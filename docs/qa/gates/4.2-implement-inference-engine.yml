    status: PASS
    notes: "O(n×m) complexity acceptable for expected inputs. No I/O operations, efficient regex matching. Excellent performance characteristics."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive edge case handling, deterministic behavior, zero external dependencies. 100% test coverage ensures correctness."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
