nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Environment variables properly excluded from git (.env in .gitignore), no hardcoded secrets in codebase, .env.example provides template without real values.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Bun package manager provides fast installation (10-20x faster than npm). CI pipeline uses parallel jobs for efficiency. TypeScript uses moduleResolution: bundler for optimal build performance.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Pre-commit hooks prevent broken code from being committed (type-check → lint → format:check sequence). CI validates all PRs before merge with parallel jobs.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear monorepo structure matching architecture specifications. Consistent tooling (Biome + Prettier). Comprehensive README documentation with quick start guide. Path aliases (@repo/shared, @/) prevent import issues.'
