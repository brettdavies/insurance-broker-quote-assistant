# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Insurance Broker Quote Assistant (IQuote Pro)**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for a modern fullstack application where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

**Context:** This is a 5-day interview project for PEAK6 demonstrating a multi-agent assistant for insurance brokers. The system supports conversational intake for new quotes and policy-based analysis for identifying savings opportunities. All knowledge operates from an offline "knowledge pack" with no runtime web scraping.

## 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a new project built from scratch. No existing starter templates or codebases are being used. The architecture is designed specifically to meet the PEAK6 project requirements for a hybrid LLM agent + rules engine system optimized for insurance broker workflows.
