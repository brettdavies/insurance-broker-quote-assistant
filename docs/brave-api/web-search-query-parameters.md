## Query Parameters

#### [#](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/#WebSearchAPIQueryParameters) Web Search API

This table lists the query parameters supported by the Web Search API. Some are required, but most are optional.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q | true | string |  | The user’s search query term. Query can not be empty. Maximum of 400 characters and 50 words in the query. |
| country | false | string | US | The search query country, where the results come from.  The country string is limited to 2 character country codes of supported countries. For a list of supported values, see [Country Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#country-codes). |
| search\_lang | false | string | en | The search language preference.  The 2 or more character language code for which the search results are provided. For a list of possible values, see [Language Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#language-codes). |
| ui\_lang | false | string | en-US | User interface language preferred in response.  Usually of the format `<language_code>-<country_code>`. For more, see [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept-language). For a list of supported values, see [UI Language Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#market-codes). |
| count | false | int | 20 | The number of search results returned in response.  The maximum is `20`. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. Combine this parameter with `offset` to paginate search results.  **NOTE**: Count only applies to `web` results. |
| offset | false | int | 0 | The zero based offset that indicates number of search results per page (count) to skip before returning the result. The maximum is `9`. The actual number delivered may be less than requested based on the query.  In order to paginate results use this parameter together with `count`. For example, if your user interface displays 20 search results per page, set `count` to `20` and offset to `0` to show the first page of results. To get subsequent pages, increment `offset` by 1 (e.g. 0, 1, 2). The results may overlap across multiple pages. |
| safesearch | false | string | moderate | Filters search results for adult content.  The following values are supported:  - `off`: No filtering is done. - `moderate`: Filters explicit content, like images and videos, but allows adult domains in the search results. - `strict`: Drops all adult content from search results. |
| freshness | false | string |  | Filters search results by when they were discovered.  The following values are supported:  - `pd`: Discovered within the last 24 hours. - `pw`: Discovered within the last 7 Days. - `pm`: Discovered within the last 31 Days. - `py`: Discovered within the last 365 Days. - `YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD`: timeframe is also supported by specifying the date range e.g. `2022-04-01to2022-07-30`. |
| text\_decorations | false | bool | true | Whether display strings (e.g. result snippets) should include decoration markers (e.g. highlighting characters). |
| spellcheck | false | bool | true | Whether to spellcheck provided query. If the spellchecker is enabled, the modified query is always used for search. The modified query can be found in `altered` key from the [query](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/responses#Query) response model. |
| result\_filter | false | string |  | A comma delimited string of result types to include in the search response.  Not specifying this parameter will return back all result types in search response where data is available and a plan with the corresponding option is subscribed. The response always includes query and type to identify any query modifications and response type respectively.  Available result filter values are:  - `discussions` - `faq` - `infobox` - `news` - `query` - `summarizer` - `videos` - `web` - `locations`  Example result filter param `result_filter=discussions`, `videos` returns only `discussions`, and videos responses. Another example where only location results are required, set the `result_filter` param to `result_filter=locations`.  **NOTE**: `count` only applies to `web` results. |
| goggles\_id | false | string |  | Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of Brave’s search index. For more details, refer to the [Goggles repository](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart). This parameter is deprecated. Please use the goggles parameter. |
| goggles | false | list\[string\] |  | Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of Brave’s search index. The parameter supports both a url where the Goggle is hosted or the definition of the goggle. For more details, refer to the [Goggles repository](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart). The parameter can be repeated to query with multiple goggles. |
| units | false | string |  | The measurement units. If not provided, units are derived from search country.  Possible values are: - `metric`: The standardized measurement system - `imperial`: The British Imperial system of units. |
| extra\_snippets | false | bool |  | A snippet is an excerpt from a page you get as a result of the query, and extra\_snippets allow you to get up to 5 additional, alternative excerpts.  Only available under `Free AI`, `Base AI`, `Pro AI`, `Base Data`, `Pro Data` and `Custom plans`. |
| summary | false | bool |  | This parameter enables summary key generation in web search results. This is required for summarizer to be enabled. |
| operators | false | bool | true | Whether to apply [search operators](https://search.brave.com/help/operators) |
