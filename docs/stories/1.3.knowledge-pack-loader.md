# Story 1.3: Knowledge Pack Loader & In-Memory Cache

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** backend system,  
**I want** to load all knowledge pack JSON files into memory at startup,  
**so that** I can quickly query carrier/state/product rules without filesystem I/O during runtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hono backend starts at `localhost:7070` with startup logging
2. On startup, asynchronously load all JSON files from `knowledge-pack/` directory into in-memory Map structures
3. Knowledge pack includes carriers (3), states (5), products (Auto/Home/Renters/Umbrella), discounts, eligibility rules, and compensation data
4. Startup completes successfully even if knowledge pack loading is still in progress (non-blocking)
5. Health check endpoint `/api/health` returns knowledge pack status (loaded/loading/error)
6. Logging includes count of loaded entities (e.g., "Loaded 3 carriers, 5 states, 12 products, 47 discounts")
7. Error handling for missing or malformed JSON files with graceful degradation
8. No runtime filesystem reads after initial load (validated via decision trace logs)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.2 completed: React frontend initialized, TanStack Router configured, Hono RPC client prepared with AppType placeholder
- Backend currently has minimal `/api/health` endpoint that needs enhancement
- No knowledge pack loading infrastructure exists yet - this is the foundation for all routing/discount/compliance logic

### Data Models
- **Carrier Schema**: Defined in `knowledge_pack/carriers/{carrier-name}.json` with structure: `name`, `operatesIn` (array of state codes), `products` (array), `eligibility` (product-specific rules), `discounts` (array with requirements and percentages), `compensation` (optional broker commission) [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#43-carrier]
- **State Schema**: Defined in `knowledge_pack/states/{state-code}.json` with minimum insurance requirements [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **cuid2-based IDs**: All entities use cuid2 IDs for citation tracking (see `docs/knowledge-pack/id-conventions.md`) [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#43-carrier]
- **Type Definitions**: Carrier and State types should be imported from `@repo/shared` schemas (Zod schemas with inferred TypeScript types) [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#41-core-data-models-overview]

### API Specifications
- **Health Endpoint**: GET `/api/health` must return `knowledgePackLoaded: boolean`, `knowledgePackStatus: 'loaded' | 'loading' | 'error'`, `carriersCount: number`, `statesCount: number`, `timestamp: string` [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#get-apihealth]
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:7070/api` [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **Response Format**: JSON with snake_case keys (auto-transformed from camelCase TypeScript types) [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Knowledge Pack RAG**: Component responsible for loading carrier/state JSON files at startup (async, non-blocking) into memory Maps, tracking cuid2 IDs for citation generation, providing exact key-based queries (carrier + state + product), returning results with file path + cuid2 ID [Source: architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag-structured-query]
- **Startup Loading Pattern**: Knowledge pack loaded during initialization ensures data is immediately available for all queries, while async loading prevents blocking container startup [Source: architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag-structured-query]
- **Structured Queries**: Known keys (carrier, state, product) make exact queries faster and more accurate than vector embeddings [Source: architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag-structured-query]
- **Citation Tracking**: cuid2-based IDs attached to every entity, enabling audit trail without line number fragility [Source: architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag-structured-query]

### File Locations
- **Knowledge Pack Directory**: `knowledge_pack/` at project root (not in apps/) [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Service Layer**: Create services in `apps/api/src/services/` directory [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Route Handlers**: Routes in `apps/api/src/index.ts` (thin layer, HTTP concerns only) [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Test Files**: Unit tests in `apps/api/src/services/__tests__/`, integration tests in `apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/` [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### Testing Requirements
- **Testing Framework**: Use Bun test (built-in, Jest-compatible API) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- **Unit Tests**: Test deterministic logic (loader, RAG queries) with 100% coverage goal [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]
- **Integration Tests**: Test API routes with Hono test utilities (no server required) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- **Test Focus**: Test successful loading, error handling, non-blocking startup, no runtime filesystem reads [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]

### Technical Constraints
- **Backend Framework**: Hono 4.0 with TypeScript 5.6 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#31-technology-stack-table]
- **File Operations**: Use Node.js `fs/promises` for async file operations [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Logging Strategy**: Two separate log streams: program log (`logs/program.log`) for API requests/debug info, compliance log (`logs/compliance.log`) for DecisionTrace objects [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
- **Log Format**: Structured JSON logging with `level`, `timestamp`, `type`, and relevant fields [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
- **No Database**: JSON files as knowledge pack (no database setup required) [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md]
- **In-Memory Cache**: Map structures loaded at startup, no runtime filesystem reads [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#31-technology-stack-table]

### Project Structure Notes
- Knowledge pack directory at root level (`knowledge_pack/`) aligns with architecture: "Data is separate from code, easy to update without touching application code" [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- Service layer pattern: Business logic in `services/`, routes are thin HTTP layer [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- Three-layer pattern: Routes (HTTP) → Services (business logic) → Data (knowledge pack RAG) [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/health.test.ts`

### Test Standards
- Use Bun test framework (Jest-compatible API: `describe`, `it`, `expect`) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- Test deterministic logic with 100% coverage goal [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]
- Use Hono test utilities for API route testing (no server required) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]

### Testing Focus Areas
- Successful loading of all knowledge pack files
- Graceful error handling for missing/malformed files

### Debug Log References
N/A - All tests passing, no debugging required

### Completion Notes
**All 10 tasks completed successfully:**

1. **Task 1:** Generated mock knowledge pack files (3 carriers, 5 states) using `scripts/generate-mock-knowledge-pack.ts`. All files follow JSON schema structure with cuid2 IDs, source metadata, and field metadata.

2. **Task 2:** Created `knowledge-pack-loader.ts` service with async file loading, concurrent loading via `Promise.all()`, and non-blocking startup support.

3. **Task 3:** Implemented in-memory `Map<string, Carrier>` and `Map<string, State>` storage with singleton pattern. Maps are read-only after initial load.

4. **Task 4:** Added structured JSON logging to console and `logs/program.log` file. Logs server startup, loading start, and completion with entity counts.

5. **Task 5:** Implemented graceful error handling for missing/malformed files. Server starts even if some files fail. Errors tracked in loading status.

6. **Task 6:** Updated `/api/health` endpoint to return `knowledgePackLoaded`, `knowledgePackStatus`, `carriersCount`, `statesCount`, and `timestamp`.

7. **Task 7:** Created `knowledge-pack-rag.ts` service with read-only query functions (`getCarrierByName`, `getStateByCode`, `getCarriersForState`, etc.). All queries use in-memory Maps only.

8. **Task 8:** Added comprehensive unit tests (8 tests) covering successful loading, error handling, non-blocking startup, and RAG service Map-only queries. All tests passing.

9. **Task 9:** Added integration tests (4 tests) for health endpoint covering status responses, loading states, and error scenarios. All tests passing.

10. **Task 10:** Updated `index.ts` to initialize knowledge pack loading on startup (non-blocking). Added startup logging. Exported `AppType` for Hono RPC client.

**Implementation Details:**
- Created TypeScript types in `packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts` for Carrier and State entities
- Path resolution handles both monorepo root and `apps/api` directory execution contexts
- All Node.js imports use `node:` protocol per Biome linting rules
- Tests use Bun test framework with Jest-compatible API
- Integration tests use Hono test utilities (no server required)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Server starts successfully at `localhost:7070`
- ✅ Knowledge pack loads: 3 carriers, 5 states, 12 products, 15 discounts
- ✅ Health endpoint returns correct status

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Solid implementation of knowledge pack loader with in-memory caching. All 8 acceptance criteria are met. The implementation demonstrates good architecture with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and excellent test coverage. However, several DRY violations and opportunities for abstraction improvement were identified. Shared package usage is correct for backend, but frontend integration opportunity exists.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Knowledge pack loader properly implemented: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:149-225](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L149-L225) async loading with non-blocking startup
- ✅ In-memory Map storage: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:33-38](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L33-L38) uses Map structures for fast lookups
- ✅ Shared types imported correctly: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:10](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L10) imports Carrier, CarrierFile, State, StateFile from `@repo/shared`
- ✅ RAG service uses Maps only: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:8-9](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L8-L9) imports from loader, no filesystem access
- ✅ Health endpoint enhanced: [apps/api/src/index.ts:37-50](apps/api/src/index.ts#L37-L50) returns knowledge pack status with counts
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:110-115](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L110-L115) and [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:135-140](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L135-L140) graceful degradation
- ✅ Structured logging: [apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts:43-50](apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts#L43-L50) JSON format with timestamps
- ✅ Excellent test coverage: 29 tests passing across 4 test files

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows [11-backend-architecture.md:11-30](docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#L11-L30) service layer architecture (routes → services → data)
- ✅ Matches [17-coding-standards.md:9-10](docs/architecture/17-coding-standards.md#L9-L10) type sharing rules (imports from `@repo/shared`)
- ✅ Implements [6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag](docs/architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag) RAG pattern (in-memory Maps, no runtime filesystem reads)
- ✅ Uses [3-tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md) specified tooling (Hono 4.0, TypeScript 5.6, Node.js fs/promises)

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Analysis

**Violations Identified:**

1. **Repeated FieldWithMetadata value extraction pattern** (8 occurrences):
   - Pattern: `carrier.operatesIn?.value || []` and `carrier.products?.value || []`
   - Locations:
     - [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:104](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L104)
     - [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:62](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L62)
     - [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:76](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L76)
     - [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:94](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L94)
     - [apps/api/src/index.ts:71-72](apps/api/src/index.ts#L71-L72)
     - [apps/api/src/index.ts:88-89](apps/api/src/index.ts#L88-L89)
   - **Recommendation:** Create helper function `getFieldValue<T>(field: FieldWithMetadata<T> | undefined, defaultValue: T): T` in `apps/api/src/utils/field-helpers.ts`

2. **Duplicated test data creation functions**:
   - `createTestCarrier` function duplicated in:
     - [apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/carriers.test.ts:12-47](apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/carriers.test.ts#L12-L47)
     - [apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/states.test.ts:53-79](apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/states.test.ts#L53-L79)
     - [apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts:36-62](apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts#L36-L62) (inline)
   - **Recommendation:** Extract to shared test fixture file `apps/api/src/__tests__/fixtures/knowledge-pack.ts`

3. **Similar error handling patterns**:
   - [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:110-115](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L110-L115) and [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:135-140](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L135-L140) have nearly identical error handling
   - **Recommendation:** Extract common error handling to helper function

**DRY Compliance Score:** 7/10 (Good, but improvements recommended)

### STAR Principles Analysis

**Single Responsibility:**
- ✅ **Loader service**: Single responsibility - loads files into Maps [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts)
- ✅ **RAG service**: Single responsibility - provides read-only query interface [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts)
- ✅ **Routes**: Thin HTTP layer, delegates to services [apps/api/src/index.ts:37-158](apps/api/src/index.ts#L37-L158)
- ✅ **Logger utility**: Single responsibility - structured logging [apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts](apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts)

**Testability:**
- ✅ **Excellent test coverage**: 29 tests across 4 files
- ✅ **Pure functions**: RAG service functions are pure (no side effects, easy to test)
- ✅ **Test isolation**: Each test creates its own knowledge pack directory
- ✅ **Hono test utilities**: Integration tests use Hono test utilities (no server required)

**Abstraction:**
- ⚠️ **FieldWithMetadata access**: Low-level `.value || []` pattern repeated (should be abstracted)
- ✅ **Service layer abstraction**: Routes abstracted from business logic
- ✅ **Map abstraction**: In-memory storage abstracted behind service functions

**Reusability:**
- ⚠️ **Test fixtures**: Test data creation functions duplicated (should be reusable)
- ✅ **Service functions**: Well-designed for reuse (getCarrier, getState, etc.)
- ✅ **Logger utility**: Reusable across entire backend

**STAR Compliance Score:** 8/10 (Very good, minor abstraction improvements recommended)

### Shared Package Usage Analysis

**Backend Usage:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Types correctly imported from `@repo/shared`: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:10](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L10)
- Types correctly imported in RAG service: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:8](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L8)
- Shared types exported: [packages/shared/src/index.ts:5-18](packages/shared/src/index.ts#L5-L18)

**Frontend Usage:** ⚠️ **Opportunity Identified**
- Frontend does not currently import Carrier/State types from `@repo/shared`
- **Analysis**: For Story 1.3, frontend doesn't need these types yet (no API integration). However, when Story 1.4 integrates API calls, frontend should use shared types for:
  - API response types (Carrier, State)
  - Type-safe API client (Hono RPC will infer types automatically)
- **Recommendation**: Frontend should import types from `@repo/shared` in Story 1.4 when API integration is implemented

**Shared Package Compliance:** ✅ **Correct for current story scope**

- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:211-218](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L211-L218) logging with counts

**AC7: Error handling for missing or malformed JSON files with graceful degradation**
- **Given** missing or malformed JSON files exist
- **When** loader encounters errors
- **Then** errors are logged, valid files are loaded, server continues
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:110-115](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L110-L115) error handling in loadCarrierFile, [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:135-140](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L135-L140) error handling in loadStateFile, [apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts:180-359](apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts#L180-L359) error handling tests

**AC8: No runtime filesystem reads after initial load (validated via decision trace logs)**
- **Given** knowledge pack is loaded
- **When** RAG service queries are made
- **Then** queries use in-memory Maps only, no filesystem access
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:8-9](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L8-L9) imports from loader (Maps only), [apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts:412-493](apps/api/src/services/__tests__/knowledge-pack-loader.test.ts#L412-L493) test deletes files and verifies Maps still work

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified all acceptance criteria are met with linked evidence
- [x] Validated architecture compliance against coding standards
- [x] Confirmed shared package usage (backend correctly imports types)
- [x] Identified DRY violations (FieldWithMetadata access pattern, test fixtures)
- [x] Assessed STAR principles (Single Responsibility, Testability, Abstraction, Reusability)
- [ ] Extract FieldWithMetadata value access to helper function (DRY improvement)
- [ ] Extract test data creation functions to shared fixtures (DRY improvement)
- [ ] Consider frontend type imports in Story 1.4 when API integration is implemented

### DRY Improvements Recommended

**Priority 1: FieldWithMetadata Helper Function**
- **File to create**: `apps/api/src/utils/field-helpers.ts`
- **Function**: `getFieldValue<T>(field: FieldWithMetadata<T> | undefined, defaultValue: T): T`
- **Impact**: Eliminates 8+ instances of `.value || []` pattern
- **Example usage**: `getFieldValue(carrier.operatesIn, [])` instead of `carrier.operatesIn?.value || []`

**Priority 2: Shared Test Fixtures**
- **File to create**: `apps/api/src/__tests__/fixtures/knowledge-pack.ts`
- **Functions**: `createTestCarrier()`, `createTestState()`
- **Impact**: Eliminates duplication across 3+ test files
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for test data structure

**Priority 3: Error Handling Abstraction**
- **Extract**: Common error handling pattern from `loadCarrierFile` and `loadStateFile`
- **Impact**: Reduces code duplication, improves maintainability

### STAR Principles Assessment

**Single Responsibility:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Each service has clear, single responsibility
- Routes are thin HTTP layer
- Logger utility focused on logging only

**Testability:** ✅ **Excellent**
- 29 tests with comprehensive coverage
- Pure functions in RAG service
- Test isolation with separate directories
- Hono test utilities for integration tests

**Abstraction:** ⚠️ **Good, but could improve**
- FieldWithMetadata access should be abstracted
- Service layer abstraction is good
- Map storage abstraction is appropriate

**Reusability:** ⚠️ **Good, but could improve**
- Test fixtures should be reusable
- Service functions are well-designed for reuse
- Logger utility is reusable

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS

- ✅ File path validation: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:175-176](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L175-L176) uses `join()` to prevent path traversal
- ✅ JSON parsing error handling: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:110-115](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L110-L115) catches JSON parse errors
- ✅ Input validation: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:96-98](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L96-L98) validates required fields before storing
- ✅ No runtime filesystem access: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts:8-9](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-rag.ts#L8-L9) RAG service uses Maps only

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS

- ✅ Concurrent file loading: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:192-197](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L192-L197) uses `Promise.all()` for parallel loading
- ✅ In-memory Maps: [apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts:33-38](apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts#L33-L38) O(1) lookup performance
- ✅ Non-blocking startup: [apps/api/src/index.ts:23-25](apps/api/src/index.ts#L23-L25) server starts immediately, loading continues in background
- ✅ No runtime filesystem I/O: All queries use in-memory Maps

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review. DRY improvements recommended but not blocking.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** PASS → [docs/qa/gates/1.3-knowledge-pack-loader.yml](docs/qa/gates/1.3-knowledge-pack-loader.yml)

**Quality Score:** 92/100

All 8 acceptance criteria fully met with proper architecture compliance. Excellent test coverage (29 tests passing). DRY violations identified but not blocking - improvements recommended for maintainability. Shared package usage is correct for backend. Frontend type imports can be added in Story 1.4 when API integration is implemented.

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done** (with recommended improvements for future stories)

**Next Steps:**
1. Story can be marked as "Done" - all acceptance criteria validated
2. Consider implementing DRY improvements (FieldWithMetadata helper, test fixtures) in future refactoring
3. Story 1.4 should import Carrier/State types from `@repo/shared` when implementing API integration
4. Frontend API client will automatically benefit from shared types via Hono RPC type inference
