# Story 1.6: Routing Rules Engine (Carrier/State/Product Eligibility)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** backend system,  
**I want** a deterministic rules engine that routes shoppers to eligible carriers based on extracted data,  
**so that** I can guarantee accurate routing without LLM hallucinations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Routing logic queries in-memory knowledge pack for carrier availability by state and product
2. Evaluates eligibility rules (e.g., credit score minimums, property type restrictions, driving record requirements)
3. Returns list of eligible carriers ranked by match quality with explanations
4. If no carriers match, returns clear explanation of why (e.g., "No carriers available for Renters insurance in Wyoming")
5. Routing decision includes confidence score and rationale based on data completeness
6. Decision trace logs all rules evaluated and match results with citations to knowledge pack
7. Unit tests cover all 3 carriers across 5 states for Auto/Home/Renters/Umbrella products
8. Routing accuracy ≥90% validated against synthetic test cases
9. No LLM calls during routing (100% deterministic logic)

    - [ ] Bonus points for carriers with compensation data (broker preference)
  - [ ] Sort carriers by match score (descending)
  - [ ] Select primary carrier as highest-scoring eligible carrier
  - [ ] Calculate overall confidence score: average of top 3 carriers' match scores, weighted by data completeness
  - [ ] Generate rationale: explain why primary carrier selected, list alternatives, note any missing data affecting confidence

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Citation Tracking** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Extract citations from knowledge pack carrier data: use `carrier._id` (cuid2), `carrier._sources[0].file` for file path

  - [ ] Detect when no carriers pass eligibility criteria
  - [ ] Return RouteDecision with:
    - [ ] `primaryCarrier`: null or empty string
    - [ ] `eligibleCarriers`: empty array
    - [ ] `confidence`: 0.0
    - [ ] `rationale`: Clear explanation (e.g., "No carriers available for Renters insurance in Wyoming" or "No carriers meet age requirements for this profile")
  - [ ] Include in rationale: which filters eliminated carriers (state, product, eligibility criteria)
  - [ ] Log to decision trace with explanation of why routing failed

- [x] **Task 9: Add Unit Tests** (AC: 7, 8, 9)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.5 completed: Conversational Extractor extracts UserProfile with `state` and `productLine` fields required for routing, hybrid extraction approach implemented, Gemini integration complete, decision trace logging exists
- Story 1.3 completed: Knowledge pack loader exists (`apps/api/src/services/knowledge-pack-loader.ts`), provides `getAllCarriers()`, `getCarrier(name)`, `getState(code)` functions, knowledge pack loaded at startup into in-memory Maps
- **Knowledge pack structure**: Carriers stored in `knowledge_pack/carriers/*.json` files, loaded into `carriersMap` keyed by carrier name, each carrier has `operatesIn`, `products`, `eligibility` fields with `FieldWithMetadata<T>` wrapper [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **Field access pattern**: Knowledge pack fields wrapped in `FieldWithMetadata<T>` - access actual value via `.value` property (e.g., `carrier.operatesIn.value` returns `string[]`) [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **Citation tracking**: Carriers have `_id` (cuid2) and `_sources` array with file paths for citation tracking [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **Intake endpoint**: POST `/api/intake` currently returns IntakeResult with `route` field as stub, needs to be populated with actual routing decision [Source: apps/api/src/routes/intake.ts]

### Required Dependencies
- **Existing**: `zod` ^3.23 (already installed), knowledge-pack-loader service (already exists)
- **No new packages required**: Routing engine uses existing knowledge pack loader and Zod for validation

### Data Models
- **UserProfile**: Schema defined in `packages/shared/src/schemas/user-profile.ts` with fields: `state` (required for routing), `productLine` (`'auto' | 'home' | 'renters' | 'umbrella'`), `age` (optional, used for eligibility), `vehicles` (optional, used for auto eligibility), other fields optional [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#42-userprofile]
- **Carrier**: Type defined in `packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts` with fields: `_id` (cuid2), `name` (string), `operatesIn` (FieldWithMetadata<string[]>), `products` (FieldWithMetadata<string[]>), `eligibility` (object with product-specific eligibility rules), `discounts` (array), `compensation` (optional) [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **ProductEligibility**: Type defined in `packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts` with fields: `minAge` (FieldWithMetadata<number>), `maxAge` (FieldWithMetadata<number>), `maxVehicles` (FieldWithMetadata<number>), `stateSpecific` (Record<string, unknown>) [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **RouteDecision**: Currently stub schema in `packages/shared/src/schemas/intake-result.ts`, needs full implementation with `primaryCarrier`, `eligibleCarriers`, `matchScores`, `confidence`, `rationale`, `citations` [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#45-intakeresult]
- **Citation**: Format includes `id` (cuid2), `type` (string), `carrier` (cuid2), `file` (string) [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]

### API Specifications
- **Intake Endpoint**: POST `/api/intake` returns `IntakeResult` with `route` field containing RouteDecision [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#post-apiintake]
- **Request/Response Format**: JSON with snake_case keys (auto-transformed from camelCase TypeScript types) [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **Error Handling**: Standard error response format with `error.code`, `error.message`, `error.details` [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#54-error-handling]
- **Error Codes**: `ROUTING_FAILED` (400) for routing failures (no eligible carriers) [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#54-error-handling]

### Component Specifications
- **Routing Engine (Deterministic)**: 100% deterministic rules engine that routes shoppers to eligible carriers based on state, product, and user profile using knowledge pack rules. No LLM calls - pure functions with predictable outputs. Returns sorted list with primary recommendation + alternatives. Every routing decision references knowledge pack file + cuid2 ID for audit trail [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Knowledge Pack RAG**: Provides fast, citation-tracked access to offline insurance knowledge loaded at startup. Structured queries (not semantic search) - exact key-based queries using carrier + state + product. Returns results with file path + cuid2 ID for every data point [Source: architecture/6-components.md#66-knowledge-pack-rag-structured-query]
- **Why deterministic matters**: Insurance regulators require explainable routing (no black-box AI). Pure functions are testable, auditable logic with predictable outputs [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Citation tracking**: Every routing decision references knowledge pack file + cuid2 ID for audit trail. Citation format: `{ id: cuid2, type: "carrier", carrier: cuid2, file: "knowledge_pack/carriers/geico.json" }` [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]

### File Locations
- **Service files**: `apps/api/src/services/` directory [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Route files**: `apps/api/src/routes/` directory [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Utility files**: `apps/api/src/utils/` directory [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Shared schemas**: `packages/shared/src/schemas/` directory [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#41-core-data-models-overview]

### Testing Requirements
- **Testing Framework**: Use Bun test (built-in, Jest-compatible API) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- **Unit Tests**: Test routing logic, eligibility evaluation, carrier ranking, confidence calculation, citation tracking, no eligible carriers scenario [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]
- **Integration Tests**: Test POST `/api/intake` endpoint includes RouteDecision in response, routing integration flow [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- **Test Focus Areas**: Deterministic engines (routing logic) - 100% coverage goal [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests cover all 3 carriers × 5 states × 4 products = 60 combinations, routing accuracy ≥90% validated [Source: epic requirements]

### Technical Constraints
- **Backend Framework**: Hono 4.0 with TypeScript 5.6 [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#31-technology-stack-table]
- **100% deterministic**: No LLM calls during routing - pure functions only [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Validation**: Zod ^3.23 for runtime type validation [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#31-technology-stack-table]
- **Knowledge pack access**: Use `getAllCarriers()`, `getCarrier(name)`, `getState(code)` from knowledge-pack-loader service, never direct file access [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- **Field access pattern**: Knowledge pack fields wrapped in `FieldWithMetadata<T>` - always access `.value` property (e.g., `carrier.operatesIn.value`) [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **Error handling**: All API routes must use the global error handler middleware, never catch errors and return 200 with error in body [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- **Decision trace logging**: Log routing decision to compliance log (`logs/compliance.log`) with complete audit trail [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#112-middleware-stack]

### Project Structure Notes
- **Service layer architecture**: Routes (thin layer) → Services (business logic) → Data layer (knowledge pack RAG) [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Three-layer pattern**: Routes layer (HTTP concerns), Service layer (business logic), Data layer (knowledge pack RAG, in-memory Maps) [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#111-service-layer-architecture]
- **Middleware stack**: Error handler (global) → Logger middleware → Zod validator → Route handler [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#112-middleware-stack]
- **Dual logging pattern**: Program log (`logs/program.log`) for API requests, errors; Compliance log (`logs/compliance.log`) for DecisionTrace objects only [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#112-middleware-stack]

### Critical Implementation Notes
- **Deterministic routing**: Routing engine must be 100% deterministic - no LLM calls, no randomness, pure functions only. This is a regulatory requirement for insurance routing decisions [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Knowledge pack field access**: Always access `.value` property when reading knowledge pack fields (e.g., `carrier.operatesIn.value` returns `string[]`, not `FieldWithMetadata<string[]>`). The `FieldWithMetadata<T>` wrapper provides citation tracking but actual values are in `.value` [Source: packages/shared/src/schemas/knowledge-pack.ts]
- **Eligibility evaluation**: Check eligibility criteria per product type. If `carrier.eligibility.auto.minAge` exists, verify `profile.age >= minAge.value`. Handle missing profile fields gracefully - if age not provided but minAge required, mark as ineligible with explanation [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Carrier ranking**: Rank carriers by match quality (data completeness, eligibility match strength). Select primary carrier as highest-scoring eligible carrier. Calculate confidence score based on data completeness [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **Citation tracking**: Extract citations from knowledge pack carrier data using `carrier._id` (cuid2) and `carrier._sources[0].file` for file path. Include citations in RouteDecision response and log to decision trace [Source: architecture/6-components.md#63-routing-engine-deterministic]
- **No eligible carriers**: If no carriers match, return RouteDecision with empty eligibleCarriers, confidence 0.0, and clear explanation of why routing failed (state/product combination not supported, eligibility criteria not met, etc.) [Source: epic requirements]
- **Decision trace logging**: Update DecisionTrace schema to include full routing decision structure (not stub). Log routing decision to compliance log with all rules evaluated and match results [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#112-middleware-stack]
- **Test coverage**: Unit tests must cover all 3 carriers × 5 states × 4 products = 60 combinations. Use test fixtures (mock knowledge pack data) instead of loading actual JSON files for faster, more reliable tests [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `apps/api/src/services/__tests__/routing-engine.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/intake-routing.test.ts` or update existing `intake.test.ts`

### Test Standards
- Use Bun test framework (Jest-compatible API: `describe`, `it`, `expect`) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- Use Hono test utilities for API route testing (no server required) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- Mock knowledge pack data: create test fixtures instead of loading actual JSON files [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#163-testing-focus-areas]

### Testing Focus Areas
- State filtering: Verify carriers operating in specific states are correctly identified
- Product filtering: Verify carriers offering specific products are correctly identified
- Eligibility evaluation: Age limits, vehicle limits, missing field handling

- Confidence calculation: Verify score reflects data completeness
- No eligible carriers: Verify clear explanation returned when routing fails
- Citation tracking: Verify citations included in response
- Comprehensive coverage: All 3 carriers × 5 states × 4 products = 60 test cases
- Routing accuracy: ≥90% of test cases must pass (at least 54/60)
