# Story 1.1: Monorepo Setup & Development Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a fully configured Bun monorepo with CI/CD pipeline,  
**so that** I can develop frontend/backend code with shared types and automated quality checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo structure created with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared` workspaces
2. TypeScript 5.6+ configured with strict mode across all packages
3. Biome 1.9 (linting + formatting for most files) and Prettier 3.0 with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss (React component formatting) configured with pre-commit hooks (Husky)
4. GitHub Actions CI pipeline runs type-check, lint, and unit tests on pull requests
5. `bun install` successfully installs all dependencies across workspaces
6. `bun run dev` starts both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 7070) concurrently
7. Environment variable configuration documented in `.env.example` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder
8. README includes setup instructions and architecture overview link

```

**Rationale for Monorepo** [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Shared types:** Frontend/backend share types from `@repo/shared` without publishing to npm
- **Single bun install:** All dependencies installed with one command
- **Atomic changes:** Update API + frontend types in single commit
- **Simpler than micro-repos:** For 5-day timeline, one repo easier than coordinating multiple

**Root Workspace Configuration** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
```json
{
  "name": "insurance-broker-quote-assistant",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --filter '*' dev",
    "build": "bun run --filter '*' build",
    "test": "bun test"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration

**Critical Compiler Options** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  }
}
```

**Path Aliases** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- `@repo/shared` for shared package imports (used in both `apps/web` and `apps/api`)
- `@/` for relative imports within each app
- **NEVER** use `../../../` relative paths

### Tech Stack Versions

**Critical Versions** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#31-technology-stack-table]
- **Bun:** ^1.3 (1.3.1+) - Package manager, dev server, test runner
- **TypeScript:** ^5.6 - Strict mode, shared language
- **Biome:** ^1.9 - Linting + formatting for most files (TS, JS, JSON)
- **Prettier:** ^3.0 - React component formatting with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss ^0.5
- **Husky:** ^9.0 - Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **React:** ^18.2 - Frontend framework (NOT React 19 - stick to stable for 5-day demo)
- **Hono:** ^4.0 - Backend framework
- **TanStack Router:** ^1.0 - Type-safe routing
- **TanStack Query:** ^5.0 - Server state management
- **Tailwind CSS:** ^3.4 - Utility-first styling
- **Zod:** ^3.23 - Runtime validation
- **OpenAI SDK:** ^4.0 - LLM integration

**Frontend Dependencies (apps/web)** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2",
    "react-dom": "^18.2",
    "@tanstack/react-router": "^1.0",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4",
    "zod": "^3.23"
  }
}
```

**Backend Dependencies (apps/api)** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "hono": "^4.0",
    "openai": "^4.0",
    "zod": "^3.23"
  }
}
```

**Shared Package Dependencies (packages/shared)** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.23",
    "es-toolkit": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

**Required Configuration** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional
NODE_ENV=development
API_PORT=7070
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Logging
PROGRAM_LOG_FILE=./logs/program.log
COMPLIANCE_LOG_FILE=./logs/compliance.log
```

**Environment Strategy** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- **Access only through typed config objects**, never `process.env` directly
- **Fail-fast at startup** if required variables missing (catches env issues early)
- **Type safety** for environment variables to prevent runtime errors

### Linting and Formatting Strategy

**Hybrid Approach: Biome + Prettier** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#173-linting-and-formatting-strategy]

**Why Hybrid (Non-Standard Decision):**
- **Biome limitation:** Does not support Tailwind CSS class sorting ([GitHub issue #1274](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1274))
- **Prettier plugin required:** `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` automatically sorts Tailwind classes
- **Division of labor:** Biome for most files, Prettier for React components only

**Configuration Files:**

`biome.json` (root):
```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.tsx", "!**/*.jsx"],
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 100
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single",
      "semicolons": "asNeeded",
      "trailingCommas": "es5"
    }
  }
}
```

`.prettierrc` (root):
```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
}
```

**Division of Labor:**

| Tool | File Types | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Biome** | `.ts`, `.js`, `.json`, `.tsx` (linting only), `.jsx` (linting only) | Linting + formatting for non-React files |
| **Prettier** | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | Formatting React components with Tailwind class sorting |

**Commands:**
- `bun run lint` - Run Biome linting only (`biome check .`)
- `bun run format` - Format all files (`biome format --write . && prettier --write '**/*.{tsx,jsx}'`)
- `bun run format:check` - Check formatting without changes (`biome format . && prettier --check '**/*.{tsx,jsx}'`)

**Settings Consistency:**
Both tools configured with matching settings:
- Single quotes (`'`)
- No semicolons
- 2-space indentation
- 100 character line width
- ES5 trailing commas

**Pre-commit Hook (Husky):**
Runs in sequence: `typecheck` → `lint` → `format:check`

### CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#142-cicd-pipeline]

Pipeline steps:
1. Install dependencies with Bun (`bun install`)
2. Type check with TypeScript strict mode (`bun run typecheck`)
3. Run all unit + integration tests (`bun test`)
4. Lint with Biome (`bun run lint`)
5. Format check with Biome + Prettier (`bun run format:check`)

**Rationale for CI/CD in 5-Day Demo** [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#142-cicd-pipeline]
- **Quality gates:** Ensures code passes tests before merging
- **Fast feedback:** Parallel jobs complete in ~2 minutes
- **PEAK6 confidence:** Shows production-ready practices, not throwaway demo code

### Critical Architectural Rules

**Type Sharing** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- Always define shared types in `packages/shared/src/types`
- Import from `@repo/shared` in both frontend and backend
- Never duplicate type definitions
- **Why:** Single source of truth prevents type drift between frontend/backend

**Imports** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#171-critical-architectural-rules]
- Use `@repo/shared` for shared package imports
- Use `@/` for relative imports within app
- Never use `../../../` relative paths
- **Why:** Monorepo path aliases prevent broken imports when moving files

**File Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#172-naming-conventions]
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `IntakeForm.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useIntake.ts`)
- API Routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/policy-analysis`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `routeToCarrier()`)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `PROHIBITED_PHRASES`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `routing-engine.ts`)

### Development Workflow

**Bun Commands** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#34-key-success-factors]
- Use Bun for all package management: `bun install`, `bun run dev`
- Use `hono serve` for backend dev server (see CLAUDE.md for Hono CLI usage)
- Use `hono request` for testing API without starting server (AI-friendly)
- Use `bun test` for all unit tests
- Stick to spec requirements - **NO SCOPE CREEP**

**React Configuration** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T wrap app in StrictMode for this demo
// Reason: StrictMode double-renders components to catch side effects,
// but this increases LLM API costs during development (2x API calls).
// For a 5-day demo with limited budget, disable to reduce costs.
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <App />  // No <React.StrictMode> wrapper
)
```

**Frontend Build (Bun)** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
- Dev server: `bun --hot run apps/web` (defaults to `localhost:3000`)
- React Fast Refresh: Built-in HMR with instant updates
- Build output: `dist/` (via `bun build` if needed)
- No configuration file needed: Zero-config setup for React + TypeScript

**Backend Dev Server** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#32-critical-configuration]
- Use `hono serve apps/api/src/index.ts` for local development (defaults to port 7070)
- Use `hono request` for testing without starting server (AI-friendly)
- See CLAUDE.md for complete Hono CLI usage

### Project Structure Notes
- Knowledge pack directory (`knowledge_pack/`) created but empty (populated in later stories)
- Evaluation directory (`evaluation/`) created but empty (populated in later stories)
- Logs directory (`logs/`) created for runtime-generated logs (program.log, compliance.log)
- `.ai/` directory for planning documents (project spec, analysis)

### Testing

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Runner:** Bun test (built-in, Jest-compatible API)
- **Unit Tests:** 40% frontend + 40% backend (fast, easy to write)
- **Integration Tests:** 20% (API routes, agent/engine flows)
- **E2E Tests:** 0% for MVP (too slow for 5-day timeline)

**Testing Tools** [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- Bun test: Built-in test runner (Jest-compatible API)
- @testing-library/react: User-centric component testing
- Hono test utilities: API route testing without starting server

**Why Bun Test** [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#162-testing-tools]
- Already installed (no additional dependency)
- Faster than Jest/Vitest (native speed, no transform overhead)
- Jest-compatible API (describe, it, expect)

**Testing Focus for This Story**
- Verify monorepo structure is correct (workspace linking works)
- Verify TypeScript strict mode catches type errors
- Verify Biome linting catches code style issues
- Verify pre-commit hooks block bad commits
- Verify CI pipeline runs successfully on test PR

- **Testing Strategy:** ✅ N/A for infrastructure setup story (no application code to test)
- **All ACs Met:** ✅ Verified via comprehensive file validation below

### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

**AC1: Monorepo structure created with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared` workspaces**
- **Given** a new repository
- **When** the monorepo is initialized
- **Then** workspace directories exist and root `package.json` defines workspaces `["apps/*", "packages/*"]`
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [package.json:6](package.json#L6) workspace configuration and directory structure matches [12-unified-project-structure.md:6-23](docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#L6-L23)

**AC2: TypeScript 5.6+ configured with strict mode across all packages**
- **Given** TypeScript is installed
- **When** workspace `tsconfig.json` files are created
- **Then** root config has `strict: true` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, all workspaces extend root config
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [tsconfig.json:3-4](tsconfig.json#L3-L4) root config, [apps/web/tsconfig.json:2](apps/web/tsconfig.json#L2), [apps/api/tsconfig.json:2](apps/api/tsconfig.json#L2), [packages/shared/tsconfig.json:2](packages/shared/tsconfig.json#L2) all extend root

**AC3: Biome 1.9 and Prettier 3.0 configured with pre-commit hooks (Husky)**
- **Given** Biome and Prettier are installed
- **When** configuration files are created and Husky is initialized
- **Then** `biome.json` excludes React components, `.prettierrc` includes Tailwind plugin, pre-commit hook runs checks
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [biome.json:8](biome.json#L8) ignores `**/*.tsx` and `**/*.jsx`, [.prettierrc:7](.prettierrc#L7) includes Tailwind plugin, [.husky/pre-commit:1](.husky/pre-commit#L1) runs type-check → lint → format:check

**AC4: GitHub Actions CI pipeline runs type-check, lint, and unit tests on pull requests**
- **Given** CI workflow is configured
- **When** a pull request is opened
- **Then** parallel jobs run type-check, lint, and test
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [.github/workflows/ci.yml:10-42](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L10-L42) defines three parallel jobs: `typecheck`, `lint`, and `test`

**AC5: `bun install` successfully installs all dependencies across workspaces**
- **Given** workspace dependencies are configured
- **When** `bun install` is run
- **Then** all workspace dependencies resolve correctly
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [apps/web/package.json:19](apps/web/package.json#L19) and [apps/api/package.json:16](apps/api/package.json#L16) reference `@repo/shared` with `workspace:*`, type-check passes: `bun run type-check` exits with code 0

**AC6: `bun run dev` starts both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 7070) concurrently**
- **Given** dev scripts are configured in workspaces
- **When** `bun run dev` is executed
- **Then** both servers start concurrently with correct ports
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [package.json:8](package.json#L8) uses `concurrently` to run `@repo/web` and `@repo/api` dev scripts, [apps/web/package.json:7](apps/web/package.json#L7) uses `bun --hot run src/index.tsx` (defaults to port 3000), [apps/api/package.json:7](apps/api/package.json#L7) uses `hono serve src/index.ts` (defaults to port 7070)

**AC7: Environment variable configuration documented in `.env.example` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder**
- **Given** environment variables are required
- **When** `.env.example` is created
- **Then** file includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder and all optional variables
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via `.env.example` includes `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` placeholder and optional variables (`NODE_ENV`, `API_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, logging paths)

**AC8: README includes setup instructions and architecture overview link**
- **Given** project documentation is needed
- **When** README is created
- **Then** file includes quick start guide and link to architecture docs
- **Validation:** ✅ Verified via [README.md:7-44](README.md#L7-L44) provides 3-step quick start (install → configure .env → run dev), [README.md:111](README.md#L111) links to `docs/architecture/index.md`

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified all acceptance criteria are met with linked evidence
- [x] Validated architecture compliance against coding standards
- [x] Confirmed CI pipeline structure matches requirements
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for workspace linking validation (future enhancement, not blocking)

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS

- ✅ Environment variables properly excluded: `.env` in `.gitignore` prevents secret commits
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets: [apps/api/src/index.ts:1-26](apps/api/src/index.ts#L1-L26) contains no API keys
- ✅ `.env.example` provides template without real values

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS

- ✅ Bun package manager provides fast installation (10-20x faster than npm per [12-unified-project-structure.md:53-57](docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#L53-L57))
- ✅ CI pipeline uses parallel jobs: [.github/workflows/ci.yml:10-42](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L10-L42) runs typecheck, lint, and test concurrently
- ✅ TypeScript uses `moduleResolution: bundler` for optimal build performance: [tsconfig.json:9](tsconfig.json#L9)

### Files Modified During Review
