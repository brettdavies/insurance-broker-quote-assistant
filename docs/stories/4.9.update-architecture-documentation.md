# Story 4.9: Update Architecture Documentation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer onboarding to the IQuote Pro codebase,

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Documentation Context

This story updates documentation to reflect the **known vs inferred pills architecture** implemented in Stories 4.1-4.8. The system now distinguishes between:

- **Known Fields:** Explicitly extracted from user input (deterministic patterns or high-confidence LLM extraction)
- **Inferred Fields:** Derived from known fields or text patterns via InferenceEngine (lower confidence, broker can dismiss)

**Key Architecture Changes from Previous Stories:**

1. **Story 4.1:** Created inference config files
   - `packages/shared/src/config/text-pattern-inferences.ts`
   - Extended `unified-field-metadata.ts` with `infers` property

2. **Story 4.2:** Implemented InferenceEngine
   - `packages/shared/src/services/inference-engine.ts`
   - Deterministic inference rules (field-to-field + text patterns)
   - Respects suppression list

3. **Story 4.3:** Added InferredFieldsSection UI component
   - `apps/web/src/components/notes/InferredFieldsSection.tsx`
   - Displays inferred fields below lexical textbox
   - Grouped by category, muted styling, dismissible

4. **Story 4.4:** Modified Field Modal with 3-button behavior
   - Updated `apps/web/src/components/modals/FieldModal.tsx`
   - 3 buttons for inferred fields: [Delete] [Save Inferred] [Save Known]
   - Shows reasoning and confidence

5. **Story 4.5:** Implemented pill injection on "Save Known"
   - Lexical editor manipulation to inject pills
   - Converts inferred → known with visual feedback

6. **Story 4.6:** Updated sidebar to show known vs inferred styling
   - `apps/web/src/components/sidebar/CapturedFields.tsx`
   - Inferred fields are muted with [✕] button

7. **Story 4.7:** Implemented suppression list management
   - `apps/web/src/lib/suppression-manager.ts`
   - Session-scoped suppression (cleared on /reset)

8. **Story 4.8:** Updated LLM prompts to respect known/inferred
   - Modified system and user prompts
   - LLM never modifies known fields, can modify inferred fields
   - Respects suppression list

**Source Documents to Reference:**

- [docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md](docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md) - Complete architecture specification
- [docs/architecture/6-components.md#61](docs/architecture/6-components.md#61) - Conversational Extractor section (needs update)
- [docs/architecture/8-core-workflows.md#81](docs/architecture/8-core-workflows.md#81) - Intake Flow section (needs update)

### Files to Update

**Primary Documentation Files:**
- `docs/architecture/6-components.md` - Update Section 6.1 (Conversational Extractor)
- `docs/architecture/8-core-workflows.md` - Update Section 8.1 (Intake Flow) with inference step
- `docs/architecture/index.md` - Update if new sections added (optional)

**Key Points to Add to Section 6.1 (Conversational Extractor):**

Per [field-extraction-bulletproofing.md Section 10.1](docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md#101-sections-requiring-updates):

- "Extraction distinguishes between known fields (explicit) and inferred fields (derived)"
- "InferenceEngine applies deterministic inference rules before LLM extraction"
- "Broker has transparent control over inferences (dismiss or convert to known)"
- "LLM respects known fields (read-only) but can modify inferred fields"

**Key Points to Add to Section 8.1 (Intake Flow):**

Per [field-extraction-bulletproofing.md Section 10.1](docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md#101-sections-requiring-updates):

- "After deterministic extraction, InferenceEngine applies rules to derive additional fields"
- "Inferred fields shown separately in UI, broker can dismiss or convert to known"
- "Converting inferred → known injects pill into lexical textbox"

### Diagram Updates

**Sequence Diagram Changes for Section 8.1:**

The current Mermaid sequence diagram in Section 8.1 shows:
```
User → Frontend → API → Extractor → Routing → Discount → Pitch → Compliance
```

**Update to include InferenceEngine:**
```
User → Frontend → API → Extractor → InferenceEngine → Routing → Discount → Pitch → Compliance
                                    ↑
                                    │
                                    └─ (shows separation of known vs inferred)
```

**New components to add to diagram:**
- InferenceEngine box (between Extractor and Routing)
- Show InferenceEngine queries KnowledgePack for inference rules
- Show return value: `{ known, inferred, suppressedFields, inferenceReasons, confidence }`

**Optional: Add new architecture diagram showing inference flow:**
- Deterministic Extraction (pills) → Known Fields
- InferenceEngine (rules) → Inferred Fields
- UI displays both (separate styling)
- Broker actions: Dismiss ([✕]) or Convert ([Save Known])
- Suppression list prevents re-inference

### Code Reference Updates

**New Files to Reference:**

From [field-extraction-bulletproofing.md Section 7](docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md#7-implementation-details-by-component):

**Shared Package:**

**Frontend:**
- `apps/web/src/components/notes/InferredFieldsSection.tsx` - Inferred fields UI
- `apps/web/src/lib/suppression-manager.ts` - Suppression list management
- `apps/web/src/components/modals/InferredFieldModal.tsx` - 3-button modal (or merged into FieldModal)
- `apps/web/src/components/sidebar/CapturedFields.tsx` - Updated with known/inferred styling

**Updated Type Definitions:**

Reference the new `IntakeResult.extraction` structure from [field-extraction-bulletproofing.md Section 5.1](docs/architecture/field-extraction-bulletproofing.md#51-api-requestresponse-changes):

```typescript
extraction: {
  method: "hybrid",
  known: Partial<UserProfile>,      // NEW: Explicitly extracted fields
  inferred: Partial<UserProfile>,   // NEW: Derived fields (dismissible)
  suppressedFields: string[],       // NEW: User-dismissed fields
  inferenceReasons: Record<string, string>,  // NEW: Why field was inferred
  confidence: Record<string, number>         // NEW: Confidence scores
}
```

### Testing

**Documentation Quality Checks:**

1. **Link Validation:**
   - All internal links work (section references, file paths)
   - No broken cross-references

2. **Code Reference Accuracy:**
   - File paths point to existing files
   - Line numbers are accurate (or use section references instead)
   - Code snippets match actual implementation

3. **Technical Accuracy:**
   - Descriptions match implemented behavior
   - Sequence diagrams reflect actual API flow
   - Terminology is consistent (known vs inferred, not "confirmed vs suggested")

4. **Completeness:**
   - All changes from Stories 4.1-4.8 are documented
   - No orphaned references to old architecture (pre-inference)
   - New components/files are referenced where appropriate

**Testing Approach:**

- Read updated documentation as if new to project
- Cross-reference with actual code to verify accuracy
- Test all internal links manually or with link checker tool
- Get peer review from another developer (recommended)

### Coding Standards Reference

[Source: docs/architecture/17-coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/17-coding-standards.md)

**Documentation Standards:**
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Keep section headers consistent with existing architecture docs
- Use Mermaid for sequence diagrams and architecture diagrams
- Include source references for technical details: `[Source: file.md#section]`
- Verify code references point to actual files (no broken links)

**File Naming:**
- Documentation files use kebab-case: `field-extraction-bulletproofing.md`
- Section headers use Title Case: `## 6.1 Conversational Extractor Agent`
