Key Takeaways: Compare Renters Insurance Quotes & Companies

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

**Renters insurance rates vary by hundreds of dollars annually between companies for identical coverage.** Comparing quotes from three to five insurers reveals which companies offer the best combination of price, coverage and customer service.

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

**Coverage limits, deductibles and property characteristics determine renters insurance costs.** Higher coverage limits and lower deductibles increase premiums, while bundling with auto insurance saves 10% to 25%.

## Compare Renters Insurance Quotes by Ratings and Affordability

Renters insurance companies have different strengths across affordability, customer service and coverage options. We analyzed major insurers to identify which companies are the best-value for different renter profiles.

Our rankings evaluate affordability, customer satisfaction scores, claims handling and coverage options. Students renting their first apartment, renters with expensive belongings and budget-focused renters each benefit from different insurers based on what matters most.

Each comparison includes renters insurance quotes from our analysis, company strengths and coverage features.

## What to Consider When Comparing Renters Insurance Quotes

Comparing renters insurance quotes requires evaluating coverage limits, deductibles and property characteristics. These factors affect costs when comparing companies and determine the level of protection for belongings and liability risks.

![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)

Coverage Limits and Deductibles

Higher coverage limits mean higher premiums but protect more of your belongings after a loss. Calculate how much your furniture, electronics and clothing would cost to replace, then add liability coverage for accidents in your rental. [Renters insurance for $100,000 in coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/how-much-is-renters-insurance-for-100-000/) costs $36 per month on average, while the cost of [$300,000 in renters insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/how-much-is-300-000-in-renters-insurance/) jumps to $90 monthly for the added protection. A higher deductible cuts your monthly premium but means you'll pay more up front when filing a claim. Understanding [what renters insurance covers and excludes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/what-is-renters-insurance-what-does-it-cover/) helps you avoid gaps in protection.

![pet icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/pet_scsbqv.svg)

Property Type and Pet Ownership

Apartments, houses, condos and mobile homes each carry different risks that affect your rate. Apartment insurance costs less since buildings have security features and fire protection systems that reduce risk. [Renters insurance for mobile homes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/mobile-home-renters-insurance/) costs more due to higher wind and structural damage risks. Pet ownership can increase premiums as well, especially for breeds insurers classify as higher risk. Some companies won't cover certain dog breeds, while others charge extra for any pet. [Pet liability in renters insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/pet-liability-renters-coverage/) covers medical bills and legal costs if your pet injures someone or damages property.

![house2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/house2_xohm98.svg)

Landlord Requirements and Additional Protection

Your landlord may require renters insurance with minimum coverage amounts specified in your lease. The [amount of renters insurance a landlord requires](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/how-much-renters-insurance-should-a-landlord-require/) ranges from $100,000 to $300,000 in personal property coverage, plus $100,000 to $300,000 in liability protection. If you rent in a flood-prone area, you'll need separate [flood insurance for renters](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/) since standard renters policies exclude flood damage. Loss of use coverage pays for temporary housing if your rental becomes uninhabitable.

Comparing Costs and Finding Discounts

Rates vary by hundreds of dollars annually between companies for identical coverage. Comparing providers helps you find the best rate since location, coverage and your profile all affect pricing. Bundling your renters policy with auto insurance saves 10% to 25% on both. Ask about discounts for security systems, smoke detectors or going paperless. Compare quotes from at least three insurers using a [renters insurance calculator](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/renters-insurance-estimate-calculator/) to find your best rate.

## How to Compare Renters Insurance Quotes Side by Side

Comparing renters insurance quotes from multiple companies takes 30 minutes and reveals rate differences of hundreds of dollars annually. Follow these five steps for effective comparison:

1. 1

   Gather Your Information

   Renters insurance quotes require rental address, belongings value and preferred coverage limits. Most renters need $20,000 to $40,000 in personal property coverage, though expensive electronics, jewelry or furniture require higher limits. Select deductible amount and liability coverage level before requesting quotes.
2. 2

   Request Quotes From Three to Five Insurers

   Start with current auto insurance carriers, as bundling saves 10% to 25% on both policies. Include national carriers like [State Farm](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/reviews/state-farm/) and [Allstate](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/allstate-renters-insurance-review/), plus regional insurers that may offer competitive rates. Online quote tools provide estimates in minutes, while agents offer personalized guidance.
3. 3

   Compare Coverage, Not Just Prices

   Evaluate each policy's personal property limits, liability coverage and deductible amounts. Verify whether replacement cost or actual cash value applies to belongings. Replacement cost coverage reimburses for new items rather than depreciated values and costs more. Review additional coverages like loss of use, which pays for temporary housing if rentals become uninhabitable.
4. 4

   Check Company Quality

   Check each insurer's financial strength ratings from AM Best and customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power. Read reviews about claims processing speed. Low premiums lose value if insurers take weeks to process theft or fire claims. Consider whether working with a local agent or managing policies through an app fits better.
5. 5

   Calculate Total Costs With Discounts

   Bundling with auto insurance, security system installations, smoke detectors, claims-free history and paperless billing all provide discounts. Some companies discount annual payments versus monthly installments. Calculate total annual costs with all discounts applied, then select the policy balancing price, coverage and company reliability.
