[Minimum insurance limits](https://www.breatheeasyins.com/videos/what-are-minimum-coverage-limits "What Are Minimum Coverage Limits") are the smallest amount of coverage drivers need to legally drive. Without meeting these minimum insurance requirements, drivers risk facing legal penalties. These limits help cover the costs of accidents, like medical expenses and car repairs, if you’re at fault. These costs include medical expenses and property damage, protecting your financial responsibility. Each state sets its own limits, and starting in 2025, California’s auto insurance limits will require more coverage.
* **More Protection:** With higher insurance limits, drivers will have more coverage if they cause an accident. These new standards are aimed at providing adequate insurance coverage to prevent financial hardship. This means they’re less likely to pay out of pocket for expensive medical bills or repairs.
