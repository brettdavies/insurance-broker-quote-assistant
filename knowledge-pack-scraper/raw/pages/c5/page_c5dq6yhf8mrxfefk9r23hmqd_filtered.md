# What are you guys paying for insurance?

Edit: I have progressive, upstate NY. I have a 6 month policy, collision, comprehensive, and liability. I was on a payment schedule of $108/month with an upfront first month payment of $130. Now I just get an email saying a payment of $371 is due on 6/19. And I have payments of $237 scheduled each month after that. Know clue how that happened. I signed up for $108. My 2021 WRX was $220/month in New Jersey. $237 for a crosstrek in upstate NY is silly.

I haven’t been in an accident or had a traffic tickets in the last 10 years. I don’t get it…

Just bought a ‘22 crosstrek, trying to understand what a normal insurance rate for full coverage is. I get that it varies, but I’d like to see the range.

Progressive just pulled a fast one on me, so I need to shop, trying to find the best option here…
