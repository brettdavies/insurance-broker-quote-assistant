The GEICO alumni discount is a type of [affiliation discount](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/geico-affiliation-discount-2140683991/) available to members of hundreds of alumni associations, fraternities and sororities and other organizations affiliated with higher education. The discount varies based on the organization and your state.

Only one affiliate discount can be applied per policy. That means if you and your spouse went to different universities, it’s worth checking which one has a bigger discount.

If an organization you belong to is on [GEICO’s list](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/organization-member/alumni-and-universities/#conferences), you can see the alumni discount applied to your new policy in an online quote. You may need to enter your organization’s credentials to get the discount in some cases.
