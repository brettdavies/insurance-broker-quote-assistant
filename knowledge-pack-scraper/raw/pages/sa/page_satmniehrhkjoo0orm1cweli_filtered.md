Adding discounts to your car insurance policy is one of the easiest ways to [save money](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) on your premium. A good student discount is available for full-time high school or college students with good grades — usually a B or 3.0 or better GPA.

Many insurance companies offer this discount, including [State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm). Policyholders can save up to 25% on their auto insurance with a good student discount. Here’s how it works, how the State Farm discount stacks up to competitors, and other ways you can save on your State Farm policy.

## **What Is the State Farm Good Student Discount?**

[Teens](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens) and young drivers generally pay the most for car insurance because they make riskier driving decisions and have less experience than older [age groups](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/age).[[1]](#cite-1) Many insurance companies, like State Farm, offer specific discounts for young drivers to save on the cost of car insurance.

Any teen or [young driver](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) up to age 25 on a State Farm policy can qualify for a [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount). The young driver must be a full-time high school or college student and meet one of the following qualifications:

* 3.0 or higher GPA
* Rank within the upper 20% of your class
* Make honor roll or dean’s list for a given semester
* Rank within the top 20% of national standardized tests dated within the last year if you’re a homeschooled student

## **How Much Can You Save With the State Farm Good Student Discount?**

![Group of young adults collaborating at a table with laptops, notebooks, and papers in a library setting.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/08eb487c38/students-using-laptop.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

State Farm advertises savings of up to 25% with its good student discount. But the amount can vary by factors like your [state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state), GPA, vehicle type, and [coverages](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage). Note that this discount may apply solely to the vehicle — not the policy — of the eligible driver.

Since the details are murky, we looked for real-world customers to see how it works. Some State Farm agents on Reddit say State Farm may accept your weighted GPA if your unweighted GPA is lower than 3.0.[[2]](#cite-2) Your current GPA for the most recent semester — not your cumulative GPA — is what matters.[[3]](#cite-3) A higher GPA may also mean a bigger discount.[[4]](#cite-4)

That said, it’s a good idea to talk with your State Farm agent to find out how much you can save on your personal policy and how the good student discount works in your state.

### **How does State Farm’s Good Student Discount compare to competitors?**

The good student discount is a common discount auto insurers offer. Qualifying students can also get a good student discount from insurers like Progressive, Nationwide, and Travelers, though eligibility varies.

See how State Farm stacks up against the competition in terms of average rates, discounts, and maximum savings in the table below, according to our research.

## **How to Get the State Farm Good Student Discount**

![A smiling young woman with long hair driving a white car, wearing a seatbelt, and looking ahead through the open window.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/c8fee8e0c8/teen-driving.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))
