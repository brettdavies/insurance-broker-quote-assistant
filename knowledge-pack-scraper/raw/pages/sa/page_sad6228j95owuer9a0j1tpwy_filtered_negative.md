* Intra-policy stacking is restricted by statute and typical policy language. You usually cannot add up UM/UIM limits from two different vehicles listed under the same policy for a single loss.
* Inter-policy coverage may be possible in specific situations where you are an insured under a separate policy, but it depends on priority rules, anti-stacking provisions, and other insurance clauses found in California Insurance Code section 11580.2 and the policies themselves.

* Exhaustion applies. You generally must collect the full liability limit from the at-fault insurer before pursuing UIM, consistent with section 11580.2’s framework.

## FAQ
###  [ After an LA car crash, what does “insurance stacking” mean and why does it matter? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-0)
Stacking means trying to combine limits from more than one auto policy or more than one vehicle’s coverage to increase the payout. It matters in Los Angeles because serious injuries are common and at‑fault drivers often have low limits, so victims look to uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage for additional recovery.
###  [ Is stacking UM/UIM coverage legal in California? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-1)
California generally prohibits intra‑policy stacking (adding UM/UIM limits across multiple vehicles on the same policy for one crash). Limited, sequential access to more than one separate policy may be possible if you qualify as an insured on both, subject to Insurance Code §11580.2, policy “other insurance” clauses, and priority rules. You cannot defeat anti‑stacking by adding limits together.
###  [ What’s the difference between uninsured (UM) and underinsured (UIM) motorist coverage? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-2)
UM applies when the at‑fault driver has no liability insurance or in qualifying hit‑and‑run events. UIM applies when the at‑fault driver has liability insurance but not enough, and your UIM limit is higher than the at‑fault driver’s bodily‑injury liability limit.
###  [ How does California’s UIM “difference‑in‑limits” formula work? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-3)
UIM is not add‑on coverage. The carrier’s maximum liability equals your UIM limit minus the at‑fault driver’s bodily‑injury liability limit paid to you, and only if your damages exceed the at‑fault limit. Example: If your UIM is $100,000 and the at‑fault limit is $30,000, the most available under UIM is up to $70,000, subject to proof of damages and policy terms.
###  [ What is the “exhaustion” requirement before UIM pays? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-4)
Under §11580.2, UIM generally does not pay until you exhaust the at‑fault driver’s liability limits by settlement or judgment. You typically must obtain written consent from your UIM carrier before accepting the at‑fault policy limits to avoid impairing the carrier’s subrogation rights.
###  [ How do California’s anti‑stacking rules affect multiple vehicles on one policy? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-5)
For one injury claim, you cannot add UM/UIM limits across vehicles listed on the same policy. The highest single applicable UM/UIM limit on that policy governs, even if you paid separate premiums for each vehicle.
###  [ Can I use more than one separate policy (inter‑policy) after a crash? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-6)
Possibly, if you are an insured under more than one policy (e.g., the vehicle you occupied plus your own household policy). Priority is controlled by §11580.2 and the policies’ other‑insurance clauses. One policy may be primary and another excess. You still cannot add limits together beyond what the statute allows.
###  [ How did the 2025 increase in California minimum liability limits change payouts? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-7)
As of Jan. 1, 2025, minimum limits are 30/60/15. That often increases the at‑fault liability tender, but because UIM is difference‑in‑limits, higher at‑fault minimums can reduce the UIM gap. Example: With 100/300 UIM and a minimally insured at‑fault driver, the potential per‑person UIM difference is now up to $70,000 instead of $85,000 under the old 15/30 minimums.
###  [ I was a pedestrian or cyclist. Can I make a UM/UIM claim? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-8)
Often yes. If you’re a named insured or qualifying resident relative on a policy with UM/UIM, you are typically covered as a pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor vehicle. If you were an occupant of someone else’s car, that car’s policy may also cover you as an occupant.
###  [ What’s required to use UM for a hit‑and‑run in California? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-9)
Policies commonly require: (1) actual physical contact by the unidentified vehicle, (2) prompt reporting to law enforcement, and (3) timely notice to your insurer. Check your policy and §11580.2 for specific conditions and deadlines.
###  [ My loved one was killed. Can the family make a UM/UIM claim? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-10)
Yes, wrongful‑death beneficiaries may seek UM/UIM benefits if the decedent qualified as an insured and the crash meets UM/UIM triggers. Per‑person and per‑accident limits still apply. Families may also pursue a survival claim for the estate. Deadlines and consent‑to‑settle rules still apply; consult counsel promptly.
###  [ What deadlines apply to UM/UIM claims and arbitration? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-11)
Section 11580.2 imposes strict timing requirements to demand arbitration and/or take specified legal action. Some deadlines can be as short as two years, and different triggers may apply for UM vs. UIM. Calendar dates early and confirm the exact timetable in your policy and the statute.
###  [ What if I settled with the at‑fault driver without my UIM insurer’s written consent? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-12)
You may jeopardize your UIM rights by impairing the insurer’s subrogation. Some policies and §11580.2 require written consent before accepting limits. If this occurred, speak with counsel immediately to assess potential remedies.
###  [ How do “other insurance,” permissive use, and household status affect which policy pays first? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-13)
Policies contain coordination clauses (primary, excess, or pro‑rata). The policy on the occupied vehicle often is primary for occupants; a personal policy may be excess. Your status—named insured, resident relative, or permissive user—can change priority and availability under §11580.2.
###  [ Do employer or rideshare policies change UM/UIM options? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-14)
Yes. Business auto policies may cover employees driving for work, depending on endorsements and definitions. Rideshare (TNC) policies have tiered limits based on app status and may include UM/UIM in certain periods. Examine the specific endorsements and certificates.
###  [ Will an umbrella policy increase my UM/UIM recovery? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-15)
Often no—many umbrellas exclude UM/UIM unless a specific UM/UIM endorsement is purchased. If an umbrella does provide UM/UIM, it typically applies as excess and must be read with anti‑stacking and other‑insurance clauses.
###  [ What defenses do insurers commonly raise in UM/UIM cases? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-16)
Typical defenses include: you are not an insured; no qualifying UM/UIM event; failure to exhaust; anti‑stacking and priority limits; late notice or missed arbitration deadlines; and disputes on causation, comparative fault, and medical necessity. Plaintiffs respond by mapping policy definitions, complying with statutory prerequisites, and proving liability and damages with credible evidence.
###  [ What if the insurer delays or mishandles the claim? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-17)
Insurers owe a duty of good faith and must follow fair claims practices. While liability and damages disputes go to UM/UIM arbitration under §11580.2, unreasonable delays or denials can support separate remedies depending on the facts and policy terms. Document communications and seek counsel.
###  [ How do med‑pay, health insurer liens, Medicare/Medi‑Cal, and workers’ comp affect my net recovery? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-18)
These benefits help pay bills but can trigger reimbursement rights or offsets. §11580.2 allows certain credits to avoid double recovery, and many policies include non‑duplication provisions. Negotiating liens and coordinating benefits is key to protecting your net recovery.
###  [ How do comparative fault and preexisting conditions affect my UM/UIM payout? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-19)
Arbitrators can reduce damages by your percentage of fault and may apportion injuries between preexisting conditions and crash‑related aggravation based on medical evidence. Strong documentation and expert opinions are often critical.
###  [ How do per‑person vs. per‑accident limits work when multiple people are injured? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-20)
The per‑person limit caps any one claimant’s bodily‑injury recovery. The per‑accident aggregate caps all bodily‑injury payments to all claimants from that occurrence. Anti‑stacking prevents multiplying limits across vehicles on one policy.
###  [ How do I find every dollar of coverage after a serious LA crash? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-21)
Collect declarations pages for all household auto policies, the policy on the vehicle you occupied, any applicable employer or rideshare policies, and any umbrella. Confirm UM/UIM selections or written rejections, identify permissive‑use coverage, verify med‑pay and health coverage, and check resident‑relative status. Sequence claims to satisfy exhaustion and consent‑to‑settle requirements.
###  [ What documents strengthen a UM/UIM claim in arbitration? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-22)
Police reports, photographs/video, witness statements, complete medical records and billing, wage and employment records, expert evaluations (medical, biomechanical, economic), and proof of out‑of‑pocket expenses. Prepare early—arbitration awards are limited by policy terms and limits.
###  [ Should I increase my UM/UIM limits now that minimum liability limits rose in 2025? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-23)
Yes, many Californians should consider higher UM/UIM limits. Because UIM pays only the difference over the at‑fault limit, higher personal UM/UIM limits are often the only way to meaningfully protect against serious losses.
###  [ Can minors make UM/UIM claims, and are there special steps? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-24)
Yes. Minors can recover UM/UIM benefits if covered as insureds. Settlements for minors typically require court approval (a compromise of a minor’s claim). Work with counsel to meet procedural requirements and protect the minor’s interests.
###  [ How can a Los Angeles attorney help with stacking and UM/UIM strategy? ](https://gosuits.com/knowledge-base/california-insurance-stacking-la-car-accidents-gosuits/#faq-25)
By auditing all policies and endorsements, mapping anti‑stacking and priority under §11580.2, controlling notice/consent/arbitration deadlines, building liability and damages proof, sequencing settlements to satisfy exhaustion, and negotiating liens to protect net recovery.
