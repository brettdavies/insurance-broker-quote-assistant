#  WARNING: DO NOT USE GEICO OR SAGESURE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. 
WARNING: DO NOT USE GEICO OR SAGESURE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. 
I've been using Geico as my insurance broker on my homeowners insurance in Suffolk County, NY for the past 3+ years. In May, the company I used HomeSite dropped me citing that they were leaving the area. 
I got a new company through Geico, SageSure. They sent someone to the house to inspect it. Then I heard nothing. Geico called me, leaving a message to tell me that the insurance wouldn't renew. But the renewal date in my app and on my policy was 05/2026 so I didn't worry about it. I couldn't get back in touch with them through the phone numbers that I had both to the Geico corp nor Local office. 
So, I emailed the local office. I emailed the contractors that had sold me the policy. I emailed SageSure. I heard NOTHING back from anyone. Then this week I emailed SageSure again to check the status of my policy after not hearing anything from my last 2 outreaches over the past few weeks. They told me to reach out to my Geico Local office that sold me the policy. I did that AGAIN and couldn't get in touch with anyone. 
I told them I couldn't get in touch with anyone. They then sent me a cancellation for my policy that was dated retroactively for 2 weeks ago. I told them I had never received any cancellation notice. They then told me that my settings were paperless so I should check my email. Nope. Nothing. I sent them screenshots of my inbox, there was not a single communication from them about cancellation. 
I asked for a 30 day extension while I figure out how to respond since that's the legally mandated notice timeframe for cancelling someone's homeowners insurance. They refused that & told me I would continue to be cancelled. 
Has anyone else has this experience? How did you resolve? I have filed a formal complaint through DFS in NY. What other levers do I have to counter this? It's utterly criminal to leave someone completely uninsured.

I already had [geico](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=geico+auto+insurance&cId=ebf1635c-8212-425e-80e3-b0ff34347830&iId=fd986f2b-ba3e-4ccc-b058-151259e731c5) as auto insurance and naturally wanted to get a quote from them for home insurance. The questionnaire had a question about home style we weren’t sure about so we wanted to ask someone for clarification. The process was so long and infuriating, and the reps unable or unwilling to deviate from script and actually help, so we decided to drop them and go with a different insurance company. 
ETA: no one ever answered our question

I switched to [state farm](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=state+farm+car+insurance&cId=c4e1a96e-bb62-4e97-bb90-9d7a21aa62cc&iId=4b8c26ba-119f-42f2-b6e6-3baf5a0e3db4) and our car insurance was literally cut in half!! I didn’t even think we had that bad of insurance rate since geico was the cheapest we could find several years ago and they barely raised premiums on us. We got married since being with them and on the cusp of age discounts which I don’t think they ever refactored in, whereas when we started shopping elsewhere they were all much more affordable than geico.

We went with Allstate through a friends recommendation and have been happy so far. Allstate has local insurance agents with offices, so my experience getting a quote and talking through options was over the phone with my local agency. Much less frustrating!

That's so funny, I had the exact same experience with Progressive. It was so bad that I ended up moving my car insurance to a different local broker as a bundle with the home insurance.

We also had geico for car insurance and they said they could get us a much better deal on homeowners insurance. It was not a better deal, it was in fact a horrible deal with less coverage and a higher rate. 
We ended up going to progressive for auto insurance, saving a ton with better coverage and using our regular insurance broker to find us a good homeowners policy.

My current company was able to keep the quote similar to what I paid last year and it doesn't feel like they are collecting money while excluding themselves from the things that could actually go wrong.

I had [Homesite](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Homesite+insurance&cId=fe289630-fd2d-4cb6-9a88-455b9e52fe88&iId=1726588d-4191-44dc-be9d-17fef6bebd6e) cancel my policy last week, giving me a month to either fix stuff or change insurers. I got my premium refunded without any notice whatsoever, so when I called to ask why that happened THAT is when I was told about issues they have with the property. One seems made up and the other two are incredibly minor, so I'm changing who I buy my policy from to someone local. Probably moving my auto policies too as that's the only reason I went to [Geico](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Geico+insurance&cId=36fd7ce9-3cbb-4fce-87d3-7048ca64f63e&iId=33da99d3-d5a6-4737-9be0-de0cdb7012e9) in the first place.

I got homesite with my recent purchase and assholes told me I needed a new roof. I sent them the receipts of the roof replacement from 3 years ago and they said oh ok you don’t need a new roof. But they gave me shit about having stuff in my backyard. (I was emptying a storage unit the week they went). May I ask what ridiculous shit they told you. So I can get ready.

My insurance company told me my policy would be cancelled in 30 days if I did not get my house painted. It was painted about 4 years ago or less. I ran around in circles panicking for a bit, then calmed down, took a picture of the house from exactly the same angle as the one their minion had taken, except mine was IN FOCUS, and they were like "ope, okay, never mind".

I'm so confused. What is HomeSite and SageSure if you have GEICO? 
Anyway, I'm pretty sure every insurance company is a nightmare to work with. Sometimes things go smoothly, but it seems to be the exception, not the rule. 
If nobody was answering me, I would physically go to the local office. 
I'm pretty sure they can drop you for pretty much whatever reason they want. It can be important to understand why they're trying to drop you. If it's a misunderstanding or something, you should get it sorted out. They may share that information with the underwriters and it could affect your ability to get insured by other companies too. 
State Farm recently sent us a letter saying that our coverage would be dropped at the renewal date because they "believe there are positive measures that should be taken to reduce the potential for future loss." 
That's all. No explanation whatsoever. I called the local office and, to their credit, they were helpful. 
We had asked them if they would cover any damage from a basement flooding. I knew we didn't have flood insurance, but we did have sewer and drainage coverage. I thought it was worth asking. They eventually said no, since the water came in from the base of the walls, not from a drain. We had had a 30 year flash flood and, I later found out, a plugged downspout. Apparently, this was why they had threatened to cancel our policy. 
I had to write them an email explaining what happened. It's not like I had receipts or anything for the 30 year flood and pulling a handful of twigs out of my gutter. 
I never got a response from them. I called the local office and she said my email was well written, but that she didn't expect that 'they' (meaning the people above the local office) would ever give me a written response. I thought that really sucked since that leaves me with my last correspondence saying that I'm losing my coverage next year. 
I'll probably change insurers at some point before then, but I don't really expect any of the others to be better.

Note for the future - and this has been happening for a while but likely more so as house insurers try to stop insuring houses - your rates can be jacked up or you can be dropped JUST because you called your insurance company to ask some questions about coverage. Even if you say "I'm not filing a claim, but wanted to check and see if this is covered" they can drop you. They do it to people all the time. Because now you "might" file a claim and god forbid they'd have to hold up their end of the bargain. 
Finks. Wormboys.

I have Sagesure through a local broker where I live. It was the cheapest option and through two renewals it has only went up a minimal amount (saying I live in a high risk area). I am kind of afraid if I ever have a claim or something with them, but I really don’t think your problems are exclusive to one company, but rather a commonality in the home insurance space…which isn’t right for what they’re supposed to provide.

It’s unfortunately not criminal for a provider to not cover/insure a home. Were you provided any reason on why they deemed it uninsurable or are refusing to renew? If they find something they consider risky with your home or your credit or claim history they may not insure you. 
IMO you’re probably better off moving on and finding a new provider. Have you reached out to other companies (I.e State Farm) for insurance estimates? 
You can also contact the better business bureau to file a consumer compliant.

I live in a high risk state for hail and such and almost no insurers are writing policies for roof coverage that arent actual cash value policies if they write them anymore here. Which i get. I watched my dad do that shit last year. He had a 30yo roof and got a brand new roof fully covered under the guise of the hail storm that year. 
I use a local insurance company because of their lack of any dog list. But they've been dropping people too.

Check out the geico employee sub, and you'll see why you can't get a response. They treat their employees like garbage so their overworked and unmotivated. I go to progressive for home and auto because their customer service is usually very good.

The problem with Geico is they don't actually provide home insurance, they contract it out to other companies like Homesite or in this case Sagesure, which is terrible because geico is adamant of being the middle man and wants everything to go through them even though it makes everything 100x slower. I remember I had Traveler's J through Geico for my condo a few years ago and I needed to make a claim, Traveler's wouldn't talk to me lol, they told me to contact my local Geico office and all they did was forward everything to Traveler's which makes me wonder why I couldn't just do it myself in the first place, I was the policy holder. 
They recently jacked up my auto insurance for no good reason so I might be jumping ship soon for a better rate.
