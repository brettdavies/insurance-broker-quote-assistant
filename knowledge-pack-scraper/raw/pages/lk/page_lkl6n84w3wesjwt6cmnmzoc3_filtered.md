# State Farm Homeowner Claim

Long story short.

Storm came thru Pittsburgh region. Pretty moderate wind and hail damage to roof, windows, screens, gutters and downspouts.

Had 2 adjusters that never called me back.

3rd adjuster scheduled a “ladder assist” inspection.

Had 2 seek now inspections. (Needed a re-inspection since first one was done with a wet roof.)

Adjuster 3 said “I put you in for a full roof replacement”.

2 days later I now have adjuster #4 assigned to my case.

Adjuster #4 states “your old adjuster didn’t have the authority to issue you a full roof replacement, management is disputing your claim, we’re having a engineer come out to your house for an inspection, the hail in your area wasn’t that big in diameter”.

It’s been 40+ days since the storm and I have an interior leak…. They just came out 2 days ago to inspect the inside.

Has this happened to anyone else? What’s my next move?

I have pictures of my roof from September 2024 when I had my chimneys re-pointed with no damage.

Now you can tell I have shingles bent from the storm.

It at a loss on what to do.

Edit #1: 1” hail came thru the area.

Edit #2: Correction to edit #1 - Roof is 10 years old. Looking into weather report now. 1.75” hail in my location. 60mph winds. 1/4 mile away a roof was blown off a grocery store. 4 of my neighbors have already had their roofs replaced.
