# WARNING: DO NOT USE GEICO OR SAGESURE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE.

WARNING: DO NOT USE GEICO OR SAGESURE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE.

I've been using Geico as my insurance broker on my homeowners insurance in Suffolk County, NY for the past 3+ years. In May, the company I used HomeSite dropped me citing that they were leaving the area.

I got a new company through Geico, SageSure. They sent someone to the house to inspect it. Then I heard nothing. Geico called me, leaving a message to tell me that the insurance wouldn't renew. But the renewal date in my app and on my policy was 05/2026 so I didn't worry about it. I couldn't get back in touch with them through the phone numbers that I had both to the Geico corp nor Local office.

So, I emailed the local office. I emailed the contractors that had sold me the policy. I emailed SageSure. I heard NOTHING back from anyone. Then this week I emailed SageSure again to check the status of my policy after not hearing anything from my last 2 outreaches over the past few weeks. They told me to reach out to my Geico Local office that sold me the policy. I did that AGAIN and couldn't get in touch with anyone.

I told them I couldn't get in touch with anyone. They then sent me a cancellation for my policy that was dated retroactively for 2 weeks ago. I told them I had never received any cancellation notice. They then told me that my settings were paperless so I should check my email. Nope. Nothing. I sent them screenshots of my inbox, there was not a single communication from them about cancellation.

I asked for a 30 day extension while I figure out how to respond since that's the legally mandated notice timeframe for cancelling someone's homeowners insurance. They refused that & told me I would continue to be cancelled.

Has anyone else has this experience? How did you resolve? I have filed a formal complaint through DFS in NY. What other levers do I have to counter this? It's utterly criminal to leave someone completely uninsured.
