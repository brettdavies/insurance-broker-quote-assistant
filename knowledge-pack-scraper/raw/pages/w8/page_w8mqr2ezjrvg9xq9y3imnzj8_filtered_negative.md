**If the at-fault driver has no insurance or it is a hit-and-run, your uninsured motorist (UM) coverage may apply. Use the quick checklist below to confirm coverage and see your next steps.**
## Quick Answer
* **Hit-and-run?** UM usually applies, but **file a police report promptly** because most policies require it.
* **Other driver uninsured?** UM acts as a **substitute for the at-fault driver’s liability coverage**.
* **Who’s covered?** Often **you**, **your passengers**, **household family members**, and sometimes **pedestrians or cyclists** struck by an uninsured or unknown driver.
* **Fault matters:** UM or UIM generally applies when the **other driver caused the crash**.
* **Deadlines apply.** Policy and Illinois time limits can be short, so **move quickly**.

## Who Is Covered by Uninsured Motorist Coverage in Illinois?
Policy language controls, but most Illinois auto policies cover the people listed below. Check the declarations page and the definitions for “you,” “family member,” “your covered auto,” and “occupying.”
* **You:** covered while driving your car, riding in someone else’s car, or as a pedestrian or cyclist struck by an uninsured or unknown driver.
* **Your passengers:** covered while riding in your covered auto with permission.
* **Household family members:** resident relatives who live with you are often covered even when they are not in your car, for example while walking or riding in a friend’s car.
* **Permissive users:** someone driving your car with your permission is usually covered, and their passengers are usually covered.
* **Someone else’s car:** the car’s insurance is usually primary. Your own UM may apply after those limits if they are not enough.
* **Hit and run:** most policies require a prompt police report and some proof that a vehicle caused the crash. Witness statements or physical evidence can help.
* **Not typically covered:** property damage unless the policy includes UMPD, vehicles available for regular use but not listed on the policy, certain commercial or rideshare uses, and injuries caused by your own fault. Ask an attorney to review any exclusions.
### Examples:
* **Passenger example:** you ride in a friend’s car and an uninsured driver hits you. Your friend’s UM applies first. Your own UM can apply if the limits are not enough.
* **Pedestrian example:** you are struck by a hit and run driver in Chicago. Your own UM may apply if you reported the crash promptly.
* **Family example:** your teen who lives with you is hurt while riding in a neighbor’s car. Your family’s UM can apply because the teen is a resident relative.
### Checklist to make coverage easier to confirm:
* Get a police report number, especially for hit and run.
* Tell your insurer quickly and save the claim number.
* Collect photos, witness names, and medical bills.
* Do not give broad recorded statements before you understand your rights.

## When Uninsured Motorist Coverage Applies in Illinois
UM coverage is meant to stand in for the at-fault driver’s liability insurance when certain conditions are met. Use the scenarios below to see where it usually applies.
### Uninsured at-fault driver
* The other driver has no liability insurance and their negligence caused the crash.
* You and your passengers make a UM claim under your policy.
* The car you were in may have its own UM that applies first. Your own UM may apply after that if limits are not enough.
### Hit and run
* The at-fault driver leaves the scene or cannot be identified.
* Most policies require a prompt police report and some proof that a vehicle caused the crash.
* Evidence can include photos, video, property damage, debris, or a witness statement.
* File your claim quickly and keep the report number.
### Phantom vehicle or no physical contact
* A vehicle forces you to swerve and leaves without contact.
* Many policies require an independent witness or other clear proof that a vehicle caused the loss.
* If you cannot meet the proof requirements, the insurer may deny the UM claim.
### Situations that may look uninsured but often are not
* The other driver has insurance, and their limits are too low. This is usually **underinsured motorist (UIM)**, not UM. Start here: **[Underinsured motorist claim](https://blumenshinelawgroup.com/underinsured-motorist-claim/)**.
* Non-listed vehicles that are available for regular use under your household may be excluded by the policy.
* Commercial or rideshare use can be limited or excluded by some policies.
* Injuries caused mainly by your own fault are usually outside UM.
### What to do now
* Get medical care and keep your records.
* Report the crash to the police if there is a hit and run or serious injury.
* Tell your insurer quickly and save the claim number.
* Gather evidence such as photos, video, and witness names.
* Speak with a lawyer before giving broad recorded statements.

## How Much Uninsured Motorist Coverage Do I Need?
Choose a limit that fits your risk and your budget. A simple rule of thumb is to match your UM and UIM limits to your liability limits, then decide if you want more.
### What the numbers mean
* Limits are usually written as **per person / per accident**. Example: **100/300** means up to 100,000 dollars for one injured person and up to 300,000 dollars total for everyone hurt in the same crash.
* Some policies use a **combined single limit**. Example: **300 CSL** means 300,000 dollars total for all injuries from one crash.
### Good, better, best starting points
* **Minimums are rarely enough.** Many medical bills in serious injury cases pass 25,000 dollars quickly.
* **Good:** **100/300**.
* **Better:** **250/500**.
* **Best:** **500/500** or higher if offered. Ask about a matching **UIM** limit so you are protected when the at-fault driver has low limits.
### Why higher limits help
* Serious injuries can include surgery, therapy, and months of lost wages.
* UM pays when the at-fault driver has no insurance. **UIM** pays when the at-fault driver has insurance but the limits are too low.
* Higher limits give you room to recover medical costs, lost income, and pain and suffering without relying only on health insurance.
### Stacking and multiple vehicles
* Illinois policies often include an **anti-stacking** clause. That means you usually cannot add limits from several vehicles to create a larger total. Check your policy language.
### Property damage and cars
* **UMPD** is uninsured motorist property damage. It may be available with a deductible. If you carry **collision**, that may still be the first path to repair the car. Ask your agent how your policy handles UMPD and collision.
### How to check your current protection
* Open your **Declarations Page** and find the lines for **UM** and **UIM**.
* Confirm the limits match your liability limits. If not, ask your agent for quotes at 100/300, 250/500, and 500/500.
* If you carry an umbrella policy, ask if the umbrella includes **UM or UIM**. Many umbrellas do not, but some carriers offer it.
### Examples
* At **25/50**, a hospital stay and follow-up care can use the full limit for one person.
* At **250/500**, the same case has more room for medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering, and you may avoid exhausting limits.

For low limit situations, start here: <https://blumemshinelawgroup.com/underinsured-motorist-claim/>.
## What Is the Statute of Limitations?
There are two clocks to track. One is the policy deadline to start a UM claim or demand arbitration. The other is the court deadline to sue an at-fault driver, if that driver can be identified.
### Policy deadline for UM claims
* Most Illinois auto policies require you to **demand UM arbitration within about two years of the crash**. This is a [contractual limit ](https://www.isba.org/barnews/2013/04/25/liability-minute-contractual-arbitration-limitation-period-uninsured-motorist-insura)set by the policy, and Illinois courts have upheld these two-year clauses.
* Policies also require [**prompt notice** and, for hit and run](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=021500050K143a), a **police report**. Treat these as time-sensitive.
### Lawsuit deadline against an at-fault driver
* For personal injury in Illinois, the general deadline to file suit is [two years from the date the claim accrues](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K13-202). This applies when the other driver is known and you are pursuing a tort case.
### Why “contract vs. statute” creates confusion
* UM is a **contract claim against your own insurer**. [Illinois has a ten-year period for suits](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K13-206) on written contracts, but the policy can **shorten** the time, and that shorter time is usually enforceable. Always follow the policy’s shorter time limits.
### Special timing notes
* **Crash reporting**: Illinois [requires crash reports](https://idot.illinois.gov/transportation-system/local-transportation-partners/law-enforcement/reporting/crash-reporting.html) to be submitted within about **10 days**. For hit-and-run claims, make a police report quickly and save the report number.
* **Minors and some exceptions**: certain situations may toll or extend deadlines. Ask an attorney to review your facts before assuming you are out of time.
### What to do now
* Check your **Declarations Page** and the **UM arbitration clause** for the exact demand deadline.
* If the at-fault driver is known, diary the **two year tort deadline** as well.
* Report the crash and open a claim with your insurer, then get legal help to preserve both clocks.

## How an Uninsured Motorist Attorney Can Help
UM claims look simple, but they are contract claims with strict proof and notice requirements. A Chicago UM lawyer can handle the evidence, deadlines, valuation, and arbitration so you can focus on recovery.
### Prove fault and meet hit and run rules
* Gather police reports, photos, video, and witness statements.
* Confirm policy requirements such as prompt reporting and proof that a vehicle caused the crash.
* Coordinate scene investigation and expert input when liability is disputed.
### Find every dollar of coverage
* Read the declarations page and policy forms for UM, UIM, Med Pay, UMPD, and umbrella.
* Determine which policy is primary and whether your own policy can apply after another policy pays.
* Spot exclusions that insurers raise and prepare responses.
### Build and file the UM demand
* Calculate medical bills, future care, lost income, and pain and suffering.
* Organize records and draft a demand that tracks the policy language.
* Send notice and preserve deadlines for arbitration.
### Negotiate or arbitrate
* Negotiate with the adjuster and present the claim to a neutral arbitrator if needed.
* Prepare you and your witnesses for testimony.
* Use comparable verdicts and settlements from Cook County and nearby venues to support value.
### Protect your net recovery
* Resolve medical liens and subrogation claims.
* Coordinate UM with health insurance or Med Pay so you do not pay twice.
* Advise on release language and future medical issues.

## Common Insurer Defenses and How to Respond
Insurers often raise the same arguments in UM claims. Here is what they mean and how a lawyer addresses them.
* **Late notice:** the insurer says you waited too long to report. Show when you learned facts, why the delay was reasonable, and that no real prejudice occurred.
* **No proof of hit and run:** the insurer wants independent evidence. Provide the police report, witness names, photos, video, debris, or property damage.
* **Not a covered person:** the insurer claims you are not insured under the policy. Point to definitions for you, family member, occupying, and your covered auto.
* **Not enough medical proof:** the insurer questions causation or treatment. Supply records, doctor opinions, billing, and a clear timeline.
* **Value dispute:** the insurer offers too little. Use medical summaries, wage loss proof, and local verdicts to support value.

## UM Arbitration: What to Expect
If the claim does not settle, most policies use arbitration instead of a jury trial. Here is how that process works.
* **Filing the demand:** your lawyer sends a written demand that cites the policy.
* **Selecting arbitrators:** each side picks one, then those two pick a neutral third.
* **Exchange of evidence:** both sides share medical records, bills, photos, and witness lists.
* **Hearing day:** you testify, your doctor may testify, and the arbitrators ask questions.
* **Decision:** the panel issues a written award. Payment timelines are set by the policy.
* **Appeal limits:** appeals are narrow. A strong record is the best protection.
**Tip:** schedule the hearing far enough ahead to complete treatment or obtain clear medical opinions.
## Frequently Asked Questions
**Does UM cover hit and run in Illinois?**
Often yes, if you promptly report to police and provide proof that a vehicle caused the crash.
**Am I covered as a passenger in someone else’s car?**
Usually, yes, under that car’s policy. Your own UM may apply after that if limits are not enough.
**What if the other driver had insurance, but the limits were too low?**
That is usually an underinsured motorist claim. Start here: [Underinsured motorist claims](https://blumenshinelawgroup.com/underinsured-motorist-claim/.).
**How long do I have to start a UM claim?**
Policies often require a UM arbitration demand within about two years. Check your policy for the exact deadline.
**Will UM pay for property damage?**
Only if your policy includes uninsured motorist property damage, collision coverage may be the path for car repairs.
