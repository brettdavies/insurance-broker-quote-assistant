## New York’s Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements

New York is a **[no-fault insurance state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-fault_insurance)**, meaning that after an accident, your own insurance covers your medical expenses and lost wages, no matter who was at fault. However, the required minimum coverage may not be enough to fully protect you.

As of 2024, the minimum auto insurance coverage requirements in New York are:

* **Bodily Injury Liability (BIL):** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
* **Property Damage Liability (PDL):** $10,000 per accident
* **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** $50,000 per person
* **Uninsured Motorist Coverage:** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident

While these requirements provide a basic level of protection, they often fall short when it comes to covering the full costs of serious injuries and damages.

## What Does Minimum Coverage Actually Cover?

The required minimum coverage in New York provides some financial protection, but it may not be enough in the event of a serious accident. Here’s what each type of coverage includes:

* **Bodily Injury Liability:** Covers medical expenses and lost wages for the other party if you are at fault.
* **Property Damage Liability:** Pays for damage to another person’s property, like their car or home.
* **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** Covers medical expenses, lost wages, and certain other costs for you and your passengers, no matter who was at fault.
* **Uninsured Motorist Coverage:** Helps pay for your injuries if you’re hit by a driver who doesn’t have insurance or in a hit-and-run accident.

While these minimums satisfy legal requirements, they often **don’t come close to covering the full costs of serious accidents** (that are very common, especially in New York). That’s why many drivers opt for higher coverage limits.

## Why Should You Consider Higher Coverage?

Although New York requires a minimum level of auto insurance coverage, **drivers have the option to increase their coverage limits for better financial protection.** Choosing maximum coverage means that in the event of a serious accident, your insurance is more likely to cover your medical bills and other expenses without leaving you with major out-of-pocket costs.

**Higher coverage limits typically include:**

* **Bodily Injury Liability:** Up to $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident
* **Property Damage Liability:** $100,000 or more per accident
* **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** Additional coverage beyond the mandatory $50,000
* **Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** Extra protection if the at-fault driver’s insurance isn’t enough to cover your damages

Higher coverage is **especially useful in cases involving severe injuries**, extended hospital stays, or costly vehicle repairs. Many accident victims find that the minimum coverage is nowhere near enough to cover medical bills, lost income, rehabilitation costs, and pain and suffering.

## What Happens If You’re in an Accident with an Uninsured Driver?

If you’re hit by a driver who doesn’t have insurance, your uninsured motorist (UM) coverage becomes essential. This coverage is required in New York and helps protect you financially when the at-fault driver has no insurance.

**Your UM coverage can help pay for:**

* Medical expenses resulting from the accident
* Lost wages if you’re unable to work due to your injuries
* Pain and suffering if the injuries are severe
* Other damages that would normally be covered by the at-fault driver’s insurance

However, **UM coverage has limits**, and if your damages exceed those limits, you might need to take legal action against the at-fault driver. Unfortunately, uninsured drivers often don’t have the financial resources to pay for damages out-of-pocket. That’s why underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage is also recommended—it provides additional financial protection when the at-fault driver’s insurance isn’t enough to cover your costs.

An experienced personal injury attorney like **[Mitchell Proner](https://thenationaltriallawyers.org/members/mitchell-proner/)** can help you explore all your options, whether that means filing an insurance claim or pursuing legal action to get the compensation you deserve.

## How Much Compensation Can an Accident Victim Receive?

The amount of compensation you can receive after an accident depends on several factors, including the severity of your injuries, the available auto insurance coverage, and whether you take legal action and hire an experienced attorney.

**Under a basic Personal Injury Protection (PIP) policy, you can receive compensation for:**

* Medical expenses up to $50,000
* Lost wages (up to 80% of your income, capped at $2,000 per month for up to three years)
* Necessary expenses (such as transportation to medical appointments)

However, if your damages exceed these limits, you may be able to pursue additional compensation through a personal injury lawsuit. This is where having an experienced attorney is crucial. **[A skilled lawyer like Mitchell Proner](https://www.prolaw1.com/about-us/mitchell-proner/)** can help you seek damages beyond PIP limits, including:

* Pain and suffering for physical and emotional distress
* Future medical expenses for ongoing treatments, therapy, or surgeries
* Loss of earning capacity if your injuries prevent you from returning to work
* Punitive damages in cases of extreme negligence or reckless behavior

## Why You Need a Lawyer After an Accident

Dealing with an auto insurance claim—especially when injuries are involved—can be complicated. **Insurance companies often try to pay out as little as possible** or even deny claims altogether. Without legal representation, you may not receive the full compensation you’re entitled to.

**An experienced personal injury lawyer can:**

* Investigate the accident and gather key evidence
* Negotiate with insurance companies to maximize your settlement
* File a personal injury lawsuit if necessary
* Ensure you don’t settle for less than what you deserve

At the firm of Mitchell Proner, **we have over 60 years of experience helping accident victims in New York**. We know how to navigate the complexities of auto insurance claims and will fight to get you the compensation you need to recover fully.

## How a Lawyer Can Help You Get the Maximum Compensation

Navigating the aftermath of a car accident and auto insurance coverage can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with medical bills, lost wages, and uncooperative insurance companies. Having a skilled personal injury lawyer on your side can make all the difference in maximizing your compensation. Here’s how:

### 1. Evaluating the True Value of Your Claim

Insurance companies often try to settle for the lowest possible amount. A lawyer will assess your case thoroughly, considering not just immediate medical expenses.

### 2. Negotiating Aggressively with Insurance Companies

Insurance adjusters are trained to minimize payouts, but experienced attorneys know their tactics. Your lawyer will:

* Handle all communication with the insurance company
* Gather and present strong evidence to prove liability
* Negotiate to ensure you receive the highest possible settlement

### 3. Proving Liability and Building a Strong Case

To secure the maximum compensation, your lawyer will collect and analyze evidence, such as:

* Police reports and witness statements
* Medical records linking your injuries to the accident
* Traffic camera footage or accident reconstruction analysis
* Expert testimony from medical professionals or economists

### 4. Filing a Personal Injury Lawsuit If Necessary

If the insurance company refuses to offer a fair settlement, your attorney can take the case to court. A strong legal team can file a lawsuit and present compelling arguments before a judge and jury, often leading to higher compensation than an insurance settlement.

### 5. Identifying Additional Avenues for Compensation

Beyond insurance claims, your lawyer may explore other ways to increase your compensation, such as:

* Filing a claim against multiple parties (e.g., if the accident involved a commercial vehicle or defective car parts)
* Seeking punitive damages in cases of extreme negligence (e.g., drunk driving)
* Accessing compensation through uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

At **[Proner & Proner](https://www.prolaw1.com/)**, we have helped countless accident victims recover the full compensation they deserve. With decades of experience, we know how to fight insurance companies and maximize settlements for our clients.
