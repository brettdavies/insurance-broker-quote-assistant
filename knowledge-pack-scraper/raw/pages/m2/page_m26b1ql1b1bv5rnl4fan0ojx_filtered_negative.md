[Small business insurance](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance "Small business insurance")[General liability](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability "General liability insurance")
If you’re [facing a lawsuit](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/lawsuit-examples "General liability insurance claims and lawsuit examples") over false or misleading statements in your ads, [personal and advertising injuries](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/personal-and-advertising-injury) coverage, which is a component of a [general liability insurance policy](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability), would help with the legal costs.
* [Libel](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/libel)
* [Slander](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/slander)
* [Copyright infringement](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/copyright-infringement "Copyright infringement insurance")
* [Invasion of privacy](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/invasion-of-privacy)
Keep in mind that some general liability insurance policies may have [exclusions](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/exclusions "General liability insurance exclusions"), including intentional misrepresentation. If you’re creating ads that purposely contain false information, your insurance company may not cover a claim. You should always take time to review your policy to understand the specific advertising injury coverage it provides.
* [Defamation](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/defamation-insurance "Defamation insurance") of a competitor’s product
If a wellness brand posted [social media ads](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/social-media "Social media liability insurance") claiming that customers would lose 20 pounds in the first month of taking their new supplement, without any verified scientific proof to back up that claim, that would be false advertising.
But if those ads also showed before-and-after photos of a person who’d lost 20 pounds after taking the supplements and having weight-loss surgery, and they didn’t disclose those details, that would be misrepresentation. Either option could result in an expensive and lengthy class action suit.
![Small business owner looking for insurance quotes on their tablet.](https://www.insureon.com/-/media/cta/image_get-small-business-insurance.png?h=300&iar=0&w=456&rev=e92b85c4bc1b4d319c29b170152111ee)
Even if the accusations are unfounded, a false advertising lawsuit can be expensive, stressful, and time-consuming. General liability coverage will help pay your legal fees, court costs, and any [settlements or judgments](https://www.insureon.com/blog/settlements-vs-judgments "What is the difference between a judgment and settlement?").
* Third-party [bodily injury](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/bodily-injury)
* Third-party [property damage](https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/property-damage)
* [Product liability](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/product-liability "Product liability insurance")
If you own a [publishing company](https://www.insureon.com/media-business-insurance/publishers "Publishing insurance"), [advertising agency](https://www.insureon.com/media-business-insurance/advertising-agencies "Advertising agency insurance"), or other type of [media business](https://www.insureon.com/media-business-insurance "Media business insurance"), it’s important to know that advertising injuries are often excluded from your general liability insurance.
Purchasing [media liability insurance](https://www.insureon.com/media-business-insurance/professional-liability "What is media liability insurance?"), which is a type of [professional liability insurance](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/professional-liability) (also known as [errors and omissions (E&O) insurance](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/errors-omissions)), will cover claims for:
* Copyright infringement and [intellectual property (IP) infringement](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/errors-omissions/intellectual-property-insurance "Intellectual property \(IP\) insurance")
If your small business uses marketing, advertising, or [social media](https://www.insureon.com/blog/social-media-business-risk "Top social media risks for businesses") to promote your products or services, [false advertising coverage is highly recommended](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/who-needs-general-liability-insurance "Who needs general liability insurance?"). Especially if you:
* Work in a highly regulated industry, including [healthcare](https://www.insureon.com/healthcare-professionals-business-insurance "Healthcare professional insurance"), [food and beverage](https://www.insureon.com/food-business-insurance "Food and beverage business insurance"), or [financial services](https://www.insureon.com/finance-accounting-business-insurance "Financial service insurance").
It’s important to remember that [commercial general liability (CGL) insurance](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/commercial-general-liability-insurance) coverage [has two coverage limits](https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/limits "General liability insurance limits"), and each limit has an impact on your coverage. If your small business is more at risk for advertising injury claims, consider that when choosing your coverage limits.
