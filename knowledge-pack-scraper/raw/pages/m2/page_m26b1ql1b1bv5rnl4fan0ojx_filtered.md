# False advertising insurance coverage

False advertising insurance protects your business from lawsuits over claims of misrepresentation. General liability insurance includes coverage for advertising injuries and can help pay for your legal expenses if you’re sued for false advertising.

## What is false advertising insurance protection?

If you’re [facing a lawsuit](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/lawsuit-examples "General liability insurance claims and lawsuit examples") over false or misleading statements in your ads, [personal and advertising injuries](/insurance-glossary/personal-and-advertising-injury) coverage, which is a component of a [general liability insurance policy](/small-business-insurance/general-liability), would help with the legal costs.

Personal and advertising injuries are acts that violate the rights of a person or a business, including:

* [Libel](/insurance-glossary/libel)
* [Slander](/insurance-glossary/slander)
* False advertising
* [Copyright infringement](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/copyright-infringement "Copyright infringement insurance")
* [Invasion of privacy](/insurance-glossary/invasion-of-privacy)
* Misappropriation of advertising ideas

## What is misrepresentation in insurance?

Misrepresenting your products or services is another form of advertising injury, so there’s a good chance your general liability insurance would help cover litigation fees and potential settlements.

Keep in mind that some general liability insurance policies may have [exclusions](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/exclusions "General liability insurance exclusions"), including intentional misrepresentation. If you’re creating ads that purposely contain false information, your insurance company may not cover a claim. You should always take time to review your policy to understand the specific advertising injury coverage it provides.

### What is the difference between misrepresentation and false advertising?

Although people often use the terms “misrepresentation” and “false advertising” interchangeably, they’re not the same. False advertising is just one bite of a bigger apple that’s known as misrepresentation in advertising.

**False advertising** is when an ad makes a direct, untrue statement, such as:

* Exaggerated or unverified claims
* Misleading or bait-and-switch pricing
* [Defamation](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/defamation-insurance "Defamation insurance") of a competitor’s product
* Fake positive customer reviews
* Misrepresenting a product’s origin

**Misrepresentation** is when an ad either has false claims, withholds key information, or sets unrealistic expectations through wording or imagery. This could look like:

* Misleading product imagery
* Exaggerated product demos
* Omitting negative information
* Hiding disclaimers

If a wellness brand posted [social media ads](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/social-media "Social media liability insurance") claiming that customers would lose 20 pounds in the first month of taking their new supplement, without any verified scientific proof to back up that claim, that would be false advertising.

But if those ads also showed before-and-after photos of a person who’d lost 20 pounds after taking the supplements and having weight-loss surgery, and they didn’t disclose those details, that would be misrepresentation. Either option could result in an expensive and lengthy class action suit.

## How does general liability insurance cover false advertising claims?

Even if the accusations are unfounded, a false advertising lawsuit can be expensive, stressful, and time-consuming. General liability coverage will help pay your legal fees, court costs, and any [settlements or judgments](/blog/settlements-vs-judgments "What is the difference between a judgment and settlement?").

In addition to false advertising claims, your general liability insurance policy will also provide coverage for:

* Third-party [bodily injury](/insurance-glossary/bodily-injury)
* Third-party [property damage](/insurance-glossary/property-damage)
* [Product liability](/small-business-insurance/product-liability "Product liability insurance")

If you own a [publishing company](/media-business-insurance/publishers "Publishing insurance"), [advertising agency](/media-business-insurance/advertising-agencies "Advertising agency insurance"), or other type of [media business](/media-business-insurance "Media business insurance"), it’s important to know that advertising injuries are often excluded from your general liability insurance.

Purchasing [media liability insurance](/media-business-insurance/professional-liability "What is media liability insurance?"), which is a type of [professional liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/professional-liability) (also known as [errors and omissions (E&O) insurance](/small-business-insurance/errors-omissions)), will cover claims for:

* Advertising injuries, including libel and slander
* Copyright infringement and [intellectual property (IP) infringement](/small-business-insurance/errors-omissions/intellectual-property-insurance "Intellectual property (IP) insurance")
* Work mistakes and oversights
* Missed deadlines
* Invasion of privacy

## Who needs false advertising insurance coverage?

If your small business uses marketing, advertising, or [social media](/blog/social-media-business-risk "Top social media risks for businesses") to promote your products or services, [false advertising coverage is highly recommended](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/who-needs-general-liability-insurance "Who needs general liability insurance?"). Especially if you:

* Promote claims about the quality, efficacy, or benefits of your products or services.
* Mention or compare competitors’ products to your own.
* Work in a highly regulated industry, including [healthcare](/healthcare-professionals-business-insurance "Healthcare professional insurance"), [food and beverage](/food-business-insurance "Food and beverage business insurance"), or [financial services](/finance-accounting-business-insurance "Financial service insurance").
* Cater to more vulnerable populations, such as children, seniors, and people with special needs.

It’s important to remember that [commercial general liability (CGL) insurance](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/commercial-general-liability-insurance) coverage [has two coverage limits](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/limits "General liability insurance limits"),
and each limit has an impact on your coverage. If your small business is more at risk for advertising injury claims, consider that when choosing your coverage limits.

## How can businesses protect themselves from false advertising claims?

When it comes to advertising, the general rule of thumb is always to be honest. Of course, it can be more complicated than that, but there are measures you can take to ensure that the messaging you put out is accurate.

* **Be truthful and transparent.** Make sure all claims are backed by credible evidence, product images and pricing are accurate, and disclaimers are easy to read and understand.
* **Read up on advertising laws and regulations.** Learn about the [Lanham Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/false_advertising "Legal Information Institute (LII) - False Advertising"), understand the specific advertising guidelines for your industry, and consult with a law firm for guidance.
* **Create internal ad guidelines.** Develop clear standards for ads, claims, social media activity, and company communications, and provide regular employee training.
* **Protect your brand’s reputation.** Monitor your ads and company social media activity, promptly address issues and complaints, and thoroughly investigate any potential accusations.
