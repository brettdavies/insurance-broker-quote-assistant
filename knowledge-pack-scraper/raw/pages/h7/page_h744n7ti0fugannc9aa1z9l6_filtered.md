How We Work for Marketplace Change

CR uses rigorous research, consumer insights, journalism, and policy expertise to inform purchase decisions, improve the products and services that businesses deliver, and drive regulatory and fair competitive practices.

Our advocacy work does that by making sure that companies prioritize safety, fairness, and honesty; by working to establish strong pro-consumer policies and protections; and by listening to people and empowering them to raise their voices to create change.

**See below to learn more about how CR works with consumers, companies and policymakers in Washington, D.C. and statehouses across the country to help build a fair and just marketplace.**
