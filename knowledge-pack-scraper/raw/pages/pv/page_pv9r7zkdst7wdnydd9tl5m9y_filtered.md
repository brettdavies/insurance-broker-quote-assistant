# What is bicycle insurance?

**Bicycle insurance is a specialty policy** that covers you for injuries and property damage you cause while riding your bike. It can also pay to repair or replace your bike if it's lost, stolen, or damaged if you carry comprehensive and collision coverages. You may also have the option to buy additional coverage for roadside assistance (for flat tires, mechanical issues, etc.) and personal belongings that are lost or damaged while using your bike.

## How does coverage for my bicycle differ while at home versus on the road?

A **bicycle insurance policy** typically applies while you're on the road, though some coverages may apply while your bike is at home too. For example, your bike policy's comprehensive coverage would still apply if your bike was stolen from your front porch rather than a public bike rack. Other coverages, such as roadside assistance, may also apply while your bike is at home.

Check with your insurer to see how your specific coverage applies when you're not riding your bike.

## What's the difference between bicycles and e-bikes?

Bicycles are non-motorized vehicles, whereas e-bikes have an electric motor or battery assist that can either propel the rider without pedaling or assist in pedaling. Since e-bikes are considered motorized vehicles, insurers view them as a greater risk for accidents and other incidents. That's why many insurers offer specialized insurance just for e-bikes.

## Does home insurance cover bicycles?

Homeowners insurance, and other types of property insurance, may extend liability coverage to cover you for injuries and property damage you cause while riding your bike. They may also cover theft or vandalism of your bike. Check with your homeowners insurance company to confirm what coverage they offer for bicycles.

## Is bike insurance worth it?

Bike insurance may be worth it if you frequently ride your bike, especially if you use it for commuting, shopping, or other daily activities. If you own an expensive bike, such as a mountain bike, then bicycle insurance may be even more valuable to you since it may cover your bike for its full replacement value.

If you rely on your [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) to insure your bike, you may not receive a large enough payout to replace your bike with a comparable one as some companies have specific limits for things like bicycles. Plus, homeowners insurance deductibles tend to be pretty high, so if the cost to replace your bike is actually less than your property coverage deductible, your insurance wouldn't cover it. You may be able to purchase additional coverage by adding your bike as scheduled property on your current policy. Or, you can buy a separate bicycle insurance policy and insure it for its full value, including the value of any custom parts.
