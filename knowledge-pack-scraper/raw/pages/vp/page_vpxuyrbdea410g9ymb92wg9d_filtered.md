Unlike many standard insurance policies that include a range of coverages, standalone insurance refers to a policy that covers a specialized risk or cost that may not otherwise be covered by your existing policies. For example, to get coverage for flood damage to your home, you may need to purchase a separate, standalone flood insurance policy in addition to your standard homeowners insurance policy.

## What is a standalone benefit?

A "standalone benefit," or "standalone insurance," may refer to a separate insurance policy that covers specific risks not covered by your existing policies. Here's how common standalone insurance policies offer coverage you don't already have for your home, life, and health, dental, and vision care.

### What are some types of standalone home insurance?

If your standard homeowners policy doesn't cover a specific peril, or if you want additional coverage for certain items, you might be able to purchase a separate (standalone) policy for that coverage. These policies are usually named after the specific type of coverage they provide. For example, if you live in a flood-prone area, you may want to purchase a standalone flood policy if your standard homeowners policy doesn't cover flood damage or offer an endorsement for flood coverage.

### What is standalone life insurance?

A standalone life insurance policy is a separate life insurance policy that won't affect other life insurance coverage you have. For example, you may decide to purchase a standalone life insurance policy in addition to the life insurance coverage your employer provides through their benefits program.

Before purchasing a standalone policy, learn about [when it makes sense to have multiple life insurance policies](https://www.progressive.com/answers/multiple-life-insurance-policies/), and factor in the costs, features, and implications of each plan with the help of a financial advisor.

### What is standalone dental insurance or vision insurance?

Standalone dental insurance and standalone vision insurance are separate from your overall health insurance plan. They have their own premium and deductible and might cover more than any relevant coverage included in your overall medical plan.

Standalone vision or dental insurance can be obtained privately, through your employer (if offered), or through a government-provided plan. Dental and vision insurance coverage is optional for adults and children.

### What is standalone medical insurance?

Many health insurance policies are sold as standalone policies, but there's also another health-related standalone policy called "critical illness insurance." A standalone critical illness policy is a separate policy from your health insurance and can help cover the costs of care for life-threatening diseases or medical conditions that might extend well beyond what your health insurance covers.

Critical illness insurance only covers qualifying diseases and conditions, as listed on the policy. The ailments covered under specific plans can vary, and premiums are often higher for plans that cover more conditions. A critical illness policy can be purchased privately or as an optional benefit through your employer, if offered.
