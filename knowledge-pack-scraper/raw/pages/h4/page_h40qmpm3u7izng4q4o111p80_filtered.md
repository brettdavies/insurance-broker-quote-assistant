HOW LONG DO DRIVING VIOLATIONS AFFECT CAR INSURANCE RATES?

If you're driving in New York, a major driving offense, like a DUI or reckless driving, could potentially influence your car insurance rates for up to a decade. By contrast, if you've committed a minor offense, expect it to impact your premiums for about three to five years.

### Tips To Find the Best High-Risk Car Insurance in NY

Below, we've shared key tips to help you save money and find the best provider for high-risk car insurance in the Empire State.

1. 1

   Decide What Coverage You Need

   To avoid being swayed by popular opinion or assertive agents, it's best to determine your [car insurance needs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) before comparing providers. This includes considering any necessary add-ons, like rideshare coverage and roadside assistance. Use our car insurance coverage calculator to find out how much auto insurance you need for your situation.
2. 2

   Research Average Costs and Discounts

   Understanding average costs and potential discounts for your profile helps you gauge the value of deals and prioritize insurers. Exploring certified defensive driving courses in your state could save you up to 10% on premiums, offering a practical way to lower costs while enhancing driving skills.
3. 3

   Consider Non-Traditional Coverage Options

   Exploring pay-per-mile insurance and other usage-based programs could significantly reduce costs for low-mileage and safe drivers. For instance, Geico’s telematics program, which monitors driving habits, can potentially decrease your premium by up to 30%, providing substantial savings for careful drivers.
4. 4

   Compare Multiple Providers

   After evaluating all options, it’s crucial to compare at least three providers to understand market offerings. Utilize both independent brokers and online comparison tools, as rates can vary among companies. Ensuring comparisons are consistent across coverage types is vital for accurately assessing how providers compare.

### What To Do if You Get Denied Coverage in New York

Car insurance companies might refuse to insure you if they find your details too risky. But don't worry, you can still get a plan through the Automobile Insurance Plan Service Office (AIPSO).
