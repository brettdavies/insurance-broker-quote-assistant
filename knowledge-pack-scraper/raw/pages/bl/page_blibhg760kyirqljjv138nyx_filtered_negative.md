### State Farm Is Better for Drivers Who Have Caused an Accident
State Farm’s rates are also better for drivers who have caused an accident with an injury. But cheaper options are likely available cheapest. [Erie](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/erie-car-insurance-review/) and [Travelers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/travelers-car-insurance-review/) are going to be better choices, based on our analysis of rates. And [USAA](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usaa-car-insurance-review/) is typically a good choice if you qualify as a military member, veteran or family member.

### Progressive Is Better for Drivers With Poor Credit
State Farm is likely going to be extremely expensive for [drivers with bad credit](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-bad-credit/). Our analysis found that State Farm is 147% more expensive than Progressive for poor credit drivers.
If you have credit issues, [Geico](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/geico-car-insurance-review/) and [Nationwide](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/nationwide-car-insurance-review/) offer much more competitive rates.

### Progressive Is Better for Adding a Teen Driver
Progressive is superior if you’re adding a teen driver to a policy.
Because insurance for teen drivers can pack a wallop to your wallet, it’s smart to [compare car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). We found that [Erie](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/erie-car-insurance-review/) and [Nationwide](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/nationwide-car-insurance-review/) have the most competitive rates for teens.

### Progressive Is Better for Senior Drivers
State Farm and Progressive have similar average rates when it comes to senior drivers, but Progressive has a small edge.
You can likely find cheaper options for [car insurance for seniors](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-seniors/), such as [Nationwide](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/nationwide-car-insurance-review/), [USAA](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usaa-car-insurance-review/) (if you qualify) and [Travelers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/travelers-car-insurance-review/).

## Progressive vs. State Farm: Coverage Types
All major auto insurance companies sell basic coverage types such as liability, collision and comprehensive, and [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage/). But when you want certain add-ons, not all companies are created equally.
When it comes to optional coverage types, Progressive is clearly the better choice vs. State Farm. It can provide add-ons like accident forgiveness and gap insurance that you won’t find with State Farm.
Coverage type  |  Does Progressive offer it?  |  Does State Farm offer it?
---|---|---
[Accident forgiveness](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/) |  Yes |  No
[Decreasing/vanishing deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/diminishing-deductible/) |  Yes |  No
[Gap insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/gap-insurance/) |  Yes |  No
[New car replacement](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/new-car-replacement/) |  No |  No
[Non-owners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/non-owner/) |  Yes |  Yes
[Pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/pay-per-mile/) |  No |  No
[SR-22s](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-sr-22-insurance/) |  Yes |  Yes
[Usage-based insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usage-based-insurance/) |  Yes, Snapshot |  Yes, Drive Safe & Save
![Left Arrow](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-vs-state-farm/)![Right Arrow](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-vs-state-farm/)
Coverage availability can vary by state.

If you’re looking for usage-based insurance, though—which uses your actual driving to help set rates—take caution before choosing Progressive. Your rate could go up if your driving scores poorly, and about 20% of drivers in Progressive’s program get a rate increase. State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save program will not increase your rate.
* * *
## Other Things To Consider
### Collision Repair
We like to look at collision repair grades when comparing auto insurers. Progressive and State Farm are both only about average when it comes to their collision repair processes:
* Progressive: C
* State Farm: C-
Grades are from the [CRASH Network](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/), which performs an annual survey of the opinions of collision repair professionals.
### Digital Functionality
If a robust digital experience is important to you, Progressive is going to be the better choice. In our analysis of mobile apps and website features, Progressive earned 4 stars compared to State Farm’s 4.6 stars. ([Geico](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/geico-car-insurance-review/) was the only 5-star winner in our analysis.)
* * *
## Progressive vs. State Farm Car Insurance: Customer Service and Claims
Both Progressive and State Farm offer 24/7 customer service and allow you to submit and track claims online.
One notable difference is that State Farm has its own agents while Progressive uses a network of more than 38,000 independent agents. While neither system is necessarily better than the other, you’ll find that State Farm agents are very knowledgeable about the company’s products. But independent agents like Progressive’s can help you compare quotes from other insurers to find the best fit.
* * *
## Methodology
We used data from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/) to find average rates from each company. Rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
* $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
* Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
* Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.

To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. **First**, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers’ offers appear on the site. This site does not include all companies or products available within the market. **Second,** we also include links to advertisers’ offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our [partners](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/advertiser-disclosure/) who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
