With the cost of just about everything rising, drivers are looking for new ways to save money everywhere they can.

Progressive’s usage-based insurance is Snapshot and offers a discount of up to 30%. 

Progressive Snapshot is a good choice for low-mileage drivers. If you already have Progressive [car insurance](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/car-insurance/ "car insurance"), Snapshot is worth considering. Read our expert [review of Progressive car insurance](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/progressive-auto-review/) to learn more about the Progressive Snapshot car insurance discount.

After exploring this Progressive Snapshot review, [enter your ZIP code](#mdatop) into our free online quote tool to compare rates with several insurers to find the best car insurance.

The Rundown

* Snapshot can help safe, low-mileage drivers save
* Snapshot customers can save an average of $19 monthly
* Non-Progressive customers can try Snapshot Road Test

## Progressive Snapshot Defined

What is Snapshot by Progressive? Snapshot is Progressive’s usage-based insurance program that encourages safe driving habits by offering cheaper rates. Signing up for Snapshot is free, and you can let Progressive track your driving with either the mobile app or a plug-in device.

You’ll earn a small discount simply for signing up for Snapshot, and Progressive offers savings of up to 30% if you drive well. 

Progressive will track your driving for a period depending on your state and give you a score. Your score will determine how much of a discount you’ll receive on your insurance. Here’s an overview of Progressive Snapshot as well as Snapshot Road Test:

![Progressive Snapshot Review, is it worth it? NEW Road Test Snapshot]()![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg)

Progressive launched Snapshot in 2008 for its customers. Then, in 2020, it created an offshoot, Snapshot Road Test, for potential Progressive customers.

With Snapshot Road Test, you can do a 30-day trial and see if your driving habits would warrant a discount that could make your car insurance more affordable by switching to Progressive. To give you a chance to improve your outcome, you can see your driving history after 15 days.

> Snapshot Road Test is similar to [Root Insurance](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/reviews/root/). But since Root is only for car insurance, the advantage with Snapshot Road Test is you could bundle your policies with Progressive to garner more savings.

There are several other car insurance discounts available as well that you might qualify for. The [best car insurance discounts](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/best-car-insurance-discounts/) available to you will depend on your unique circumstance. 

Unlike many other UBI programs, Progressive imposes surcharges for drivers with less-than-ideal driving habits. According to Progressive’s data, about 20% of Snapshot users see their rates increase after signing up.

## Navigating Progressive Snapshot: Pros, Cons, and Comparisons

Progressive Snapshot insurance offers drivers a unique opportunity to potentially lower their insurance premiums through a usage-based program. The Progressive Snapshot plug-in device or mobile app tracks driving habits such as acceleration, braking, and mileage to determine personalized rates.

One of the notable advantages of Progressive Snapshot is its potential cost savings, as safer driving habits are rewarded with discounts.

However, there are both Progressive Snapshot pros and cons to consider. While some drivers appreciate the ability to potentially reduce their premiums, others may have concerns about privacy and data collection. Additionally, the Progressive Snapshot duration of the Snapshot program and its Progressive Snapshot grading scale may vary, impacting the discount calculation.

> Using tools like the Progressive Snapshot discount calculator can help drivers estimate their potential savings.

Despite these considerations, many customers have left positive Progressive Snapshot customer reviews highlighting the transparency and fairness of the program.

Furthermore, Progressive offers additional incentives such as Progressive law enforcement discount to further attract customers interested in saving on their insurance premiums. When comparing Snapshot with similar programs like Snapshot vs Drivewise car insurance, it’s essential for drivers to weigh the features and benefits to determine which option best suits their needs and preferences.

### Rates With Progressive Snapshot

Does Snapshot actually lower rates? Although it promises a discount of up to 30%, does Snapshot really produce savings? The amount you save with Snapshot depends on how well you drive. You can earn the full 30% discount if you practice safe habits. However, your rates might increase if Progressive decides your driving is not up to par.

Most Progressive Snapshot reviews state they’ve earned at least a small discount, with the average annual savings being about $231. If you’re interested in larger savings with UBI, you should consider looking at other companies. Many of Progressive’s competitors offer larger discounts to safe drivers.

For those interested in Progressive good driver discount, Progressive insurance customer service, Progressive insurance driving monitor, Progressive insurance low mileage discount, or need the Progressive insurance phone number, exploring other options might be beneficial. You can also learn about Progressive’s customer service in our [Progressive insurance review](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/reviews/progressive/ "Progressive insurance").

### Who Is Eligible for Progressive Snapshot

To be eligible for the Progressive auto insurance Snapshot discount, you must be a Progressive customer and live in a state where the program is available. The program is currently available in most states, but there are a few exceptions. You also need to have a car that was manufactured in 1996 or later and has an OBD-II port.

One thing to keep in mind is that Snapshot is a voluntary program. You can choose to enroll at any time, but you’re not required to do so. If you do enroll, you’ll need to keep the telematics device plugged in for the duration of the program to receive your discount. Additionally, remember that the Progressive auto insurance mobile app can make managing your policy and participating in programs like Snapshot easier.

If you’re looking for even more savings, consider Progressive auto insurance discounts and explore options such as the Progressive car tracker and Progressive coverage for rental cars.

## Who Should Use Progressive Snapshot

The people who benefit most from Snapshot are those who regularly practice safe driving habits. If you’re prone to speeding, putting a lot of miles on your car, or getting distracted by your phone, you should probably skip Snapshot.

It’s also a good idea for low-mileage drivers. Snapshot isn’t exactly a [mileage-based car insurance plan](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/mileage-based-auto-insurance/), but it does reward drivers who put fewer miles on their cars.

Drivers in New York should also carefully consider their options before signing up for Snapshot. According to state law, New Yorkers have to go through the initial driving evaluation every 36 months to stay in the program.

Snapshot is not available in California, and the participation discount isn’t available in Hawaii and New York. Snapshot Road Test is only available in 33 states.

If you’re interested in Snapshot, you should compare your options before signing up. Progressive is not the only company with a usage-based program, and many of its competitors offer better savings and features.

## How Progressive Snapshot Works

How does Progressive Snapshot work? When you sign up for Snapshot, you’ll have to decide between the mobile app and a plug-in device to track your driving. Each has its benefits and disadvantages, but many drivers opt for the mobile app for convenience.

If you choose the mobile app, you’ll need to make sure every driver listed on your policy participates in the program. The app does an excellent job of determining who is driving, but you can correct it if it makes a mistake.

However, one should consider the Progressive insurance pros and cons to make an informed decision. The plug-in device allows you more freedom to decide who or what is being monitored. For example, if an unlisted driver plans to borrow your car, simply unplug the device, and they won’t be tracked. You can also plug your device into a different vehicle so you can track your driving no matter what you drive.

Once you make your choice on whether to opt for Progressive Snapshot’s app or plug-in-device, you can follow the same procedure to get started. Here are details of the steps to take for the process:

**Progressive Snapshot Setup Steps**

| Step # | Action | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Join the program | You can join Snapshot on the Progressive website, through the app, or with help from a representative. |
| 2 | Choose your device | If you want to use the mobile app, download it on your phone. If you choose the plug-in, Progressive will mail it to you. Once you get it, plug it into your vehicle's OBD port. |
| 3 | Collect your participation discount | New customers using the mobile app should register within 45 days to receive their 5% discount. If you have the plug-in device, you’ll get your discount either after the first 45 days or after collecting 30 days' worth of data. |
| 4 | Start driving | Snapshot needs to collect driving data before it can offer you a discount. You can review your results either on the app or the website. |
| 5 | Get your savings | Once Progressive has enough data, you’ll receive your score and see how much of a discount you earned. Your performance discount replaces the participation savings, and your score will stay the same unless Progressive needs more. |
| 6 | End your tracking | After Progressive gives you a score, you no longer need to track your driving. You can delete the app or mail the device back. |

Choosing the right device for you depends on your lifestyle. The plug-in device might be right for you if you live in a household with [multiple owners of a vehicle](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/answers/multiple-owner-vehicle-who-is-required-to-carry-insurance/ "Multiple owner vehicle who is required to carry insurance"). Since it allows you to remove the device whenever you’re not driving, it gives you better control over the data Progressive collects.

### How Snapshot Knows Who’s Driving

If you use the plug-in device, Progressive will track driving habits as long as it’s in the OBD port. That’s why removing the device when you’re not driving is essential to keeping your rates from being affected by someone else’s bad habits.

If you decide the mobile app is right for you, you’ll need to enroll every driver in your policy. You might also have to indicate which car your drive most often, depending on your state. 

> Although Progressive promises a high level of accuracy when detecting who is behind the wheel, the Snapshot app occasionally makes mistakes. If you notice an error after a drive, you can correct it in the app.

In some states, Progressive tracks driving data by phone. In others, it creates an average score using every driver on the account.

## Driving Habits Progressive Snapshot Monitors

When you sign up for Progressive Snapshot,  here are the following driving behaviors that the program assesses to determine the amount of your savings:

* **Time of Day:** The safest time to drive is when the sun is up. If you frequently drive between midnight and 6 a.m., you probably won’t save very much with Snapshot.
* **Mileage:** Low-mileage drivers will save more with Snapshot than those who drive more frequently. High-mileage drivers are considered riskier simply because they spend more time on the road, so they should avoid usage-based insurance programs.
* **Braking and Accelerating:** When you sign up for Snapshot, you should avoid quick accelerations and hard braking as much as possible.
* **Speeding:** Drivers who stick to posted speed limits will see higher Snapshot scores than those who frequently speed.
* **Distracted Driving:** Snapshot tracks cell phone use if you sign up for the mobile app. If you text or make phone calls while you drive, your Snapshot score will suffer.

Snapshot looks at a variety of driving habits to determine your overall score. If you struggle to avoid any of the above behaviors, you should probably skip signing up for Snapshot. Learn more about [how insurance companies determine rates](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/how-does-the-insurance-company-determine-my-premium/).

While other companies do not penalize bad driving behaviors, you might see your rates increase with Snapshot.

You should also be aware that the Snapshot app reserves the right to share your data with third parties for several reasons. They include to service your insurance policy, as support for insurance rates, to detect fraud, to help resolve claims, as permitted to assist law enforcement investigations, and for marketing purposes.

You’ll need to agree to this data collection before using the Snapshot app. However, you can skip much of the data collection and sharing by opting for the plug-in device.

## If Snapshot Is Worth It

The only way to get the most from Progressive’s Snapshot discount is to practice safe driving habits. You should also confirm you drive less than 10,000 miles per year and don’t mind being monitored before you sign up.

Progressive Snapshot can be very beneficial for young drivers who are also safe drivers. While traditional car insurance rates are usually high for young drivers, Progressive ranks No. 1 for cheapest car insurance for 21-year-old drivers, thanks to its safe driver discounts.

Dani Best
**Licensed Insurance Producer**

For drivers who don’t practice the safest habits, it might be better to skip Snapshot, especially since you might actually pay higher rates.

## **Case Studies: Progressive Snapshot Review**

When it comes to car insurance, usage-based insurance is a relatively new concept. Its newness is reflected in the following examples of drivers trying out Progressive Snapshot.

* **Case Study #1 – Sarah’s Positive Experience:** Sarah, a cautious driver, decided to try the [Progressive Snapshot car insurance discount](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/progressive-snapshot-review/) to potentially lower her rate. She found it accurately tracked her safe driving habits, including maintaining a steady speed and avoiding sudden braking. She received a significant discount on her insurance rate.
* **Case Study #2 – John’s Frustrations with Accuracy:** John, an occasional aggressive driver (which is among the [different types of bad drivers](https://www.usinsuranceagents.com/types-of-bad-drivers/)), enrolled in Progressive Snapshot but had challenges with some false events, such as hard braking instances. This led to an inaccurate assessment and limited his discount. John considered exploring programs with better tracking.
* **Case Study #3 – Emily’s Privacy Concerns:** Emily was initially intrigued by Progressive Snapshot, but hesitated to participate due to privacy concerns. She decided to explore alternative insurance options that offered similar benefits without compromising privacy. She opted for a different usage-based insurance program that allowed her to maintain more control.
* **Case Study #4 – Mark’s Inconsistent Results:** Mark, an urban driver with traffic congestion, signed up for Progressive Snapshot in hopes of reducing his insurance cost. However, Snapshot struggled to distinguish between aggressive maneuvers caused by external factors, such as sudden lane changes due to heavy traffic. Mark decided to look for insurers with more accurate tracking.
* **Case Study #5 – Lisa’s Alternative Approach:** Lisa was intrigued by the concept of usage-based insurance and the cost savings potential, but she didn’t want to commit to a specific program. She opted for an alternative solution: a smartphone app that tracked her driving behavior. It provided similar benefits to Progressive Snapshot, but without the need for a physical device.

As you can see, thanks to a highly competitive insurance market, customers have several options to customize their car insurance — whether they stick with Progressive or choose to try another company.
