## More insight into our methodology

### Coverage & Benefits

The terms and requirements behind an SR-22, including the costs, how long it needs to stay in effect, and why it must be a part of your policy, will vary from state to state. If you fall into the high-risk category, some companies may be cheaper than others when it comes to insuring you, though the general rule is that premiums usually do go up. The first thing to do is contact your current insurance agent for more SR-22 information, and to help determine the SR-22 and liability insurance requirements in your state. Your insurance agent can assist you in processing a change in your insurance, if this should be necessary, as well as your SR-22 certificate, often through an insurance provider in your area. If you live in Florida or Virginia, you will probably need to request an FR-44, instead of an SR-22.

---

### Pricing & Discounts

The filing of the certificate will be handled differently from state to state, and penalty and filing fees will vary as will the certificate. Since all states have different financial responsibility laws, the SR-22 will look very different in Florida (where it is called an FR-44) than it would in Nebraska or another state. Generally, the cost of filing an SR-22 is between $15-$35, though the form is fairly common, which is why many insurance companies offer the certificate. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the different state laws and variables that can affect your premium and call your car insurance company for a quote. You may also be able to get your SR-22 insurance quote online.

When choosing a car insurance company to file your SR-22, keep the coverage amount in mind. For a full listing of the state laws with regards to the SR-22, you can visit your state DMV or insurance website, which will also detail how much insurance you must have in order to get the certificate in your particular state.Remember to verify the coverage length specifications, as most states require that your certificate remain active for at least three years, typically beginning on the first day that the SR-22 certificate is issued by the insurance company, though some states can require as much as 5 years. The policy that's in effect with the certificate must meet all minimum liability requirements with the state, including personal and property liability. Every state has their own liability requirements, sothis will vary significantly, based on the laws of your individual state.

Other things to consider are the penalties and fees. Certain fees may be assessed in conjunction with writing the SR-22 certificate: penalty fees can reach as high as $250 in some states while reinstatement fees can be $55 or even higher, in addition to any court fees, as well as the cost of the SR-22 car insurance itself. As with most elements of car insurance, fees will vary by state, but the DMV will be able to tell you exactly how much fees will be in order to get the SR-22 in place. Finally, if you a high-risk driver and are planning to move to another state, in order to get a driver’s license in your new home, you must first satisfy the state requirements where your suspension occurred, which means having an SR-22 on record. Most states in the country report suspensions and other issues on a national computer system connected to the DMV, which therefore cannot issue a new license if you have been suspended in another state without first getting the SR-22 and having it reported to the DMV. This ensures that your driving privileges are suspended until you can prove financial responsibility. For some states, this is not required, and more so if the state you are moving to does not require an SR-22 (like Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico or Oklahoma). We recommend you verify the laws in the state you are both transferring from and to.

### Financial Strength

Many people shop for car insurance based on the amount of coverage they want and the cost of the premium they will pay. Another important element to consider when shopping around are the financial strength ratings of a car insurance company. Knowing the solvency of your car insurance company is vital because it provides a good measure for determining whether they'll be able to meet their obligations on your policy. It is important to understand your company's financial performance not only because it reflects their resources and history but also because it is a testimony to their sound business policies. There are several industry-trusted sources that offer independent reviews or ratings for insurance companies, including Moody's and AM Best, both of whom offer a financial rating and an issuer strength rating.

Rating agencies consider a range of factors when determining a company’s financial strength and stability and issuing a grade. Some of the factors that these rating companies take into account include the type of company (whether they underwrite their own policies, function as subsidiaries to other underwriters, or are simply a marketplace that offers quotes from various entities). It is also important to consider the company's marketshare, especially as it relates to their time in business.

---

### Customer Experience

Filing any type of insurance claim is universally acknowledged as being a complicated and frustrating process. Therefore, it is extremely important to choose an insurance company that provides high-quality customer service. Since car insurance is a major expense for many people, their insurance company should be committed to flexible and positive consumer experiences. In order to independently evaluate customer experience, we looked at several factors. First of all, we considered the 2017 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data on complaint ratios. The NAIC not only compiles complaints by company but also assigns them a score in relation to the rest of the car insurance industry. We also looked at the company's BBB rating and complaints and the TrustPilot score.

Depending on how the insurance company structures their customer service, submitting claims can be made immeasurably harder or easier. Many, if not all, insurance websites have a dedicated customer service page, which makes it easier to compare and contrast their various services. Some even include 24/7 claim reporting and live chat support. You can always file a claim by phone, but the most popular options nowadays is to file via an online portal. These portals also allow customers to purchase additional coverage if they need it. Besides, almost every car insurance company offers instant online quotes, which makes shopping around simple. There are also other customer service perks to consider, such as roadside assistance, towing/repairs and much more. We recommend that you research all these factors so that you can find the car insurance company that is going to meet all your needs.

## Helpful information about SR-22 Insurance

SR-22 Insurance or Certificate of Financial Responsibility is not exactly an insurance policy, despite the common misconception, but rather a form that is filed with the state on behalf of people who have had traffic violations resulting in a suspended license. These drivers are considered high-risk and must follow state guidelines to have their driving privileges reinstated.

There are several reasons for the state to require a driver to file an SR-22 form. Violations such as at-fault accidents, driving without car insurance, having a DUI/DWI, or driving recklessly are all traffic offenses that may require filing said form to show that the driver is financially responsible should he or she be involved in another traffic accident or incident.

Drivers ordered to file an SR-22 form must do so through their insurance agent, since they are required to have the minimum personal and property liability coverage as per their state's requirements. If coverage lapses, the insurance company is then legally required to inform the state, and the individual’s driver’s license can be suspended or even fully revoked.

Since not all insurance companies are licensed to issue the SR-22 form or willing to issue a policy to high-risk drivers, finding the right insurer can take longer than purchasing conventional auto insurance. Furthermore, the limits required vary by state. In most cases, switching to a high-risk car insurance policy will significantly alter the customer's costs, though each company may still be able to offer some additional perks, discounts, or benefits. Finally, just as with any other car insurance policy, customer service, price, and how financially solid the insurance company is, must also be taken into account.

## FAQs about SR-22 Insurance

---

#### Is SR-22 a type of car insurance?

An SR-22 is not an insurance policy in and of itself, but rather proof of insurance. More specifically, an SR-22 is a document of financial responsibility required by the state and provided by your auto insurance company that verifies you have auto insurance liability coverage. You will only be required to get an SR-22 if you have been deemed a high-risk driver, which can happen for certain driving-related violations like DIU convictions, reckless driving, or accidents caused by uninsured drivers. When you are designated a high-risk driver, your driver license will typically be suspended, and either the court or your state DMV will send you a notice requiring you to get an SR-22.

---

#### How much does an SR-22 cost?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as prices vary from state to state and for each person seeking an SR-22. Also, insurance quotes vary amongst providers. Generally, the cost of filing fee depends on how much your state charges to file the document. In most states, insurance providers charge between $15 to $35 fee for filing and renewing your SR-22. The filing fee is a one time charge that you will need to pay when the insurance company files the SR-22. You will not have to continue to pay the filing fee for each renewal. The only time you will have to pay more is if you allow your policy to lapse.

---

#### Will my insurance rates go up with an SR-22?

Not all providers will agree to ensure a high-risk driver, but those that do, will generally increase your premiums. SR-22 insurance requirements are directly related to violations and incidents that are almost guaranteed to increase your rates. The cost of remaining insured as a high-risk driver varies, depending on factors such as your age, your driving record, and your provider. In order to lower your costs, it’s important to ask the potential insurance company about discounts for high-risk drivers. Some discounts include a senior citizen discount, a good student discount, and even a multiple policy discount if you insure your home and vehicles with one company. Not everyone that files for SR-22 reports higher insurance premiums. But the only way to know how exactly how much you will pay is to get an insurance quote from a provider.

---

#### Will I have to pay my insurance up front with as SR-22?

Because an SR-22 is proof of current and future car insurance, you may not be able to pay your auto insurance premium in monthly payments. Instead, you may be required to purchase each policy term up front. In order for them to guarantee the coverage, you have to be able to pay them for the entire amount of the premium. There may be some insurance companies out there that you can find that may be willing to take installment payments, but they are rare.

---

#### How long will I need an SR-22?

How long you will need an SR-22 will vary from state. However, SR-22’s are commonly required for a minimum of three years. In that time, continuous coverage must be maintained. Your insurance company may offer an automatic renewal that ensures your document remains active. If there is an insurance lapse or cancellation, your car insurance company is legally obligated to notify the DMV and your license will be suspended. Also, if you commit another violation or are involved in another instance that may require an SR-22 filing within the initial mandated time period, you may be required to file your SR-22 for longer. It’s your responsibility to keep the SR-22 up to date, so you need to check with the potential insurance provider to see what its rules are regarding this documentation.

---

#### Will my car insurance be canceled after a DUI?

DUIs do not always result in policy cancellations. If you have been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you will face challenges with your car insurance. Since driving under the influence is so dangerous, car insurance companies are reluctant to provide auto insurance to people convicted of operating a vehicle DUIs. If an accident is caused by drunk driving, the claim may be paid by the insurance company, or it may be partially denied. In some cases, the car insurance company will pay for any damage the drunk driver causes to another person but not the insured vehicle. In other cases, the insurance company will pay the claim in its entirety and then cancel the insurance policy. Sometimes an increase in the policy premium is the only effect on the insurance.

---

#### How do I get a non-owner SR-22 insurance?

You may need to purchase a non-owner SR22 certificate when you need to reinstate your driver’s license, but do not own a vehicle. A non-owner SR22 is an endorsement to a non-owner insurance policy. To get a quote for non-owner insurance, and to purchase coverage, you’ll need to provide some basic personal information, along with your driver’s license number, and a payment method (such as credit card). Though most major auto insurance companies offer non-owner policies, none that we’ve found offer online quotes for these, relying on agents. The best choice for non-owner auto insurance will partially depend on your driving history and personal information, as these are the principal factors which will help determine your premium. In addition, some insurers do not provide non-owner insurance in certain states, so some companies may not be an option where you live. To ensure you pay the cheapest rate, we recommend calling multiple insurers and comparing at least three to four quotes before you make a purchase.

---

#### What is an FR-44?

The FR-44 is similar to an SR-22 financial responsibility certificate. If you are convicted of a DUI or DWI in Florida or Virginia, you might be required to file an FR-44 to reinstate your license with the DMV. Unlike a more general SR-22, an FR-44 is specific to DIU of DWI convictions. If you lose your license as a result of this violation, your insurance company must file an FR-44 on your behalf to prove to your state that you are covered by increased liability insurance. In addition, an FR-44 requires your liability coverage limits to be significantly higher than the state minimum. With a FR-44 your liability limits must be equal to or greater than $50,000 per person / $100,000 per accident/ $40,000 property damage. In Florida, an FR-44 is officially called a Florida Uniform Financial Responsibility Certificate, while in Virginia it is simply referred to as an FR-44 form.
