The terms and requirements behind an SR-22, including the costs, how long it needs to stay in effect, and why it must be a part of your policy, will vary from state to state. If you fall into the high-risk category, some companies may be cheaper than others when it comes to insuring you, though the general rule is that premiums usually do go up. The first thing to do is contact your current insurance agent for more SR-22 information, and to help determine the SR-22 and liability insurance requirements in your state. Your insurance agent can assist you in processing a change in your insurance, if this should be necessary, as well as your SR-22 certificate, often through an insurance provider in your area. If you live in Florida or Virginia, you will probably need to request an FR-44, instead of an SR-22.
* * *
The filing of the certificate will be handled differently from state to state, and penalty and filing fees will vary as will the certificate. Since all states have different financial responsibility laws, the SR-22 will look very different in Florida (where it is called an FR-44) than it would in Nebraska or another state. Generally, the cost of filing an SR-22 is between $15-$35, though the form is fairly common, which is why many insurance companies offer the certificate. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the different state laws and variables that can affect your premium and call your car insurance company for a quote. You may also be able to get your SR-22 insurance quote online.
When choosing a car insurance company to file your SR-22, keep the coverage amount in mind. For a full listing of the state laws with regards to the SR-22, you can visit your state DMV or insurance website, which will also detail how much insurance you must have in order to get the certificate in your particular state.Remember to verify the coverage length specifications, as most states require that your certificate remain active for at least three years, typically beginning on the first day that the SR-22 certificate is issued by the insurance company, though some states can require as much as 5 years. The policy that's in effect with the certificate must meet all minimum liability requirements with the state, including personal and property liability. Every state has their own liability requirements, sothis will vary significantly, based on the laws of your individual state.
Other things to consider are the penalties and fees. Certain fees may be assessed in conjunction with writing the SR-22 certificate: penalty fees can reach as high as $250 in some states while reinstatement fees can be $55 or even higher, in addition to any court fees, as well as the cost of the SR-22 car insurance itself. As with most elements of car insurance, fees will vary by state, but the DMV will be able to tell you exactly how much fees will be in order to get the SR-22 in place. Finally, if you a high-risk driver and are planning to move to another state, in order to get a driver’s license in your new home, you must first satisfy the state requirements where your suspension occurred, which means having an SR-22 on record. Most states in the country report suspensions and other issues on a national computer system connected to the DMV, which therefore cannot issue a new license if you have been suspended in another state without first getting the SR-22 and having it reported to the DMV. This ensures that your driving privileges are suspended until you can prove financial responsibility. For some states, this is not required, and more so if the state you are moving to does not require an SR-22 (like Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico or Oklahoma). We recommend you verify the laws in the state you are both transferring from and to.
* * *
Many people shop for car insurance based on the amount of coverage they want and the cost of the premium they will pay. Another important element to consider when shopping around are the financial strength ratings of a car insurance company. Knowing the solvency of your car insurance company is vital because it provides a good measure for determining whether they'll be able to meet their obligations on your policy. It is important to understand your company's financial performance not only because it reflects their resources and history but also because it is a testimony to their sound business policies. There are several industry-trusted sources that offer independent reviews or ratings for insurance companies, including Moody's and AM Best, both of whom offer a financial rating and an issuer strength rating.
Rating agencies consider a range of factors when determining a company’s financial strength and stability and issuing a grade. Some of the factors that these rating companies take into account include the type of company (whether they underwrite their own policies, function as subsidiaries to other underwriters, or are simply a marketplace that offers quotes from various entities). It is also important to consider the company's marketshare, especially as it relates to their time in business.
* * *
Filing any type of insurance claim is universally acknowledged as being a complicated and frustrating process. Therefore, it is extremely important to choose an insurance company that provides high-quality customer service. Since car insurance is a major expense for many people, their insurance company should be committed to flexible and positive consumer experiences. In order to independently evaluate customer experience, we looked at several factors. First of all, we considered the 2017 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data on complaint ratios. The NAIC not only compiles complaints by company but also assigns them a score in relation to the rest of the car insurance industry. We also looked at the company's BBB rating and complaints and the TrustPilot score.
Depending on how the insurance company structures their customer service, submitting claims can be made immeasurably harder or easier. Many, if not all, insurance websites have a dedicated customer service page, which makes it easier to compare and contrast their various services. Some even include 24/7 claim reporting and live chat support. You can always file a claim by phone, but the most popular options nowadays is to file via an online portal. These portals also allow customers to purchase additional coverage if they need it. Besides, almost every car insurance company offers instant online quotes, which makes shopping around simple. There are also other customer service perks to consider, such as roadside assistance, towing/repairs and much more. We recommend that you research all these factors so that you can find the car insurance company that is going to meet all your needs.
SR-22 Insurance or Certificate of Financial Responsibility is not exactly an insurance policy, despite the common misconception, but rather a form that is filed with the state on behalf of people who have had traffic violations resulting in a suspended license. These drivers are considered high-risk and must follow state guidelines to have their driving privileges reinstated.
Drivers ordered to file an SR-22 form must do so through their insurance agent, since they are required to have the minimum personal and property liability coverage as per their state's requirements. If coverage lapses, the insurance company is then legally required to inform the state, and the individual’s driver’s license can be suspended or even fully revoked.
Since not all insurance companies are licensed to issue the SR-22 form or willing to issue a policy to high-risk drivers, finding the right insurer can take longer than purchasing conventional auto insurance. Furthermore, the limits required vary by state. In most cases, switching to a high-risk car insurance policy will significantly alter the customer's costs, though each company may still be able to offer some additional perks, discounts, or benefits. Finally, just as with any other car insurance policy, customer service, price, and how financially solid the insurance company is, must also be taken into account.
