## How much does marketplace health insurance cost per month?

[Marketplace health insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/health/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace) plans, sometimes referred to as Obamacare plans or ACA plans, can be purchased by individuals and families on HealthCare.gov and state health insurance marketplaces.

Depending on a variety of factors, premiums can range from $0 to over $1,000 per month.

For example, here are average 2025 premiums for the lowest-cost Silver plans available to three different combinations of age, family size and income as a percent of the federal poverty line (FPL), before any cost reductions, according to CMS   [1]

[Premium tax credits](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/premium-tax-credit) can significantly reduce what you pay for premiums, even if your income is well above the federal poverty line. For example, here’s what the three premiums above become after premium tax credits are applied   [1]

In general, people with household income between 100% and 400% of the FPL can be eligible for premium tax credits. For an individual in the contiguous U.S., that’s between $15,650 and $62,600 per year in 2025   [2]

 . For a family of four in the contiguous United States, the range between 100% and 400% of the FPL would be $32,150 to $128,600 per year.

The largest subsidies go to people with the lowest income, then they go down on a sliding scale for those who qualify with higher income levels

## What are the out-of-pocket costs for Obamacare plans?

Marketplace health insurance plans can have several kinds of [out-of-pocket costs](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/health/coinsurance-vs-copay):

* Deductible: Before your plan starts to pay for its portion of most covered services and prescription drugs, you might need to spend a certain amount out of pocket, such as $2,400 for an individual or $4,800 for a family.
* Copay: You might owe a flat amount each time you get a service, such as $50 for visiting a doctor’s office or $10 for filling a prescription.
* Coinsurance: You might owe a percent of the cost of a service, such as 25% of the cost of a prescription drug or 40% of an emergency room bill.

Plans also have an [out-of-pocket maximum](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/health/whats-difference-deductible-pocket-maximum), which puts a cap on what you have to spend for the year in copays, coinsurance and/or deductibles. After you reach the out-of-pocket maximum, you don’t owe additional out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year, so a lower maximum is better.

Generally speaking, plans with higher premiums tend to have lower out-of-pocket costs. Plans with lower premiums often have higher out-of-pocket costs.

### Cost-sharing reductions

If you qualify for the premium tax credit and have household income up to 250% of the FPL, you can qualify for cost-sharing reductions

 . Cost-sharing reductions shrink or eliminate copays, coinsurance, deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket costs — but only for Silver plans.

The size of the cost-sharing reductions depends on your income

 :

| Household income | Cost-sharing reductions |
| --- | --- |
| 100% up to 150% of the FPL | Largest |
| Greater than 150% up to 200% of the FPL | Medium |
| Greater than 200% up to 250% of the FPL | Smallest |

## Why are Silver plans the most affordable?

Marketplace health insurance plans can come in four metal levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum, each with different levels of coverage. For example, a Silver plan covers about 70% of members’ medical costs, so you’d be responsible for the other 30% out of pocket

Marketplace health insurance plans by tier

| Metal tier | Costs covered by plan | Deductible level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 60%. | High. |
| Silver | 70%. | Medium. |
| Gold | 80%. | Low. |
| Platinum | 90%. | Low. |

Silver plans are often the most affordable because they’re potentially eligible for more subsidies than any other plan type. Silver plans can end up covering more and costing less than other plans types if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions — and most marketplace enrollees do.
