###  [Your Business Runs on Trust. E&O Protects It.](https://www.ohanainsured.com/your-business-runs-on-trust-e-o-protects-it)
By Curtis Rock • June 16, 2025
Your Business Runs on Trust. E&O Protects It. If you run a business where people rely on your advice, your service, or your expertise — then you need to understand what Errors & Omissions insurance (E\&O) does and why it’s critical to protecting your reputation and your bottom line. Even when you do everything right, misunderstandings happen. Details get missed. And if that mistake (or even a *perceived* mistake) causes a client to lose money, you could be held financially responsible. That’s where E\&O insurance steps in. Why Insurance Agencies Carry It Let’s start with us. At Ohana Insurance Group, we carry E&O coverage ourselves — and for good reason. If one of our agents fails to include key coverage, miscommunicates a deductible, or a client misunderstands their policy, that could lead to a lawsuit or claim. E&O insurance helps pay for legal defense, settlements, and other costs associated with that kind of professional liability. It doesn’t matter if the mistake was unintentional or if the client misunderstood — you still have to defend your business. Who Else Needs E&O Coverage? E&O coverage isn’t just for insurance agencies. It’s essential protection for any service-based or professional business that could be blamed for financial loss. Here are just a few examples: Accountants & Bookkeepers A simple error in tax filings could lead to penalties and lawsuits. E\&O helps cover those legal claims. Business Consultants Your advice has real financial impact. If a client claims your strategy caused losses, E&O can protect you. Real Estate Professionals Misrepresenting property features or failing to disclose information can result in expensive legal disputes. IT & Tech Professionals If your software fails, or your work leads to data loss or downtime, E\&O covers claims related to service failure or negligence. What Does E&O Actually Cover? * Mistakes or oversights in your professional work * Missed deadlines or failure to deliver agreed-upon services * Legal defense costs, judgments, and settlements * Claims of negligence, misrepresentation, or bad advice It’s important to note: E&O doesn’t cover physical injuries, property damage, or intentional misconduct. Those exposures are handled under different policies (like general liability or cyber coverage). Why It’s Smart Business You don’t have to be wrong to get sued. And defending your business — even from a claim with no merit — costs time, money, and stress. Errors & Omissions insurance protects your reputation, your finances, and your ability to keep working. It's a smart layer of protection for businesses that run on relationships, responsibility, and trust. At Ohana Insurance Group, we help business owners choose the right E\&O coverage for their industry — and explain it in plain language. Want to know if your business needs E&O insurance? Let’s talk. 📞 361-334-0539 🌐 [www.ohanainsured.com](http://www.ohanainsured.com) 📍 Corpus Christi | Houston
