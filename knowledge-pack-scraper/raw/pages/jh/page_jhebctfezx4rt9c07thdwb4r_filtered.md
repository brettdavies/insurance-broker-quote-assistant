### 1) Report the claim

Have your policy number, date/time, location, dashcam clips (if any), and the other party’s details ready. If the vehicle isn’t drivable, request a tow and confirm storage location to avoid unnecessary storage charges.

### 2) Photos, video & documentation

Take images from multiple angles, plus VIN and odometer. For hail, photograph panels under consistent lighting (hood, roof, trunk) and include a wide-angle shot of the entire car. Upload the police report or incident number when available.

### 3) Inspection & estimates

Progressive may use virtual inspection or send an appraiser. You may select your preferred shop; ask how supplements are handled and whether paintless dent repair (PDR) is appropriate for hail. Keep the shop, you, and the adjuster in one email thread.

### 4) Coverage confirmation

Verify deductibles, rental reimbursement limits, and endorsements (glass, OEM parts, custom equipment). For potential totals, ask about valuation method and how taxes/title fees are handled on settlements in Texas.

### 5) Settlement & payout

Payments can go to you, the shop, or a lienholder. Keep receipts for towing, storage, and emergency transport. For injury claims, organize medical records and stay in regular contact with your adjuster.

### 6) Post-claim review

After repairs or settlement, we can review your policy, shop multi-carrier options for your ZIP, and adjust deductibles or endorsements before renewal to reflect your current risk and budget.
