## A path to prosperity through homeownership

Owning a home is more than just having a place to live — it's a powerful way to build wealth and create a lasting legacy. We're committed to helping first-generation homeowners unlock the full potential of their homes.

Millennials today are wealthier than previous generations at their age; however, the wealth gap between renters and homeowners has widened. Real estate is the biggest driver of this wealth increase, with a home representing almost a third of household wealth in the U.S., second to retirement savings [according to Census 2022](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p70br-202.pdf).

Many first-time home buyers are unaware of how to maximize their homeownership benefits. To enhance their financial education, we're equipping homeowners with resources to help expand knowledge, build equity in their home, maximize property value, and secure their investment for the future.

### In 2024, we contributed over $7M

With more than $3 million of the total amount going toward helping more families build wealth by realizing the full value of their homes.
