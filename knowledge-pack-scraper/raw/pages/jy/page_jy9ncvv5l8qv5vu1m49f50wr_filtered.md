## Average car insurance cost trends in Illinois

Drivers in Illinois have seen a 42.9% increase in [auto insurance](/car-insurance/) rates from January 2019 to September 2024, according to [S&P Global’s data.](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/us-private-auto-rate-increases-dip-into-single-digits-in-2024)

This may explain why drivers pay a monthly average of $191.19 for state-mandated minimum coverage. Compare that to the national average for minimum coverage which is currently $271.73.

In Illinois, drivers have to carry these minimum levels of coverage:

* $20,000 for damage to property of another person.

While reviewing car insurance quotes, it’s important to decide if you’re looking for just [cheap car insurance](/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) or if you’re more focused on policies that provide extra protection through higher limits. Everyone’s financial and driving situations are different, which is why comparison shopping is so useful. Comparing quotes from several car insurance providers will help you determine your own cost of car insurance.

Methodology

Jerry's editorial team analyzed Jerry customer quotes to find the median full coverage quote, by ZIP code. We looked at customers driving popular vehicles, including the Ford-150, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, RAM 1500, Toyota Camry and Toyota RAV4 . We also used the following base driver profile:

* 35-45 years old.
* Clean driving record.
* $50,000 in bodily injury liability, per person.
* $100,000 in bodily injury liability, per accident.
* $1,000 deductible for comprehensive and collision insurance.

## Factors affecting car insurance rates in Illinois

Here are a few important reasons that drivers in Illinois pay higher-than-average insurance premiums.

* **Chicago’s size.** Because much of Illinois’s population is concentrated in and around Chicago, many in the state are paying elevated rates. Urban areas come with plenty of risks, including more cars and pedestrians on the street and a naturally higher crime rate. However, those living outside of Chicago are likely to see substantially lower rates.
* **Weather risks.** Longtime Illinois residents are pros at navigating snow and ice in the winter, but insurers view those as unsafe driving conditions that could lead to an accident. The state also sees its fair share of hail damage, which can total a car within minutes. Overall, though, Illinois’s weather is relatively mild compared to coastal states, so insurers may not make frequent climate-related increases for drivers there.
* **Car-theft rates.** In 2023, Illinois was No. 5 in the country for the highest number of car thefts, according to the [National Insurance Crime Bureau](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/vehicle-thefts-surge-nationwide-2023). The state has since fallen off the list, but even a temporary spike in car-related crime can cause rates to rise quickly and fall slowly.
* **Uninsured drivers.** Though a 15% uninsured-motorist rate doesn’t put Illinois in the top 10, it’s still likely an important factor for car insurance companies. When an uninsured driver hits a driver with robust coverage, the covered driver’s insurer foots the bill, and that means drivers are usually paying higher rates to make up for the risk.
