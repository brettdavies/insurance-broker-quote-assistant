These regulations primarily apply to new construction and major renovations in hurricane-prone regions.

Below, you will find answers to additional frequently asked questions related to hurricane shutter requirements in Florida.

## When Are Hurricane Shutters Required by Florida Building Codes?

Florida’s building codes require homes in designated wind-borne debris regions to have storm protection, such as [hurricane shutters](https://www.stormsmart.com/aluminum-shutters/) or impact-resistant windows. These areas include:

* **Coastal regions** and high-risk zones where wind speeds exceed 140 mph
* New construction homes built after 2001
* Homes undergoing major renovations or window replacements

If you live in an older home, you may not be legally required to install hurricane shutters, but doing so can provide essential protection during storms.

## Do Insurance Companies Require Hurricane Shutters?

While not legally mandated, some home insurance providers in Florida require storm protection to qualify for coverage or offer discounts for homes equipped with approved shutters. Installing hurricane shutters can help:

* **Lower insurance premiums** by reducing storm damage risk
* **Ensure policy compliance** in areas with strict insurer requirements
* **Improve safety and property value** by adding storm-resistant features

Homeowners should check with their insurance provider to determine specific requirements.

## What Are the Benefits of Installing Hurricane Shutters?

Even if not required by law, hurricane shutters offer several advantages:

* **Storm Protection** – Prevents window and door damage from high winds and debris
* **Increased Security** – Provides an extra layer of protection against break-ins
* **Energy Efficiency** – Some shutters help reduce heat and UV exposure, lowering cooling costs
* **Insurance Savings** – May qualify homeowners for wind mitigation discounts

Given Florida’s high hurricane risk, installing shutters is a proactive step to protect your home and reduce potential storm damage costs.
