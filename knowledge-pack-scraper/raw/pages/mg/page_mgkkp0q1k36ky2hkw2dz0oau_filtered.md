# State Farm® Stands in Defense of Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion

Today, State Farm joined over 200 other companies and industry associations in a national business-led [effort](https://www.hrc.org/blog/over-200-businesses-file-amicus-brief-in-support-of-lgbtq-workers) to support equal employment opportunities for all people.

Later this year, the U.S. Supreme Court will review [three cases](https://collab.sfcollab.org/sites/WSS005447/LawDeptComm/LGBTQ%20Cases.pdf) involving discrimination against the LGBTQ community. These cases will carry great significance for our society.

The decision will focus on whether interpretation of [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm) prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

“State Farm is proud to sign a [‘friend of the court’ brief](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/Title-seven-business-amicus-brief.pdf) (also known as an amicus brief) in support of anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ employees. Doing so, is in furtherance of the letter and spirit of our enterprise policies and practices,” says SVP and General Counsel Steve McManus. “Moreover, it says in one collective voice, ‘We believe in a workplace free of discrimination, and we value and promote diversity, equality and inclusion.’”

As good neighbors, our long history and success story is built directly from committed, caring people helping other people. Sometimes how we help people involves supporting what we value and believe.
