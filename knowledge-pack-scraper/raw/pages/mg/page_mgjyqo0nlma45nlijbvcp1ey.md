HOW LONG DO DRIVING VIOLATIONS AFFECT CAR INSURANCE RATES?
If you've had a traffic violation in Maryland, it's good to know how long it might affect what you pay for car insurance. Serious violations, like DUIs or excessive speeding, could have insurance companies looking back as far as 10 years.
But minor violations usually only increase your rates for about three to five years. Each insurance company has its own rules, so how long your rates are affected depends on its policies.

### Tips To Find the Best High-Risk Car Insurance in MD
Below, find key tips to save money and choose the best provider for high-risk car insurance in Maryland.
  1. 1
Decide What Coverage You Need
To make informed decisions without the influence of popular opinion or convincing agents, identify [what car insurance is necessary](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) for you before comparing providers. Additionally, consider add-ons like rideshare coverage and roadside assistance. You can use our car insurance coverage calculator to find out how much auto insurance you need.
  2. 2
Research Average Costs and Discounts
Understanding average costs and discounts for your profile prepares you to evaluate deals effectively when comparing providers. Look into discounts and your eligibility, like taking certified defensive driving courses in the area, which can reduce your premiums by up to 10%. This knowledge helps you prioritize which insurers to explore first.
  3. 3
Consider Non-Traditional Coverage Options
Explore pay-per-mile and other usage-based car insurance options to save on premiums, especially if you're a safe driver with low mileage. For example, Geico offers a telematics program that can track your driving habits and potentially save you up to 30% on auto policies.
  4. 4
Compare Multiple Providers
After considering all available options, compare offers from at least three different providers to see what they offer. Use various comparison methods, such as independent brokers and online comparison tools, since rates might vary among providers. Ensure your comparisons are consistent in coverage to clearly evaluate how insurers measure up.


### What To Do if You Get Denied Coverage in Maryland
Insurance is a choice, so car insurance companies can say no if they think you're too risky. But, if that happens, you can still get a plan through the Automobile Insurance Plan Service Office (AIPSO).
Below, we've provided contact information if you want to start the process.
