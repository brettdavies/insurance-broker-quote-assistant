## Common GEICO Full Coverage Insurance Components

**Liability insurance.** Almost every state requires drivers to carry liability insurance, which includes [property damage liability](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/property-damage-liability/8775) and [bodily injury liability](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/bodily-injury-liability/8607) coverage. Liability insurance pays for others' expenses after an accident you are at fault for.

**Collision and comprehensive insurance.** Collision insurance covers the cost of fixing or replacing the policyholder's vehicle after an accident, regardless of who was at fault. Similarly, comprehensive insurance covers the policyholder's car if it's damaged by something besides an accident, like vandalism, a fire, or a natural disaster. Collision and comprehensive are not mandatory in any state, but they are usually required for leased and financed cars.

**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.** This type of coverage protects you if you are involved in an accident with a driver who either does not have car insurance or does not have enough coverage. [Uninsured/underinsured motorist](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/uninsured-motorist-coverage/9647) insurance covers your expenses after an accident that should have been paid for by the at-fault driver's liability insurance. It will automatically be included in your full coverage policy if it is required in your state.

**Personal injury protection/MedPay**. [Personal injury protection](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/pip-insurance/9248) (PIP) insurance and [MedPay](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/med-pay/9255) coverage both cover medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, regardless of fault. Depending on your state, you may be required to carry one or the other.

Although these types of insurance are commonly included in a full coverage policy, what your specific policy includes will depend on your state. Full coverage is not the official name of any type of insurance, so be sure to clarify whether these types of insurance are included if you're purchasing a GEICO policy.
