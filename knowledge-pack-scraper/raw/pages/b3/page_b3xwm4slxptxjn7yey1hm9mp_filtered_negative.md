The amount of commission varies depending on the type of policy and the insurance company. For example, some _insurance companies pay a fixed commission rate_, while others pay a percentage of the policy premium.

It's _worth noting that most brokers work_ on behalf of the client while getting paid by the insurance carrier, aiming to find the best coverage without adding extra costs for you.

Insurance brokers and consultants/advisors work similarly, but have distinct fee structures. An insurance consultant typically charges a fee for service, which can be a _direct invoice of billable hours_ or an offset with commissions received. They often _forgo commissions from the insurance company_, which means they must charge a consultant's fee.
The average consulting fee is 15% of the policy premium, with the _percentage decreasing as the premium increases_. For example, a higher premium might result in a lower percentage fee.

Insurance brokers are often paid through _commissions based on insurance policies sold_, which can range from 7% to 15% of the premium payment. This means they typically don't charge you directly for their services.
Some _brokers charge fees for additional services_, such as voluntary benefits enrollment, but this is not the norm.
Fee-based broker compensation has become more common, especially when brokers take on consultant or advisor roles. These fees are usually paid by _insurance companies or billed directly_ to the client.
