# Car insurance for college students
College students may have the option to stay on their parents' auto insurance policy if their primary address matches the address on their parents' policy. They often get a lower price on car insurance, and greater convenience, when they stay on their parents' policy. If the student's vehicle is kept in a different state than where their parents reside, some states and insurers may require out-of-state college students to buy a separate car insurance policy.

## How much does car insurance cost for students?
The [cost for car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-car-insurance-cost/) is typically higher for college students than for older adults, primarily because people between the ages of 18 and 22 can be riskier drivers. One of the reasons most parents keep their student children on their insurance is that it's more affordable.
## Do college students get a discount on car insurance?
Many insurers offer [car insurance discounts to students](https://www.progressive.com/answers/student-information/) who are on their parents' policy:
  * ### Good student discount
Many insurers offer discounts for young drivers on a policy who are also good students. In most states, the Progressive good student discount starts at 5%.*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. Note that your child must be a full-time student, under the age of 23, and have a B average or better in order to qualify for Progressive's good student discount.
  * ### Distant college student discount
Some insurers also offer distant student discounts for college students who go away to school and don't take a car. Depending on the state, you can get a discount for any full-time college students on your Progressive auto insurance policy if they're 22 or younger and enrolled at an educational institution that's more than 100 miles away from home.†Read the associated disclosure for this claim.
  * ### Usage-based insurance
In most states, Progressive offers personalized rates based on how safely you drive using [Snapshot®](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/snapshot/), a mobile app or device that plugs into your car.**Read the associated disclosure for this claim. A key component of safe driving is the time you spend behind the wheel. So, if your child's car typically sits in your driveway or a school parking lot, you could score big savings for the infrequent driving category.


### Other ways to get the cheapest student car insurance
If you're a college student and your car is paid off or of minimal value, you could lower your rate by dropping comprehensive and collision coverage. Understand that if you drop these coverages, you'll have to pay out of pocket to repair or replace the car if it's damaged, stolen, or totaled.
Another way to get [cheap car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/cheap-car-insurance/) as a student is, under the right circumstances, to buy a policy separate from your parents. If you go to school in a more affordable ZIP code than your parents, buying a policy on your own may be cheaper than being on your parents' policy. You also may be able to get a cheaper car insurance rate on your own if you're over the age of 24 and have a cleaner driving record than your parents.
## Can college students stay on their parents' car insurance if they move out for college?
In most cases, college students can stay on their parents' car insurance when they go to school — if they haven't moved out permanently. Many families decide to keep their college students on their policies for the following reasons:
  * **It saves money**. Sharing one policy is usually more affordable, as you split the cost of certain coverages.
  * **You can share cars**. You're both covered when driving each other's cars, so you don't have to let the insurance company know who's driving which car when.
  * **It's more convenient**. It's generally easier to manage a single policy rather than two. Students should remain on their parents' car insurance policy if they drive their parents' cars when home on weekends or school vacations. In fact, Progressive requires college students who are away from home but occasionally drive their parents' cars to be on their parents' policy.


### Pro Tip:
What do you do with car insurance if your child moves out permanently? Your child must get their own policy under their new permanent address. If they no longer drive your cars, you can remove them from your policy and potentially lower your premium.
### What about car insurance for out-of-state college students?
Most states allow out-of-state college students to stay on their parents' car insurance if their primary address remains their parents' residence. However, depending on your state, insurer, and other factors, an out-of-state student may be required to get their own policy. Your insurer will determine if a separate policy is necessary after clarifying the following:
  * Who owns the vehicle
  * The ZIP code where the car will be parked
  * Whether the vehicle is kept on or off campus


### What about car insurance for international students?
Car insurance doesn't cover drivers outside of the U.S. and Canada. International students studying in another country need their own car insurance policy that's valid in the country where they plan to drive. Learn more about [international car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/international-car-insurance/).
### Are there age limits for students to stay on their parents' car insurance?
Car insurance rules don't change whether you're an 18-year-old at home, a 19-year-old college student, or an older adult living with your parents. If you share a permanent address, or if the car is usually kept overnight at your parents' house, you can continue sharing a car insurance policy — regardless of your age.
