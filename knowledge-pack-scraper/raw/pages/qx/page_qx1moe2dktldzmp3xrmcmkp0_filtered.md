## How Much VW Insurance Costs on Average - Summary by Model

The average cost of VW insurance differs by model. The following is a list of average annual rates for VW models, from the cheapest to the most expensive:

* **VW Tiguan:** $1,165 per year
* **VW Golf:** $1,176 per year
* **VW Passat:** $1,192 per year
* **VW Beetle:** $1,261 per year
* **VW Jetta:** $1,272 per year

The cost of insurance for certain VW models can be more expensive if they have a high manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) or high repair costs, which is especially true for electric vehicles.

WHY VW COSTS DIFFER BY MODEL

Based on average rates, the VW Tiguan is the cheapest model to insure. That's because of its low value and low horsepower.

Less powerful cars also tend to be cheaper to insure because they are less likely to get into major accidents.

The VW ID.4, on the other hand, is the most expensive to insure. As an electric car, it has higher repair costs, so insurers typically charge more. It also has a high MSRP and high horsepower, which both lead to more expensive auto insurance.

## FAQs About VW Insurance

MoneyGeek answered some of the most frequently asked questions to help drivers understand auto insurance for VW and how they differ per model.

### What do VWs cost to insure on average?

[On average, the cost of VW insurance is $1,245 per year](#k). However, rates may vary depending on your car’s model.

### What is the most expensive VW model to insure?

MoneyGeek’s analysis found that the VW ID.4 is the [most expensive VW model to insure](#vw-id-insurance-costs). The average annual insurance rate for a VW ID. 4 is $1,679.

### What is the cheapest VW model to insure?

The VW Tiguan is the [cheapest VW model to insure](#vw-tiguan-insurance-costs). A policy for this model costs an average of $1,165 per year.

## Methodology

Our baseline used a **40-year-old male** purchasing full coverage with **$100,000 per person** and **$300,000 per accident** in bodily injury liability, **$100,000** in property damage liability, plus comprehensive and collision protection with a **$1,000 deductible**. This represents standard full coverage that pays for injuries and property damage you cause while also protecting your VW from theft, weather damage and collision repairs after you pay your deductible.

We analyzed six major VW models to capture the brand's pricing spectrum from affordable compact SUVs to electric vehicles. The VW Tiguan averages **$1,165** annually, the cheapest in our analysis due to its modest value, lower horsepower and reasonable repair costs that reduce claim expenses insurers must cover. The VW ID.4 costs **$1,679** annually, reflecting higher replacement parts costs for electric vehicle batteries and components, plus an elevated MSRP that increases what insurers pay after total loss accidents.

Model-specific factors drive these rate differences more than the VW nameplate itself. Lower-value vehicles like the Golf (**$1,176** annually) and Passat (**$1,192** annually) cost less to repair or replace after accidents, so insurers charge lower premiums. Higher-powered or specialty models like the Beetle (**$1,261** annually) and Jetta (**$1,272** annually) fall in the middle range. Electric vehicles consistently cost more due to specialized repair requirements and limited technician availability for battery and electrical system work.

We also examined how rates shift across model years and driver ages, since an 18-year-old pays roughly **$2,600 to $3,800** more annually than a 40-year-old for identical VW coverage, reflecting inexperience and higher accident risk regardless of vehicle choice. This methodology reveals which insurers maintain competitive VW rates across their entire model lineup versus companies that advertise low prices for economy models but spike premiums for electric or performance variants.
