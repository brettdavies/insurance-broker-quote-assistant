![Woman in red shirt painting a wall during home maintenance.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/homeowners-insurance-maintenance-repairs.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
* **Fire or smoke** — if your kitchen sustains damage due to a fire.
* **Frozen pipes** — winter weather sometimes results in frozen pipes that can burst. This can cause water damage and the need for [plumbing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/preventative-plumbing-maintenance-for-your-home) repairs.
Whether its painting, caulking or cleaning gutters, maintaining a home can be a lot of work. You can tackle some projects yourself, but others might require a professional. [Do your research](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-to-diy-home-renovations-and-when-to-go-pro) to help you make that decision. Remember to document any maintenance or repairs you’ve made. This could be beneficial if you find yourself navigating the claim process.
Worn out or obsolete appliances are typically not covered by insurance. However, you can contact your local [State Farm® agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) for information on Home Systems Protection which may offer insurance protection for certain perils typically not covered by a homeowners policy.
