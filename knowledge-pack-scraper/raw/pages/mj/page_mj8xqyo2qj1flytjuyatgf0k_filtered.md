Progressive offers umbrella insurance policies up to $5 million. To buy a policy, call the insurer at **1-877-777-1783**.

Umbrella insurance increases your personal liability insurance from your home or auto insurance policies and also can pay for the following:

* Medical bills (from injuries you caused).
* Property damage (if you are the reason for the damage).
* Slander.
* Libel.
* Defamation.
* Court costs and attorney expenses.

This type of insurance adds coverage to an existing [liability policy](/car-insurance/liability-car-insurance/), to protect you if you’re deemed [at-fault](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/) for an accident. This reduces the risk that you’ll need to pay medical or car repair bills out of pocket your own once you’ve maxed out your other insurance.

Umbrella insurance can’t be bought if you don’t meet the required liability limits for your car or your home, since it only kicks in once your liability policy’s limitations have been reached.

## How much does Progressive umbrella insurance cost?

The amount you pay for umbrella insurance depends on certain factors.

* Homes, cars, boats and other vehicles owned.
* Driving record, including previous violations and accidents.
* Previous homeowners insurance claims.
* Location.
* Credit history.

[Progressive](/reviews/car-insurance/progressive/) notes on their website that policies are typically priced around a few hundred dollars per year.

Progressive also quoted Money.com’s research which showed annual premiums typically increase by $75 for every $1 million in additional coverage.

## What does Progressive umbrella insurance cover?

Umbrella insurance coverage from Progressive can include the following types of coverage:

* Personal injury coverage: Helpful if you face a libel or slander case.
* Worldwide coverage: Protects you while you’re traveling internationally.
* Protection for accidents involving boats, jet skis, scooters and other rental transportation equipment.
* Defense coverage: Helps you pay for legal fees and court costs.

Umbrella insurance is strictly for covering damages to other people and their property, so your own medical and property repair bills would not be covered.

Typically, you can get a maximum of around $500,000 in [bodily injury](/car-insurance/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage](/car-insurance/property-damage-liability-car-insurance/) coverage with a [car insurance](/car-insurance/) policy. However, if you exceed this amount in an accident, you will have to pay for the damages out-of-pocket. It’s the same is someone is injured on your property and their expenses exceed your home insurance policy’s liability limits.

This is where umbrella policies help to protect your finances.

## The bottom line

Progressive sells umbrella insurance policies up to $5 million and you can buy an umbrella insurance policy by calling Progressive at 1-877-777-1783. It typically costs a few hundred dollars to add millions in protection.
