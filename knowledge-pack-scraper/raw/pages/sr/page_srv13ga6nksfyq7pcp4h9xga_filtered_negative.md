**California FAIR doesn't require you to show proof that you can't get coverage from a private company.** But homeowners should [look for insurance from a private company](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-california "Best and Cheapest Home Insurance in California") before buying a FAIR Plan. This is because California's FAIR Plan covers fewer types of damage than home insurance from a private company. It also has lower coverage limits.
The California FAIR Plan offers home insurance, [renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies") and condo insurance.
A [FAIR homeowners insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/fair-plans-and-how-do-you-insure-high-risk-home "Compare FAIR Plans for High-Risk Home Insurance") policy protects your house and personal property. Condo owners and renters can only get coverage for their personal property, not the dwelling itself.
The California FAIR Plan offers [replacement cost coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance") for your home and personal property. This increases your claim payout since FAIR won't consider age or wear and tear in the value of an item.
[Other structures coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-homeowners-cover-other-structures "What Is Other Structures Coverage for Home Insurance?") will pay to fix or replace a shed, a separate garage or other structures on your property.
The California FAIR Plan offers [earthquake insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/california-earthquake-insurance-cost "How Much Does Earthquake Insurance Cost in California?") as a separate policy through the California Earthquake Authority (CEA).
**The California FAIR Plan offers[home insurance deductibles](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "How Do Homeowners Insurance Deductibles Work?") that range from $100 to $10,000.** A higher deductible will lower your home insurance rates. But it's important to choose a deductible you can afford in an emergency when you may have other pressing expenses.

The agent can also help you decide [how much coverage you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need "How Much Homeowners Insurance Do I Need?"). When you get a home insurance quote online from a private company, it will usually estimate how much coverage you need to protect your home. The FAIR Plan, on the other hand, won't help you determine how much coverage you need. But an agent can help you choose the correct coverage limits.
The California FAIR Plan offers property insurance to homeowners who can't [find coverage from a private insurance company in California](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-california "Best and Cheapest Home Insurance in California"), like Travelers or Nationwide.
The California FAIR Plan covers damage to your home and personal property due to fire, lightning, smoke and internal explosions. You can also [add on extra coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/california-fair-plan-home-insurance#covered "#covered") for damage due to windstorms, hail, vandalism and more.
