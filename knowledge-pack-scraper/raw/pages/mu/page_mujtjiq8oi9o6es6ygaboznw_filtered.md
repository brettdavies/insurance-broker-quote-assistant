“Do I need to obtain a home insurance policy to qualify for a mortgage loan in California? And if so, what type of insurance coverage do I need?”

These are common questions among first-time home buyers in the Golden State. So we’ve created a guide to explain the standard insurance requirements for mortgage loans.

**Here are seven things you need to know about this subject:**

1. California law does not require homeowners insurance, but most mortgage lenders do.
2. Banks and lenders want to be sure the property is protected, since they have a financial stake.
3. Mortgage lenders in California typically require at least dwelling coverage for loan approval.
4. Some lenders might require basic liability and personal property coverage as well.
5. Borrowers must provide proof of insurance before closing on the home.
6. Proof of insurance might include a policy document, declarations page, or insurance binder.
7. The binder serves as temporary proof of coverage until the formal policy is issued.

## Home Insurance Needed for a Mortgage Loan

Home insurance is not mandated by state or federal law. So, from a legal standpoint, you are not required to have a homeowners insurance policy in the state of California.

But if you need to use a mortgage loan to help facilitate your purchase, you’ll probably be required to have at least a basic homeowners insurance policy.

As in most states, banks and mortgage lenders in California require borrowers to have homeowners coverage prior to closing on the home. Lenders typically want to see proof of insurance before the transaction can be finalized.

(We’ll talk about the kinds of proof that can be provided in just a moment.)

Even if it’s not mandatory for your specific situation, home insurance is a worthwhile consideration due to the financial protection it provides.

## Common Types of Coverage

When obtaining a mortgage loan, lenders typically require borrowers to have certain types of home insurance coverage to protect their investment.

The specific insurance requirements can vary, depending on the lender and the location of the property. But the following types of home insurance are commonly required:

**1. Dwelling Coverage**

This is the primary component of homeowners insurance and covers the structure of the home itself. Lenders usually require a minimum amount of dwelling coverage to ensure that the home can be rebuilt or repaired in the event of a covered loss, such as fire, storm damage, or vandalism.

**2. Liability Coverage**

Liability insurance protects homeowners in case someone is injured on their property, and they are found legally responsible for the injury or damages. Lenders generally require a certain amount of liability coverage to protect against potential lawsuits. But the minimum amount of coverage needed can vary.

**3. Personal Property**

While it might not be required for mortgage approval, personal property coverage gives homeowners some important additional protection. It helps replace or repair personal belongings (like furniture, electronics and clothing) if they get damaged or destroyed by a covered event. In this context, a “covered event” might include fire, theft, or severe weather.

## Showing Proof of Insurance at Closing

Mortgage lenders in California typically require borrowers to provide proof of home insurance coverage, on or before the schedule closing day.

There are different types of proof, and the specific requirements can vary depending on the lender and terms of the loan. But the verification process generally includes one of the following forms:

**1. Homeowners Insurance Policy**

The most common form of proof is the actual homeowners insurance policy itself. This is the comprehensive document provided by the insurance company that outlines the coverage, policy limits, deductibles, and other important details. The policy should be active and effective on the closing date or prior to it.

**2. Declarations Page**

Lenders may also request a declarations page, which is a summary or snapshot of the key information in the homeowners insurance policy. It typically includes the policy number, effective dates, coverage amounts, and the name and contact information of the insured homeowner.

**3. Insurance Binder**

In some cases, lenders may accept an insurance binder as proof of coverage. A binder is a temporary document provided by the insurance company that serves as proof of insurance until the formal policy is issued. It contains similar information to the declarations page and indicates that the insurance is in effect.

**4. Proof of Payment**

Lenders may require evidence of premium payment for the homeowners insurance policy. This can be in the form of a receipt, bank statement, or confirmation from the insurance company indicating that the premium has been paid in full.

## In-Depth: The Homeowners Insurance Binder

A homeowners insurance binder is a temporary document that serves as proof of insurance coverage until a formal homeowners insurance policy is issued. It is typically provided by an insurance agent or company when a homeowner applies for a new insurance policy, or makes changes to an existing one.

The binder acts as a temporary contract between the homeowner and the insurance company, outlining the coverage, limits, deductibles, and other policy details. It provides immediate coverage while the insurance company processes the application and prepares the final policy documents.

The binder is important because it offers temporary coverage and protection against potential losses during the underwriting process, or while awaiting issuance of the actual policy.

Once the formal policy is ready, the binder is replaced by the policy document, which contains all the finalized terms and conditions of the coverage.

## The Wildfire Threat: Obstacles and Solutions

California’s escalating wildfire risk has created an additional hurdle for many home buyers: securing the home insurance that’s required for mortgage approval.

Lenders typically require insurance to protect their investment, but many traditional insurers are pulling back from high-risk areas. This leaves buyers in a difficult position, potentially jeopardizing their ability to close on a home.

This is an evolving situation that we continue to monitor. In the meantime, here are some potential solutions and important considerations for home buyers:

* **California FAIR Plan:** This state-mandated option provides basic fire insurance when standard coverage is unavailable, fulfilling lender requirements, though often at a higher cost and with less comprehensive coverage.
* **Specialized Insurers:** Some companies cater to high-risk areas. Working with experienced brokers can help locate these providers.
* **Supplemental Policies:** To address coverage gaps, consider purchasing a Difference in Conditions (DIC) policy, which provides additional coverage for risks not covered by a standard policy.
* **Home Hardening:** Taking proactive steps to fortify homes against wildfires can improve insurability, though it won’t guarantee coverage.

While securing homeowners insurance in California’s wildfire-prone areas has become more challenging, options like the California FAIR Plan, supplemented with additional coverage, can help home buyers meet lender requirements and protect their investments.

*Note: This information has been provided for a general audience and might not apply to all home-buying scenarios. When applying for a loan, be sure to ask your lender what type of insurance coverage you’ll need.*
