### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* The price of car insurance has almost doubled since 2020, as supply-chain disruptions and increasingly destructive natural disasters have raised the number of claims and their costs.
* Insurance companies have consistently raised prices over the years, and they were finally profitable in 2024 for the first time in years.
* However, as customers say prices have become unaffordable, many are unsatisfied with their insurer. This year, insurance companies must focus on making their customers happier to retain them.

After years of price hikes, car insurers will likely shift their priorities from raising prices to satisfying and retaining their customers.

Car insurance prices have almost doubled over the past five years, according to the latest CPI data, as COVID-19-related supply chain interruptions made car repairs more expensive and [natural disasters increased damages](https://www.investopedia.com/los-angeles-wildfires-california-property-insurance-crisis-8772152).12 Last year was one of the costliest years, with claims surging 113% higher than in 2023, according to a report from Verisk, a global data analytics and technology provider, and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association.3

Yet, the report found insurance companies were still able to make a profit for the first time in four years in 2024 after consistently [raising their prices](https://www.investopedia.com/car-insurance-prices-keep-rising-and-drivers-are-struggling-to-keep-up-11678676). However, if insurers want to keep their customers, they will need to shift away from rising rates and [exiting unprofitable markets](https://www.investopedia.com/weather-drives-homeowners-to-shop-for-better-insurance-can-they-find-it-8694091) to focus on better customer care, experts at J.D. Power, an American data analytics company, wrote in a recent report.4

The majority of American drivers say insurance prices are unaffordable, and are [cutting down on their coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/a-third-of-americans-cut-down-on-car-insurance-expecting-tariffs-to-raise-premiums-11748959). At the same time, about 38% of customers are unsatisfied with their insurer, according to a survey by J.D. Power. That dissatisfaction makes customers much more likely to shop around for a better deal.

“We’ve been hearing from more carriers, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, that they’re making product adjustments to improve their competitive position," Josh Damico, vice president of Insurance Operations at Jerry, a car insurance comparison app, said in an email. "These moves aren’t broad enough to drive insurance deflation, but they do suggest a shift toward more stable pricing and slower increases moving forward. For drivers, this could be a sign of progress.”
