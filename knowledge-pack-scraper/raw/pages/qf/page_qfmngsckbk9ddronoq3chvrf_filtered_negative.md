One unique coverage is Deductible Savings Bank, which periodically lowers your collision or comprehensive deductible for every six-month policy period that you go claim- and violation-free.
The company’s usage-based insurance program, Snapshot, can help you save on your policy if you drive safely. Once you sign up, the company will monitor your driving habits via a mobile app. In most states, drivers can receive a participation discount just for signing up for Snapshot. However, the enrollment discount isn’t available in New York. Drivers will only receive a discount if they have safe driving habits, as tracked by the program.

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Best Local Car Insurance Companies
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about car insurance companies in New York. For our local rating, we analyzed data we collected and evaluated for our National Best Car Insurance rating, including state-specific insurance premiums provided by Quadrant Information Services, survey respondents from New York, and state-level auto insurance complaints filed to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for insurers in our rating.
To qualify for the best list in each state, an insurer must have available state-level premium data provided by Quadrant, along with data from at least one of the two following sources: respondents for that insurer in New York from our 2025 national best car insurance survey, or be in the top 10 of market share for Private Passenger Auto in New York from the 2024 NAIC market share report.
To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual driver profiles.
To get the average annual rate used in our analysis, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers aged 25, 40, and 60 who drive 14,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record. The medium coverage tier refers to $50,000/$100,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible, $50,000 property damage coverage, $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, and any other mandatory coverages a state may require. The rates are for comparative purposes only and should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. Because car insurance rates are based on individual factors, your car insurance rates will differ.
We then normalized the number of complaints for each company in New York by reviewing the total direct premiums written for that insurer in New York in 2024, generating a NAIC Quotient. If a company in New York fell outside of the top 10 in premiums written, a proxy number was used to calculate its quotient.
### **We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the state-level premium (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment. We then applied weights to each of the standardized scores to calculate the overall rating, demonstrating that some aspects of auto insurance are more important than others when making the purchasing decision. With that in mind, we arrived at the following weights:
* State-level Average Premium (40%)
* Survey Responses (20%)
* NAIC Quotient (40%)
We combined the weighted scores and converted the value to the U.S. News Rating on a 5-point scale, with 5.0 being the best possible rating. The U.S. News Rating for each car insurance company allows us to make company comparisons and ratings. The ratings are periodically updated based on the latest information we collect from online sources and surveys.
