While the exact process can vary based on location and specific policy details, these steps should get you started —&nbsp;and you can always reach out to your Progressive Insurance agent or broker for help or guidance if you need it.</p><p><strong>1. Check your eligibility. </strong>Ensure you meet the age requirement for the discount, which is 55 years in California. Review your driving record to ensure it’s clean, as this can be a key factor in qualifying for the discount.</p><p><strong>2. Sign up for a DMV-approved mature driver course. </strong>At Traffic Safety Institute, we offer both a <a href="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/mature-driver/california/">California Mature Driver Course</a> and a <a href="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/mature-driver/florida/">Florida Mature Driver Course</a>. Both are approved and licensed by the DMV and accepted by all insurance carriers. And, if you don’t get at least $100 back over three years, we’ll give you your money back.</p><p><strong>3. Complete the course and pass the final exam. </strong>Once the course is completed, you’ll receive an insurance discount certificate as proof you completed it.</p><p><strong>4. Contact Progressive about your discount. </strong>Reach out to a Progressive representative or agent. You can do this by phone, online through the Progressive website, or in person if there’s a local office near you. Inform them that you’ve completed the mature driver course and you’d like to apply for the discount. Submit the certificate or proof of completion from the mature driver course. Progressive may also request other documents or information, like details from your driving record.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Receive your mature driver discount and enjoy your savings. </strong>Once all documents are received, Progressive will review the information. If everything is in order and you meet the criteria, the discount will be applied to your policy. The exact savings will vary, but it can lead to a significant reduction in your premium.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Maintain the Progressive Mature Driver Discount</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" decoding="async" width="1" height="1" data-src="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06.png" alt="How to Maintain the Progressive Mature Driver Discount" class="wp-image-2642" data-srcset="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06.png 2293w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-300x82.png 300w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-1024x280.png 1024w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-768x210.png 768w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-1536x419.png 1536w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-2048x559.png 2048w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-600x164.png 600w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-685x187.png 685w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-06-1920x524.png 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2293px) 100vw, 2293px"></figure><p>The Progressive mature driver discount lasts for three years at a time. If you want to maintain it for longer than that, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>1. Take a renewal course. </strong>You don’t need to take the full mature driver course again —&nbsp;but you do need to take a DMV-approved renewal course, which covers similar topics but is shorter. Once you pass the renewal course, you’ll receive another insurance discount certificate that’s good for another three years. This can be repeated every three years indefinitely for as long as you meet the other eligibility criteria for the program.</p><p><strong>2. Maintain a clean driving record. </strong>Avoid at-fault accidents —&nbsp;being at fault in a car accident could jeopardize your discount. Traffic violations, especially severe ones like DUIs, can also disqualify you from the discount.</p><p><strong>3. Stay up-to-date with policy changes. </strong>Insurance policies and discount requirements can change. Periodically review your policy and the terms of the discount to make sure you’re in compliance.</p><p><strong>4. Regularly review your insurance policies. </strong>It’s a good idea to review your policy and discounts periodically to ensure you’re getting the maximum benefits and to check if there are other discounts you might qualify for.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="FAQ_About_the_Progressive_Mature_Driver_Discount">FAQ About the Progressive Mature Driver Discount</span></h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" decoding="async" width="1" height="1" data-src="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07.png" alt="FAQ About the Progressive Mature Driver Discount" class="wp-image-2643" data-srcset="https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07.png 2292w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-300x98.png 300w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-1024x336.png 1024w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-768x252.png 768w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-1536x503.png 1536w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-2048x671.png 2048w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-600x197.png 600w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-685x224.png 685w, https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/83-Progressive-Mature-Driver-Discount-07-1920x629.png 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2292px) 100vw, 2292px"></figure><p>If you have any other questions about the Progressive mature driver discount, keep reading! Below are some of the most frequently asked questions about the program.</p><div id="rank-math-faq" class="rank-math-block"><div class="rank-math-list "><div id="faq-question-1745474661587" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">What’s the Progressive Mature Driver Discount Age?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>The typical starting age for the Progressive mature driver discount is 50 years old. However, the exact age at which one becomes eligible for the discount can vary by state and specific policy details. In some states, the age requirement might be 55 years old or another age threshold. In California and Florida, drivers must be 55 or older to qualify for the program.</p><p>To get the most accurate and up-to-date information on the age requirement for the Progressive mature driver discount in a specific state, it’s best to contact Progressive Insurance directly.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474682881" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">Do I Automatically Receive a Mature Driver Discount When I Become Old Enough?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>No, reaching the eligible age is just one of the criteria. You’ll also need to maintain a clean driving record and, in some states (like California), complete a DMV-approved mature driver course.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474712311" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">How Long Is the Progressive Mature Driver Discount Valid?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>In California and Florida, the discount lasts for three years before it either expires, or you need to take a renewal course to keep qualifying. That can vary in other states.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474727866" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">How Much Can You Save With the Progressive Mature Driver Discount?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>The exact discount percentage can vary by state, or even by individual insurance provider, so it’s a good idea to check with your Progressive agent to see how much you can save by qualifying for the mature driver discount.</p><p>However, in California, the average savings for Progressive customers who qualify for the mature driver discount is 10%. When you apply that savings to the <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average annual cost of auto insurance premiums in California</a> — $2,291 —&nbsp;it means the average driver would save $687.30 over the three years the discount is valid. If you renew the discount, you can save even more.</p><p>At Traffic Safety Institute, we guarantee you’ll save at least $100 on your car insurance by taking our mature driver course —&nbsp;but as you can see, it’s easy to save much more than that.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474759215" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">Can a Mature Driver Discount Be Combined with Other Discounts?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Yes, Progressive allows policyholders to stack multiple eligible discounts. This means you can combine the Mature Driver Discount with other discounts you qualify for, maximizing your savings.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474774166" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">Does Progressive Offer Any Other Discounts?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>to reward specific behaviors and conditions. Some of these discounts include:</p><p>•   Multi-policy discount<br>•   Multi-car discount<br>•   Autopay discount<br>•   Pay-in-full discount<br>•   Paperless discount<br>•   Homeowever discount<br>•   Anti-theft device discount<br>•   Military discount</p><p>This is not an exhaustive list, and availability can vary based on location, changes in company policies, and other factors. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on discounts and to understand which ones you might qualify for, contact your Progressive agent or broker.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1745474931446" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">How Long Is the Mature Driver Course?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>The California DMV-approved mature driver course contains 13 modules. When you take the course in a classroom, you’re required to sit for 400 minutes of instruction for the initial course, and 240 minutes for the renewal course.</p><p>But when you take the mature driver course online, one of the best features is the ability to complete it at your own pace.
