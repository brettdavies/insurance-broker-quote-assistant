Florida Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworsky signed orders this week authorizing Mangrove Property Insurance Co., Patriot Select Property and Casualty Insurance Co., and [Slide Insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/slide-insurance/530813/) Co. to participate in the state’s “depopulation” initiative. The program is designed to reduce Citizens’ ballooning policy count, which swelled during recent years as private carriers struggled under the weight of financial losses, litigation costs, and extreme weather events.
In contrast, some large private insurers like [State Farm](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/state-farm/67041/) Florida Insurance Co. have stayed on the sidelines, opting not to participate in depopulation. [State Farm](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/state-farm/67041/) ended 2024 with roughly 647,000 policies—virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
**Mangrove Property Insurance** Company is a newly established Florida-based insurer, approved by the [Florida Office of Insurance Regulation](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/florida-office-of-insurance-regulation/542664/) (OIR) on January 15, 2025, to offer property and casualty insurance to homeowners across the state. The company is led by Harvard educated CEO Stephen Weinstein. Weinstein has served in senior roles at major reinsurance firms and holds positions on a number of industry boards.
**​Slide Insurance Company,** established in 2021 by founder and CEO Bruce Lucas, is a Tampa-based, technology-driven insurance provider specializing in homeowners and property insurance across Florida and South Carolina. Since its inception, Slide has rapidly expanded, acquiring policies from insolvent insurers like St. Johns Insurance Company and UPC Insurance, and securing renewal rights to approximately 86,000 [Farmers](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/farmers/67005/) Insurance policies after their withdrawal from the Florida market.
**Patriot Select Property and Casualty Insurance Company** is also Florida-based and is headquartered in St. Petersburg, specializing in homeowners insurance tailored to the unique risks faced by property owners in the Sunshine State. The company also offers standard HO-3 policies. The company is led by CEO John W. Rollins and COO Kelly Booten.
