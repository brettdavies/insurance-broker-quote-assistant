Geico offers a defensive driving discount in 37 states for drivers aged 50 and older who complete an approved defensive driving course. In eight additional states, a similar discount is available for drivers of all ages. But like all major car insurance companies, Geico does not have a senior discount that automatically lowers rates for all older drivers.

In addition to the defensive driving discount, senior drivers can take advantage of other discounts in order to [lower their premium](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-to-lower-geico-car-insurance-2140732872/). For example, Geico offers multi-policy discount, which gives a discount to drivers who have another Geico policy in addition to their car insurance.
