#  Mobile Home Insurance Companies 
[ Home Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)
Hello, own a home in New Mexico, unfortunately it’s just over 20 years old & the cheapest I could find was through foremost since it seems like most major insurance companies won’t touch mobile home, definitely older mobile homes. 
The house is nice & well taken care of on a concrete foundation, we’re currently paying $3400 a year. I was wondering if there’s someone or something I’m missing that I could find a cheaper company to go through.

Use an independent agent to shop for you and do the work for you. I’m sure you will be able to find something a tad cheaper. 
Unfortunately, though, you’re in a very rough state for the current insurance market and mobile homes typically depreciate in value. At 20 years old and as nice as you would say it is, the mobile home is on the verge of being uninsurable. Add these two things together - means extremely high premiums and scant coverages.

Mobile homes can be an affordable housing option, but you are right that they can be difficult and expensive to insure. 
Foremost is one of the companies that will accept this type of risk. Another option is American Modern. 
You might check with a couple of independent agents to see if they have anything less expensive. Also, you could check Geico, Progressive, Allstate, and State Farm. 
Check all your options and go from there.

Foremost is probably the #1 writer of mobile homes in the country, so their pricing is likely to be competitive.

Foremost is probably your best bet. If they are willing to insure it, that is a good policy.
