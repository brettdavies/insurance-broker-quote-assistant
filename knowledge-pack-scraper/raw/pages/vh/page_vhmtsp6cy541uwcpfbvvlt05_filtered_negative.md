Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-nationwide/)
Root was among the early adopters of telematics technology, which helps to assign insurance rates based on driving habits instead of traditional rating factors. In fact, the company aims to discontinue using credit scores — a practice it calls "discriminatory" — by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive limited mileage.

Though the company is seen as financially stable, it receives more customer complaints than average.
