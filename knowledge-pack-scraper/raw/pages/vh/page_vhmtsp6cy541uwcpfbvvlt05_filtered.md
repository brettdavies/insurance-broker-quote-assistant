Root was among the early adopters of telematics technology, which helps to assign insurance rates based on driving habits instead of traditional rating factors. In fact, the company aims to discontinue using credit scores — a practice it calls "discriminatory" — by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive limited mileage.

* Duration with insurance provider and coverage specifics, including teen drivers.
* Claim filing experiences and satisfaction with claims handling.
* Customer service interactions, trust in providers, and likelihood of recommending their insurance.
* Use and satisfaction with digital tools and usage-based insurance programs.

Respondents rated their satisfaction on a Likert scale from 1 to 10 and provided qualitative feedback.

Data were analyzed focusing on descriptive and inferential statistics to identify satisfaction trends and demographic impacts. Data cleaning and weighting were applied to ensure accuracy, alongside strict confidentiality protocols to protect data security.

Root allows existing auto insurance customers to bundle homeowners insurance through a partnership with Homesite. Root home insurance is not available as a standalone insurance policy — a customer must be enrolled in Root's car insurance program to be eligible.

Though the company is seen as financially stable, it receives more customer complaints than average. Customers looking for top-notch customer satisfaction may do well to look into a policy with a more established carrier. In addition, Root homeowners insurance quotes can only be found via the company's mobile app, not its website. Root claims customers who [bundle home and auto policies](/best-home-and-car-insurance/) receive 10% discounts on their home insurance premium.
