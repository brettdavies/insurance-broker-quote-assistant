##  What Is Insurance?
* Popular insurance policies include [health](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-health-insurance-companies-8762191), auto, [business](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-commercial-business-insurance-11705329), home, and [life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-term-life-insurance-8764257).
##  How Insurance Works
Many insurance policy types are available, and virtually any individual or business can find an insurance company willing to insure them, for a price. Common [personal insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-insurance-lines.asp) policy types are auto, health, homeowners, and life insurance. Most individuals in the United States have at least one of these types of insurance, and car insurance is required by state law.
Businesses obtain insurance policies for field-specific risks. For example, a fast-food restaurant's policy may cover an employee's injuries from cooking with a deep fryer. Medical malpractice insurance covers injury- or death-related liability claims resulting from the health care provider's negligence or malpractice. A company may use an insurance [broker of record](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-of-record.asp) to help it manage the policies of its employees. Businesses may be required by state law to buy specific insurance coverages.1
##  Insurance Policy Components
###  Premium
###  Policy Limit
The policy limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay for a covered loss under a policy. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum.
Typically, higher limits carry higher premiums. For a general [life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp) policy, the maximum amount that the insurer will pay is referred to as the face value. This is the amount paid to your beneficiary upon your death.
###  Deductible
The [deductible](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-difference-between-copay-and-deductible.asp) is a specific amount you pay out of pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims.
The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp) compiles an index of complaints about insurance companies from state insurance regulators.
##  Types of Insurance
###  Health Insurance
###  Home Insurance
###  Auto Insurance
Instead of paying out of pocket for auto accidents and damage, people pay either annual or monthly[ premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp) to an auto insurance company. The company then pays all or most of the covered costs associated with an auto accident or other vehicle damage.
###  Life Insurance
* **Permanent life insurance:** This type of life insurance8
###  Travel Insurance
Travel insurance covers the costs and losses associated with traveling, including trip cancellations or delays, coverage for emergency health care, injuries and evacuations, damaged baggage, rental cars, and rental homes.9 However, even some of the best travel insurance companies do not cover cancellations or delays due to weather, terrorism, or a pandemic. They also don't often cover injuries from extreme sports or high-adventure activities.
