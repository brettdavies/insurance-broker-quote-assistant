The 15-Year Roof Rule doesn’t require you to replace your roof, but if it’s over 15 years old, your insurer can demand an inspection or drop your policy. The best move? Get ahead of the game with a proactive inspection and real documentation, before your coverage is at risk.

Your roof can look brand new, survive multiple hurricanes, and still get you dropped by your insurance company the moment it hits 15 years old. 

Sounds ridiculous, right? We’ve seen it happen more times than we can count. But it’s not about the roof, it’s about the risk.

If you’re a Florida homeowner, you need to understand what’s really going on with this so-called “15-Year Roof Rule.” 

No, it’s not a state law that says you must replace your roof after 15 years. But the insurance industry has found ways to use that milestone to pressure homeowners into expensive, often unnecessary replacements, or worse, drop their coverage entirely.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the 15-Year Roof Rule. Also your rights, and how you can protect your home and your wallet. Let’s get into it.

## What Is the 15-Year Roof Rule in Florida?

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/florida-15-year-roof-rule-statute-300x300.jpg)

The “15-Year Roof Rule” isn’t a law, but it’s become one of the biggest pain points for Florida homeowners trying. Here’s what it really means, and why it matters.

### 1. It’s Not a Law That Forces You to Replace Your Roof

The 15-Year Roof Rule stems from [Florida Statute 627.7011](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.7011.html), which gives insurance companies the authority to evaluate your roof’s age and condition when deciding to issue or renew a policy. 

That’s it. 

The state isn’t going to fine you or show up at your house with a citation if your roof is 16 years old. 

But your insurance company might decide to drop your coverage or refuse to renew your policy based on that age alone.

Putting it in plain English:

* The state does not force you to reroof after 15 years.
* Your insurer, however, can make replacement a condition for continued coverage.

It’s not the law pushing you into a new roof, it’s the insurance industry’s risk calculations.

### 2. This Affects Your Insurance Eligibility After 15 Years

Once your roof hits 15 years many insurance companies will trigger a coverage review. 

This often comes in the form of a letter stating that your roof is now considered “aged” and will need to pass an inspection in order for your policy to remain active.

Insurers are not necessarily looking for damage. They’re looking for confirmation that your roof still has at least five years of “useful life” left. 

It’s a subjective assessment of how much longer your roof is expected to perform its function without becoming a liability. 

It doesn’t matter if your roof has never leaked, you’ve done regular maintenance, or you used high-end shingles with a 25-year warranty.

If the inspector (approved by the insurer) concludes that your roof doesn’t have five years left, your coverage is in jeopardy. 

More. Many of these evaluations are based more on averages and industry formulas than the actual condition of your roof.

This makes the 15-year mark becomes a trigger point for insurance companies to protect their bottom line. 

And unless you’re prepared with documentation or a strategy, you could be stuck footing the bill for a replacement you didn’t plan for.

## Why Insurance Companies Care About Your Roof’s Age

To understand why your roof’s age triggers such scrutiny, you have to look at how insurance companies calculate risk, and how the Florida market has forced their hand.

### Older Roofs Mean Higher Risk

When insurers evaluate your home they’re doing a risk calculation. 

The older the roof, the higher the odds, statistically, that it’s going to fail during a claimable event like a hurricane, hailstorm, or wind gust.

That means:

* Even if your roof **looks brand new** and has **never leaked**, it may still be labeled “high risk.”
* Roofing materials like asphalt shingles have known lifespans, and insurers lean on those general standards, not your roof’s actual condition.
* Roofs in certain Florida regions (especially coastal areas) age faster due to salt air, high humidity, and UV exposure, regardless of build quality.

This approach isn’t personal, it’s actuarial. 

Insurers don’t want to gamble on whether your 17-year-old shingle roof might survive the next storm. They’d rather flag it now than pay out for a full replacement later.

### Litigation and Fraud Are Driving These Rules

Now, here’s the part most homeowners never hear about. Florida’s insurance market has been shaped by litigation abuse and fraud over the past decade.

This flood of legal action has cost insurers billions, and they’ve responded by tightening underwriting criteria. That includes:

* Cutting policies for homes with roofs over 15 years old,
* Demanding stricter inspection requirements,
* And shifting more risk back onto homeowners.

In their eyes, it’s simple math. Fewer older roofs = fewer lawsuits = more control over losses. 

But for homeowners, that means you’re now stuck proving your roof’s worth, or being pushed toward a replacement before it’s truly needed.

**Helpful Resource →** [Florida Roofing Scams: What Every Homeowner Needs to Know](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/blog/florida-roofing-scams/)

## What Happens When Your Roof Turns 15?

Once your roof hits the 15-year mark, especially if it’s made of shingles, things change. 

Even if it’s in great shape, your insurance company may suddenly decide it’s too old to insure without extra proof.

### 1. You Might Get a Letter from Your Insurance Company

Most homeowners first learn about this rule through a letter from their insurer. The message is usually clear:

* Your roof is now considered “aged.”
* You’ll need to get it inspected within a set timeframe.
* If it doesn’t pass, or if you ignore the request, your policy might not be renewed.

Can they force you to replace your roof?

Not legally. But they can refuse to renew your coverage unless you do. And if you have a mortgage, no insurance means no compliance with your lender which puts you in a tough spot. 

So while they can’t legally force you to reroof, they can make it feel like you have no real choice.

### 2. Mandatory Inspections Are Often Required

To keep your policy active, most insurers require you to prove your roof still has at least five years of useful life left. 

This means scheduling a roof inspection, often with someone approved by the insurer.

But not all inspections carry weight:

* Some insurers will only accept reports from their network of inspectors.
* Others may reject reports that don’t meet specific standards or include required documentation.

Even if your roof passes, there’s no guarantee. 

Insurers can still raise premiums, reduce coverage, or drop your policy based on their internal criteria.

## Common Misconceptions About the 15-Year Rule

Florida homeowners hear “15-Year Roof Rule” and immediately think, “Well, that can’t apply to my roof.” 

Whether it’s because you bought premium materials or installed something stronger than shingles, there’s a lot of misinformation about how this rule is enforced. 

Let’s set the record straight.

### 1. The 15-Year Rule Still Applies to 25-Year or “Lifetime” Shingles

Here’s the harsh truth, manufacturer warranties don’t mean a thing to your insurance company generally. 

Those warranties are designed to cover product defects, not storm damage or long-term wear. Insurance companies aren’t bound by those terms. 

Instead, they rely on internal risk models that treat any shingle roof over 15 years old as a potential liability, regardless of warranty status.

So even if:

* You paid for architectural or “lifetime” shingles,
* Your roof looks brand new,
* Or you have the original paperwork from the manufacturer,

Your insurance company can still require an inspection, or deny coverage altogether, based on the roof’s age alone.

### 2. “Metal or Tile Roofs Don’t Count”

Another common assumption is that the rule only applies to asphalt shingle roofs. Not true.

Insurers are tightening their standards across the board, and that means:

* Metal roofs may still need an inspection after 15 years, especially if they’re exposed to salt air near the coast.
* Tile roofs are scrutinized for underlayment wear, which can deteriorate long before the tiles themselves do.

Roof material might buy you time, but it doesn’t guarantee exemption. 

In the eyes of the insurance industry, age is age, and risk is risk.

## What Happens If You Don’t Replace Your Roof or Keep It Insured?

If your roof is older than 15 years and your insurance company is pressuring you to replace it. But what really happens if you don’t replace your roof, or you drop coverage entirely?

Let’s walk through your options if you want to push back.

### 1. Non-Renewal or Dropped Coverage Is the Most Likely Scenario

If your roof fails an inspection after year 15 and you don’t replace it, your insurance company probably won’t cancel your policy right away. But they will likely choose not to renew your coverage when the term ends.

That means:

* You’ll get a letter stating your policy is ending.
* Once that expiration date hits, you’re no longer covered.
* You may struggle to find another insurer willing to write a new policy, especially if the roof is still over 15 years old and hasn’t been replaced.

Now, if you have a mortgage your lender requires you to maintain insurance as part of your loan. If you lose coverage and don’t replace it, your lender may step in and issue force-placed insurance.

* It’s usually two to three times more expensive than normal insurance.
* It only protects the lender’s interest, not yours.
* You don’t get to shop around or negotiate terms.

So while no one is physically forcing you to reroof your home, the system is built in a way that gives you very few workable alternatives.

### 2. You May Be Able To Appeal

In some cases, if your roof is in good shape and you believe it still has years of life left, you can try to challenge your insurer’s decision.

You’ll need to:

* Pay for an independent inspection.
* Provide documentation showing the roof is structurally sound and has at least five years of remaining life.
* Include photos, maintenance records, and past repair invoices if you have them.

It’s not a guaranteed fix, but for some homeowners, especially those with high-quality materials or recent repairs, this can be a temporary solution.

### What If You Just Don’t Get Insurance?

You’re not legally required to carry homeowners insurance in Florida. That means you can choose to go uninsured. But before you do, think carefully.

Without insurance:

* You’ll pay out of pocket for any damage, whether it’s from wind, hail, fire, or anything else.
* If your home becomes unlivable due to a roof failure, there’s no claim, no help, and no safety net.
* If someone gets injured on your property, you’ll have no liability protection.

Sure, you might save money upfront. 

But in a state like Florida, where storm season is a very real threat every single year, it’s a huge financial gamble. And If You Have a Mortgage, different story. Your lender requires insurance, no exceptions.

## How to Stay Protected Without Breaking the Bank

Not everyone has ten or fifteen thousand dollars sitting in their back pocket for a new roof, and insurance companies don’t exactly wait until it’s convenient. 

If your roof is aging and your policy is at risk, there *are* ways to protect your home, stay insured, and buy time.

### 1. Citizens Insurance and Other Alternatives

Citizens Property Insurance Corporation may be your safety net. It’s known as Florida’s “insurer of last resort,” and it exists specifically for situations when no one else will write your policy.

You may qualify for Citizens if:

* You’ve been denied coverage or priced out by private carriers.
* Your roof is older than 15 years but still functional.
* You can’t afford a full roof replacement but need to maintain insurance for mortgage compliance.

That said, Citizens isn’t a perfect solution. While it can keep you insured, there are trade-offs:

* You may still need to prove your roof has five years of useful life through an inspection.
* Coverage may be limited and replacement payouts could be capped or denied.
* Claims and customer service aren’t as robust or flexible as what you’d get from a private company.

In short: It’s better than being uninsured, but don’t expect it to offer premium protection.

### 2. Consider Actual Cash Value (ACV) Policies

Another option worth exploring is a policy based on Actual Cash Value (ACV) rather than full Replacement Cost Value (RCV). Here’s the difference:

* RCV policies pay to fully replace your roof at today’s market cost.
* ACV policies subtract depreciation, so if your roof is 18 years old, you might only get 30–40% of what you’d need to replace it.

Why go this route? Because:

* Premiums are lower, which makes the policy more affordable.
* It’s a way to stay insured while you plan or save for a future roof replacement.
* You avoid the total risk of going uninsured or being stuck with force-placed coverage from your lender.

Just remember, if a major storm hits and your roof takes a hit, you’ll likely have to pay the difference out of pocket.

### 3. Get an Independent Roof Inspection Before Year 15

Beat your insurance company to the punch. Don’t wait until they send you a letter demanding an inspection, do it on your own terms.

By scheduling an independent roof inspection in year 14 (or even earlier), you can:

* Identify minor issues before they become disqualifiers.
* Gather documentation that proves your roof still has years of life left.
* Negotiate from a place of control instead of reacting in a panic.

Make sure your inspector is licensed and experienced, and that their report clearly outlines estimated remaining lifespan, material condition, and signs of proper maintenance. 

This can make a big difference during renewal.

### 4. Work With Roofing Companies That Understand Insurance

A regular roofing crew can patch your roof, but a great roofing company helps you stay insured.

We’ve spent years navigating Florida’s insurance ecosystem. We help you build a case:

* Our team provides inspection-ready reports tailored to what insurers are actually looking for.
* We understand the difference between what’s cosmetically fine and what’s an underwriting red flag.
* We help you find the smartest path forward, whether that’s a repair, maintenance plan, or alternative coverage strategy.

We’ve helped countless homeowners stay insured and protected *without* immediately dropping tens of thousands on a new roof.

You don’t need a brand-new roof tomorrow to stay protected. What you need is a game plan. 

Whether that means leveraging Citizens Insurance, switching to ACV, or partnering with a contractor who knows how to work *with* insurance instead of against it, there are options. 

## What Florida Homeowners Need to Know

The 15-Year Roof Rule isn’t some state-mandated law that forces you to replace your roof. 

It’s a strategy used by insurance companies to reduce risk and control payouts, especially in a high-claims state like Florida. It’s about business, not building code.

But even if the rule isn’t law, the consequences are real. 

Once your roof hits that 15-year mark, it’s no longer just a structure over your head, it becomes a line item on your insurer’s risk report. And 

That’s why waiting for a notice in the mail is the worst move you can make.

Instead:

* Plan ahead. Don’t let your insurer dictate the timeline.
* Get your roof inspected early. Know exactly where you stand before the renewal deadline creeps up.
* Explore your options. Whether it’s Citizens Insurance, an ACV policy, or strategic repairs, you’ve got more control than you think, as long as you act early.

At Florida Roofing & Gutters, we’ve seen this play out hundreds of times.
