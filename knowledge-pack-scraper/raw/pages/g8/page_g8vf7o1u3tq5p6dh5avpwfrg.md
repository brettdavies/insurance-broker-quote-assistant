  * ###  How Bankrate chose the best home insurance companies in Florida 
Caret Down Icon
Bankrate’s insurance editorial team follows the turbulence in the Florida home insurance market closely, and we know how difficult finding coverage can be. We want to make shopping for homeowners insurance in Florida as easy as possible by providing up-to-date and reliable information. In our quest to find the [best Florida homeowners insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), we started by analyzing average rates from Quadrant Information Services for the largest companies in Florida by market share. 
Price isn’t everything, though, especially in a state like Florida that is facing an insurance crisis. We also analyzed coverage offerings and discounts that may be appealing to homeowners in the Sunshine State, third-party ratings and scores, digital tools, availability and corporate sustainability programs. We combined these metrics into a Bankrate Score on a scale of 0.0 to 5.0. Our Bankrate Score model may help you quickly see how the various companies stack up.

## Common Florida home insurance problems 
Florida homeowners have been dealing with a [turbulent home insurance market](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/florida-homeowners-insurance-crisis/) for nearly three decades for several reasons, the biggest being why so many Americans flock to Florida for vacation every year — location. 
Florida has 1,350 beautiful miles of coastline with flat topography and limestone bedrock. That, combined with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, means that about [77 percent of Floridians](https://coast.noaa.gov/states/florida.html) live on land inherently vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding. Location aside, here are some other common Florida homeowner problems:
  * Rates Icon
###  Climbing rates
Caret Down Icon
Inflation directly impacts the cost of labor and building materials needed to repair or rebuild homes. Along with supply chain issues, insurance companies pass these increases along to policyholders.
  * Mortgage Questions Icon
###  Limited carrier options
Caret Down Icon
If carriers aren’t turning a profit, they reserve the right to exit a state. Heavy hurricane losses coupled with [rampant legal system abuse](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/third-party-litigation/) have forced insurance companies out of business and into receivership. However, some experts argue that the market could be [making a turn for the better](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/florida-home-insurance-recovery/), with new home insurance companies entering the market and turning a profit for the first time in years. 
  * Online Error Icon
###  Unable to get insurance
Caret Down Icon
It can be difficult for some homeowners in moderate to high-risk areas to secure insurance coverage. This happens because their homes may not meet the insurer’s underwriting guidelines or the home may have had a lot of prior claims. There are even cases of policyholders who have been able to get coverage for many years receiving nonrenewal notices from carriers because they are no longer offering coverage in Florida or are changing their underwriting guidelines to incur less financial risk.
  * Mortgage Icon
###  Weighing the decision to move 
Caret Down Icon
Between how expensive Florida homeowners insurance is and how frequent the threats of a significant catastrophe loom, Floridians are in a tough spot. Many can't afford the cost of home insurance, but also can't afford to rebuild their homes if disaster strikes while they are uninsured. For many, the only viable option is to [sell their home and relocate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/why-florida-homeowner-decided-better-to-rent/) to a more affordable area.


Bankrate Insight
To be ready for a hurricane, you’ll need multiple insurance policies 
It’s a common misconception that you can file a claim for flood damage under your home insurance policy. However, that isn’t the case. Floods are not covered by your home insurance policy — if you don’t have flood insurance, you’ll need to pay for flood repairs out of pocket. In Florida, homeowners can also choose to exclude wind from their insurance policy. If you go that route, you’ll need a wind insurance policy or be prepared to pay for wind damage on your own. 
## Cheapest home insurance companies in Florida
Securing [cheap homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/) in Florida might be challenging. However, knowing which companies have more affordable average premiums can be a helpful starting point on your shopping journey. Remember that some providers cover wind loss from hurricanes, while others exclude this coverage. These exclusions can vary between ZIP code and policy type and could significantly impact insurance rates.
Home insurance rates are known to fluctuate frequently, but you can rely on Bankrate to offer you the latest options available. These are sample rates for comparative purposes only. Your quotes will differ.

### Florida homeowners insurance rates by city

If you’re often in the direct line of landfall hurricanes, your rates are likely to be more expensive than average. Meanwhile, some cities benefit from below-average rates because they see less serious storm damage.

###  [ Political gridlock hurting Florida homeowners? Previously Read ](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/fl-political-gridlock-homeowners-insurance/)
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the cheapest homeowners insurance company in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Based on Bankrate’s analysis of average rates, State Farm offers the cheapest home insurance policies in Florida. However, there’s no guarantee that State Farm will offer you the best rate. 
  * ###  Does my homeowners policy include additional living expenses? 
Caret Down Icon
Yes. If you cannot live in your home because it’s damaged due to a peril included in your policy, your home insurance can help you out. You typically have between 20 and 30 percent of your dwelling limit reserved for additional living expenses you may incur while you’re displaced, like hotel bills, food costs, laundry and more. 
  * ###  Will my Florida home insurance policy get canceled?
Caret Down Icon
Because every home insurance policy is unique, there’s no blanket method of knowing whether yours will get canceled. Your choice of insurer, that insurer’s financial strength, the details of your home and your claims history could all be factors of a home insurance non renewal. Some insurers choose to nonrenew homes of a certain age or building material, while others might back out of an entire region or state; these are actions that are far beyond your control. But even in Florida, where the home insurance market is rapidly changing, there are things you can do to lessen your risk of a home insurance cancellation or nonrenewal.
Keeping your home in good shape, trimming back bushes and trees that could fall on your home, reducing the amount of small claims and installing wind-mitigation features may all lower your risk of losing coverage. Sometimes, though, a cancellation is out of your hands. If your insurer exits the state or goes insolvent, you’ll be notified in advance so you have time to seek out another home insurance option.

### Bankrate Scores 
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well auto and home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [NAIC](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/), were analyzed.
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
