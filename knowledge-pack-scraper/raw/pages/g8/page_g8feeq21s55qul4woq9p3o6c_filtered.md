## Why GEICO Offers a Good Student Discount

Young drivers are usually quite expensive to insure since they lack driving experience. However, GEICO offers a good student discount because having good grades shows the insurer that you are responsible off the road, meaning you’re more likely to be responsible in the driver’s seat as well.

GEICO good student discounts vary by state, but it’s always worth the effort of checking to see if they are available in your location. Check out WalletHub's guide for more information on [Gieco](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/geico-car-insurance-review/62236) discounts.
