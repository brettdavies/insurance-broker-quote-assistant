Our rankings, ratings, and product reviews are unbiased. We do not rank or rate products or services based on our financial relationships with the companies that produce them. Our in-house research team collects extensive information used in our evaluation process, although we may not cover all options available in the marketplace. See our full [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies#methodology).
## **Key Takeaways**
* The average cost of car insurance increases by $872 per year after an at-fault accident, according to our research.
* If you have [accident forgiveness](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-increase-accident#accident-forgiveness) on your policy, your rate may stay the same after your first at-fault accident.
* Your [driving record](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-increase-accident#driving-record) has a major impact on what you pay for coverage. At-fault accidents, speeding tickets, and DUIs are among the things insurers consider when setting your premium.
Finding affordable car insurance after an accident may be a challenge. Our research found that a single at-fault accident can increase rates by more than $800 per year.
The cost of post-accident coverage varies by insurance provider, so shopping around may help you find a lower rate. Plus, there are other steps you can take to be sure you’re paying the most competitive premium possible, regardless of your circumstances.
## Do Car Insurance Rates Increase After an Accident?
Insurance premiums may rise after an accident, with at-fault drivers seeing the biggest increase in costs.
“This increase is due to the higher risk of future claims associated with an accident history,” said Loretta Worters with the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/).
The extent of premium increases may vary based on state laws, the severity of the accident, and other factors, Worters noted. Drivers with multiple accidents may see their premiums rise more than drivers with only one. Other factors (e.g., speeding tickets, DUIs) also play a role in determining how much rates go up.
“Different insurers have varying policies and rate structures, too, so rate increases can differ even for the same accident,” Worters said.
A U.S. News & World Report analysis found that the average annual premium for a driver with a single accident on their record is $2,940. That’s $872 per year higher than the average rate for a driver with a clean record: $2,068.
The rate analysis found that average costs differ from one insurer to the next.
## Cheapest Car Insurance Companies After an Accident
Among insurers in our analysis, USAA has the lowest average rate for drivers with a single at-fault accident on their record – $1,908 per year. Not everyone qualifies for USAA auto coverage though. The company only sells car insurance to active-duty members of the military, veterans, and their families.
Erie has the second-lowest average annual rate at $1,964, and Auto-Owners is third-cheapest at $2,264. Other companies with sample premiums below the national average are Nationwide, State Farm, Geico, and Progressive.
The table below shows the impact an at-fault accident has on average [premiums](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/insurance-premium) for the companies in our analysis.
**COMPANY** | **WITH A CLEAN RECORD** | **WITH ONE AT-FAULT ACCIDENT**
---|---|---
USAA | $1,335 | $1,908
Erie | $1,532 | $1,964
Auto-Owners | $1,619 | $2,246
Nationwide | $1,621 | $2,425
Geico | $1,778 | $2,781
Progressive | $1,848 | $2,827

## How Can I Lower My Insurance Rates After an Accident?
If an at-fault accident increases your rate, finding ways to save can become a priority. There are steps you can take to help keep car insurance costs as reasonable, including:
The company that was cheapest for you before an accident may not be cheapest after an accident. Our research found that average car insurance rates after an at-fault accident differ by insurer.
Shopping around and [comparing quotes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto) can help you find the lowest rate given your current circumstances. It’s generally recommended that you compare quotes from at least three companies.
When you review your policy, you may find that you’re carrying optional coverage you no longer need. It’s a good idea to review your coverage periodically to see if you need to make any adjustments. If you’re unsure about how to proceed, you can consult an agent for guidance.
Collision and comprehensive coverage, which protect against physical damage to your vehicle, typically have deductibles. If you carry this type of coverage, you can adjust your deductible – raising it will mean a lower premium. But take this step carefully. You have to pay your deductible when you file a [claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/insurance-claim), so be sure the amount you choose is one you can comfortably afford.
In most states, insurers are allowed to use a credit-based [insurance score](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/insurance-score) to help determine what you’ll pay for coverage. How you’ve managed your credit (e.g., your payment history) is one thing that can impact your score. Drivers with poor credit tend to pay more for car insurance than drivers with good credit.
Most insurers offer [discounts](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-discounts) that can help lower your costs if you qualify. For instance, many have a good student discount, based on meeting or exceeding a certain grade point average, that can help you save if there’s a young driver on your policy.
Bundling is another common discount. Some companies offer a discount if you bundle your car insurance with another type of coverage, like [home insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles).
Some insurers have programs that can tailor your rate based on the number of miles you drive. If you’re a low-mileage driver, a program like this may help you pay cheaper premiums.
Some insurers offer discounts for drivers who complete courses aimed at improving their driving skills. Start by asking your insurer about approved courses, and verify whether you’re eligible for a discount.
Some companies offer [telematics](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/how-do-those-car-insurance-tracking-devices-work) programs that tailor your rate based on how you drive. They use an app or other device to measure acceleration, braking, and other driving characteristics. If you demonstrate safe driving habits, a program like this can help you save money on coverage.
## How Does Accident Forgiveness Coverage Work?
If you have accident forgiveness coverage, your rate may not increase after an accident. Many insurance companies offer accident forgiveness as an optional coverage you can add to your policy.
Accident forgiveness requirements can vary. Some companies require that drivers are accident-free for a period of time to qualify. And while accident forgiveness is typically an optional add-on, some insurers may provide it for free to drivers who maintain a clean driving record.
## How Much Does My Driving Record Impact My Rate?
Your driving record can have a major impact on your car insurance costs. We analyzed average rates after an at-fault accident, as well as rates [after a speeding ticket](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-increase-accident) and a DUI.
The national average rate for a driver with a clean record is $2,068 annually. For a driver with a single at-fault accident, it’s $2,940, an increase of $872 per year. A driver with one speeding ticket pays an average of $2,503, which is $435 more than a driver with a clean record. The national average for a driver with a [single DUI](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-after-a-dui) is $3,538 – $1,470 higher than a driver with a spotless driving history.
The table below shows the impact of different driving-record factors on average costs, broken down by company.
**COMPANY** | **WITH A CLEAN RECORD** | **WITH ONE SPEEDING TICKET** | **WITH ONE AT-FAULT ACCIDENT** | **WITH ONE DUI**
---|---|---|---|---
USAA | $1,335 | $1,623 | $1,908 | $2,567
Erie | $1,532 | $1,765 | $1,964 | $2,541
Auto-Owners | $1,619 | $1,937 | $2,246 | $3,244
Nationwide | $1,621 | $2,032 | $2,425 | $3,281
Geico | $1,778 | $2,299 | $2,781 | $4,323
Progressive | $1,848 | $2,389 | $2,827 | $2,296
**National Average** | **$2,068** | **$2,503** | **$2,940** | **$3,538**
State Farm | $2,150 | $2,344 | $2,526 | $2,762
American Family | $2,170 | $2,617 | $3,068 | $3,300

## FAQ
This can depend on your insurance provider and the state where you live. Generally, filing a claim against your policy can lead to higher premiums. Being in an accident you didn’t cause may indicate to an insurer that you’re more likely to be in future accidents. So, even if you didn’t cause the accident, your costs could go up – but not as much as they would for an at-fault accident.
How long an accident affects your car insurance rate can depend on your insurer and where you live. Typically, a claim will remain on your record for three to five years
You can shop around for a better rate any time, but looking for the lowest premium may be especially important after an accident or other event that causes a rate increase. A company’s approach to evaluating your driving record and adjusting rates may vary, so you could find a lower rate by shopping around.
As an example, USAA has the lowest average rate we found for drivers after an accident: $1,908 annually. Farmers has the highest average premium at $4,926. That’s a variation of more than $3,000 per year.
Optional car rental coverage is offered by many insurers. In general, it helps with the cost of renting a car while your vehicle is in the shop for covered repairs. Some companies also cover other types of transportation that can come in handy if you're without your vehicle, such as public transit.
