## [How can I lower my car insurance after an accident?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-to-lower-car-insurance-after-accident-2140713954/)

One way you can lower your car insurance after an accident is by reducing the amount of coverage that you pay for. Another way to lower your premium is by comparing quotes from multiple insurers and finding a cheaper one. You can also take a defensive driving course and search for additional discounts from your current insurance provider. On average, an at-fault accident [raises premiums](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/how-much-does-insurance-go-up-after-an-accident/87986) by about 50%, and the increased cost lasts [3-5 years](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-long-does-it-take-for-car-insurance-to-go-down-2140685614/).

Yes, GEICO offers accident forgiveness in 47 states and the District of Columbia, with the exceptions being California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. GEICO accident forgiveness protects you from increases to your car insurance premium after your first at-fault accident.

The accident forgiveness feature may only be used once. How much your premium would rise without accident forgiveness depends on your state, driving record, and claim payment amount. The increase could range from 2% to 50%, or even more for a bodily injury claim.

## How to Get GEICO Accident Forgiveness

There are two ways to get GEICO accident forgiveness:

1. **Earn it as a free upgrade.** Policyholders who are 21 years of age or older can earn the upgrade by being accident-free for at least five years.
2. **Purchase accident forgiveness.** To purchase this protection, policyholders must meet minimum driving-record requirements. However, GEICO does not specify what these minimum requirements are on its website, as the rules and coverage terms vary by state.

Keep in mind that GEICO accident forgiveness is provided on a per-policy basis, not per driver. If you have multiple drivers on your policy, only one of them can have an accident forgiven.
