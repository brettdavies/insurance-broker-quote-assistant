### Important Disclosures

**Ad Disclosure:** Certain offers that appear on this site originate from paying advertisers. For full transparency, here is a list of our [current advertisers](/blog/advertisers/135281).

Advertising impacts how and where offers appear on this site (including, for example, the order in which they appear and their prevalence). At WalletHub we try to present a wide array of offers, but our offers do not represent all financial services companies or products.

Advertising enables WalletHub to provide you proprietary tools, services, and content at no charge. Advertising does not impact WalletHub's editorial content including our best picks, reviews, ratings and opinions. Those are completely independent and not provided, commissioned, or endorsed by any company, as our editors follow a strict [editorial policy](/edu/wallethub-editorial-policy/25756).

WalletHub is not a financial advisor. Our goal is to provide you with top-notch content, data, and tools. You are responsible for deciding what financial products and providers are best for your needs.

WalletHub members have a wealth of knowledge to share, and we encourage everyone to do so while respecting our [content guidelines](/community/guidelines/). This question was posted by WalletHub. WalletHub does not endorse any particular contributors and cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of any information posted.

Irrespective of whether an institution or professional is a paid advertiser, the presence of information on WalletHub does not constitute a referral or endorsement of the institution or professional by us or vice versa.

We work hard to show you up-to-date product terms, however, this information does not originate from us and thus, [we do not guarantee](/information-guarantee/) its accuracy. Actual terms may vary. Before submitting an application, always verify all terms and conditions with the offering institution. Please [let us know](/feedback/) if you notice any differences.

You can get the Progressive EFT discount if you pay your commercial auto insurance premium via an electronic funds transfer. This way, your check processing fees will be waived, and the commercial auto payments will be automatically deducted from your checking account. The discount varies based on where you live and your policy details, so the best way to get more information and set up your electronic funds transfer is to call Progressive commercial customer service at [(888) 806-9598](tel:+18888069598).

The Progressive EFT discount is not available to personal auto insurance policyholders, but these drivers can get an automatic payment discount. Progressive’s automatic payment discount works the same way as the commercial EFT discount—you save money when you set up your payments to be automatically deducted from your checking account, credit card, or debit card. The only real difference is that Progressive refers to the discounts by two different names, one for commercial clients and one for personal auto insurance customers.
