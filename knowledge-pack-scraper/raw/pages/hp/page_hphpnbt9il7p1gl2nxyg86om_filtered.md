Greetings PRS peeps. I just changed renters insurance from GEICO to Progressive. GEICO had assured me that 'additional personal property coverage' through them would cover my guitars, FM-3, amps, etc. But never saw that in the policy. Progressive told me today that they do not cover musical instruments through the renters coverage. Audio, and other electronics etc. are covered up to a very low limit, $500-2500.  
  
Question to the community: how best to insure one's guitar collection?

Get appraisal’s on the equipment you want to insure and get an insurance rider for that specific equipment. Also a good (even iPhone) video of your gear won’t hurt.

Got photos and receipts for everything. Will look into appraisals. Any thoughts on good insurance companies for a guitar collection? I'm particularly interested if anyone successfully got a claim covered. The big hazard in my building would be the sprinkler system, which flooded one or two apartments. Or theft...although the building is pretty safe.

State Farm insurance covered my Twin Reverb amp that was stolen and returned damaged. Replacement value. They told me that as long as I wasn’t earning money with my music stuff, it’s covered under Homeowners’ insurance. YMMV

I've always considered mine as general personal property and account for them in my overall limit. I haven't had any policies that limit losses on musical instruments, so they're fair game in the event of a loss.   
  
It may be different if you're a professional and you use them for your business.

That's a great story and just what I was looking for. I don't earn a cent playing guitar (although I am richer for it every day ;-))

I should have added the best answer will come from your particular insurance provider. I’m just a practicing question answerer lol.

I’ve moved all my music gear insurance to MusicPro. When State Farm stopped covering any gear used professionally, my agent recommended them as a highly rated insurance company well regarded in the insurance biz. Prices are reasonable, actually cheaper than what I was paying, and the process is online and simple. I recommend you give them a look.

Have been using Heritage for many years thanks to 11top's recommendation. Fantastic people. zero point zero issues.  
  
normal renters and homeowners insurance doesnt have the limits most of us need, and wont cover it leaving the house. personal articles/inland marine policies will cover the limits but not for commercial use.

I am also a Heritage Music Ins. customer and have been for quite some time now. They are the best out there IMHO. I had one claim and an almost claim with them. They are more than willing to start up a claim on something. House and renters insurance usually doesn't give adequate coverage. Then you have the issue of whether you make any money with your instruments. If you do you are then considered a professional and they won't cover you. That is what brought me to Heritage in the first place. I wanted coverage for my gear for playing gigs.

I'm another long-Heritage customer. I've never made a claim but they're easy to work with and I consider the rates quite reasonable.

Gosh my State Farm homeowners covers $50k or so for just contents.  
Riders from my experience get pretty expensive. If you've got 10 $15k core guitars...yeah I'd bone up unless you feel you live in a super safe area. But coverage typically would cover loss beyond theft....like a trio of Jack Russell's flying thru the guitar racks!

I though my existing renters policy would do the trick but the agent told me point blank that they would limit the payout on all my musical instruments to about what one CE24 costs. My building has seen a few sprinkler leaks, where everything in the resident's apartment gets a good soak. This is what I am concerned about. The only valuable things I own are my guitars.   
  
We've had no robberies that I've heard. Hauling off guitars in a burglary would be make for a slow getaway among other problems. So I most concerned about those sprinklers. Many thanks all.

I had to get an add on to my renter's to cover my equipment. After having some stolen and trying to file under my renter's insurance policy, I was told that since I used it at gigs that paid (considered a business by THEM) it was not covered.

That sucks - it's one thing if you assumed they'd be covered under your general policy and were wrong - but you specifically got an add-on just for them, your agent should have been up front and made clear that they can't be used for gigs. I hope you've moved on to another more honest company!

To be clear, I got the add on AFTER the "they aren't covered since you made money with them" revelation.

The Hartford has a musical insurance policy for those who make money with their instruments.  
It is underwritten by a few agencies, one being Heritage Insurance Agency.  
In my experience, the prices are much less expensive than Ovation Insurance. And you are allowed to use stated value as opposed to what they may find to be current market value.
