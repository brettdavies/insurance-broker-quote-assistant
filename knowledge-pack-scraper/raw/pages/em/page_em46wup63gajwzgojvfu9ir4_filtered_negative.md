It depends on which state you live in as _most_ states require you to be 50/55+ for the discount, but I have seen clients get pretty decent discounts from it. It stays on 3 years which is a bonus

Go with a different insurance company! Full coverage on my 24 year old SUV is $110 a month. Clean driving record.

Because I don’t trust that every driver has insurance coverage, even basic coverage.

Yes. Go to the NSC site though the GEICO policy site. Make sure you get the class for your state otherwise it isn’t acceptable. You take the course, make sure you take the survey at the end or it isn’t completed. You get a temp certificate then and the official one gets mailed to yh. They should send the certificate to GEICO and they update the discount. You can also send the certificate to GEICO. The discount depends on your state and how your policy is rated. Like it goes only to the principal operator of the vehicle.
It lasts 3 years. However after three years, it doesn’t fall if mid term but when the policy renews after it expires. So don’t retake it right at 3 years as it is a waste of money. Wait until it falls off your policy so you get the full benefit of the discount.

Geico got me with this scam, nowhere does it mention you have to be over 50, plus the website they link offers no way to create an account to take the course. At least in California
