Why Trust Us
Our rankings, ratings, and product reviews are unbiased. We do not rank or rate products or services based on our financial relationships with the companies that produce them. Our in-house research team collects extensive information used in our evaluation process, although we may not cover all options available in the marketplace. See our full [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles#methodology).
## **Key Takeaways**
  * USAA ranks at No. 1 in our rating of the best home and auto bundles, but it’s exclusively available to members with an eligible military connection. If you don’t qualify for USAA insurance, Travelers is the No. 2 best option.
  * A multi-policy or bundle discount is not the only way to lower your premium. Insurers typically offer several discounts that homeowners and drivers may be able to qualify for, such as by staying claim-free, being a loyal customer, installing security devices, and more.
  * Bundling your home and car insurance with the same company may give you a discount, but that doesn’t mean it’s always the best deal. You should always shop around to see whether bundling is worth it.

If you qualify for USAA membership, it's the best company in our rating for bundling your home and car insurance policies. However, only qualifying [members of the military](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-for-veterans) community can purchase its insurance products.   
  
USAA advertises a discount of up to 10% when you purchase homeowners and auto policies. This provider ranks impressively high at No. 2 in our home and car insurance ratings. It received positive feedback in our consumer surveys for its customer service and claims handling.  
  
USAA may not have as many optional endorsements as some of its competitors, but its policies offer some coverage that other insurers may not. For example, active-duty military personnel get uniform coverage under the homeowners policy.  
  
Even without the bundle discount, USAA is the No. 2 cheapest insurer for car insurance and No. 3 cheapest for home insurance, offering below-average rates.

Travelers is the No. 2 bundle option overall, but it’s the best choice for customers who don’t qualify for USAA insurance. While it ranks below average among the best and most affordable home insurance providers, Travelers is the No. 1 car insurance company, offering rates that are cheaper than average for auto insurance. When you buy both policies from Travelers, you may lower your premiums for both policies.  
  
This company is an excellent choice for homeowners with a certified green home and drivers with a hybrid car, as those eco-friendly options may qualify you for a discount. Travelers home insurance also offers optional coverage for green building materials.

The No. 4 company for bundled home and auto policies is Auto-Owners, which placed in the midrange for both our homeowners and car insurance ratings. Its home insurance ranks at No. 2 for customer service and No. 4 for claims handling, while its auto insurance also received positive feedback.  
  
Auto-Owners’ sample rates are slightly cheaper than average, even for policyholders who recently filed a home insurance claim or received a speeding ticket. You may get a discount for bundling qualifying policies. Other discounts are available as well.  
  
Keep in mind that Auto-Owners is not available in about half of the U.S. states, and you must typically speak to an agent to get a quote or file a claim.

Progressive is our No. 5 car insurance company and No. 8 for home insurance, so it’s another solid mid-tier option. For our home and auto bundle rating, Progressive is also at No. 5.   
  
Its car insurance rates are a bit cheaper than average for most driver categories, but its home insurance falls on the slightly more expensive side. Still, this insurer placed second in our consumer survey for the value of its home insurance.  
  
New customers who buy home and car insurance from Progressive can save over 20%, but the average savings is 7%, according to the company. For claims involving a loss to both your house and your car, you may only pay one deductible; however, to receive this benefit, your home insurance must be underwritten by Progressive Home, which is one of the insurers in Progressive’s network. If your policy is underwritten by an independent insurer in the network, that perk is not available.  
  
You may be able to bundle other types of insurance with Progressive as well, such as RV or boat policies. Other discounts include options for newly built homes and good students.

For car insurance, Farmers is No. 8 and has a sample premium much more expensive than the national average.

## Should You Bundle Your Car and Homeowners Insurance?
#### Pros:
  * **You may save money.** The multi-policy discount can range between 5% and 30%. 
  * **Managing your policies is easier.** Keeping your policies under one provider can simplify billing, renewals, and claims.
  * **You may enhance your coverage.** You may avoid gaps in coverage and become eligible for extra benefits.


#### Cons:
  * **A bundle may not be the cheapest option.** In some cases, mixing and matching providers may be cheaper than bundling.
  * **Your coverage needs may not be met.** You may not find one carrier with all your desired add-ons or specialized coverage.


## How To Find the Right Auto and Home Insurance Bundle
Whenever you purchase insurance, you should compare quotes from multiple providers. On some company websites, you can get an online quote for a home and auto insurance bundle, while others may require you to call customer service or find an independent agent.
While online quotes are often quick and convenient, independent insurance agents can do some of the heavy lifting for you in comparing different companies, so it’s often helpful to consult one.  

## How To Save Money When Bundling Auto and Home Insurance
Here are some ways to find the best deal when you’re buying home and auto insurance:  

  * **Shop Around:** You should compare home and auto insurance quotes from at least three providers before you make a decision. Consider comparing quotes for individual home or auto policies as well to see how the rates differ from the bundle pricing.
  * **Adjust Deductibles:** Having a higher deductible typically means you pay a lower premium. However, be careful not to select a deductible you can't afford in case of a covered loss.
  * **Only Select Essential Coverage:** Standard insurance policies typically come with basic coverage and the option to purchase endorsements for extra protection. If you want to save money, skip unnecessary add-ons.
  * **Ask About Discounts:** Aside from multi-policy discounts, home and auto insurers typically have other ways you can save, so inquire about available discounts.
  * **Track Premium Raises:** Take notice of annual premium increases. If your rate keeps going up, shop around for cheaper options.
  * **File Fewer Claims:** Keep in mind that your provider may raise your rates after you claim a loss. For minor damage, you may not want to file a claim if you can pay out of pocket, or the repair or replacement cost is less than the deductible. You can also reduce the risk of a loss by installing security devices, driving safely, and more.

## How We Rated Home Insurance Companies
To compile our ratings, we researched 21 home insurance companies, surveyed 1,125 home insurance policyholders, and analyzed a total of 10,482 product features.The following describes our approach to researching home insurance companies to guide prospective consumers.
### **U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Home Insurance Companies**
**1. We identified the companies people care most about.**
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about home insurance companies. We found 21 home insurance companies that offer home insurance policies in the U.S. We then narrowed our list down to 12 home insurance companies that had the highest volume of consumer searches online, a wide reach of consumers in various states, and a good complaint record according to data provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC reports complaint counts and annual premiums for insurance companies at the subsidiary level. The complaint data points were weighed by the size of the annual premium written, and we aggregated the weighted data points to calculate the NAIC score at the parent company level.
**2. We collected data needed to make product comparisons.**
With the companies determined, we conducted a comprehensive data collection on the features and plans of their home insurance policies to create a general summary of what consumers should know to assist with their purchasing decisions. We collected data via a consumer survey, company feature analysis, and information on premiums from Quadrant Information Services.
(a) We surveyed 1,125 home insurance customers (593 women and 532 men, with an average age of 55.8 years) to assess their satisfaction with their policies. The survey was conducted in March 2025, and the target respondents were individuals in the U.S. who currently have a home insurance policy from one of the 12 companies we identified. Survey respondents were located in the South (29.5%), Northeast (25.9%), Midwest (23.0%), and West (21.4%). We asked respondents to rate companies on the following topics:   

  * Value
  * Claim outcomes
  * Discounts
  * Customer service


(b) We collected data on 10,482 company features from the websites of the home insurance companies. These features were selected based on what consumers care most about according to our survey results, including:
  * State availability
  * Optional coverage add-ons
  * Purchasing options
  * NAIC complaint information


(c)To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with Quadrant Information Services. To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual homeowner profiles. The following represents our profiles for the premiums collected with Quadrant Information Services:
  * Applicant age:  

    * 56-year-old married applicant
    * 38-year-old married applicant
  * 720 FICO credit score
  * A 3-person family living in a wood frame house
  * Deductibles:  

    * $1000
    * $2500
  * Home age  

    * 2024 construction
    * Median home age for each state
  * Dwelling coverage from $300,000 to $800,000
  * Liability coverage from $100,000 to $300,000
  * Structures coverage at 10% of dwelling coverage
  * Loss of use coverage at 20% of dwelling coverage
  * Personal property coverage at 50% of dwelling coverage
  * Guest medical coverage limited to $5000


We also collected information for applicants with a 620 FICO score, as well as for an applicant with a single wind claim in the past 5 years, but these profiles were not included in our U.S. News Rating calculation.
**3. We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the product features (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment.
### **Conversion to Standardized Scores**
![Graph visualizing top standardized scores](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000196-ef18-d572-a796-ff5ad1c00000/unnamed-3.png?update-time=1752520502478&size=responsiveFlow640)
**4. We assigned weights to the standardized scores.**
To integrate standardized scores into our model, we used the survey results and industry knowledge to identify which scores should influence the purchasing decision more strongly. We also considered the heterogeneity of the scores. If a score was highly heterogeneous across products, we assigned more weight to that score. But, if a score was uniform for all products, we reduced the weight of that score. For example, if all plans offered dwelling coverage, we removed its scores from the model. This allowed us to enhance the model’s ability to detect meaningful differences by emphasizing the scores with stronger discriminant power. As a result, we arrived at the following weights:
(a) Price Data (40% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 30% premium information provided by Quadrant Information Services
  * 10% survey score for value


(b) Claim Handling (25% of the U.S. News Rating)  

  * 20% survey score for claim handling
  * 5% NAIC complaint information


(c) Coverage (15% of the U.S. News Rating)  

  * 3% core coverages (dwelling coverage, other structures coverage, loss of use coverage, personal property coverage, personal liability coverage, guest medical coverage)
  * 4% other optional coverages
  * 4% property replacement options
  * 2% water backup coverage
  * 2% valuable possessions coverage


(d) Discounts (10% of the U.S. News Rating)  

  * 7% discount options
  * 3% customer satisfaction with discount programs


(e)Customer Service  

  * 4% customer satisfaction with customer service
  * 3% availability of online signups and mobile applications
  * 3% customer satisfaction with the ease of opening a policy and filing claims

**5. We aggregated the weighted scores into the U.S. News Rating.**
We combined the weighted scores and converted the value to the U.S. News Rating on a 5-point scale, with 5.0 being the best possible rating.
