Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it.
Call an independent agent in your area with good reviews and see if someone else is cheaper. If they are, great. If not, then you know where you stand.

Every time you call for help with a flat, or a jump start, or a tow, or anything, it becomes a claims record.
AAA's highest tier membership is less than $10 a month.

In California it is 174 a year, or close to it.
And a tow claim does not increase your insurance, but too many tow claims can get you kicked out of roadside assistance

If you changed coverage in the middle of a policy term, your bill is PRO-RATED. You cannot divide payments evenly when you’re changing to higher coverage in the middle of the month and the middle of your policy term.& expect even payments. You’re also on a 5 pay and not a true monthly payment plan, making your payments even higher

Yes, it’s possible for your rates to be that much different for going from liability-only to including comprehensive and collision (I’m assuming that’s what you mean by “full coverage”).
You can try raising your deductibles for comp and collision. That will probably lower your premium by half. But ultimately, having comp and collision will probably, at best, be DOUBLE your liability-only premium. Probably closer to TRIPLE.
Don’t bother trying to argue with Geico about why they’re priced the way they are; they can’t really give you an explanation besides “that’s what our rates are, take it or leave it”
Just start shopping around for other carriers

But from $100 to $500? I understand it could be double for full or even triple but it’s 4 times more?

Yes. If you Google “average cost liability-only auto insurance” vs “average cost full coverage auto insurance”, I see various articles showing average jumps from like $61/mo to $199/mo, or 326%. Those are just averages though; your individual jump depends on the company, your profile, your deductibles, and dozens of other factors. A 400 or 500% jump is well within the bell curve of distributions when compared to a 330% average

Have you sat down with itemized bills from before the change and after the change and compared them to see where the increases were? There could have been a misunderstanding on the phone and more was changed, or you weren't quoted the right price for the change. Or it could just be that expensive for the changes made, for some reason that we couldn't imagine.
I once had my rate shoot up and after much insistence on my part, the company finally truly looked into it and realized that they had used someone else's (worse) credit rating. At that point I was so mad at how they had treated me I changed to a different company. And this was back in the day when you dealt with human agents in town.
So, pursue this, but it's also worthwhile to shop around every so often.

So if it has a salvage or branded title it can be more expensive to insure. If you made a coverage change right before a due date the next payment may be hire then go back down. But comp/collision is the mist expensive coverages you can carry. If the car is older they may not even be worth it. If you are paying 450 a month that's over 5000 a year for car insurance? Is your care even worth that?

That’s what I’m saying. I did not agreed to any of these and I been paying $447 a month where I paid only $487 for 6 months. Is this normal price change from liability to full? $447 a month VS $487 for 6 months.
