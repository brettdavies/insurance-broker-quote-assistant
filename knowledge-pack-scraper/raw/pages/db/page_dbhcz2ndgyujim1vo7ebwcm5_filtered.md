# GEICO insurance started charging so much.

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

I used to pay only $70/month only then it changed to $83. I added roadside assistance so my bill went to $103+ which I understand. My friend got in accident in November and had lability and he had to pay so much out of his pocket to fix his car so I got worried and called and changed my coverages to full and I was told that my bill was going to be $85 dollar more from what I’m paying now so I agreed. Now I see 3-4 month bill and saw they were charging me $447 each month and I called them and they said I agreed on this price and I asked them if they can send me recording or any proof and they just said we just listened to it and I agreed but we can’t send you any proof or recording. Is it possible to go insurance to go this high from $100 to almost $500. Just from liability to full. I was paying $400 something for 6 month with liability and now I’m paying 1 month $447? Am i missing something? My car are old and salvages.
