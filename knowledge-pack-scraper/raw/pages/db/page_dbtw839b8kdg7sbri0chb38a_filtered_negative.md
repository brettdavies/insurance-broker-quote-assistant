**Bankrate’s take:** Not all companies will [insure a driver with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) on their record. Drivers who are able to secure insurance coverage after such an incident may see a rate hike of 50 percent or more. Mississippi requires [SR-22 documentation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) from your insurance company following a DUI conviction, but not all insurance carriers offer this certification. If your license has been suspended after a DUI, you may need to switch insurance companies in order to acquire an SR-22 and get back on the road legally.

**Bankrate’s take:** Teen drivers have less experience behind the wheel and are [statistically more likely](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) to be involved in accidents than other age groups. The increased likelihood of young drivers filing claims can hike rates for all drivers under 20. Average premiums in the table above were determined based on a 16-year-old driver being added to their 40-year-old married parents’ policy.

**Bankrate’s take:** Mississippi is an [at-fault](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/) or tort state, meaning the driver responsible for a collision must compensate the other party for their losses. This includes [bodily injury](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/).
