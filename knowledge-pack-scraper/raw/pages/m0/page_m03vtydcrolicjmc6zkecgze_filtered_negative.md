Some insurance companies also offer discounts for security camera systems, especially if there’s professional monitoring involved. Amica, for example, does offer discounts for systems even _without_ monitoring, but the discounts are much better when there’s a third-party watching over your property.

Losing your home to a fire is a terrifying prospect, which is why every home should have a smoke alarm in every bedroom. Many insurance companies offer discounts for some kind of fire or smoke detector. But a _smart_ smoke detector can alert you even when you’re _not_ at home, which is helpful for protecting not just your loved ones but also your valuable assets.
