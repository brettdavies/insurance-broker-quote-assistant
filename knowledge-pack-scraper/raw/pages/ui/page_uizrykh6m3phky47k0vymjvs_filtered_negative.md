Full coverage insurance from Progressive [costs around $169 per month](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review#auto-cost "#auto-cost"), which is fairly average. Minimum liability from Progressive costs 4% less than the national average at $66 per month.
Progressive auto insurance is a good choice for drivers looking for a large national company. However, you can probably find better rates and a more reliable customer service experience with [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review"), Geico or American Family.
**To compare Progressive's homeowners insurance quotes**, ValuePenguin collected rates for every ZIP code across  6 states. Rates are for the median home age and value for each state. For example, the median home in California was built in 1975 and valued at $505,000. Our experts used median home values to estimate the rebuild cost in each state.
**To compare Progressive's renters insurance quotes,** ValuePenguin gathered rates from the  five largest cities in California. Rates are for a 25-year-old man who lives alone with no history of insurance claims.
