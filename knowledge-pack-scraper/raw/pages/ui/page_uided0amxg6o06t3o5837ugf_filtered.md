  100/300/100.
* Do you have a car loan, and can you afford to repair or replace your vehicle on your own? If the answer to the
  first is yes, you need [comprehensive and
  collision](/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html). If the answer to the second is no, you also need comprehensive and collision coverage.

  mind that a lower deductible means higher premiums.
* What would happen if you were involved in an accident with a driver who is uninsured or carries only [state minimum
  coverage](/auto-insurance/coverage/understanding-minimum-car-insurance-requirements.html), and it’s not enough to cover your damages? Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

* If you finance or lease your car, you may need GAP coverage if it’s less than a year old or if you put
