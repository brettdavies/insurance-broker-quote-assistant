To drive legally in the state of [Illinois](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/illinois-car-insurance/) in2025, every driver must carry certain limits of insurance coverage. This is for your protection as well as that of other drivers. Illinois is what’s known as a fault state. This means that the driver who causes the accident is responsible for covering the damages.
Illinois law requires that all drivers must have proof of insurance showing that they carry the required amounts of auto insurance coverage. If you can’t provide such proof, you could face steep penalties. The minimum amounts of Illinois [auto insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) required are listed below[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/illinois-car-insurance/state-laws-il/#footnote-1).
---|---
* $25,000 for bodily injury per person
* $50,000 for bodily injury per accident
* $20,000 for property damage per accident
* $25,000 per person
* $50,000 per accident
* * *
Illinois drivers must carry liability insurance in order to drive legally. If you are at-fault in an auto accident, [liability insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) is what will go toward paying the expenses for property damage or bodily injury of the other driver. It’s important to remember that liability insurance only covers injuries or damages that you cause to others. It never pays for injuries or damages to your own property.
The sad fact is that not all drivers carry insurance. Therefore, Illinois mandates all drivers carry [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) to cover bodily injury if they are harmed in an accident in which an uninsured driver is at fault. Note that the only coverage required is bodily injury. This can still leave your personal property at risk. Uninsured motorist coverage protecting against property damage can be added as an endorsement to your policy if you wish.
## What are state-mandated car insurance  _limits_?
Nearly every state requires its motorists to carry a certain amount of coverage to be considered a legal driver. The  _limit_ refers to the minimum amount of insurance coverage required by the state. These limits can — and in most cases should — be increased for an additional premium.
You’ll often see liability insurance limits written out as 25/50/20. Known as a  _split limit_, it separates the types of coverage offered. These coverage types are **per person**, **per accident**, and **property damage**.
The **p****er person** limit is the amount of coverage available to any single person that you injure in a car accident. Multiple people are covered up to the “per accident” limit.
**Per accident** applies to the total amount that your car insurance company will pay out for bodily injury that you cause, assuming that you have injured more than one person in the same accident. While this is the total amount that your insurance company will pay out for bodily injury, they will never pay over the “per person” limit for any single person.
**Property damage per accident** refers to the amount that an insurance company will pay if you damage another person’s property in an auto accident.

Operating a motor vehicle without the proper auto insurance coverage can bring about some stiff consequences. These can include fines and the loss of your driving privileges. Penalties for failure to show proof of insurance in Illinois are as follows[[2]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/illinois-car-insurance/state-laws-il/#footnote-2).
---|---
$500 - $1,000  |  Driver’s license suspension for up to three months. $100 reinstatement fee.

**[Collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/)****:** Collision coverage is important if you want to have your own vehicle covered. This coverage helps you to repair damages done when you are involved in a collision with another vehicle or fixed object (other than animals).
**[Comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/)****:** Comprehensive coverage also covers your vehicle. This coverage typically helps with most other damages your vehicle might sustain (including collisions with animals). When paired with collision, these two are often referred to as full coverage.
**[Gap Coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/)****:** If you are leasing or financing your vehicle, gap coverage could be a smart option. Because automobiles depreciate in value so quickly, this coverage pays the difference in the actual cash value of your vehicle and what you still owe on the loan.
**[Roadside assistance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/)****:** If you find yourself broken down on the highway, this coverage can be very helpful.
**[Medical payments](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/medical-payments-coverage-auto-insurance/)****:** This added coverage can go towards the medical bills for injuries sustained by another driver. It covers you and those in your vehicle up to the policy limits (typically between $5,000 - $10,000).
**[Uninsured motorist property damage (UMPD)](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/)****:** While Uninsured motorist coverage is required by Illinois, it only covers bodily injury. To have your property protected, you must purchase uninsured motorist property damage coverage separately.
* * *
Illinois is a diminished value state, meaning drivers are allowed to recover [diminished value](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/diminished-value-claims/) from the at-fault party’s insurance company. When your vehicle experiences an accident, even if it is fully repaired to its pre-loss condition, the resale value decreases. The involvement in a collision makes your car’s value lesser than similar vehicles that have not experienced an accident. A diminished value claim allows you to recoup the losses you might experience when selling your car.
