**_Overview:_**_Car insurance rates are calculated by estimating the cost of future claims and establishing prices to provide funding to cover them. Various sources of information are used to determine rates, like accident statistics, vehicle repair and replacement costs, along with personal factors for calculated premium such as age, location and claims history. Understanding what affects car insurance rates may help you identify ways to save money._
## Rate vs. premium
Let’s first look at the difference between **rate** and **premium** :
  * **Rate** — the price of insurance, set at the group level, based on common factors shared by multiple policyholders, like age or location.
  * **Premium** — the price of insurance, set at the individual level, based on the common factors that apply to the policyholder.


## How are car insurance rates calculated?
Rates are calculated by estimating the cost of future claims and establishing a pricing structure that provides funding to cover them. These estimates come from data analysis based on information like accident statistics, vehicle repair and replacement costs, vehicle safety features and driving behaviors. Rates apply to groups of policyholders who share common factors such as age or location.
## How are car insurance premiums calculated?
Premiums are calculated by starting with the rate that applies to the individual policyholder based on common factors like age and location and then adjusting it for personal factors like driving history to better reflect the driver and the vehicle being insured. The table below includes the factors most companies use, the reason why they’re used and how they can affect premiums.

[Age](https://www.iihs.org/research-areas/older-drivers)
Age often correlates with driving experience and accident likelihood.
Premiums will typically be higher for drivers under 25 and over 65.
[Location](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/driving-tips-for-traffic-jams)
Location indicates the likelihood of being in an accident.
Drivers residing in higher traffic areas tend to have higher premiums.
[Driving record](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/the-real-costs-of-a-non-moving-or-moving-violation)
Driving record indicates driving behavior.
Drivers with more traffic violations on their record typically have higher premiums.
Claims history
Claims history helps determine the likelihood and frequency of future claims.
Drivers with more claims often have higher premiums.
Annual mileage
The amount of time spent on the road indicates the likelihood of accidents.
Drivers who drive more frequently tend to have higher premiums.
Vehicle type
Vehicle type indicates the potential repair or replacement costs.
Vehicles that cost more to repair/replace typically cost more to insure.
[Policy choices](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well)
Coverages and deductibles determine the insurer’s potential payout.
Policies with higher limits or lower deductibles typically have higher premiums.
## How can I lower my car insurance premium?
Here are some potential ways to help you save money on your auto insurance:
  * **Take advantage of discounts** — many companies offer [discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts) for maintaining [safe driving habits](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) or [bundling auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/bundling) with another type of policy such as [homeowners](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners) or [renters](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/renters).
  * **Consider adjusting deductible amounts** — choosing higher deductibles may help lower your premium.
