***Overview:*** *Car insurance rates are calculated by estimating the cost of future claims and establishing prices to provide funding to cover them. Various sources of information are used to determine rates, like accident statistics, vehicle repair and replacement costs, along with personal factors for calculated premium such as age, location and claims history. Understanding what affects car insurance rates may help you identify ways to save money.*

## Rate vs. premium

Let’s first look at the difference between **rate** and **premium**:

* **Rate** — the price of insurance, set at the group level, based on common factors shared by multiple policyholders, like age or location.
* **Premium** — the price of insurance, set at the individual level, based on the common factors that apply to the policyholder.

## How are car insurance rates calculated?

Rates are calculated by estimating the cost of future claims and establishing a pricing structure that provides funding to cover them. These estimates come from data analysis based on information like accident statistics, vehicle repair and replacement costs, vehicle safety features and driving behaviors. Rates apply to groups of policyholders who share common factors such as age or location.

## How are car insurance premiums calculated?

Premiums are calculated by starting with the rate that applies to the individual policyholder based on common factors like age and location and then adjusting it for personal factors like driving history to better reflect the driver and the vehicle being insured. The table below includes the factors most companies use, the reason why they’re used and how they can affect premiums.
