In 1936, Leo and Lillian Goodwin launched an auto insurance company during the Great Depression, known as the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), initially serving federal employees and select military personnel.

Lillian Goodwin played a crucial role, in managing marketing, accounting, and underwriting, enabling the company to write 3,700 policies and hire 12 staff in its first year.

In 1948, investment banker Lorimer Davidson joined GEICO, connecting the company with influential investors.

Davidson introduced GEICO insurance to Benjamin Graham, who would become Warren Buffett’s mentor and a key investor.

The investment from Benjamin Graham laid a strong foundation for GEICO’s future growth.

These early connections and investments helped establish GEICO as a major force in the insurance industry.

Warren Buffett first encountered GEICO in 1951, sparking his interest and leading to his initial stock purchase.

Leo Goodwin retired in 1958, and Lorimer Davidson took over, later opening the company’s new headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in 1959.

GEICO expanded significantly in the 1960s, reaching over 1 million policyholders by 1964 and generating $150 million in premiums by 1965.

The passing of the Goodwins in the 1970s challenged the company, revealing issues in its loss reserves from rapid expansion.

GEICO used this challenge to improve its underwriting and reserving practices, solidifying a stronger fiscal reputation by the late 1970s.

Buffett increased his investment in GEICO in 1976, purchasing an additional 1 million shares.

The 1980s focused on prudent underwriting and growth, highlighted by the launch of 24/7 claims service in 1980.

In 1993, Olza "Tony" Nicely became chairman and CEO, initiating a new strategy to broaden GEICO’s customer reach and increase advertising.

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway acquired a major stake in GEICO in 1995, leading to GEICO becoming a subsidiary by 1996.

These strategic moves helped GEICO become a leader in the insurance industry and secured Buffett’s long-term involvement.

In the 21st century, GEICO cemented itself as a household name for insurance by introducing its iconic Gecko mascot and its Cavemen advertising campaign—both still utilized in its modern marketing efforts.

Since then, the company has continued to grow and provide its millions of policyholders with a variety of perks and features to better suit their needs.

This includes programs, such as the GEICO Auto Repair Xpress® that helps prioritize your vehicle when it needs to be fixed, roadside assistance, the GEICO mobile app, pet insurance, affordable home and auto bundles, and much, much more.

Over 17 million policyholders trust GEICO with their insurance needs as they continue to innovate affordable products while maintaining personalized customer service.

## Should You Enroll in the GEICO DriveEasy?

DriveEasy is GEICO’s safe-driving program that rewards users with savings based on driving behavior tracked through the GEICO Mobile app.

The app automatically logs behaviors like braking, distance driven, and phone usage, which contributes to a safe driving score using telematics based on the company's algorithm.

DriveEasy includes features like trip tracking, safe driving reminders, and a crash assist function to help file claims, aiming to enhance user safety and convenience.

GEICO uses this score to adjust your insurance rate at each renewal; safer driving may lead to discounts, while riskier driving can increase rates.

Signing up might come with an initial discount, and safe driving could yield up to a 25% savings on premiums, though riskier behavior may reduce or eliminate discounts altogether.

Furthermore, if you live in a city, due to the nature of urban driving requiring often a lot of short braking and quick lane changes, the app may not benefit you as a driver either.

There are also risks of being penalized due to the misinterpretation of phone usage while driving and you'll need to be comfortable handing over your data.

Overall, GEICO DriveEasy can be an excellent tool for safe drivers to be rewarded through discounts but whether or not it's up to you will vary based on the many factors listed above.

## Does GEICO Cover Rental Cars?

Start by checking your GEICO auto insurance policy. Most personal auto insurance covers rental cars within the U.S. for damages and liability, however, everyone’s individual coverage will vary.

Next, consider the type of rental vehicle you have. If it’s similar in value to your car, your existing coverage should be enough. However, for a luxury rental, like a sports car, the rental company’s insurance may be worth it for added protection.

Lastly, personal auto insurance might not cover charges like “loss of use” or business rentals.

For added peace of mind, think about adding a Loss-Damage Waiver (LDW) from the rental company to fill in any coverage gaps, and remember, knowing your coverage can save you from paying for extra, duplicate insurance.

## Does GEICO Cover Windshield Replacement?

GEICO’s comprehensive auto insurance coverage covers windshield or glass damage in most cases, providing you with a quick and easy claim process to get your repairs or replacement done seamlessly.

You can report damage online and set up an appointment that works for you.

If your window is completely broken, protect your car’s interior by parking it in a garage or covering the opening, and handle any broken glass carefully to avoid injury.

## Does GEICO Have Gap Insurance?

Unfortunately, one of the few auto policy options not offered by GEICO is gap insurance. While this is not ideal for all drivers, there are still plenty of ways to personalize your coverage that may still work for your needs.

## Does GEICO Cover Blown Head Gaskets?

If you have GEICO’s Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI), you may be able to cover a blown gasket affecting your vehicle and a lot more.

MBI covers repairs for all mechanical parts on your vehicle, excluding maintenance or regular wear and tear.

The coverage is designed to help get you back on the road quickly with high-quality repairs, minimizing the inconvenience of downtime.

However, remember not to start any repairs until you receive authorization from GEICO. Otherwise, if you don't allow your carrier to complete its investigation, you may put your claim approval at risk.
