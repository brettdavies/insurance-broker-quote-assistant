**Consumer satisfaction.** Amica ranked above average for customer satisfaction in two recent J.D. Power studies. It also draws a very low rate of consumer complaints to state regulators.

**Platinum** **Choice coverage package.** This upgraded policy offers extra coverage and higher limits.

**Dividend policies in some states.** Not many insurance companies offer you the chance to earn dividend payments on your policy.

### Where Amica home insurance falls short

**Ability to buy online.** We were able to get a homeowners insurance quote on the Amica website, but there was no way to buy the policy online. Instead, we were given a phone number to call.

**No availability in Alaska or Hawaii.** Homeowners in these states will need to seek other options.

**Dwelling replacement** that pays up to 30% above your coverage limit to rebuild or repair your home.

**Personal property replacement** to cover the cost of replacing personal items with brand-new versions.

Get Started

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Amica scores highly on this measure, drawing a very low proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

**Third-party ratings:** Amica was ranked well above average for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s latest Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[1] It also scored highly in J.D. Power’s annual Home Insurance Study.[2]

* ### What Reddit users say about Amica

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like home insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  Reddit comments about Amica homeowners insurance are largely positive. Many people praise the company’s customer service and handling of claims. Some say that they’ve stuck with Amica even when its prices are higher than those of other insurers because they feel the company’s service is worth it.

  That said, not all Redditors have good things to say about Amica. Several people report drastic rate increases or problems with claims.

## How to file a claim with Amica

Amica offers several ways to file a claim: over the phone, through its website or using its app. Amica recommends taking pictures of any damage before you start making repairs. You’ll also want to prevent further damage if possible, such as by tarping your roof.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

## How to contact Amica customer service

**Phone:** Home insurance policyholders can call 800-242-6422, seven days a week.

**Email:** You send an email through the submission form on Amica’s contact page.

**Live chat:** Amica’s claims live chat is available Monday through Saturday. General customer service representatives are available to chat seven days a week.

**In person:** You can use the search function on Amica’s website to find a local office to visit.

Amica also offers customers the ability to file and track a claim online. The site includes a unique feature called Contractor Connection, which matches customers with vetted home improvement specialists.

## Amica home insurance vs. competitors

### Amica home insurance vs. State Farm

The biggest differences between Amica and State Farm are:

**Dwelling coverage.** State Farm generally includes [extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost) with its standard policies. That means it’ll add a little extra to your dwelling coverage limit in case it costs more than expected to rebuild your home after a disaster. Amica includes this coverage in its upgraded Platinum Choice package.

**Smart-home devices.** Both State Farm and Amica encourage the use of certain smart-home technology. State Farm offers a free Ting device, which monitors your electrical system, to policyholders in many states. Meanwhile, Amica offers discounts on some devices and will lower your homeowners premium in many states if you install smart-home technology.

Check out our [State Farm home insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/state-farm-home-insurance-review) for more details

### Amica home insurance vs. GEICO

The primary differences between Amica and GEICO home insurance are:

**Business structure.** Amica sells its own policies, while GEICO works with third parties. GEICO will pair you with a company of its choosing, and you’ll have to contact that insurer directly if you ever need to file a claim.

**Online policy details.** GEICO offers limited coverage details on its website, since your options will depend on which insurer you’re matched with. But Amica describes its standard and Platinum Choice policies in some detail, enabling you to decide whether either one would be a good fit.

## Frequently asked questions

### What other types of insurance does Amica offer?

Amica offers several insurance products, including auto, life, umbrella and boat. Learn more in our reviews of [Amica auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/amica-auto-insurance-review) and [Amica life insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/life/amica-life-insurance-review).

### Where can I get an Amica home insurance quote?

Quotes are available through Amica's website or by phone.

### Can I bundle Amica insurance policies?

Yes, Amica offers discounts as high as 30% for bundling home, auto, life or umbrella policies.

### Why is Amica quoting me higher rates than other companies?

Every insurance company has a different formula for calculating premiums. That means the cheapest option for your neighbor might not be the cheapest one for you. Also, insurers often have slightly different estimates for how much it will cost to rebuild your home. For example, a company that thinks it’ll cost $400,000 to rebuild your home may charge a higher premium than one that sets the replacement cost at $360,000.

When comparing [home insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/home-insurance-quotes), check how much coverage is included in each policy and which deductibles apply. You may also want to weigh each company’s track record of consumer complaints. (You can find this information in NerdWallet’s [home insurance reviews](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-reviews).)

### Why does my dwelling coverage from Amica not match what my home is worth?

The dwelling coverage limit on a homeowners policy is the maximum amount your insurance company will pay to rebuild your home if it’s destroyed. This amount may not match the [value of your home](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/how-to-determine-home-value) as determined by an appraiser for selling purposes. That’s because the appraised value includes the land your house sits on, which isn’t a factor in your rebuilding cost.

**Star rating methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts, claims process and website functionality. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or star ratings.

Here’s how we weighted each category to come up with our list of the best home insurance companies:

* Consumer experience (40%).
* Financial strength (30%).
* Coverage (25%).
* Discounts (5%).

Read our [full home insurance ratings methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-home-insurance) for more details.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
