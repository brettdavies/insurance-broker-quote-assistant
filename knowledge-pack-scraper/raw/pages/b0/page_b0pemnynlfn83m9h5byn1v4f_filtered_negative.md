# How to Spot and Fight Against False Advertising
[Home](https://os-legal.com "Go to Olivier & Schreiber PC.")[Blog](https://os-legal.com/category/blog/ "Go to the Blog category archives.")How to Spot and Fight Against False Advertising
February 12, 2025
False advertising isn’t just frustrating—it’s illegal. Companies that mislead consumers through dishonest claims or deceptive practices can erode trust and cause financial harm. At [Olivier & Schreiber PC,](https://os-legal.com/about-the-firm/) we’ve seen firsthand how these tactics impact individuals, and we’re committed to holding businesses accountable. Understanding how to identify and combat false advertising is crucial, and as experienced consumer protection attorneys, we’re here to help.
## What Is False Advertising?
False advertising occurs when a company uses deceptive, untrue, or exaggerated statements to sell a product or service. For example, a business might claim a product has benefits it doesn’t possess, hide critical costs in fine print, or use misleading images that distort the reality of what’s being offered. Whether it’s an online retailer overstating discounts or a manufacturer misrepresenting their product’s safety, these practices are not only unethical but also violate consumer protection laws.
Both federal and state-level legal frameworks are designed to protect consumers from such deception. Federal laws, such as those enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), prohibit businesses from disseminating misleading information. Meanwhile, California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and False Advertising Law (FAL) offer additional protections to residents of our state. However, recognizing false advertising in the real world requires vigilance and awareness.
## How to Spot False Advertising
Often, false advertising can be subtle, but there are red flags to watch for. Start by examining the following elements of any marketing material or sales process:
1. **Vague or Overblown Claims:** Be cautious when a product promises “miracle results” or uses language like “guaranteed” without offering detailed proof. If something feels too good to be true, it probably is.
2. **Fine Print Discrepancies:** Read the fine print on any advertisements. Hidden fees, contradictory terms, or exclusions can often be buried where they think you won’t look. For instance, an attractive “50% off” offer might come with unspoken conditions that make it hard to qualify.
3. **Before-And-After Images or Testimonials:** Dishonest companies sometimes use fabricated testimonials or staged images to create an illusion of success that real users won’t experience. Look for authentic, verified customer reviews instead.
4. **False Comparisons or Statistics:** Ads may use misleading comparisons, such as pitting their product against outdated models, or they may cite studies without giving sources or legitimate results.
5. **Pressure Tactics:** If an offer insists the deal is “only available today” or pushes you to act immediately, pause. Scarcity tactics are often employed to prevent careful decision-making.
By looking critically at advertising materials, you can develop the instincts necessary to distinguish legitimate offers from dishonest marketing.
## Fighting Back Against Deceptive Practices
If you’ve been a victim of false advertising, know that you’re not powerless. Filing complaints with the FTC or California’s Department of Consumer Affairs is often a good starting point. Keep a record of all advertisements, receipts, or communications that demonstrate misrepresentation. Document everything—you’ll need these materials if you pursue legal action.
At Olivier & Schreiber PC, we’ve successfully represented consumers in pursuing justice against companies engaging in deceptive practices. Whether it’s securing refunds, stopping illegal marketing campaigns, or obtaining compensation for damages, we bring decades of [consumer protection ](https://os-legal.com/practice-areas/consumer-protection/)experience to each case.
