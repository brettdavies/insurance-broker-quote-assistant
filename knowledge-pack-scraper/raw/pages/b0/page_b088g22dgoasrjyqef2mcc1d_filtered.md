The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global.

## Average car insurance in Chesapeake by rating factor

There are [factors](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/) that can impact the cost of car insurance, some of which are within your control, and others that are not. Rating factors refer to specific characteristics that pertain to your profile, such as age, claims history, and credit score. Although companies typically consider the same factors, they may apply varying weights to them. For example, one insurer may place a greater emphasis on your credit score, while another may focus more on previous claims.   
  
Keep in mind that the right coverage and insurance company for you can shift over time. As you accumulate more driving experience and age, your profile will transform. It's crucial to obtain new quotes on your auto insurance periodically to ensure that you're still receiving the most favorable rates possible.

#### Q: I didn't have an accident — Why is my insurance going up?

A: Chesapeake car insurance rates are influenced by end-of-year earnings, which reflect the balance between the revenue generated from premiums and the cost of paying out claims to insureds. Even if you have a clean driving record with no prior claims, insurers may still adjust their rates to compensate for the increasing cost of doing business in specific areas.

### Auto insurance premiums by age in Chesapeake

The [age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) of the driver is one of the most important factors when it comes to car insurance premiums. Insurance companies have data to help them identify the age group most likely to file claims. [Teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/), for example, have the highest number of accidents and, therefore, face the highest premiums. In Chesapeake, there's a $1,583 difference in rates between teenage drivers and those in their 20s for a six-month policy, making it the most significant price gap between any two age groups for a new car insurance policy.   
  
It might be shocking to see how expensive it is to insure a young driver, but keep in mind that insurance companies have to balance the cost of paying claims. They charge the riskiest drivers higher rates to keep their business going, knowing that accidents will occur.

#### Zebra Tip: The cheapest companies for Chesapeake drivers between ages 20 and 40 are USAA and Nationwide

---

The data shows that the largest demographic of drivers in Chesapeake falls in the age range of 20-40. This particular group usually pays $938 every six months for their car insurance. Opting for one of these insurers can result in savings of up to 27%. Keep in mind that USAA is only available to members, so be sure to check your eligibility.

### Auto insurance premiums for minimum coverage in Chesapeake

When shopping for auto insurance, one detail that can significantly impact your rates is the level of coverage you choose. The numerous options available can be overwhelming, so it's critical to take the time to consider your choices and specific needs. According to our research, just 33% of Chesapeake drivers have opted for the minimum coverage required by the state. While this technically meets Virginia's legal requirements, it also means that you're more vulnerable in the event of an accident.   
  
Including collision coverage or comprehensive coverage (also known as "[full coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/best-full-coverage-auto-insurance/)" when both are present) in your policy can lead to a significant increase in your rates. However, by selecting the right deductible, you can have more control over how much you pay. The higher the deductible, the lower your rates will be. If you prefer a lower deductible, then you'll have to pay a higher premium. It's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider your budget before making a decision.  
  
[Roadside assistance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) and [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) are two additions that can impact your insurance rates. They provide additional peace of mind. Uninsured motorist coverage helps protect you from drivers who do not carry auto insurance or do not have enough coverage. Although these extras will increase your premiums, they are worth considering, and The Zebra recommends carrying them for unexpected situations where you and your vehicle may require additional assistance.

#### Q: Can I lower my car insurance coverage?

**A: Possibly — if your vehicle is paid off.**

If you opt to finance or [lease](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-leased-vehicle/) your car, a specific level of coverage may be required. However, if you fully own your car, it may be worthwhile to think about whether dropping comprehensive or collision coverage is a viable choice. We advise using a source like Kelley Blue Book to determine your car's true market value. Generally, if your car isn't worth more than $4,000, collision coverage isn't necessary. Keep in mind that the risk of dropping collision coverage is that you'll have to cover the cost of repairs if you're in an accident.

33% of our customers in Chesapeake opt for the minimum level of coverage, but this may not be the best option for everyone. While we understand this is a budget-friendly solution, it does leave you at risk for damages that exceed your liability limits. Virginia's 30/60/20 liability limits provide coverage for damage you cause up to $30,000 per person in bodily injury, $60,000 per accident in bodily injury and $20,000 for property damage. While this may be sufficient for most standard car accidents, it might not be for bodily injury claims or multi-vehicle accidents.

### Chesapeake car insurance rates by credit score

While it may seem like your credit score and your car insurance rates are not related, the reality is that they are more intertwined than you might assume. In most states, such as Virginia, credit score is one of the factors that insurance companies consider when determining rates. This is because individuals with lower credit scores are more likely to file insurance claims, are more prone to having gaps in their car insurance coverage, and typically take greater risks while driving. As a result, insurance companies must factor in these risk elements when calculating premiums.  
  
Chesapeake drivers with poor credit scores (300-579) pay 106% more in insurance rates compared to drivers with excellent credit scores (800-850), which is a significant difference to take note of. This information can be quite shocking! Fortunately, our data shows that the majority of Chesapeake drivers have an "Excellent" credit score. USAA provides the most affordable insurance for drivers in this credit category.

![car insurance in Chesapeake by credit score]()

### Auto insurance rates with an at-fault accident

[Insurance claims](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/) are commonly related to at-fault accidents and [collisions](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/). An at-fault accident in 2025 caused an average monthly increase of between $50 and $67, which is 51% higher than the rate for drivers who haven't been involved in accidents. Auto-Owners offers the most affordable insurance rates in Chesapeake for individuals who have had an at-fault accident.   
  
To ensure that your auto insurance rates remain affordable, regardless of where you live, it's crucial to maintain a clean driving record by avoiding accidents and citations. Speeding citations, reckless driving charges, DUIs and DWIs, and at-fault accidents can all result in increased rates. Your premium will be affected for several years depending on the type of citation or ticket you receive. Typically, at-fault accidents and speeding tickets stay on your record for three to five years, while DUIs or DWIs can have a longer-lasting impact on your rates.

## Why is car insurance in Chesapeake so expensive?

There are numerous reasons why auto insurance in Chesapeake is pricey. One of the primary factors is the high cost of living in the city, which causes car insurance companies to raise their rates. Apart from your coverage level, driving record, and credit report, there are additional elements that determine your insurance premiums.

To gain insight into why car insurance in Chesapeake is expensive, read the following rundown, regardless of your driving profile.

![location]()

Location

Alongside your credit score and driving history, where you live in Chesapeake is one of the key contributing factors to your insurance premiums. The frequency of crime or theft and the number of uninsured drivers vary depending on the ZIP code. Some parts of the city are more susceptible to criminal activity, making them more dangerous for insurance companies. As a result, if you live (and drive) in a high-crime area, you will likely pay more for auto insurance than someone who lives in a safer location. The good news is that the difference between the cheapest and most expensive ZIP codes in Chesapeake is only about $4 per month

![drivers]()

Number of drivers

You may be a very safe driver with a flawless driving record, but as we know, insurance rates are not always within our control. According to our data, roughly 29% of drivers in Chesapeake are not presently insured. This number is not the highest compared to other Virginia cities, but it is still substantial. Insurance companies look at this information to help them determine the risk of a certain area.

![weather]()

Weather

Although its location near the sea makes it a desirable location for many people, Chesapeake is also in a precarious location as far as severe storms. In 2022, the Virginia Beach metropolitan area ranked in the top ten locations in the U.S. for both storm surge risk and hurricane wind damage risk.[[1]](#footnote-1)Insurers take climate into account when calculating rates, so areas with risk of [hurricanes](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-hurricane-damage/), [tornadoes](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-tornado-damage/) and other [natural disasters](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/) typically pay more than areas of the country that are lower risk.

#### Zebra Tip: Comprehensive coverage and uninsured property damage coverage are good to have in Chesapeake

---

[Comprehensive coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) encompasses damage resulting from weather, animals, and vandalism. It is highly recommended to include comprehensive coverage in your Chesapeake car insurance policy, especially if you own a new or valuable vehicle.

Moreover, in areas with a high prevalence of uninsured drivers, we suggest obtaining [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) (UMPD). In case of damage to you or your vehicle caused by an underinsured or uninsured driver, this coverage offers assistance. With a lower deductible and cheaper premiums than collision coverage, UMPD is an affordable option. In addition, a UMPD claim may result in a much lower rate increase compared to a collision claim, potentially saving hundreds of dollars.

---

## Bundling insurance policies in Chesapeake

Despite the increase in car insurance rates, there are ways to cut down on costs. One way to do this is by [bundling your home and auto insurance policies](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/) to take advantage of potential savings. Many policyholders have been able to secure discounts worth up to 10%, making this an appealing option for people who want to save money while still having adequate coverage.   
  
If your home and auto policies are currently separate, it only takes a few minutes to ask about bundling them. When looking for a new insurance provider, explore bundling options to help make your coverage more affordable.

Many factors are taken into consideration when determining insurance rates. Although many of these factors are not within your control, there are still things you can do as a driver to keep your car insurance affordable. We strongly suggest shopping around for [auto insurance quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) so that you can thoroughly compare your options and find the [most affordable rate](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/how-to-shop/best-cheap-auto-insurance/).   
  
By educating yourself and exploring various car insurance providers, you can find the appropriate coverage for your needs and budget. It is a good idea to get quotes frequently, particularly when personal factors change, such as significant birthdays or credit improvements, as these events can help you save money. It may feel uncomfortable to switch insurance providers, but some providers are just more expensive than others, so don't be afraid to make a change.
