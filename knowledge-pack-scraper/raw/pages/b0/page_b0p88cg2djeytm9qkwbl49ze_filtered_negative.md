Editor's rating |
USAA is an excellent choice for auto insurance. It offers [cheaper rates than State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-usaa-vs-state-farm-car-insurance#quotes "#quotes") for eligible drivers and has excellent customer service. But most drivers don't qualify, because availability is limited to active-duty military members, veterans and their families.
State Farm does not offer a military discount. But they have [a number of discounts available](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-usaa-vs-state-farm-car-insurance#discounts "#discounts") to help lower your premium.
