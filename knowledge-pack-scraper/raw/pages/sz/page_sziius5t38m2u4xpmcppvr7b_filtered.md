## What does umbrella insurance cover?

If you are a high-net-worth individual, the liability limits of your auto, homeowners or other insurance policy may be insufficient. [Umbrella insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-umbrella-insurance/) extends coverage limits and protects your assets if you're found responsible for damages or injuries.

If you're involved in a car accident that results in a $500,000 medical bill, but your auto insurance policy has a $300,000 limit, an umbrella insurance policy would cover the remaining $200,000. Otherwise, your savings and future earnings could be used to cover the difference.

This kind of coverage typically helps if you're facing a lawsuit for unintentional damages.  It can provide coverage for legal defense costs that you'd otherwise be on the hook for, including things like attorney fees.

## Who needs umbrella insurance?

Anyone with assets to protect from legal rulings could benefit from umbrella insurance. Some are at a higher risk, however, including:

* People with a significant net worth
* Pool or trampoline owners
* Frequent hosts
* Children's sports coaches
* Young drivers
* Landlords

## Umbrella insurance FAQs

### What is not covered by umbrella insurance?

Since umbrella insurance is designed to cover damages to others, it won't cover your property or belongings. Umbrella insurance also won't cover intentional acts.

Under a personal umbrella insurance policy, business-related damages or property losses are not covered. Generally, this includes businesses operated out of your home.

### How much umbrella insurance do I need?

Generally, umbrella insurance coverage should equal your taxable assets, including things like investments, homes beyond your primary residence and other assets.

We also considered complaint index data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and financial strength ratings from [A.M. Best](https://ratings.ambest.com/).

We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.

Based on that criteria, the best companies for umbrella insurance are:
