# How much is flood insurance?

Most homeowners insurance policies exclude coverage for water damage caused by a flood, which means if you live in a flood zone area, be prepared to purchase a separate flood insurance policy. Flood insurance rates vary depending on many factors, including your home’s construction, how much coverage you need, and your area’s risk for flooding.

## How much does flood insurance cost per year?

[According to FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20210318/fact-sheet-myths-and-facts-about-flood-insurance), the average flood insurance cost for a policy from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is approximately $700 annually. However, your price will vary based on your location, type of home, and other factors.

FEMA also states that if you qualify for federal disaster relief after a flood and you’re uninsured, you’re required to buy a flood insurance policy in order to get federal assistance in the future. Learn more about [how flood insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/flood-101/).

## Flood insurance cost factors

The cost of flood insurance is determined by several components, such as:
