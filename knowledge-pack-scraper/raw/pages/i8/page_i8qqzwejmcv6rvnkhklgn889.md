## How much does flood insurance cost per year?
[According to FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20210318/fact-sheet-myths-and-facts-about-flood-insurance), the average flood insurance cost for a policy from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is approximately $700 annually. However, your price will vary based on your location, type of home, and other factors.
FEMA also states that if you qualify for federal disaster relief after a flood and you’re uninsured, you’re required to buy a flood insurance policy in order to get federal assistance in the future. Learn more about [how flood insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/flood-101/).
