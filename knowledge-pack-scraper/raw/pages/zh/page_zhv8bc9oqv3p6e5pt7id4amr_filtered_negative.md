Our rankings, ratings, and product reviews are unbiased. We do not rank or rate products or services based on our financial relationships with the companies that produce them. Our in-house research team collects extensive information used in our evaluation process, although we may not cover all options available in the marketplace. See our full [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance#methodology).
## Key Takeaways
* State Farm offers more affordable rates than Progressive but does not sell new policies in California, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts.
* [State Farm](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/state-farm-vs-progressive#state-farm) provides a personalized experience with local agents, while Progressive is known for its digital self-serve buying experience.
* Both companies have multi-policy discounts, though [Progressive](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/state-farm-vs-progressive#progressive) offers a wider variety of insurance categories through a network of third-party insurers.
## State Farm vs. Progressive
State Farm and Progressive are in our [best homeowners insurance rating](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance), taking the No. 3 and No. 8 spots, respectively. While both companies offer excellent coverage options, there are a few noticeable differences between State Farm and Progressive.
Bargain hunters might be drawn to [State Farm](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/state-farm), in particular, because it offers some of the most affordable rates of the companies we analyzed. It takes the No. 2 spot in our cheapest homeowners insurance rating, while [Progressive](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/progressive) ranks No. 7. And, if you prefer to work directly with an agent, State Farm is known for its extensive agent network. However, it is important to note that the company no longer offers new policies to homeowners in California, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts. Discounts are available for bundling policies, installing safety devices, and remaining claim-free, with generous savings for combining home and auto insurance.
On the other hand, Progressive excels in providing a digital-first experience with streamlined online quotes and policy management. And, while Progressive is an excellent choice for people who prefer digital interactions, it does have customer service agents who can help.
While Progressive offers common endorsements like extra liability and water backup, it lacks discounts such as autopay and loyalty programs available from other insurers. However, Progressive works with a network of third-party insurers, which allows it to offer a wider variety of insurance categories, such as travel, dental, and even health insurance.
Below are the average annual rates for State Farm and Progressive for several different levels of coverage:
### Do State Farm and Progressive cover mold damage or removal?
Like most insurers, coverage for mold damage or removal largely depends on the cause of the mold. If the mold results from a covered peril, such as a roof leak caused by a windstorm, State Farm and Progressive are more likely to cover it. However, mold resulting from poor maintenance or neglect is typically not included in standard homeowners insurance policies.
Additionally, there may be limits to how much coverage is available for mold removal or remediation; check your policy carefully to find out how much (if any) coverage you have for mold removal.
### Do State Farm and Progressive cover roof leaks?
Coverage for roof leaks will depend on whether or not the damage was caused by a covered peril. State Farm and Progressive both cover roof leaks if the damage is caused by a covered peril, such as a storm or hail. However, if the roof leak is due to an aging roof or failure to maintain it properly, it may not be covered.
Review your policy details to find out exactly what is and is not covered under your homeowners insurance coverage.
### Do State Farm and Progressive cover termite damage?
Generally speaking, damage caused by insects, animals, or other pests is not covered under a homeowners insurance policy. [Termite damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage) isn’t likely to be covered because it's considered preventable through home maintenance. This approach is relatively standard amongst home insurers, so it is important to keep a close eye on your property and hire an exterminator if needed.
### Do State Farm and Progressive cover water damage?
State Farm and Progressive both cover water damage if it is caused by a sudden and accidental covered peril, such as a burst pipe or overflow. However, damage from flooding or slow leaks may not be covered unless additional coverage like [flood insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance) is purchased.
### Do State Farm and Progressive offer homeowners insurance bundling?
Both State Farm and Progressive offer discounts for bundling home and auto coverage.
State Farm is known for offering more substantial bundling discounts. With State Farm, you can bundle your auto insurance with your homeowners, condo, or renters insurance, which can save you up to $1,356 annually, according to the 2024 national survey by State Farm of new policyholders.
When you bundle policies with Progressive, you'll only pay one deductible when a single event causes a loss that applies to both policies. Progressive also offers multi-policy discounts for bundling your homeowners insurance with other policies, like boat, motorcycle, or RV insurance.
