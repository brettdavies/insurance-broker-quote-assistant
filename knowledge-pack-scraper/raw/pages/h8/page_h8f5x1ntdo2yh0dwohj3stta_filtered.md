## [What happens if you get 1 point on your license?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/1-point-on-license-1000131-2140699412/)

One point is unlikely to affect a driver’s insurance costs, if it is the only point on the driver’s record. One point is assigned for a minor violation, like driving with broken taillights or an expired license, which the insurance company might not even hear about it. And if the insurer does not tally the point, it will not result in a higher premium.

Forty-one of the 50 states use a license-points system. Drivers...

## [What happens if you get 2 points on your license?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/2-points-on-license-1000131-2140699411/)

Two points will increase a driver’s insurance costs by roughly 20% to 100%, depending on the state, insurance company and type of violation. Two points are assigned for relatively minor traffic violations, like driving at night with no headlights or making an illegal U-turn. Two points might even be the minimum number of points you can get, depending on where you live. Some states assign points by a factor of two, skipping odd numbers in...

## [What happens if you get 3 points on your license?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/3-points-on-license-1000131-2140699415/)

If you get 3 points on your license, your car insurance premiums will likely increase and you will be closer to the threshold for a license suspension, depending on your state. Driver's license points are used to track violations, so accumulating 3 points is a sign of increased risk for insurers.

Each state has a different threshold for how many license points lead to a specific penalty, but accumulating points is never good. The table...

There is no public information about a Progressive insurance point system. Your insurance premium can go up following an accident, a speeding ticket, or other traffic violations, but you won’t know by how much until your policy is up for renewal.

You might not see premiums go up for speeding tickets unless you get two or more in a three-year period. Whether you will see your premium go up after just one ticket depends on [multiple factors](https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-insurance-cost-factors/), like the seriousness of the ticket, your insurance history, and more.

It’s also important to note that Progressive offers small accident forgiveness for new customers in some states. This means that your rate won’t go up after your first claim of $500 or less. If you’ve been a customer for five years and accident and violation-free for five consecutive years, then your rate won’t increase if you have a claim of any size. Large accident forgiveness can vary by state, so it’s best to contact Progressive directly at [(888) 671-4405](tel:+18886714405) to find out the rules where you live.
