I had to renegotiate insurance in the last 6 months because it went insane. I found a lower rate with [Progressive](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Progressive+auto+insurance&cId=eedb6c26-7ad5-4e55-8864-70653b6e1a3f&iId=818d8a13-95c2-4934-9f0a-ab40798ee890).

I've found that you have to switch insurance companies every few years to maintain the best premiums. I currently have [Allstate](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Allstate+auto+insurance&cId=0141e1b3-b51c-4f0c-90ef-0fd90ee2aa4e&iId=9f536ffa-2aaf-4743-af47-619b6339f58d) and pay about $485 every 6 months (about $80/mo) for 2 vehicles, with 3 drivers (me, my wife, and our 16 y/o daughter). I also have my home insurance bundled for the multiple policy discount.

I’ve got a 2012 grand caravan living in the city and my insurance with [Geico](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Geico+auto+insurance+rates&cId=ba35265d-cba4-4637-9861-21d81caa5a68&iId=c282d8d7-3dfb-4dc7-90b8-173f1e1f8936) is $150 a month. No accidents and have never had a speeding ticket in my 38 years of life. I don’t understand why my shits so high but I’m about to break up with Geico

We recently shopped around to get new insurance after being lazy and letting rates increase for years despite zero claims/violations. Now paying ~$60/mo for my fairly new car and ~$40/mo for my partner's 10+ year old car with [Erie](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Erie+auto+insurance&cId=14f14d5c-0774-472b-bad8-70a76a34dbba&iId=ef8e74ef-52e7-427f-8f6a-8ea039995ec8). Seemed like a great deal to us but no experience with making claims yet (hope to keep it that way forever). Bundling multiple cars and [homeowners](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=homeowners+insurance+bundling+discount&cId=802e0e73-195d-4c7e-a804-2f2020223ba1&iId=5243e315-4505-42f1-b9a9-47a7835a8fc3) definitely helps.

That's about what we pay too. Actually, about a grand a year for two cars. Needed to make a claim with them once and it went smoothly.

That sounds about right. The [reckless driving](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=reckless+driving+insurance+rates&cId=db872cac-0933-4c7b-9dfe-5732066e3281&iId=90efa505-fd89-4ce2-a6dc-631825befa20), stolen cars, people driving with no insurance/license/registration causes everyone's to go up unfortunately. Mine has been increasing every 6 months. I pay in full and shop around for rates.
ETA: I lease a newer car and pay $542 for 6 months with Progressive. If paid monthly it would be $108 a month ($650 total). I paid $400/6 months at the end of 2022.

That sounds about right, I used to pay $67 a month and now paying $87 a month and change. So sounds like everybody raised rates $20 a month

It will vary largely depending on your zip code. Insurance companies know all and if you live in areas where more accidents and claims are prevalent then your insurance rates will dictate that.

I live in 53212 and I bought my car 4 presidents ago. I've been paying $101 per month with GEICO, and never thought twice about it. I'm the kind of person who assumes what I have is probably fine, plus that gecko is really cute.
After reading this thread I realized how much I was overpaying so I switched. It took me about 10 minutes to get identical coverage with Progressive for $58 per month.

I would like to advocate that everyone get new quotes on a regular basis, including with the same company.
A couple years ago after several years of wondering why my insurance rates were so insanely high despite having no accidents or claims and using all the discounts they could throw at me, I decided to get new quotes just for the heck of it. I ended up getting a quote from the same company for less than half of what I was paying. I called them up and demanded to know why my quote was so much less than what I was currently paying and they said they weren’t really sure and that’s just how the system works. They recommended that I use the new quote and they transferred over all of my loyalty stuff. I couldn’t believe it. If I hadn’t proactively checked, I would still be paying those insane rates.

Geico wanted 150/month. Switched to progressive and got it down to 48/month for similar coverage. Would have been 42 but I had to cancel the snapshot nonsense since it felt like it made me drive less safe and couldn't justify that for 6$.

We have State Farm. Two cars, one is a Tesla, the other is a Jeep Rubicon. Both newish. (2-3 years old) I live by Marquette.
Right around $200 a month, for both, for full coverage. We both have auto loans, and there’s no way both won’t be fully insured with these stupid ass Kia kids and people going 80 and blowing lights left and right. And passing in the turn lanes. And the million other dumb shit I see all day.
I haven’t had a ticket since 2012, and he’s never even had a speeding ticket. Fucking Milwaukee bullshit.
