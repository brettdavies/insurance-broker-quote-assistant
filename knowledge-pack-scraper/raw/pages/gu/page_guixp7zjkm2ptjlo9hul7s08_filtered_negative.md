The **Progressive Corporation** is an American [insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance "Insurance") company. Progressive is currently the #2 auto insurer in the United States behind [State Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm "State Farm").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-2) The company was co-founded in 1937 by Jack Green and Joseph M. Lewis, and is headquartered in [Mayfield, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfield_Village,_Ohio "Mayfield Village, Ohio").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-3) The company insures passenger vehicles, motorcycles, [recreational vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle "Recreational vehicle") (RVs), trailers, boats, [personal water craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_water_craft "Personal water craft") (PWC), and commercial vehicles.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Corporation&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]
Progressive was formed in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Mutual Insurance Company.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-5) In 1956, the company found a niche by insuring more risky drivers. In 1965, [Peter B. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_B._Lewis "Peter B. Lewis"), son of Joseph Lewis, and his mother borrowed $2.5 million, pledging their majority stake as collateral, and completed a [leveraged buyout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout "Leveraged buyout") of Progressive.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-6) In 1971, Progressive conducted an [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering "Initial public offering") (IPO) and became a [publicly-traded company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company "Public company").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-7) In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums surpassed $1 billion, and by 2016 that number reached $20 billion.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-:1-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-9) Progressive also claims being the first auto insurance company to allow customers to purchase insurance policies over the phone in 1993, and to have a website in 1995, and have policies available for purchase online in 1997. Later, Progressive enabled customers to use mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-10) It also reports to be the first to offer [24/7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24/7_service "24/7 service") claims reporting.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-11) On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") claims.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-12)

The company operates in three segments: personal lines, commercial auto, and other [indemnity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indemnity "Indemnity").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-13)
* The personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, [motorcycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle "Motorcycle"), boats, and [recreational vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle "Recreational vehicle") through both an independent [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_\(law\) "Agency \(law\)") channel and a direct channel.
* The other-indemnity segment provides [professional liability insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance "Professional liability insurance") to community [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank"), principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans.
## Industry information
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Corporation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Industry information")]
Progressive is the second-largest auto insurer in the United States as of the 2023 fiscal year, with 15.2% of the market, behind [State Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm "State Farm")'s share of 18.3%.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-14) Progressive primarily offers its services through the internet, by telephone or through independent insurance agents.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-:0-15) Progressive’s agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agents[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-:0-15) and _progressiveagent.com_ where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-16) Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011, and later rebranded as PD Insurance in 2019.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-17)
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Corporation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Crash response")]
In September 2007, Progressive began to offer pet injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with collision coverage.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-18) Immediate response vehicles used by Progressive are specially modified [Ford Explorers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Explorer "Ford Explorer") and [Ford Escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escape "Ford Escape").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-19)
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressive_Corporation&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Advertising")]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-20)
Since 2008, many of Progressive's [television advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement "Television advertisement") have featured a character named [Flo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flo_\(Progressive_Insurance\) "Flo \(Progressive Insurance\)"), played by actress [Stephanie Courtney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Courtney "Stephanie Courtney"),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-21) who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-22) In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign. He was played by John Jenkinson.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-23) The Flo universe also includes Jamie ([Jim Cashman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cashman_\(actor\) "Jim Cashman \(actor\)")), an awkward fellow Progressive employee; and Bill and Tom, rival insurance salesmen from the figurative [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man "Straw man") "A. Nother Insurance Company." Bill and Tom were largely discontinued after [Allstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstate "Allstate") filed a claim with the [Better Business Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Business_Bureau "Better Business Bureau") alleging that Progressive was making a false claim that they offered discounts that Allstate and other insurance providers did not.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-24)
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box, voiced by [Chris Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Parnell "Chris Parnell"), representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-adage-thebox-25) Progressive later added more characters like Flobot, Mara ([Natalie Palamides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Palamides "Natalie Palamides")), [Dr. Rick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Rick "Dr. Rick"), and Motaur to its advertising series. In 2019, Progressive began the _At Home with[Baker Mayfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield "Baker Mayfield")_ ad campaign during the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League") season. The campaign featured the [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns "Cleveland Browns") quarterback living with his wife in [FirstEnergy Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstEnergy_Stadium "FirstEnergy Stadium").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-mayfield-26) After he was traded to the [Carolina Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers "Carolina Panthers") in the 2022 offseason, Mayfield stated that the advertisements will end, calling it a "missed opportunity."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-28)
In 2022, [Jon Hamm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm "Jon Hamm") appeared in several TV commercials, as himself, unsuccessfully pursuing a romantic relationship with spokesperson Flo.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-29)

According to a February 2011 _[Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal "Wall Street Journal")_ article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-30) Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's [Pay As You Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_As_You_Drive "Pay As You Drive"), or [usage-based insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage-based_insurance "Usage-based insurance") program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-progressive.com-31) Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-ReferenceA-32)
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they're eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn't take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-ReferenceA-32)
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-progressive.com-31)

In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a [class action lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action_lawsuit "Class action lawsuit") over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-42) Five years later, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on [litigants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litigant "Litigant") seeking [redress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_redress "Legal redress") from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for [invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy "Invasion of privacy") and [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud "Fraud").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-43)
In 2009, Progressive was sued for allegedly deceiving [policyholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policyholder "Policyholder") by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-44) The court ruled in the company's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending [appeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal "Appeal").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-45)
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. The 24-year-old died when the car she was driving was hit by another that had run a [red light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light "Traffic light") in [Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore "Baltimore"). Progressive fought to avoid paying out the claim to Fisher's estate. Fisher's insurance policy with Progressive included coverage in the event of an accident with an [underinsured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underinsured "Underinsured") driver. The [underinsured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underinsured "Underinsured") driver was found to be [negligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent "Negligent") in a jury trial brought by the Fisher family, in which the Fisher family contended that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-48) In two followup statements, Progressive explained that they did not "serve as the attorney for the defendant in this case"[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-49) and then clarified that "[a]s a defendant in this case, Progressive participated in the trial procedures on our own behalf."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-50) The company's position was that fault for the accident had not been clearly established, since three witnesses (the driver of the other car, that car's passenger, and Ms. Fisher's passenger) believed that Fisher had run a red light, and filed a [motion to intervene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_\(law\) "Intervention \(law\)") to assert that she had been at fault, and therefore was not [liable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liable "Liable") to pay the underinsured motorist claim. The lawyer for the Fisher family countered by noting that two of the three witnesses were not independent, saying "I have an issue with how they examined the evidence to abandon their insured" and introduced the idea the state [insurance commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_commissioner "Insurance commissioner") could find Progressive had acted in bad faith. As noted, Progressive lost the case and was ordered to pay the underinsured motorist claim in addition to a separate settlement with the Fisher family "to avoid a hearing before the state insurance commissioner."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation#cite_note-51)
