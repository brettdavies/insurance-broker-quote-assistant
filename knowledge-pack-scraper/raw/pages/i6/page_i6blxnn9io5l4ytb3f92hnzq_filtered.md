February 1, 2025-Brett J. Harrison

Car accidents are stressful enough, but finding out the other driver doesn’t have insurance can make an already difficult situation even worse. You might find yourself asking, “How will I cover my medical bills, lost wages, or other unexpected expenses?”

This is where [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.hlgny.com/car-accidents/) comes into play. Designed to provide financial protection when the unexpected happens, this essential coverage can be a safety net in one of the most challenging situations drivers face.

In this blog, a [Long Island personal injury lawyer](https://www.hlgny.com/) breaks down New York’s uninsured motorist coverage requirements and explains how it works. Whether you’re dealing with an insurance claim or thinking about your coverage options, you’ll learn how to protect yourself and your family from the financial strain caused by an uninsured driver.

## What Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage?

Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage protects you, your family members living in your household, and any passengers in your car if you’re injured due to the negligent actions of an uninsured driver or a hit-and-run motorist. This **mandatory coverage** specifically applies to bodily injuries sustained in accidents that occur within New York State. It does not cover damage to your vehicle or other property.

In New York, UM coverage is automatically included when you purchase an auto insurance policy. According to the [New York Department of Financial Services](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements), all drivers must carry a minimum of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident in uninsured motorist protection.

## Why Does the Other Driver’s Insurance Status Matter?

You might wonder why the at-fault driver’s lack of insurance is an issue if you already have your own auto insurance. In New York, your liability insurance only covers damages or injuries you cause to others—it doesn’t protect you if you’re the victim of an accident.

New York’s no-fault insurance system ensures that your Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage will handle your initial medical expenses and lost wages, regardless of who caused the accident. However, PIP has limits, and if your damages exceed those limits, you’d typically rely on the at-fault driver’s liability insurance to cover the rest.

If the other driver doesn’t have insurance, you’re left without the financial protection their liability coverage would have provided. This gap can leave you facing significant medical bills, lost income, or other costs.

That’s where uninsured motorist (UM) coverage comes in. UM coverage steps in to cover these expenses, ensuring that you’re not left paying out of pocket for someone else’s negligence. Without it, you’d bear the financial burden of an accident caused by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver, adding stress to an already difficult situation.

## What About Underinsured Motorist Coverage?

While UM coverage is required in New York, underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage is optional. UIM coverage provides additional protection when the at-fault driver has insurance but insufficient coverage to fully compensate for your injuries. For example, if your damages total $100,000 and the other driver’s policy covers only $25,000, UIM coverage helps bridge the gap.

Adding UIM coverage to your policy can be a valuable way to protect yourself against financial shortfalls in serious accidents.

## How Does Uninsured Motorist Coverage Work?

If you or a member of your household is injured in a qualifying accident, the process for filing a claim under your UM coverage will depend on the circumstances. Here are some common scenarios:

* **Injury in a Collision with an Uninsured Driver:** File a claim with your own auto insurance company.
* **Hit-and-Run Accidents:** Report the accident to law enforcement immediately, as insurers often require proof that the accident involved a hit-and-run driver.
* **Pedestrian Accidents:** If you or a family member is injured as a pedestrian by an uninsured vehicle or a hit-and-run motorist, you can file a claim under your household’s auto insurance policy. If you don’t have a policy, but a relative in your household does, you may be able to file a claim under their policy.
* **Unknowingly Occupying an Uninsured Vehicle:** If you or a family member is injured while unknowingly riding in an uninsured vehicle, you can still file a claim with your insurer.

## Why Uninsured Motorist Coverage Matters in New York

Even though liability insurance is legally required in New York, not everyone on the road complies. According to recent statistics from the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), 10.8% of drivers in New York are uninsured. That means roughly 1 in every 10 drivers lacks the insurance needed to cover your injuries or damages if they cause an accident.

This figure isn’t just a statistic—it represents a real risk every time you’re on the road. Whether it’s a driver who let their policy lapse or one who never purchased insurance at all, encountering an uninsured driver can leave you financially exposed.

Uninsured motorist coverage acts as your safety net in these situations. It steps in to cover medical bills, lost income, and other expenses when the other driver cannot. Without this protection, you could be forced to pay out of pocket for costs that can quickly add up, leaving you to deal with not only physical recovery but also financial strain. While uninsured motorist coverage provides essential protection, you can take additional steps to strengthen your financial security on the road by exploring optional coverages that go beyond the basics.

## Optional Coverage to Consider

Beyond the mandatory UM coverage, New York drivers have access to additional optional coverages that can enhance their financial protection:

* **Supplemental Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (SUM):** This optional coverage provides higher policy limits than the state minimums and includes both UM and UIM protections. It’s a popular choice for those seeking extra security.
* **Collision Coverage:** While UM coverage doesn’t include property damage, collision coverage can help pay for repairs to your vehicle regardless of fault.

Adding these coverages to your policy may slightly increase your premiums, but the added protection can be invaluable if you’re involved in an accident.

As you can see, when it comes to protecting yourself and your loved ones from the unexpected, having the right auto insurance coverage is critical. However, if you’re facing challenges with an insurance company after an accident, a [car accident attorney in NY](https://www.hlgny.com/car-accidents/) can help you address delays, disputes, or denied claims.

## Don’t Let Insurance Companies Deny Your Rights After a Car Accident

After a car accident with an uninsured driver, you might think your own insurance company will handle everything smoothly. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. Insurance companies often look for ways to minimize payouts, delay claims, or deny them altogether. That’s why you need an advocate who knows how to hold them accountable.
