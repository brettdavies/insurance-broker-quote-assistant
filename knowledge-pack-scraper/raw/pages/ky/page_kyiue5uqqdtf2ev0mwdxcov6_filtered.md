## Frequently Asked Questions

Is GEICO always the cheapest option?

Not always. Rates vary by driver profile, garaging address, vehicle, and discounts. Comparing multiple carriers is the best way to find your lowest suitable rate.

Will comparing quotes affect my credit score?

Insurance quotes are generally soft inquiries and do not impact your credit score.

Can I switch without a gap in coverage?

Yes. We can align start dates so your new policy begins as your current one ends, preserving continuous coverage.

How long is an auto quote valid?

Quotes typically refresh after several days or weeks as rates update. If yours expires, we’ll re-run it quickly.

Can I bundle auto with home or renters?

Often yes. Many companies offer multi-policy savings when you combine auto with home, renters, or condo coverage.
