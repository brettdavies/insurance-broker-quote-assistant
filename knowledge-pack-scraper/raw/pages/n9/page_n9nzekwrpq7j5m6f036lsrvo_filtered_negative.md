* **Bundling discounts:** You can find [**bundling discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) from many insurance companies. With these, you get a percentage off your premiums for having multiple insurance products, such as home and [**auto insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/).
* **Home security and safety discounts:** It’s also common to see discounts for installing certain [**home security and safety features**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/security-system-discount/), such as smoke detectors, burglar alarm systems, or sprinkler systems.
* **Increase your deductible.** [**Your deductible**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-insurance-deductible/) is the amount you pay before your home insurance covers you. Common deductibles are $500–$2,000, but opting for a higher deductible generally means lower prices.

[**Dwelling coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/dwelling-insurance/) protects the structure of your home and covers repairs or replacement if a covered peril damages it, such as fire or severe weather.
[**Other structures coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/other-structures-coverage/) protects other buildings on your property, such as detached garages or sheds.
[**Personal property coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-coverage/) protects your personal belongings if they’re damaged or stolen.
[**Personal liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) protects you if someone injures themselves at your home and you’re found at fault. It can cover their medical expenses and other related costs.
[**Loss of use coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use-coverage/) can pay for temporary housing if your home is seriously damaged or destroyed and you need to relocate while repairs are being made.
Homeowners insurance for seniors doesn’t cover everything, unfortunately. Insurers typically have certain exclusions, such as wear and tear, [**flood damage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/), sewer backups, and damage caused by neglect.
A good rule of thumb is to set your dwelling coverage at a limit at least equal to the cost of replacing your home after a catastrophic event. The Insurance Information Institute also recommends that you purchase a minimum of $100,000 in personal liability insurance, though you might prefer additional protection just in case.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-for-seniors/#cite-3)
* **Actual cash value:** Opting for [**actual cost value**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/actual-cash-value/) might result in lower rates but offer less protection, as this is the value of your home and possessions after depreciation.
