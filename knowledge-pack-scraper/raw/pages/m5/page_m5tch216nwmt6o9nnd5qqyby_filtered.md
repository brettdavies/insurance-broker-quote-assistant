## Is GEICO a good company? Our Take

GEICO is widely regarded as a reputable insurance company, offering a range of products including auto, home, and life insurance. Its competitive rates and user-friendly online tools make it a popular choice among consumers.

However, customer reviews are mixed, as is common in the insurance industry. While many customers praise GEICO for its affordability and efficient service, others have reported dissatisfaction with claims handling and customer support.

For instance, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) rates GEICO with an A+, but customer reviews average 1.1 out of 5 stars based on over 1,600 reviews.

Similarly, a MarketWatch review notes that GEICO has an A+ rating from the BBB but also highlights the low customer review scores.

These mixed reviews suggest that while GEICO excels in certain areas, individual experiences may vary.

I’ve only ever had Geico. Most of my interactions have been smooth (I’ve had a couple of fender benders over the past couple of decades), except in one case where they wanted to declare my car (worth probably around $5000 at the time) a total loss because I had run over something that had punctured my radiator.
