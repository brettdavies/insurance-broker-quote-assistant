In a state as large and weather-prone as Texas, homeowners often wonder if windstorm insurance is legally required. The answer? Not exactly.

While Texas doesn’t mandate windstorm insurance by law, many mortgage lenders, especially in coastal and high-risk areas, require it as a condition for home financing.

Understanding your obligations and protections as a homeowner is essential, particularly as wind-related damages become increasingly common.

Whether you live in Galveston, Corpus Christi, or further inland, this guide will help you determine if you need windstorm coverage, what it includes, and how to respond if you’re denied a claim.

At Daly & Black, we know how to handle claim denials and fight for every dollar you’re owed.

## Is Windstorm Insurance Legally Required in Texas?

No, windstorm insurance is not legally required by the state of Texas. However, if you live in a designated high-risk area, especially along the Gulf Coast, your mortgage lender may require it. Coastal counties like Galveston, Brazoria, Nueces, and Cameron are particularly vulnerable to [wind](https://www.dalyblack.com/practice-areas/windstorm-claims/) and [hail damage](https://www.dalyblack.com/practice-areas/hail-damage/), which is often excluded from standard homeowners policies in those zones.

[The Texas Department of Insurance](https://www.tdi.texas.gov) and insurers typically defer to underwriting risk models. If you’re in a high-exposure area, your lender may demand a separate windstorm policy to protect their investment.

### What Is Windstorm Insurance & Why Does It Matter?

Windstorm insurance is a specialized policy that covers damage caused by [high winds](https://www.dalyblack.com/practice-areas/windstorm-claims/), [hail](https://www.dalyblack.com/practice-areas/hail-damage/), [tornadoe](https://www.dalyblack.com/practice-areas/tornado-claims/)s, and [hurricanes](https://www.dalyblack.com/understanding-your-insurance-policy/)—events that may not be fully covered by your regular homeowners insurance. It becomes crucial in parts of Texas where insurers exclude wind and hail damage due to the frequency of severe weather.

Don’t confuse windstorm coverage with flood or hurricane insurance: flood insurance covers rising water, while windstorm focuses on wind-related structural damage, broken windows, roof loss, and destruction from flying debris. In hurricane-prone zones, having both flood and windstorm coverage is often essential.

Flood insurance is generally obtained through the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.usa.gov/agencies/national-flood-insurance-program) (NFIP), and homeowners in designated flood zones can purchase it through most licensed insurance agents.

### Where & When You Might Need It

If you live near the Gulf Coast or in areas designated as catastrophe zones by the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association ([TWIA](https://www.twia.org/)), you’re likely to need windstorm insurance, especially if you have a mortgage. Mortgage lenders want to protect their investment, and in high-risk zones, they usually won’t finance a property without proper coverage.

Even inland homeowners should verify whether their current policy includes wind/hail damage. In some cases, insurers write exclusions into policies regardless of location. If your policy lacks coverage and you can’t find a private insurer to provide it, TWIA may be your fallback.

## The Role of TWIA

The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) is a state-created insurer of last resort for homeowners who cannot obtain windstorm coverage from private insurers. To qualify for a TWIA policy, your property must:

* Be located in one of the 14 designated coastal counties or a portion of Harris County.
* Be certified to meet applicable building codes (with a [WPI-8](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/wind/index.html) or equivalent certificate).
* Have been denied coverage from at least one private insurer.

TWIA coverage costs, on average, between $1,700 and $2,000 per year, depending on your property’s value, location, and construction. Though it’s not always the cheapest option, it offers essential protection when no other coverage is available.

## What Does Windstorm Insurance Cover?

Windstorm insurance typically includes:

* Structural damage to the home caused by high winds or hail
* Damage to detached structures, like garages or sheds
* Personal property loss resulting from wind-driven damage
* Debris removal and emergency repairs
* Additional living expenses (if your home is uninhabitable during repairs)

However, it does not cover losses from flooding, theft, or fire—those require separate policies. Windstorm policies are often highly specific, so it’s critical to read the fine print and understand exclusions.

## Can You Be Denied Windstorm Coverage in Texas?

Yes. Insurers (including TWIA) can deny coverage for several reasons:

* The home doesn’t meet current building codes or lacks certification
* The property is in a high flood-risk zone and lacks separate flood insurance
* There is existing or unrepaired storm damage

To qualify for TWIA, a home must pass inspection and carry the necessary Windstorm Certificate of Compliance (WPI-8 or WPI-8E). Without this certification, your application may be rejected.

## FAQ

### Is windstorm insurance mandatory in Texas?

No. Texas law does not require windstorm insurance, but mortgage lenders often require it for properties in coastal or high-risk areas.

### What does windstorm insurance typically cover?

It covers damage from wind and hail to your home, detached structures, and belongings. It may also include debris removal and living expenses if you’re displaced.

### Can I be denied windstorm coverage in Texas?

Yes. You can be denied if your property is non-compliant with building codes, lacks proper certification, or has existing damage.

## Practical Advice & When to Call an Attorney

If you live in a wind-prone area of Texas, review your policy immediately. Check if wind or hail damage is excluded. If it is, you may need a separate windstorm policy, either from a private insurer or through TWIA.

Homeowners in Galveston, Brazoria, and other coastal counties should make sure their homes meet building codes and obtain WPI-8 certification to remain eligible for coverage.
