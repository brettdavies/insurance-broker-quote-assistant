![Red car toy on stacks of coins. Pink background. ](https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/02/23875872-c292-4bdb-ad91-4e42f65a3604/thumbnail/620x413/9e8502b3dbb6a35263f9050ea9d856c8/gettyimages-1454694075.jpg) The cost of car insurance has skyrocketed, but there are ways to reduce the expense without sacrificing your coverage.

Inflation has been widespread over the last few years, but the car insurance industry has been hit particularly hard by the higher costs that have resulted from it, which have led to increases in auto repair prices. Over the last three years, auto insurance costs in the U.S. have increased by a staggering 51%, according to[ Insurance Business America](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/auto-motor/rising-auto-insurance-hits-classic-car-owners-519156.aspx) _._ Other factors, like extreme weather events and an uptick in litigation, have also helped to drive up the cost of car insurance.
If you have a [full coverage](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-full-coverage-car-insurance-necessary-pros-and-cons-drivers-should-know/) policy, you likely have a combination of liability, collision and comprehensive car insurance. When combined, these coverage options protect you in a range of situations. Your liability insurance covers both bodily injury and property damage to other drivers. While it covers your liability, it doesn't cover any damages to your vehicle. That's where [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance-whats-the-difference/) help keep your bases covered. Collision coverage kicks in for collision-related events, while comprehensive car insurance covers you for non-collision-related events like theft, fire and floods.
If you can afford that jump or have been claims-free, this simple move can result in significant savings. According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/nine-ways-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs), your premiums may drop 15% to 40%, depending on the deductible you choose.
So, it makes sense to keep an eye on your credit. Your payment history and amount owed have the most significant impact on your credit score, so paying your bills on time and keeping your credit card balances relatively low can help. And, if you do find errors on [your credit reports](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-remove-negative-items-from-your-credit-report/), be sure to contact each credit bureau to start [the dispute process](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-dispute-a-collection-debt-you-dont-owe/).
