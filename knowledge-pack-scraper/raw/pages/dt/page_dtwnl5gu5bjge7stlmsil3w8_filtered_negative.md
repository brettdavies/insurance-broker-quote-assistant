###  Key Takeaways
We’ve all flicked on the news to see mile-high flames twisting up from a charred mountainside. And we’ve all seen the next shot of the homes that didn’t escape those flames, and with a sense of sobering gratitude thought, _I’m so glad that’s not my home!_
And even if your next thought is, _How much home insurance do I need?_ it’s easy to move on to the next thing (_What’s for dinner? I’m starving._) while you’re watching the news in safety from your mid-century modern sofa. But the truth is, that _could_ be your home. Maybe not in a forest fire, but some disaster. Industry research shows two-thirds of homeowners don’t have the protection they need, especially considering the rapidly rising home values and construction costs we’ve seen in the last few years.[1](https://www.apci.org/media/news-releases/release/71613/) If you don’t have enough home coverage, your finances will be turned inside out, along with your life.

It’s crucial to have the  _right amount_ of coverage for your home. So you’re on the right track if you’re asking,  _How much should I insure my home for?_
[Homeowners insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-homeowners-insurance) covers a lot of things, but there are also [some things it  _doesn’t_ cover](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover), like flooding and certain [natural disasters](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-hazard-insurance). It can get confusing, but don’t worry—I’m here to help you figure out how much of what you need so you can protect your biggest investment.
**How Much Homeowners Insurance You Need**
**You want enough home insurance to:** |  **The coverage that does it:**
Rebuild your home structure |  Extended dwelling coverage
Replace your stuff |  Personal property
Cover injuries and damages that happen on your property |  Liability
Reimburse your higher-than-normal living expenses after the loss of an insured home |  Additional living expenses
And heads up, if you have a mortgage, you’re actually  _required_ to have a certain minimum amount of dwelling and liability insurance. (If you’re researching homeowners insurance because you’re just starting to shop for a home, check out our [free Home Buyers Guide](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/homebuyers-guide). It tells you everything you need to know about what can sometimes be a pretty complicated process.)
If you already have homeowners insurance, but aren’t sure how much you have, check out your [insurance declaration page](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/insurance-declaration-page). This is a really helpful summary from your insurance carrier of exactly what you’re paying for.
###  Here's A Tip
On the other hand, an open-perils policy (usually an HO-5 if we’re getting technical) covers every hazard _unless_ specifically excluded. You probably already know what I’m going to say, but _this_ is the kind of policy you want! Make sure the policy you buy doesn’t exclude perils that are likely where you live (and if you can’t find one that doesn’t, you may have to buy extra insurance called a _rider_). If you already have homeowners insurance, check your policy’s list of exclusions to see what you’ll be on the hook for.
Calculating the replacement cost can be tricky—just like calculating how upset your wife will be if you tell her what you  _really_ think about the new paint color on the living room walls (I know my suggestion of Snowbound was the safe choice, but it was also the _right_ choice). But it’s up to you to get it right—here’s how.
3. Third, once you have your own estimates, ask a professional to give you theirs. An expert independent insurance agent, like one of our [RamseyTrusted pros](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/home-insurance), will know your area and can help you calculate a very close estimate of the replacement cost.
####
What factors affect the replacement cost?
When you finally have an accurate replacement cost,  _you should check it every couple of years_. Plenty of factors—both in your control and not in your control—can affect the cost to rebuild your home.
If a natural disaster wipes out your  _current_ home, your  _new_ home will have to meet up-to-date building codes, which could require you to pay for new features or materials. Insurance companies sometimes offer building code coverage, which means they’ll pay for whatever the new codes require—so ask your insurance agent if that’s something you could add to your policy.
Home is where the kitchen is (at least in my house), so it’s no wonder [kitchen renovations](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/how-will-a-kitchen-renovation-affect-value) change home values. Granite countertops, farmhouse sink, scratch-resistant flooring—whatever fancy upgrade you’ve added, adjust your homeowners insurance to match the increase in your home’s value.
Maybe you [finished your basement](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/home-renovations) to add bedroom space for your growing family. Or maybe you added a garage, a workshop or a screened-in porch. New rooms add value, and unless you update your homeowners insurance to account for these additions, you risk having to pay for them again.  _No one_ wants that.
Many of us  _way_ underestimate how much we own. Maybe it’s because we buy things slowly over time—a leather armchair here, a floor-to-mattress dog ramp there—so we lose sight of their value. The risk, then, is to  _underinsure_ personal property and end up with a shock when the reimbursement check doesn’t replace the losses.
To keep this from happening, make an inventory of everything you own that has value. That’s right.  _Everything._ Make a game out of it! Start in your bedroom and work your way to the garage. Take photos (or better yet, a video!) of each possession, especially more expensive items. This may sound like a lot of time, but what takes a few hours to inventory could take _months_ of income to replace. So, be detailed! At the _very_ least, take a photo of every room from each corner. It will help jog your memory about what’s in there.
As you make your inventory, separate your most expensive items. Do you own a Monet? Or some really nice audio equipment that could blow the whiskers off your cat? Write down the estimated replacement costs of those items and ask your insurance agent if you need an additional policy (called  _scheduled personal property_) specifically for them.

Coverage to Insure Your Home’s Structure
Dwelling coverage promises to rebuild your home if it burns down, crumbles in a windstorm, or gets crushed by a falling satellite. (The insurance business calls these perils or [hazards](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-hazard-insurance).) You know, all the usual nightmare stuff we hope never happens. When you hear _dwelling coverage,_ think the structure of your house, all the materials used to build it, and anything attached to it, like a garage, deck or front porch.
At the bare minimum, you should definitely have  _replacement cost coverage_ (or RCV) for your home, which is what pretty much all standard policies offer anyway. It can fall short in some situations since there’s a strict coverage limit. And if construction costs have risen a lot in your area, that limit might not fully cover your cost to rebuild.
On the other hand, most companies  _do_ offer a handy option called  _extended replacement cost_. It extends your coverage by a certain percentage, that could be anywhere from 25% to 100% to help cover increased replacement costs. Even a 25% extension on your payout is nothing to sneeze at, but you should  _always_ get the largest percentage possible, and 100% is the ideal.
Whether the ADU, (aka granny flat, guest house, carriage house) is attached to your house or not makes a  _big_ difference. If it’s something like a finished attic space or bonus room, your homeowners policy can cover it as long as your limit includes the value of the ADU. If it’s detached, however, you may need to purchase extra coverage. So, much like therapy, attachment style is the root issue here.
Now that you have coverage for the structure of your home, let’s get coverage for your  _stuff_ —what most homeowners insurance policies call  _personal property coverage_.
Personal property applies to your furniture, appliances, clothes, sports equipment, electronics, and even the food in your refrigerator. (This coverage is, after all,  _personal,_ and it would be a shame to lose those two dozen free-range eggs you bought from Costco.) It covers your stuff if it’s destroyed, stolen (egg thieves!) or vandalized.
Most standard policies offer 50% of your dwelling coverage in personal property coverage, but it can go higher. As you’re figuring out how much personal property coverage you need, ask yourself,  _If I lost everything, how much would I need to get back on my feet?_ A [local RamseyTrusted pro](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/home-insurance) can help you figure out what different companies offer and help you get more if you need it.
When it comes to personal property coverage, there are two kinds to consider: [actual cash value (ACV) and replacement cost](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).
ACV gives you what your stuff is worth on the day it went up in smoke (or whatever tragedy struck). In other words, depreciation is factored in. So, whatever you originally paid for that hand-knotted New Zealand wool rug is _not_ the amount you’ll get from the insurance company. You’ll get something closer to the Facebook Marketplace resale price.
Like we mentioned earlier, your insurance policy usually pays for your stuff up to a percentage of your dwelling limit. This means if you have some really expensive stuff (think furs, jewelry, a fine art collection, a Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson–level home gym, etc.) you’ll need to buy extra coverage for that. You can get what’s called a _scheduled personal property rider_ to cover extra-expensive stuff—you’ll _schedule_ specific items like your great-grandmother’s five-carat diamond ring to be covered for more.
Now that your home and possessions are properly insured, the next step is to protect your personal finances by loading up on [ _liability coverage_](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/personal-liability-insurance). The threats to your bank account don’t just come from storms and fires. People getting hurt on your property and potential lawsuits are big, gaping vulnerable spots you need to get covered ASAP.
If you just  _have_ to have a wolf-dog hybrid, best of luck, because you’re on your own.
###  Here's A Tip
####
Consider an Umbrella Insurance Policy
You should also look into adding an [umbrella policy](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-umbrella-insurance) if you have a high net worth (above $500,000). This supplemental policy is just one more layer of liability to protect you and your assets. It kicks in once you’ve reached the limits on your standard policy.
Because an umbrella policy isn’t a standalone policy, you must already carry homeowners, [auto](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/how-much-car-insurance) or [other kinds of insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/types-insurance-cant-go-without) to get one.
Hopefully, nothing— _if_ you have additional living expenses (ALE) coverage (also called  _loss of use coverage_). ALE is like a super emergency fund: If you and your family were left with nothing after an accident—nowhere to live, no kitchen to use—ALE would reimburse you for the added cost of living without a home.
The key word here is  _added_ cost of living. For instance, let’s say you cook all your meals, and you pay around $500 a month for groceries. One day, a fire destroys your kitchen, and you’re suddenly forced to eat out. Your monthly food bill jumps from $500 to $900. ALE would reimburse you for the extra $400 hit to your food budget.
It may sound like we’ve covered every possibility at this point, but there could  _still_ be some gaps in your coverage.
What if you live in California with a view of the mountains and the San Andreas Fault? What if you own a bungalow bordering Louisiana’s levies? Insurance companies don’t cover certain natural disasters like [earthquakes](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/earthquake-insurance-guide), [floods](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/flood-insurance-guide), [hurricanes](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/hurricane-insurance) (if you’re on the coast), and sinkholes (except in Florida and Tennessee). You can and should buy separate insurance for those events if they’re common in your area.
* * *
Hopefully the question _How much home insurance do I need?_ has been answered. Your next move is to figure out if you have enough or make sure you buy the right amount. Choosing [the right independent insurance agent](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-an-independent-insurance-agent) is a big part of that. You want someone who knows their stuff and can guide you through the process of insuring your biggest investment.
One final thing before I let you figure out what’s for dinner: The value of your insurance policy  _won’t_ automatically increase along with the value of your home, so it’s important to check up on your policy with your agent every year to make sure you have enough coverage.
