## How to Get Cheap Motorcycle Insurance

There are several steps to follow when deciding which SR-22 motorcycle insurance coverage is right for you, including:

1. 1

   Decide How Much Coverage You Need

   Determining [what motorcycle insurance you need](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/)  will allow you to compare with confidence and avoid being oversold by agents. Consulting with an independent insurance agent will also give you valuable perspective on factors you should consider when making this decision.
2. 2

   Research Costs and Discounts

   You should research [average motorcycle insurance rates](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/motorcycle/average-cost-of-motorcycle-insurance/) for your profile to get a gauge on whether a provider is cheap or not when you compare quotes. Also, taking advantage of common discounts like a pay in full or motorcycle license reduction will save you as much as possible on your policy.
3. 3

   Choose Minimum Liability Coverage

   SR-22 motorcycle insurance is often very expensive, so if you can tolerate the risk, we recommend choosing a minimum liability only policy. Compared to full coverage, you can save up to 77% on average.
4. 4

   Compare Quotes

   Comparing quotes from multiple insurers apples to apples is necessary to secure competitive motorcycle coverage rates. However, the most affordable policy isn't necessarily the right choice, so prioritize value by selecting coverage that balances cost with your actual protection needs.
