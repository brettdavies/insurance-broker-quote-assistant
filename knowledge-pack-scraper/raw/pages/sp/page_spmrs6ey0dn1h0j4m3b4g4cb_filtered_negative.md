### **How Much Is Landlord Insurance In California Per Month?**

### Factors That Affect Your California Rental Insurance Quotes
There are several factors that insurance companies consider when you're getting a quote. Below, we cover some of the most important ones, which are:
**Your Building -** The age of your property determines the cost of your insurance coverage. Is there any water in the pipes? When was the roof last replaced? Is it copper wiring or aluminum wire?
**Your Location -** When it comes to determining your rental insurance rates, one of the most important factors that insurance companies consider is the location of your house.
**Credit History -** You have a distinct credit score for insurance products developed specifically for you. Your rates will be lower if your credit score is higher. However, some states no longer allow insurance companies to use your credit to determine rates.
**Coverage Levels -** When you start reviewing quotes, you will see that each insurance provider will let you choose various coverage options.
**Deductibles -** A deductible is another alternative that you may customize to your budget. A deductible is a sum you must pay before insurance pays out.
## What Type Of Liability Coverage Should A Landlord Carry In California?
In California, **there are three distinct types of rental property insurance coverage** to consider. They're known as "forms," and each has a different degree of coverage.
### What Are The Different Types Of Landlord Insurance Cover In California?
Below we discuss the different types of landlord insurance coverages in detail:
#### DP1 - Dwelling
A named-peril policy (DP-1) is an insurance policy that protects you against a specific hazard. This implies the policy will pay for only those events expressly included in the coverage wording, and your insurance coverage will not compensate for anything else.
#### DP2 - Replacement Cost
The (DP-2) policy will give you more coverage than the DP-1. This is accomplished by extending the range of additional perils and providing reimbursement on a replacement cost rather than a cash value cost basis.
#### DP3 - Open Peril
The most popular landlord insurance policy is a DP-3 policy, an open peril policy. An Open Peril Policy means your coverage will cover damage caused by anything other than items on the prohibited list.[ ](https://go.simplyinsurance.com/choose-good-sam-rv)
## What Perils Does Landlord Insurance California Cover You For?
If you're renting a property, **your landlord insurance policy will cover the structure and land and provide enhanced general liability insurance** to ensure you don't have to worry about legal costs. If your home becomes uninhabitable, your income loss protection will come into action, reimbursing the rent that your tenant was supposed to pay.
### Property Damage
Standard rental insurance includes this sort of coverage to repair or replace your property after a covered loss, such as fire, vandalism, or natural calamity.
### Loss Of Use Coverage
If your property becomes uninhabitable because of issues such as a sinkhole, mold, or termites, your landlord policy rent loss coverage will come into play and pay you the rental income that a tenet would have paid.
### Liability Protection:
Liability protection covers the medical bills or legal expenses incurred by a tenant or visitor if they are injured due to an apartment building care problem.
### Specific Perils That Can Be Covered By A Rental Policy:
You may select a broader range of coverage on your insurance policy or opt for a restricted variety of coverages at a lower price.
* Water
* Fire
* Windstorm & Hail
* Lightning
* Lawsuits
* Vandalism & theft
* Riot and civil commotion
* Injury
[ **GET A LANDLORD INSURANCE QUOTE** ](https://go.simplyinsurance.com/choose-steadily-landlord-insurance)
## Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Rental Properties?
**No, A standard home insurance policy will not cover any income losses or liability claims resulting from a renter** residing in their home while they are away on vacation, at work, or otherwise. If you own an investment property that's rented out full time, landlord insurance rather than the usual homeowners policy is required for the protection of your business property.
### What Type Of Rental Properties Will A Landlords Insurance Policy Insure?
A landlord insurance policy will usually provide coverage for **all sorts of rental dwellings, ranging from single-family homes to apartment complexes**, including vacant, undergoing renovations, or being converted into a rental property. They can also cover AirBNBs and similar rentals.
### What Is Not Covered By Rental Property Insurance?
Although landlord insurance is a certain safeguard for landlords to rent out their property, it does not cover everything. The following is a **lists of conditions that landlord insurance does not generally cover:**
**Flooding:** Regardless of whether a flood occurs due to natural phenomena or an accident, you will need to buy flood insurance to cover those specific costs.
**Maintenance repairs:** If an appliance, such as a stove or dishwasher, breaks down and doesn't work correctly, landlord insurance will not cover the repairs or the money to buy a new one.
**Renter's Personal Property:** If the landlord fails to maintain the rental property and causes damage to the tenants' possessions, and as a result, landlord insurance will not cover it. We recommend requiring all of your renters to obtain renters insurance to safeguard their belongings.
**Careless Tenants:** Landlord insurance may not always cover irresponsible renters who fail to maintain your rental house properly. Property owners may have to consider additional protection against these sorts of claims.\
## Do I Need Landlord Insurance By Law In California?
In **California, landlord insurance is not required by law**, but it is a brilliant idea to get it. It's a good idea to acquire landlord insurance if you rent and maintain your possessions because landlord insurance helps protect against the unexpected. It is important to note that your homeowner's policy will most likely not cover any losses or damages caused by you or your renters.
### Who Should Buy California Rental Insurance?
Anyone who **rents out their property or properties should have landlord insurance** (also known as rental property insurance). Mainly because it may provide you with several advantages, including:
* Financial protection against natural disasters
* Protection against a tenant getting injured on your property
