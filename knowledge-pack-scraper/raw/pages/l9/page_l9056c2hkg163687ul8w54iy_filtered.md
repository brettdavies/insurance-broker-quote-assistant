Progressive insurance goes up by an average of 101% after an at-fault accident, according to the company. If the accident was not your fault or only your car was involved, you may not see your rates go up at all. If your premiums do go up, it won’t be as significant as after an at-fault claim. The amount your rate increases depends on your location, the total cost of the claim, your prior driving history, fault and [other factors](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates/69302/).

It’s possible that Progressive won’t raise your rates for your first accident, regardless of fault. The company offers two [accident forgiveness](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/progressive-accident-forgiveness) programs at no cost to customers. First of all, Progressive won’t increase premiums for certain small claims of $500 or less, whether you are a new or long-term customer. Plus, if you’ve been a policyholder for five years or longer and have been accident-free for three straight years, Progressive will forgive your first accident, no matter the cost.

Progressive automatically enrolls eligible customers into accident forgiveness, but qualifications vary by state. It’s best to call Progressive customer service at 1-800-776-4737 to find out the rules where you live. If you already have a policy number, a representative can tell you what benefits you qualify for.
