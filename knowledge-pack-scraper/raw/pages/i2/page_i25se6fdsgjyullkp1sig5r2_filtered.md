## Illinois car insurance laws

Illinois requires that drivers carry at least 25/50/20.

These limits are in place to ease the financial burden for drivers who cause an accident and for the victims. The at-fault driver knows their insurer will cover medical expenses and property damage up to a certain amount, and victims can more readily access funds to pay for accident costs.

However, coverage limits are very low and will not cover expenses from a serious accident. To be better protected, Illinois drivers should consider increasing liability limits and adding coverage, such as collision and comprehensive.

## Illinois car insurance requirements

Illinois requires the following coverage:

**Liability**. There are two parts to [liability coverage](/auto-insurance/coverage/auto-liability-insurance-guide.html). First, bodily injury liability pays medical costs associated with an accident, such as doctor visits, surgery, and prescriptions. Second, property damage liability covers repairing or replacing items such as vehicles, fences, or buildings.

Illinois liability minimums are **25/50/20.**

**The average cost of a minimum coverage policy is $421**. However, **GEICO** has the lowest minimum car insurance rates, averaging **$298**.

## Are the Illinois minimum coverage requirements changing in 2025?

Illinois car insurance requirements will not change in 2025. You do not need to make any changes if you have minimum coverage. If mandatory coverage changes in the future, your insurer will inform you, along with any rate changes.

Why do limits change?

"Several states have minimum requirements of property damage of $10,000-$25,000," says Zack Pope, agency manager at David Pope Insurance in Missouri. "[Given] the current values of vehicles, that's extremely antiquated values of coverage and a main reason that I personally do not offer less than 100/300/100 to customers. It is significantly easier to see a car on the road that is valued at $100,000 than it has been in the past."

## What does minimum car insurance cover in Illinois?

Illinois requires drivers to carry at least a minimum amount of car insurance to help offset accident costs.

Illinois drivers are required to carry liability coverage. Bodily injury liability helps pay for injuries you cause to others in an accident. Property damage liability covers items damaged in an accident, such as another vehicle, fence, or other property.

### PEOPLE ASK:

Is Illinois minimum car insurance enough?

It may not be. Even a moderately serious accident could exceed the state minimum limits of 25/50/20, and minimum coverage may not cover all accident costs. Furthermore, state minimums do not cover your vehicle; you need to add [comprehensive and collision coverage.](/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html)

## How much car insurance is enough in Illinois?

[Car insurance](/auto-insurance.aspx) isn't one size fits all. The amount of coverage you need depends on your assets, net worth and risk level.

For example, if you are financially stable and can afford to pay out of pocket for medical costs and repairs, you may keep insurance limits low. However, you may be sued for the cost difference if you have a sizeable net worth and don't carry enough insurance to cover expenses.

Additionally, if you drive very little or have a short commute, your chances of causing an accident are relatively low. Also, you may choose to skip coverages such as collision and comprehensive if your car isn't worth much, or you can afford to pay for a new vehicle if yours is damaged. However, if you have a loan or lease you will be required to carry this coverage by your lender.

Consider your financial situation when determining how much car insurance you need.

## Illinois penalties for driving without car insurance

Since Illinois requires its drivers to carry car insurance, failing to do so has consequences. Although you may be tempted to skip coverage to save money, you'll wind up paying heavily in the long run.

Failing to carry Illinois car insurance has penalties including those listed below. Keep in mind that repeated infractions have more severe penalties, such as jail time.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Fines | $500 |
