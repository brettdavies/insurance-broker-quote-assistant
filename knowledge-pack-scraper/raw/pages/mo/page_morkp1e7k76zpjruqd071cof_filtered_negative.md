4. Texas Home Insurance
Texas law doesn’t require homeowners to have insurance on their property, but if you finance your home through a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to have [homeowners insurance](https://www.amica.com/en/products/home-insurance.html). Even if you own your home outright without a mortgage, it’s still highly advisable to be insured. Home insurance is not a one-size-fits-all product. It should be tailored to your specific situation and needs.

You may find that the general coverages afforded in a basic homeowners policy don’t cover certain losses or types of property. Amica offers [home insurance options](https://www.amica.com/en/resources/home/coverage/home-insurance-options.html) in the form of policy endorsements that can fill in some of those gaps in coverage. Adding endorsements to your Texas homeowners insurance policy can provide valuable additional coverage tailored to your specific needs. Here are a few endorsements you might consider:
* Desktops
* Laptops
* Smartphones
* Gaming devices
* Smart TVs

The location of your home is a [factor that impacts your home insurance](https://www.amica.com/en/resources/home/coverage/6-ways-to-save-money-on-homeowners-insurance.html) premiums. Different areas may face varying risks and exposures that will impact your policy premium, such as your proximity to hail and tornado-prone areas.
There are several ways Texans can save money on home insurance without compromising the quality of their coverage.1 We offer [home insurance discounts](https://www.amica.com/en/products/home-insurance/discounts.html) for:
One of the best ways to conveniently manage all of your insurance needs and save money at the same time is to bundle your insurance coverages for home and auto with the same insurance company.
