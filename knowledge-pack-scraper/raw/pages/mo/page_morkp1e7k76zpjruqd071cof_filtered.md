# Texas Home Insurance

Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or have owned your home for years, comprehensive home insurance coverage in The Lone Star State is essential to ensure your property is safeguarded against the unpredictable, protecting what matters most in your life.

## Is home insurance required in Texas?

Texas law doesn’t require homeowners to have insurance on their property, but if you finance your home through a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to have [homeowners insurance](/en/products/home-insurance.html). Even if you own your home outright without a mortgage, it’s still highly advisable to be insured. Home insurance is not a one-size-fits-all product. It should be tailored to your specific situation and needs.

## Typical Texas homeowners insurance coverages

* **Coverage A – Dwelling:**

  Coverage for your home and attached structures for damage caused by events such as fire, lightning, wind or hail.
* **Coverage B – Other structures:**

  This covers damage to other structures on the property that are set apart from the dwelling, such as a fence, shed or detached garage.
* **Coverage C – Personal property:**

  Coverage for your belongings, such as furniture, clothing and electronics, if they’re damaged by a peril listed in your policy.
* **Coverage D – Loss of use:**

  This covers your temporary living expenses when a covered loss makes your home unfit to live in.
* **Coverage E – Personal liability:**

  This covers damage or injury to another person or their property that you’re responsible for causing. It also covers legal assistance for claims made against you.
* **Coverage F – Medical payments to others:**

  Medical payments to others: This coverage can pay for medical bills for people who are accidentally hurt on your property, not including members of your household.

Remember, each of these coverages is subject to a policy limit, deductible and exclusions, which are specified within your policy.

Your homeowners insurance won’t cover flood damages, so it helps to ensure you’re properly covered if there’s a flood. Flood insurance policies are available and are written through the federally backed National Flood Insurance Program. It’s common for mortgage companies to require flood insurance if your home is within or near a floodplain. Regardless, a flood can occur anywhere, and it’s a good idea to buy this additional coverage.

### Additional coverages in Texas

You may find that the general coverages afforded in a basic homeowners policy don’t cover certain losses or types of property. Amica offers [home insurance options](/en/resources/home/coverage/home-insurance-options.html) in the form of policy endorsements that can fill in some of those gaps in coverage. Adding endorsements to your Texas homeowners insurance policy can provide valuable additional coverage tailored to your specific needs. Here are a few endorsements you might consider:

* **Special computer coverage:**

  Additional protection beyond what’s included in your policy for devices against direct physical loss, like accidental damage or theft. Devices covered under special computer coverage include:

  + Desktops
  + Laptops
  + Smartphones
  + Gaming devices
  + Smart TVs
* **Identity fraud:**

  Identity theft is a growing concern, and this endorsement can help cover expenses associated with restoring your identity, such as legal fees, lost wages and other related costs.
* **Water backup and sump overflow:**

  Unexpected and accidental water damage, like from an appliance or burst pipe, is covered by most homeowners insurance policies. But, at the same time, they also exclude coverage for backed-up sewers and drains. This endorsement provides coverage for water that backs up through drains and sump pumps.
* **Scheduled personal property:**

  If you have high-value items such as jewelry, fine art or collectibles, a basic homeowners policy may not provide sufficient coverage. With this endorsement, you can insure specific items to make sure they’re adequately covered against loss or damage.
* **Earthquakes:**

  A standard Texas policy excludes damage caused by earth movement, including earthquakes. This endorsement would extend coverage to damage caused by earthquakes.
