Don’t get state mins. Imo get 250 or 300k pd limits at the least. Don’t do a crazy high deductible either. Also make sure you get rental. Don’t put future self in possible financial ruin just to save like $7 a month.

As a AD before I write a sheet I always check PD limits. It’s actually insane how many people are driving around on 25k limits or in some states even 10k

Before you ask everyone else if the minimum coverage is good enough, ask yourself if someone hit you and had bare minimum coverages how would you feel? Then when you answer that question you know you won't have to ask here.

There are usually coverage requirements based on your state and your car.
If the car is leased or financed it needs full coverage as a requirement of the leasing company or the Lienholder.

Think about it like this:
1. Bare minimum coverage is like taking $40k and putting it in a cookie tin with a $5 padlock that can easily be broken
2. Getting the best coverage protection is like taking $40k putting it inside a solid titanium box with a highly encrypted password lock on it with retina scan
For liability coverages, get 100/300 or 250/300. Your max allowed liability limit is dependent on your state and other factors.
For 1st party coverages (COMP/COLL), get the deductible you think you can afford to pay in the event of an at fault accident. I would go with 250 or 500. Don’t go higher
As far as other coverages, get rental coverage. It’s wonderful and cheap
Cars are insanely expensive nowadays and so are hospital visits. If you go cheap with low liability limits then those limits will get exhausted real quick.
Being a first time car owner, your insurance might be a little higher regardless of your age since you probably don’t have any prior insurance history or driving history so… good luck. You could always go through a broker to help you find the best rate for the coverages and limits you want
Edit: typo

A lot of people get liability only thinking they are a “good driver” and if they ever get into an accident it will always be the other persons fault and file under their policy. While it may be true you are a good driver and never get into an accident that is your fault, you can’t assume the other person will be truthful and say the truth to their insurance company whenever you try to file under their policy. A lot of claims are considered word versus word which means it could be either way. We ALWAYS side with the insured because they are the ones paying us.
