**Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive offers some of the cheapest rates for drivers living in the Bronx in 2024. With a Bankrate Score of 4.4 out of 5.0, Progressive outpaces most of the competition in areas like pricing, customer service and availability of coverage. While the company scored below the industry average for customer satisfaction in New York in [J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study), it ranks above average in the [2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), coming in fourth for service, indicating it could be a good fit for drivers seeking insurance they can manage easily on their phones.

**Why Progressive may be best for discounts:** Progressive’s list of auto insurance discounts is extensive, with the company claiming an average of more than [$800 in savings](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/) for drivers who switch from another insurer. Available discounts include bundling discounts and the [Snapshot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/) telematics program, which could reward you with lower rates for safe driving.

**Why Geico made our list:** Overall, Geico stands out from the competition for affordable rates and generally positive customer service experiences. Geico’s overall low pricing earned it a [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers. The company also scored above average for customer satisfaction in New York in J.D. Power’s 2024 study.

**Why Geico may be best for digital policy management:** Geico could be a particularly good fit for younger or tech-savvy customers in the Bronx, thanks to a digital-first strategy. The company's mobile app allows you to access insurance cards, make changes to your payment schedule, review your policy, add a new vehicle and more. While the company ranked just below average in the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience study shopping category, it only fell below average by one point. Last year, the company had an above-average score in this area.  For drivers seeking a more traditional insurance experience, Geico might not be the best fit — the closest brick-and-mortar office is in Yonkers.

**Why USAA made our list:** USAA’s base rates for Bronx car insurance are just below the borough’s average, making it a competitive option for drivers eligible for coverage (military members, veterans, members of the National Guard and Army Reserves and their qualifying family members). USAA also received the highest customer satisfaction score of any carrier in the New York region of J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Why USAA may be best for military-focused coverage:** In addition to affordable rates, USAA offers additional perks that military members won’t typically find elsewhere, including deployment support, discounts for cars stored on a military installation and a wide range of financial services for military members and their families. If you live in the Bronx and are eligible for an auto insurance policy from USAA, its competitive pricing makes it worth gathering car insurance quotes for the Bronx, NY to see how it compares to other carriers.

**Why Erie made our list:** If you prefer to steer clear of insurance giants and work with a local insurer, Erie could be a good fit for your insurance needs. New York is one of just 12 states (plus Washington, D.C.) where this regional insurer writes policies with unique benefits like the ERIE RateProtect discount program. Just be aware that Erie doesn’t have physical offices in the NYC area.

**Why Erie may be best for custom policies:** A major advantage of Erie’s auto insurance offerings is the opportunity to add less-common coverage options like a roadside assistance and rental coverage bundle, personal item coverage and even pet coverage. The ERIE Auto Plus coverage bundle offers death benefits, deductible waivers, additional transportation expense coverage and the option to increase limits on specific coverage.

**Why Allstate made our list:** Allstate is one of the more affordable major insurers for customers in the Bronx. It scored just below the industry average in New York for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s 2025 car insurance study. However, it scored above average for service in J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study. Allstate offers a wide range of coverage and discount options, including a Deductible Rewards Program and the [Drivewise telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/allstate-drivewise/), which both reward safe drivers with premium reductions.

**Why Allstate may be best for bundled policies:** If you own or rent a home in the Bronx, you can bundle your coverage with a home or renters insurance policy from Allstate and earn significant discounts. Unlike some other major carriers, Allstate writes its own home insurance policies. The company earned a 2025 Bankrate Award as Best for First-Time Homeowners, offering perks and savings for those purchasing their first home.

## How much is car insurance in the Bronx?

The average cost of car insurance in the Bronx is $6,368 per year for full coverage — 56 percent more than the New York state average and 136 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). For state minimum coverage, Bronx drivers pay an average of $2,746 per year, 55 percent more than the state average.

Heavy traffic, high property crime rates and a tough insurance market all contribute to the Bronx’s high car insurance prices. However, average rates only tell part of the story: [individual rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) like your age and driving record can significantly impact what you pay for car insurance compared to your neighbors in the Bronx.

### Bronx rates for teens

Teens aged 16 to 19 pay some of the highest rates for car insurance in the Bronx, especially if they purchase a standalone policy instead of staying on their parents’ insurance. On average, a standalone auto insurance policy for an 18-year-old driver in the Bronx costs $5,784 per year, or $482 per month, just for state minimum coverage. Below you’ll find [cheap Bronx car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) for teen drivers added to their parents’ policies.

### Bronx rates for senior drivers

Seniors aged 55 to 75 typically pay some of the lowest rates for car insurance in the Bronx, thanks to a lifetime of driving experience. On average, 60-year-olds pay $5,950 per year for full coverage, while 70-year-olds pay $6,421 per year. Rates can begin to climb again as you enter your 70s due to increased risk of injuries and slower reaction times.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
