Founded in 1937, Progressive is the second-largest property insurance company in the U.S.[[1]](#cite-1) The company offers a wide range of financial and insurance products, including boat, auto, condo, flood, and renters insurance.

Progressive’s renters insurance policies provide coverage for your belongings, personal liability protection, medical payments coverage, and loss of use insurance. But many factors affect how much you’ll pay for renters insurance.

To [**find a renters insurance policy**](/renters-insurance/) that best fits your needs and budget, it’s a good idea to compare multiple quotes. Here’s what you need to know about Progressive renters insurance to help you decide if it’s right for you.

Quick Facts

* Progressive’s rates are on par with the national average cost of renters insurance.
* Bundling a Progressive auto policy with a renters policy could save you $30 per month.
* Progressive has an AM Best financial strength rating of A+ (Superior), indicating the company has the money available to pay policyholder claims.

## Insurify’s take on Progressive renters insurance

Progressive’s average monthly premium for a renters policy with $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage is $19 — just $1 less than the national average for the same coverage limits.

Similar to other insurance companies, Progressive offers [**standard renters insurance coverages**](/renters-insurance/knowledge/what-does-renters-insurance-cover/), including personal property, liability coverage, loss of use, and medical payments insurance. Water backup and personal injury coverage are also available as add-ons to standard Progressive renters insurance policies.[[2]](#cite-2)

If you want to lower your monthly premiums with discounts, Progressive offers five options. You can save an average of 3% if you bundle your Progressive renters insurance with an auto, motorcycle, boat, or other type of policy. You can also save by paying your premium up front and in full.

Although Progressive’s offerings and pricing for renters insurance are competitive, it appears to fall short in customer service. Customer reviews from Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau are generally poor. And Progressive scored well below average for customer satisfaction (619 out of 1,000 points) in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study.[[3]](#cite-3)

Pros 

* AM Best financial strength rating of A+ (Superior)
* Multiple renters insurance discounts
* Quotes available online

Cons

* Minimal optional coverage for renters
* Below-average customer satisfaction reviews
* Other insurers offer lower renters insurance rates

## What Progressive renters insurance covers

Progressive provides standard renters insurance coverages, including personal property, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments insurance. You can also choose from a small selection of optional insurance coverages to ensure your belongings are properly covered.

Here’s what a standard Progressive renters insurance policy covers:

* **Personal property:** Personal property insurance covers damages to or loss of your personal items (furniture, clothing, electronics) up to your policy’s limits. It can also cover your belongings if they’re stolen from a storage unit, [**from your car**](/renters-insurance/knowledge/does-renters-insurance-cover-car-theft/), or while you’re traveling. If you have high-value items such as jewelry, certain limits may apply. If you need a higher coverage limit for valuables, you can look into adding a rider to your policy.
* **Personal liability:** If you’re liable for damages to someone else’s property or injuries to another person, personal liability insurance may help cover you up to your policy limits. It can also cover your legal costs if someone sues you.
* **Loss of use:** If you can’t stay in your rental due to a covered incident, [**loss of use insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use-coverage/)can help cover the cost of a hotel or other accommodations. It can also pay for food expenses.
* **Medical payments to others:** If someone is injured in your rental, medical payments coverage may help cover their medical bills up to the policy limit.

Progressive also offers two additional coverage options:

* **Water backup:** Water or sewer backups can cause substantial and costly damage. Adding this option to your renters policy could help pay for your belongings if they’re damaged in a backup, or for the cost to remove the water.
* **Personal injury:** If someone sues you for slander or libel, personal injury coverage can help pay for legal fees and damages.

Like most standard renters insurance policies, Progressive’s renters policies have limits on what they’ll cover. Most renters insurance policies exclude regular wear and tear, flood damage, or any damages that occurred to the property before you purchased your policy. They also won’t pay for damage to a roommate’s belongings, unless the roommate is named on your policy.

Renters insurance also doesn’t cover damages to the structure of your unit — that’s what [**landlord insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/landlord-insurance/) is for.
