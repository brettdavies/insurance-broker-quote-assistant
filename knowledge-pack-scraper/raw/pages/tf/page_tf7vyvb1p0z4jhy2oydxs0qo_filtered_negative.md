Exactly this! Also look at how much it is to repair these cars after an accident and you will see a similar if not more striking trend

Cars are also bigger, heavier and have more safety and accident prevention items built in. All of these things point to increased severity of physical damage losses. Same hit from behind at 15mph: 1988 Honda = dented bumper. 2020 Honda = airbag deployed, tailgate, bumper, safety systems, extra lights all need to be replaced, new fancy paint

Insurance is a collective pool of money. The cost to keep that pool full has increased. If that doesn’t translate, you can’t buy a loaf of bread today for what you paid in 2021.

This is what gets me about these people. It's not _just_ insurance that's gone up. It's everything. It amazes me that people don't understand the basic concept of inflation makes prices higher.
I can understand someone needing an explanation of what caused the rate increases in insurance. I can understand needing an explanation that there's a noticeable lag time between when inflation hits and when it impacts rates due to the need for filings and approvals. I just don't get people being surprised that it's gone up.

Well not only inflation, but losses and lawsuits are through the roof just about all over the US. So mix the two together and you have yourself a perfect storm for high rate increases.

2 separate issues I think, and both cause the increase
1. inflation b/c parts and services price has gone up so the cost to insure them goes up.
2. guy above you was talking about the pool of money. Nothing to do with inflation, its how many people make claims against that particular insurance company. If A lot of people are making claims then overall pool of money will go down, and they have to raise their rates to fill that pool back up.

All rates are going up. Too many claims happening. It's a [market correction](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+market+correction&cId=14ec1801-5a5a-4a0d-a6f8-f13fa33389ea&iId=b609347b-3c9f-4525-8a55-2197ed8ca086). Cars are 3 times what they were 20 years ago. Technology is expensive. Some windshields now cost $4000 to replace due to all the tech in them. Backup cameras are standard which means a bump in the rear was $1200 is now $3500, $5000 or more to install new cameras, plus bumpers now have sensors in them for blindspots.
Roofs are now $20k-$30k 20 years ago it was $8-$15k. Meanwhile it's being replaced on a $500 or $1000 deductible.
Insurance sadly has needed major market correction and the low price wars are over for now. Hard market will bring a soft one but probably not until 2026 or 2027.
Be aware companies are now going to ask you for actual roof age proof through paperwork and if its older or you can't....it's going to be non-renewed. So we're not even close to out of this yet.

This is the right answer.
P&C Insurance rates always reflect the cost of the market they operate in. As such, your premium will always be one of the truest indicators of inflation.
Why are insurance rates higher? Because fixing stuff costs exorbitantly more, and insurance companies get the money to fix stuff from insurance premiums. The model requires those premiums accurately reflect the market cost.

Exactly the truth is rates should have been SLOWLY climbing over the last 20 years, instead the competition to buy business has kept the prices way too low. No you shouldn't pay $100 a month on a $60k car. No your home insurance shouldn't be $1300 a year on $750k. Price points were going to have to take big hits to adjust. We just got so used to legit cheap insurance that now increases seem crazy because they've been held back a good 20 years.

I love seeing comp and collision symbols start on new vehicles at double or even triple what they used to be. I don't do a lot of service work, but occasionally I will do a vehicle change and the people swapping 2021 or newer leases after three years are getting absolutely hosed on the immediate rate difference. Auto and most property is becoming unbearable. I try to stick to writing as much GL/PL as I can.

Inflation, [supply chain](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+supply+chain+issues&cId=4ba3b0ea-3ce5-4022-862b-5a6a164143a4&iId=c9a6e63d-bcc4-4677-8c86-de20ada8c223) and auto body labor shortages, vehicles increasing in complexity leading to more expensive repairs, general increase in poor driving/claims since Covid, the increase in nuclear verdicts against insurance companies … I mean there is a lot of variables that play into increasing rates. It’s not just you if it makes you feel better— it’s everyone.
Best thing you could probably do in the immediate future is to review your coverage to see if you can save anywhere and/or shop around.

I mean... you're saying what we're thinking... but they aren't in the industry and don't actually know. And while they could have read through the forum, they didn't. There may have been a nicer way to say it.... this is part of the reason agents get a bad rap for being assholes... I don't know if you're an agent, but i wouldn't work with you if this is the way you treat people. It's our job to help educate people so they understand the industry a little, not be snarky at them. We want to create an environment where people know they can trust us to come to us for help, not be belittled.

Yeah with as much misinformation that’s out there about insurance, I think its unreasonable to be mad at people for having questions that may be frequently asked. I’m in Florida and I can look up questions about insurance that will have answers that are completely wrong or misleading.
All these snarky people are also repeating each other with their “well duh, inflation” as if there’s not more to it. Yeah there’s inflation, there’s also unreasonable things happening such as an obsurd amount of litigation which ends up being settlements because some insurance companies would rather write a check than battle in court, companies going through lawsuits because they have been artificially inflating premiums and gathering an obsurd amount of data in an invasive way (see TX Allstate lawsuit), etc.
“Duh inflation” doesn’t really do it justice.
