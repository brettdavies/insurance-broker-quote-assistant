Costco isn't the best choice for auto or home insurance. It's expensive and its customer service is bad.

Costco's policies come from American Family Connect, part of [American Family Insurance (AmFam)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/american-family-insurance-review "American Family Insurance Review"). So when you pay a bill, make a change, or file a claim, you'll work with AmFam Connect, not with Costco.

Costco's minimum limits might be higher than the [minimum limits required in your state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). That means drivers in some states may have to buy more coverage than the state minimum.
For example, drivers in Illinois are only required to have $20,000 in [property damage liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?"), which pays for the damage you cause to another person's car or property if you hit them. But the lowest limit available from Connect is $25,000.
Costco members  automatically get a discount on American Family Connect insurance. Costco Executive Members also get a few extra perks.
**A guaranteed option to renew their policies:** With this benefit, you'll always have the option to renew your policy, no matter how many accidents or tickets you have. Typically, insurance companies can choose [not to renew your policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-cancellation-after-car-accident "Insurance Non-Renewals") when it runs out if your driving record is bad. Even with this perk, though, you might see your rates go up. You just won't lose your coverage completely.
If you're a [good driver](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-driver-car-insurance-discount "How to Get a Good Driver Discount on Car Insurance") with no accidents or tickets on your record, you are eligible for extra savings. Drivers in California also have an extra "good driver" discount available.
If you're a full-time student under 25 years old with a "B" grade average or better, you could get a [good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Good Student Insurance Discount: Who Offers It, and How to Save"). You might also get a cheaper rate if your child is a student who goes to school more than 100 miles from home and doesn't have a car with them.
Connect insurance from Costco gives you access to all the basic car insurance coverages, including liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage, [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Overview of Comprehensive and Collision Coverage"), and medical payments or personal injury protection.
[Roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") helps pay for repairs when you're stuck on the side of the road, like when you have a dead battery, lock your keys in your car or get a flat tire. It covers up to $75 per incident. It's free if you have a Costco Executive Membership.
[Gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance: How Does It Work, and Do I Need It?") pays for the difference between what you owe on your lease or auto loan and the replacement cost of the car if it is totaled in an accident.
[Rental car reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/get-rental-car-from-insurance-claim "How to Get a Rental Car From an Insurance Claim") pays for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after an accident. It covers up to $30 per day and $900 per incident.

Just like with car insurance, Costco members  automatically get a discount on Connect home insurance.
If it's newer, your roof might help you lower the [cost of your home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance "Average Cost of Homeowners Insurance"). Newer roofs can withstand damage better, so they get cheaper rates.
Buying both auto and home insurance from Costco can save you on both policies. You might also save by buying other kinds of insurance, like an [umbrella policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?").

Costco car insurance is not cheap. A full coverage policy costs an average of $177 per month. If you want [cheap car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies"), get rates from bigger companies like State Farm, Progressive and Geico.
