# Does Geico allow 6 equal payments for auto ins in California?

Im thinking of switching and the 25% down payment part always annoyed me about most other carriers. Im on the geico quote page and it says about 6 almost completely equal payments (first one is less than a dollar difference between the other 5), but I don’t want to go through the hassle of switching only to be surprised that they require a 25% dp too.

Can anyone confirm Geico does 6 equal payments for 6 month auto policies in California?
