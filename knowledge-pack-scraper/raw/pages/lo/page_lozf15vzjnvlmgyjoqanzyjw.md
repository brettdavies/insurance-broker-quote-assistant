## Geico Auto Insurance in New York
Geico offers auto insurance to drivers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to auto insurance, Geico offers many different coverages, including homeowners, renters, and pet policies.
Drivers have to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance to drive legally in the state. However, these [New York auto insurance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/new-york/) minimums are low and may not provide the coverage you need.
**New York auto insurance requirements are:**
  * $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident bodily injury liability
  * $10,000 per accident property damage liability
  * $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident uninsured/underinsured bodily injury
  * $50,000 personal injury protection


While these coverages are mandatory, they do not pay for damages to your vehicle. Add collision and comprehensive coverages to protect your car.
Collision insurance pays for damages to your car from an accident that you caused. On the other hand, comprehensive pays for damages to your vehicle unrelated to an accident, such as fire, theft, and vandalism.
Geico full coverage car insurance includes the required New York coverages as well as collision and comprehensive insurance. Drivers who cannot pay out of pocket for damages to their vehicle should consider full coverage. Although rates are a little higher, you can avoid paying high repair bills.

Whether you add extra coverages or not, be sure to carry at least the minimum amount of car insurance required. According to the Insurance Information Institute, uninsured drivers face fines, having their car impounded, and even having their driver’s license suspended.

Although [USAA insurance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/compare-auto-insurance/usaa-insurance-review/) offers the cheapest rates in New York, it only provides coverage to military members and their families. On the other hand, Geico offers the most affordable rates on average to all drivers in New York.
Remember, although low or liability-only coverage is the cheapest, it offers very little protection. Consider [full coverage](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/is-full-coverage-really-full/ "full coverage") to ensure you and your vehicle is wholly protected.
Geico full coverage is only around $25 more a month than liability-only insurance, but your protection is greatly increased. For more information, read our “[Automobile Liability Coverage](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/automobile-insurance/liability/)“.
Another thing to consider is where you live in New York. Drivers who live in busy cities with traffic congestion and high theft rates will see higher rates. For example, auto insurance rates for Geico in NYC will be higher than in Corning.

Next, look carefully at your auto policy for savings. Determine if you can drop or reduce any coverages, such as [roadside assistance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/automobile-insurance/roadside-assistance/ "roadside assistance") or rental car coverage.
Finally, you can also increase your coverage deductibles to lower rates. However, as with reducing coverage amounts, increasing your deductibles will mean you have to pay more yourself if your car is damaged.
