## Geico Auto Insurance in New York

Geico offers auto insurance to drivers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to auto insurance, Geico offers many different coverages, including homeowners, renters, and pet policies.

Drivers have to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance to drive legally in the state. However, these [New York auto insurance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/new-york/) minimums are low and may not provide the coverage you need.

**New York auto insurance requirements are:**

* $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident bodily injury liability
* $10,000 per accident property damage liability
* $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident uninsured/underinsured bodily injury
* $50,000 personal injury protection

While these coverages are mandatory, they do not pay for damages to your vehicle. Add collision and comprehensive coverages to protect your car.

Collision insurance pays for damages to your car from an accident that you caused. On the other hand, comprehensive pays for damages to your vehicle unrelated to an accident, such as fire, theft, and vandalism.

![Mascot - GEICO Insurance]()![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg)

Geico full coverage car insurance includes the required New York coverages as well as collision and comprehensive insurance. Drivers who cannot pay out of pocket for damages to their vehicle should consider full coverage. Although rates are a little higher, you can avoid paying high repair bills.

Next, look carefully at your auto policy for savings. Determine if you can drop or reduce any coverages, such as [roadside assistance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/automobile-insurance/roadside-assistance/ "roadside assistance") or rental car coverage.

Finally, you can also increase your coverage deductibles to lower rates. However, as with reducing coverage amounts, increasing your deductibles will mean you have to pay more yourself if your car is damaged.
