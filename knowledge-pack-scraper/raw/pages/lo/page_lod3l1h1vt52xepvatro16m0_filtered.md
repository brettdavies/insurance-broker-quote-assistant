Things to Remember...

* Auto insurance company codes appear on your insurance card
* Vehicle insurance codes identify the type of car or truck insured
* Some automobile insurance codes represent rates for insuring different types of cars

## How to Find Insurance Company Codes

How do I find my insurance company code? Auto insurance company codes appear on the insurance card given to auto policyholders and vary by state. For example, the Geico Insurance Company ID number in Massachusetts is 343 and in New York, it’s 639.

> These insurance codes for cars identify the type of car or truck a person has insured with the company. U.S. auto insurance companies use these codes to determine how much a policyholder will pay for collision and comprehensive coverage.

What is an insurance company code? Ins. company codes, or the insurance companies code, typically range from one to 27. Lower-numbered codes are assigned to cheaper auto insurance rates, and high-numbered codes are assigned to higher insurance rates. **Learn how to find your insurance code because these auto insurance policy codes affect how much a policyholder will pay to insure a car.**

While a person’s driving record is the main factor affecting insurance rates, the type of car a person drives can also have a considerable impact on the amount paid for auto insurance coverage.

Some insurance companies refer to auto insurance codes as symbols that represent cost rates for insuring different types of cars. These cost rates are based on different risk factors pertaining to the value of the car.

A car or truck’s value dictates how much it costs to replace each part of the vehicle. These factors affect the cost rates assigned to each auto code.

### Auto Value

A car’s perceived value can affect the likelihood that it will be stolen or vandalized. In other words, a high-end car, such as a sports car or a muscle car is more likely to be stolen than a 10-year-old clunker.

> Insuring high-end cars means a company takes on a greater risk of having to pay replacement or repair costs because these vehicles are highly sought after.

A well-built vehicle versus one that’s less solid can also affect the value of the car and its assigned company code. For example, car exteriors made from fiberglass are less durable than metal or steel-constructed exteriors.

So, a metal or steel-constructed car would be more likely to sustain less damage than a fiberglass car in a collision. This can also apply in cases of extreme weather conditions involving high winds and hail.

Ultimately, repair and replacement costs point to the degree of risk involved with insuring different types of cars. In turn, newer cars often carry higher repair and replacement costs than older cars. So, a car that uses modern computer technology would be assigned a higher insurance code than a car that runs on older mechanical systems.

## Auto Insurance Class Codes Lookup

What is Geico’s three-digit insurance ID number? That three-digit number varies by state, so Florida DMV insurance codes will differ from Texas and New York, etc. Find out how to check insurance codes in our guide to [what an auto insurance policy looks like](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-does-an-auto-insurance-policy-look-like/).

Along with the unique three-digit auto insurance code, your insurance provider is also given a number by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  Refer to this list for a quick insurance code search:

* **AAA Insurance Company Code:**The AAA company code is 11983.
* **Allstate Insurance Code:**The NAIC Allstate code is 19232.
* **Direct Auto Insurance Company Code:** The Direct Auto company code is 20133.
* **Geico Insurance Code:**The Geico company code is 35882.
* **Liberty Mutual Company Code:**The Liberty Mutual code is 23043.
* **Progressive Insurance Code:**The Progressive company code is 24260.
* **State Farm Insurance Code:**The State Farm company code is 25178.
* **The General Insurance Code:**The General NAIC code is 13703.
* **Travelers Insurance Code:** The Travelers Insurance Company ID is 25658.
* **USAA Insurance Company Code:**The USAA insurance code is 186000.

This NAIC number differs from the driving record insurance codes discussed earlier that insurance companies use to set rates. 

## Qualifying for Lower Rates

As insurance rates among companies tend to stay within a certain range, people insuring a vehicle or switching auto insurance companies can still improve their chances of getting the best rates. Considering the factors that affect how auto insurance companies assign codes, policyholders can do a couple of things to lower the code rating assigned on a car policy.

What is my insurance code? Standard model cars are more likely to fall within the low-risk categories than high-end cars. Replacement costs for standard model cars typically run lower since parts are usually easier to get than high-end, specialty vehicle parts.

Policyholders who already own high-end cars also have options when it comes to lowering the code rate assigned in their insurance policy.

> Installing safety features, such as alarms or customized locking systems can help reduce the likelihood of a high-value car being stolen.

Safety feature improvements can also take the form of replacing standard tires with specialty tires designed to maneuver better on the roads.

Once you make improvements, an insurance company may lower the auto code rating based on how said improvements reduce the company’s overall risk to insure the car.

The location where a car resides is another factor that affects auto code ratings, which means policyholders living in affluent neighborhoods most likely have a lower code rating than those who live in less affluent areas.

When factored together with a person’s driving record, the type of car insured can add a whole other set of risk factors that insurance companies must take into account.

Maintaining a clean driving record and reducing a car’s overall risk profile can go a long way toward lowering auto insurance rates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an insurance code for car insurance?

Motor vehicle insurance codes apply to the type of vehicle listed on the insurance policy. Other types of codes for car insurance include DMV insurance codes and the NAIC and state-assigned reference codes assigned to providers.

### What is the insurance code on my registration?

The three-digit insurance code on vehicle registration helps the state DMV recognize your insurance company.

### What is the insurance code on an accident report?

The five-digit car insurance code on the accident report refers to the NAIC number assigned to your insurance company.

### How does a car’s value impact car insurance codes?

A car’s perceived value affects the likelihood of theft or vandalism. High-end cars are more likely to be targeted, leading to higher insurance rates. Additionally, the construction and durability of a car’s exterior can affect its assigned code. Newer cars with modern technology may have higher repair and replacement costs, resulting in higher insurance codes.

### Are auto insurance rating codes the same for all insurance companies?
