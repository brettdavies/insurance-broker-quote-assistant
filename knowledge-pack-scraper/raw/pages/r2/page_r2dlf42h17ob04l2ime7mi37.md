### What's the best car insurance coverage in Boise, ID?
Full coverage car insurance is the best choice for most people in Boise.
Full coverage meets the minimum requirements to drive in Idaho, and it also includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Comprehensive and Collision Coverage").
  * **Collision coverage** pays for damage if you crash into another vehicle or a fixed object, regardless of whose fault it is. 
  * **Comprehensive coverage** pays for damage from "acts of God" or events outside your control. This includes fires, theft or hitting an animal on the road.


**If you have a car loan or lease, your lender probably requires you to have collision and comprehensive coverage.** You should also consider these coverages if your car is fewer than eight years old or worth more than $5,000.
**While a minimum liability policy is the least expensive option to avoid[penalties](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/idaho/penalties-driving-without-insurance "Penalties for Driving Without Insurance in Idaho"), it doesn't protect your car if you get into an accident.** In addition, minimum liability limits may not be high enough to fully cover the cost of a serious accident.
For example, if you hit and total a brand new car, $15,000 of property damage liability probably won't be enough to cover the cost to replace it. You'll have to pay the difference, which could get very expensive.
