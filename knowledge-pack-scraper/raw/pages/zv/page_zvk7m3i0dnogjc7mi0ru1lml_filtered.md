# How can you tell the difference between a structural brick building and a brick veneer?

[Brick](/r/masonry/?f=flair_name%3A%22Brick%22)

I live in a town with a lot of brick buildings that were built between 1890 and 1910. Are those buildings all structural brick primarily? These buildings now tend to have drywall would there be a 2x4 frame inside to support the drywall or lathe and plaster?

These buildings appear to have very wide exterior walls are there multiple layers of brick?

Apologies if my terminology is not correct.
