![Mother teaching son how to drive a car.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/parents-guide-to-car-insurance-for-teens.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_Car insurance for teenagers is often more expensive due to the higher risks associated with their limited experience. Factors influencing premiums may include age, vehicle type and location. Parents can choose to add their teen to an existing policy or secure a separate one. To help manage costs, families can explore various discounts, such as those for good grades or participation in safe driving programs. It's important to keep the insurance provider informed of any changes in the teen's driving status. It’s helpful to educate the teen and promote safe driving habits. By proactively addressing these, families can navigate the challenges of insuring teen drivers while encouraging responsible driving behavior._
Teen driver insurance typically costs more due to the higher risk associated with younger drivers. However, understanding [how car insurance is calculated](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-affects-car-insurance-premiums) and the factors influencing premiums can help you make informed decisions and manage costs.

Many insurers offer a variety of [auto insurance discounts for teen drivers](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-teens), helping make it easier to save on premiums while encouraging safe driving habits. Here are some common options to consider:
* **Student discounts** — teens who maintain good grades may qualify for savings through programs like the [Good Student Discount](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-teens) from State Farm.
* **Driver education discounts** — driver education programs like [Steer Clear®](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/steer-clear) from State Farm can be a great way for your teen to improve their defensive driving skills while also earning a discount.
* **Bundling discounts[ footnote 1](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/parents-guide-to-car-insurance-for-teens#footnote-1)**— [combining insurance policies](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/bundling), like [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) and [homeowners insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners), can provide further savings.
Some insurers offer usage-based programs that track your driving habits to help determine premiums. State Farm offers a program called [Drive Safe & Save®](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) that gives you 10% off just for signing up[footnote 2](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/parents-guide-to-car-insurance-for-teens#footnote-2) and an opportunity to save up to 30%.[footnote 3](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/parents-guide-to-car-insurance-for-teens#footnote-3) In addition to potential savings, usage-based programs can provide valuable insights into driving habits, which can help parents understand how their teen is driving.
When [choosing a vehicle for your teen](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/good-first-car-for-teens), it's helpful to compare cars and safety features, as these factors can influence insurance costs.
* **Safety features** — vehicles with certain [safety ratings and features](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/latest-car-safety-features-becoming-musthaves), like anti-lock brakes and multiple airbags, may qualify for discounts.
