Coverage Types

The following are examples of the types of coverage that are usually listed in your insurance policy.

* **Damage to House**
  + Covers damage to the house, up to the face amount of the policy or the additional percentage of replacement cost. Depending on the estimated value of the home. For home that incurred a total loss.
* **Other Structures**
  + Covers damage to other structures or buildings, such as a detached garage, work shed, or fencing.
* **Personal Property**
  + Covers damage to, or loss of personal property. Personal property includes household contents and other personal belongings used, owned or worn by you and your family.
* **Additional Living Expense**
  + Covers additional living expenses when incurred. This means that the policy covers the necessary living expenses up to the stated limit, incurred by the insured to continue, as nearly as possible, the normal standard of living when the house cannot be occupied due to a covered loss or if you were evacuated for a prolonged amount of time.
* **Comprehensive Personal Liability**
  + Covers personal liability. This coverage protects you against claims arising from accidents to others on property that you own or rent. With a few exceptions, such as auto or boating accidents, it is an all purpose liability policy that follows you wherever you go.
* **Medical Expense**
  + Covers medical expenses. Coverage is limited to an amount per person and per accident for injuries occurring on your premises to persons other than an insured, or elsewhere, if caused by you, a member of your family, or your pets. An important feature of this coverage is that payment is made regardless of legal liability.

Flood Is Not Covered

Water damage from a home’s plumbing or a leak in your roof is typically covered. However flood damage or destruction from ground-water or rain runoff and snow-melt is not. Flooding is a risk homeowners face everywhere in the U.S. and you must get additional coverage through The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers in addition to your standard homeowners policy. According to Kiplingers, the average cost of flood insurance is about $700 a year.

What Affects the Cost of Homeowners Insurance?

Like auto insurance, the cost of homeowners coverage depends largely on where you live. Crime rates vary from community to community and so does the access to your local fire department, police department, and water supply. These factors help determine the protection class. Along with the value of your house, the following factors determine the rates you pay for homeowner’s coverage. Other considerations are the age of the home and local fire protection.

* New homes may qualify for discounts. Older homes may not qualify for preferred programs. Insurers may require older homes to have updated heating, plumbing, wiring and roofing.
* Your home’s distance from a fire hydrant and the quality of your local fire department determine your fire protection class.
* The amount of coverage you buy for your house, contents and personal liability will affect the price you pay. Your choice of a higher deductible will reduce the price for homeowners insurance.

Cancellation and Non-Renewal

There are great differences between an insurance company *canceling* a policy and *choosing not to renew it.*

Insurance companies can cancel a policy for the following reasons:

* You fail to pay the premium.
* You have committed fraud or made serious misrepresentations on your application.
* You willfully act in a way that increases any hazard the policy insures against.
* You violate any local fire, health, safety, building, or construction regulation or ordinance that increases hazards.
* A change in the risk occurs which substantially increases any hazard insured against.
* The insured party is convicted of a crime having as one of its necessary elements an act increasing any hazard the policy insures against.

*Non-renewal* is a different matter. Either you or your insurance company can decide not to renew the policy when it expires. Companies shall give policyholders at least ten days notice prior to the date of cancellation and 30 days notice prior to the date of non-renewal.

If you think the reason is unfair or want a further explanation, call the insurance company’s consumer affairs division. If you don’t get a satisfactory explanation, call the Consumer Assistance Bureau at 855-427-5674.

Can’t Find Home Insurance?

***New Mexico Property Insurance Program is the underwriting association for the New Mexico F.A.I.R. plan (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements).***

The New Mexico FAIR Plan Act was enacted by the legislature in 1969 to provide essential property insurance to qualified applicants in the State of New Mexico who are unable to secure such insurance in the normal market.  Under the FAIR Plan, consumers can purchase a policy at Actual Cash Value of the structure at an affordable rate.  The Fair plan offers multiple limits of coverage from $225,000-$350,000 on occupied residential structures, and $250,000-$1,000,000 on Commercial structures.

The New Mexico FAIR Plan operates like a small insurance company underwriting applications, issuing policies, and adjusting claims.  This insurance is only available for dwellings and commercial property.  The applicant may apply directly to the program for coverage or may choose to use a representative or an insurance agent to act on the applicant’s behalf.

Although the plan may not appoint agents, any licensed property insurer in New Mexico can provide a quote and complete an application.  Upon completion of the application the licensed agent will submit the information to the plan for underwriting.  Should an issue with the structure arise during the underwriting process, the plan will notify the insured to allow time for corrections to be made.
