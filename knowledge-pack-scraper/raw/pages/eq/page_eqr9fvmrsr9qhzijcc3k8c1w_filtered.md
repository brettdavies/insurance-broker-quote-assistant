## Tips for owning a car

The responsibility of car ownership starts before you even make a purchase and continues as long as you own your vehicle. Fortunately, there are car ownership resources that can help you choose the right vehicle and keep it in good working order for the vehicle’s whole life.

### Vehicle recall search

The [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls) (NHTSA) has a searchable database to see if recalls exist for your vehicle. Enter the [Vehicle Identification Number](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-a-vin/) (VIN) of a vehicle to start your search. This resource is great for both shopping and vehicle maintenance. Anyone [buying a car from a private party](https://www.progressive.com/answers/buying-car-from-private-seller/) can use the database to see if there are known recalls about the vehicle they’re considering. Owners can monitor their vehicle periodically to address any issues that come to light.

### Crash test ratings and videos

If you’re [buying a new or used car](https://www.progressive.com/answers/buying-a-new-vs-used-car/), check with the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/ratings) (IIHS). The IIHS website lets you see crash test ratings and videos for many current and vintage vehicles — some models show ratings from as far back as the early 1990s.

### Car maintenance

Vehicle ownership is a lot of work, but proper maintenance can help your car perform well, look its best, and last as long as possible. Check your car's fluids and air filters according to the owner's manual, and replace lightbulbs that have burned out and wiper blades that are streaking. You can also visually inspect parts like your car's battery and belts. The battery should be free of signs of corrosion or leaking acid, belts should be free of fraying and oil contamination, and hoses shouldn't have any bulging or signs of deterioration.

### Car theft

Car theft is a broad category. Common forms of car theft include [catalytic converter theft](https://www.progressive.com/answers/catalytic-converter-theft/), stolen personal belongings from your car, and having your car stolen.

## Other considerations for vehicle ownership

If you already own a car, knowing how to maintain and protect it can help you have the best possible car ownership experience.
