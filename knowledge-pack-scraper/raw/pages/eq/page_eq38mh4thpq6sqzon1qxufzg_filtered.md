## How to bundle your auto and renters insurance policies

If you already have auto or renters insurance, bundling your policies with your current company is simple. First, reach out to your insurance company to ask if they bundle those policies and how much of a discount you can get for doing so. If they don't have the option or offer a discount, get quotes from other companies to find out how much money you could save.

If you want to bundle your auto insurance with a renters insurance policy with a new company, you'll usually use one of two methods:

1. Get a quote for both auto and renters insurance, and sign up for both at the same time.
2. Get a car insurance quote. After you sign up for the auto policy, the company will give you a discount on your car insurance if you sign up for renters insurance with them.

Some companies will offer you a multipolicy discount even if they don't sell renters insurance. For example, you can get a discount on a Geico auto insurance policy if you bundle it with , Geico's partner.

You may not have the option to bundle if you're covered by a small or regional company that doesn't offer renters insurance policies.

## Should you bundle your car insurance and renters insurance?

If it saves you money and is more convenient, bundle your auto and renters insurance. But that isn't always the best or cheapest option for everyone. It's also important to remember that some companies, such as [ResidentShield](/residentshield-renters-insurance-review "ResidentShield Renters Insurance Review") don't offer auto insurance.

### Pros and cons of insurance bundles

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Save money by getting a bundle discount | You might pay more for a combined policy with one company than you would with policies from two separate companies |
| Streamline paying bills and making claims | Support experience may be different for auto vs. renters claims |
| Pay one deductible for a combined auto and renters claim if your company offers a combined deductible |  |

## Insurance bundle opportunities
