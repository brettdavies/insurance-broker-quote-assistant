##  What Is Hazard Insurance?
Hazard insurance is coverage that protects a property owner against damage caused by fires, severe storms, hail, sleet, or other natural events. As long as the specific weather event is covered within the policy, the property owner will receive compensation to cover the cost of any damage incurred.1
##  How Hazard Insurance Works
Hazard coverage is usually a subsection of a [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp) that protects the main dwelling and other nearby structures, such as a garage. Hazard insurance financially protects a property owner against physical damage to the property structures caused by sudden perils.1
To be prepared for every contingency, homeowners should be sure that specific, common hazards are covered in their insurance policy package. Some hazard insurance policies also cover theft and vandalism.3
###  Extra Coverage
Homeowners can often elect to beef up the hazard coverage of their policy. It is much better to pay the upfront costs of [extra insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need-4783621) than to deal with the associated expenses out of pocket. As severe weather events become more commonplace across North America due to climate change, increased hazard insurance may become necessary for more homeowners.5
###  Hazard vs. Catastrophe Insurance
##  Hazard Insurance and Mortgages
##  Separate Hazard Insurance Policies
Homeowners living in high-risk areas often need a separate hazard insurance policy to adequately protect their property, such as [flood insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flood-insurance.asp). They might also need a policy that protects the property against landslides since conventional homeowners insurance's hazard coverage rarely covers landslides.7
