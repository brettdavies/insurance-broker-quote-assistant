If it saves you money and is more convenient, bundle your auto and renters insurance. But that isn't always the best or cheapest option for everyone. It's also important to remember that some companies, such as [ResidentShield](https://www.valuepenguin.com/residentshield-renters-insurance-review "ResidentShield Renters Insurance Review") don't offer auto insurance.

Auto and renters aren't the only insurance policies you can bundle. And you may even be able to bundle more than two for more discounts. For example, if you're looking to increase your renters liability coverage beyond your policy limits, you may have the option of bundling a [personal umbrella policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?") with your renters or auto insurance — or bundling all three.
As a general rule, bundling more expensive policies tends to bring bigger discounts., [Home and auto insurance bundles](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle") tend to provide the biggest discounts — up to 10% — because they're typically two of the more expensive policies.
Yes, most of the [largest insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/largest-auto-insurance-companies "Largest Auto Insurance Companies") let you bundle renters and car insurance, including State Farm, Geico, Progressive, Allstate and Farmers. Most companies will ask at the end of the quote process if you'd like to add auto or renters coverage if you don't have it already.
Geico offers the [cheapest renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies") and auto insurance bundle, at an average rate of $91 per month. State Farm offers the best discount for bundling car and renters insurance, at 4.7%.
