![Man checking document safety on his smartphone.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/mobile-digital-document-safety.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
When storing sensitive information directly on your smartphone, be selective on what to include. Think about it in terms of risk/benefit. For example, keeping a digital version of your Social Security card on your mobile device could provide more risks than benefits. For that reason, be cautious about what electronic documents you share with others. If [identity thieves](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/prevent-identity-theft) snag that information, they can wreak havoc on your personal and financial life.
Remember to [lock your phone](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/smart-ways-to-prevent-smartphone-identity-theft) as soon as you’re done using it. It can be the first line of defense and an effective deterrent in mobile electronic document security, especially if you store payment information on your device. Use either a strong passcode or a biometric measure (such as facial recognition or fingerprint) to unlock your smartphone.
Some digital ID cards or digital information can be stored via dedicated apps for easy accessibility. For example, the [State Farm® mobile app](https://www.statefarm.com/customer-care/download-mobile-apps/state-farm-mobile-app) offers the ability to access insurance information such as digital insurance ID cards.
Some accounts may offer you the option of using two-factor authentication (TFA). When possible, using TFA allows you to help protect your account’s credentials by confirming the person logging into your account is actually you. It prompts you for more than one form of contact to verify your log-in, typically by sending either a text or email with a code to input after successfully entering your password. If TFA is offered when signing up for an account, app or service, consider opting in as it can help provide greater [protection against data breaches](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-help-protect-yourself-from-data-breaches).
Be careful when navigating the internet on your device. Take [social media safety](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/tips-for-social-media-safety) measures to help remove the risk for potential threats online. Learn [how to reduce your digital footprint](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/how-to-reduce-and-protect-your-digital-footprint) to potentially remove access points for would-be hackers and fraudsters. While there are many measures you can take to help protect yourself online, [protecting yourself from smartphone theft](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/smart-ways-to-prevent-smartphone-identity-theft) can be a major part of keeping your personal information more secure.
Now that you have learned some measures to help protect e-documents on your phone, you may be interested in some [safety tips when using social media](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/tips-for-social-media-safety). Also consider contacting a [State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) for your [insurance needs](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance), including [coverage for identity restoration](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/identity-restoration).
