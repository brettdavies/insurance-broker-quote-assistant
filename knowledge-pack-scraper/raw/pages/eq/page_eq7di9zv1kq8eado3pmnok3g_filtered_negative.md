* Covers damage to the house, up to the face amount of the policy or the additional percentage of replacement cost. Depending on the estimated value of the home. For home that incurred a total loss.
* Covers damage to other structures or buildings, such as a detached garage, work shed, or fencing.
* Covers damage to, or loss of personal property. Personal property includes household contents and other personal belongings used, owned or worn by you and your family.
* Covers additional living expenses when incurred. This means that the policy covers the necessary living expenses up to the stated limit, incurred by the insured to continue, as nearly as possible, the normal standard of living when the house cannot be occupied due to a covered loss or if you were evacuated for a prolonged amount of time.
* Covers personal liability. This coverage protects you against claims arising from accidents to others on property that you own or rent. With a few exceptions, such as auto or boating accidents, it is an all purpose liability policy that follows you wherever you go.
* Covers medical expenses. Coverage is limited to an amount per person and per accident for injuries occurring on your premises to persons other than an insured, or elsewhere, if caused by you, a member of your family, or your pets. An important feature of this coverage is that payment is made regardless of legal liability.

There are great differences between an insurance company  _canceling_ a policy and  _choosing not to renew it._
_Non-renewal_ is a different matter. Either you or your insurance company can decide not to renew the policy when it expires. Companies shall give policyholders at least ten days notice prior to the date of cancellation and 30 days notice prior to the date of non-renewal.

_**New Mexico Property Insurance Program is the underwriting association for the New Mexico F.A.I.R. plan (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements).**_
The New Mexico FAIR Plan Act was enacted by the legislature in 1969 to provide essential property insurance to qualified applicants in the State of New Mexico who are unable to secure such insurance in the normal market. Under the FAIR Plan, consumers can purchase a policy at Actual Cash Value of the structure at an affordable rate. The Fair plan offers multiple limits of coverage from $225,000-$350,000 on occupied residential structures, and $250,000-$1,000,000 on Commercial structures.
The New Mexico FAIR Plan operates like a small insurance company underwriting applications, issuing policies, and adjusting claims. This insurance is only available for dwellings and commercial property. The applicant may apply directly to the program for coverage or may choose to use a representative or an insurance agent to act on the applicant’s behalf.
Although the plan may not appoint agents, any licensed property insurer in New Mexico can provide a quote and complete an application. Upon completion of the application the licensed agent will submit the information to the plan for underwriting. Should an issue with the structure arise during the underwriting process, the plan will notify the insured to allow time for corrections to be made.
