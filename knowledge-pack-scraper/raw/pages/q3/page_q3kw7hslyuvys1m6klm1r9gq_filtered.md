## What does a GEICO declarations page look like?

A declarations page (commonly called a "dec page") hosts the most important information about your insurance policy — who is covered, what is covered, and for which limits. For GEICO customers, your declarations page will look something like this:

### How to read your declarations page by section:

1. **Policy number**: This is your unique policy number, which you’ll need when [filing a claim](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/).
2. **Policy term**: Lists the effective date and expiration date of your policy.
3. **Policyholder name and address**: The address listed must be that of the policyholder and the primary location at which the vehicle is kept.
4. **Vehicle information:**The insured car's make, model, year and VIN are listed here.
5. **Coverages, limits and deductibles:**Lists [bodily injury](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage liability](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/)(required), as well as any elected coverages such as [comprehensive, collision](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-vs-collision/), etc. The limits list the maximum amount that each coverage will pay as well as any required [deductible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-deductibles/) you have to pay out of pocket.
6. **Premium**: The amount you’ll pay over the course of the policy term. Can be listed as a six-month or one-year total.

## How to find your GEICO declarations page online

Click on the ‘Manage Policy’ button.

On the top right, click on ‘Policy Documents.’

This may be grouped under “Change Your Policy” or another similar heading.

## Zebra tip: Renewal is a great time to shop around

If your policy renewal premium was higher than you're happy with, consider [comparing quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) with other companies. Now that you've found your declarations page, you can compare coverage exactly and ensure you are getting quoted for a comparable policy.

![katie gold headshot]()

Advice from your agent: Compare coverages line by line

"A lot of people focus only on the cost of insurance without truly comparing coverage apples to apples. I always encourage folks to go line by line through their policy before switching. Often, you’ll discover that certain coverages were removed, limits were lowered, or deductibles were increased. It’s essential to ensure all coverages are equal first, and then compare the price."

***Katie Gold — Head of Agency at The Zebra***

## When would I need my declarations page?

Your insurance declarations page is a key document that summarizes your policy. You might need to check it to understand your coverage, prove you have insurance when registering a car, during a traffic stop, or when filing a claim. It’s also useful for comparing policies, meeting loan or lease requirements, and checking if your policy covers rental cars. Keep it handy for travel or if you need to resolve any disputes about your coverage. Think of it as your insurance cheat sheet!

Because of this, I recommend getting an estimate for the repairs prior to filing a claim. If the value of the repairs is less than the rate increase you would receive plus your deductible (so, $2,080 + $500 to $1,000), I recommend repairing the vehicle yourself. check our handy claims calculator to…

Generally you can't remove a household member from your policy unless they have their own separate insurance coverage. You should have the option to exclude your son from the policy if you don't want him to impact your rate, but that means he will not be covered to drive any of the vehicl…

#### [Does State Farm match auto insurance quotes with other companies?](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/state-farm-match-auto-insurance-quotes-companies/ "Does State Farm match auto insurance quotes with other companies?")

In truth, no. Car insurance companies determine their rates based on their previous years' filings (loss to revenue ratio) in addition to other factors. State Farm and GEICO have different loss histories and net profits, and therefore will have different quotes (with no reason or incentive to …

I'm sorry to hear about the damage (and the sweater!). The good news is that since you are in California, glass claims should not impact your premium. In most locations, it's up to the discretion of the insurer to raise rates based on glass claims but in California, specifically, not-at-fault claim…
