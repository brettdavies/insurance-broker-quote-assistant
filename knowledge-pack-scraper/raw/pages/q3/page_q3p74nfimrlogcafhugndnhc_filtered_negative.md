Maybe State Farm should advertise to its customers that it will fight them tooth and nail anytime their property gets older, wears out, and results directly or indirectly with loss. This post gives State Farm a three-day winning hat trick following _[State Farm Wins Alabama Worn Out Roof Damage Case: Lesson About Hail Damage Cases, Expert Testimony, and Investigation Standards](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/state-farm-wins-alabama-worn-out-roof-damage-case-lesson-about-hail-damage-cases-expert-testimony-and-investigation-standards/)_, and _[State Farm Wins Texas Worn Out Roof Damage Case: Lesson About Texas Hail Damage Cases, Expert Testimony, and The Very Unique Texas Concurrent Causation Rule](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/state-farm-wins-texas-worn-out-roof-damage-case-lesson-about-texas-hail-damage-cases-expert-testimony-and-the-very-unique-texas-concurrent-causation-rule/)_.
A decision made last week in _[State Farm Florida Insurance Company v. Adele Feltes](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Feltes.pdf)_, [1](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/state-farm-wins-worn-out-plumbing-case-ensuing-water-damage-not-covered-under-state-farms-language/#_ftn1) addressed State Farm’s denial of coverage for certain water-related damages, highlighting the continued narrowing of coverage under its policies. This case serves as a reminder of the evolving landscape of homeowners’ insurance, particularly with State Farm’s water damage coverage, an issue I’ve previously warned about in _[Water Loss From Toilet Overflow Is Covered Despite State Farm Denial](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/water-loss-from-toilet-overflow-is-covered-despite-state-farm-denial/)_. State Farm has quietly implemented significant changes in its policy language, diminishing the scope of coverage in water damage scenarios, which can leave policyholders vulnerable during times of need. These water claims procedures were previously noted in _[The State Farm Water Initiative—Water Restoration and Mitigation Companies, Public Adjusters, and Policyholders Find Out How State Farm Got Tough on Water Losses](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/the-state-farm-water-initiative-water-restoration-and-mitigation-companies-public-adjusters-and-policyholders-find-out-how-state-farm-got-tough-on-water-losses/)_.
> Although the Homeowner argues otherwise, it matters not that the leak was periodic because the policy does not require a steady drip, just a repeated one. It also matters not that the phrase ‘over a period of time’ is an undefined term in the policy, because it is clear and unambiguous, and obviously met when a leak lasts for several months. See, e.g., _Brodzinski v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co._, No. 16-6125, 2017 WL 3675399, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 25, 2017) (finding exclusion for leakage and seepage of water ‘over a period of time’ unambiguous and concluding that evidence of repeated leakage that lasted long enough to result in rot and mold growth fit within the exclusion) (citing _Fifth v. State Farm Ins. Co._, No. 11-7440, 2014 WL 1253542, at *5 (D.N.J. Mar. 25, 2014) (finding exclusion for leakage and seepage of water ‘over a period of time’ unambiguous, and concluding that leakage over the course of one month fit within the exclusion)).
All public adjusters and insurance practitioners should [subscribe](https://www.irmi.com/subscribe/plans-and-pricing) to [IRMI](https://www.irmi.com/) to learn about how other policies treat these plumbing losses. The International Risk Management Institute, Inc., now known as IRMI, was founded in 1978, primarily to educate risk managers, insurance agents/brokers, underwriters, and other insurance professionals. It has developed online risk and insurance publications and discussions about much-needed policy and coverage information in an evolving industry. It has a March 2022 edition explaining the ISO standard language in an article: _[Homeowners Exception to Overflow of Water Exclusion 2.c.(6) Homeowners 3 Special Form](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Homeowners-Exception-to-Overflow-of-Water-Exclusion-2.c.6.pdf). _The article shows how different the ISO language is compared to the State Farm language and provides an example of how a policyholder can be paid through the ensuing water loss:
It is too bad that Ms. Feltes was not insured by an insurer with the standard ISO language rather than being insured by State Farm. Further, it is too bad that the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation does not demand that Florida insurers warn Floridians of the significance of slight changes in wording that can lead to uninsured policyholders. This was noted in _[Fighting Insurance Coverage Protection Gaps Is Sound Public Policy](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/fighting-insurance-coverage-protection-gaps-is-sound-public-policy/)_.
State Farm nationally and other admitted carriers in Florida particularly, through changes in policy language, have effectively limited the types of damages it will cover, especially under circumstances involving aging infrastructure or plumbing issues that develop over time. This underscores the need for vigilance in both understanding policy changes and in communicating with your insurance agent to ensure that you fully understand your coverage limits and have coverage for common losses that happen to policyholders. Some of these gaps in coverage can be filled by endorsements if your agent will take the time to explain them to you.
**_“Someone to be trusted; a courteous, friendly source of help when help is needed; someone you can count on; someone who cares.”_**
_—Former State Farm CEO Edward B. Rust, Jr. defining the Good Neighbor ethos._
