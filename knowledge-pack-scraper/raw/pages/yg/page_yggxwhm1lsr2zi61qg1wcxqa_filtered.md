## Was Your Property Damage Claim Denied by State Farm Insurance? Here's What You Can Do

**Why Were Property Damage Claims Denied by State Farm?**

The high rate of claim denials primarily stems from the nature of the damages caused by Hurricane Debby. A majority of the claims submitted were for flood damage, which Florida property insurance policies, including those from State Farm, typically do not cover. Instead, flood-related damages fall under flood insurance policies, such as those provided by the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program-nfip).

**Comparing Recent Hurricane Impacts**

Hurricane Debby placed immense pressure on Florida’s already strained insurance system. In quick succession, the state also endured Hurricanes Helene and Milton, compounding the challenges for homeowners and insurers alike.

* **Hurricane Milton** (October 2024): Over 200,000 claims were filed, with estimated losses exceeding $2.3 billion.

* **Hurricane Helene**: This storm devastated multiple states, claiming over 200 lives and damaging thousands of homes. In Florida, 14.4% of Helene-related claims were denied, compared to 8.5% for Hurricane Milton.

Across all three storms, over 37,000 hurricane claims were denied, leaving many Florida residents to seek federal assistance, such as FEMA grants, to rebuild their homes.

**What Can Florida Homeowners Do When Facing Denials by State Farm?**

If your claim with State Farm Insurance has been denied, you can take these steps to protect your rights and maximize your chances of recovery:

1. **Review and Understand Your Policy:** Ensure your insurance coverage includes all possible risks, including flood insurance if needed.
2. **Document Your Property:** Take photos and videos of your home both before and after the storm to provide clear evidence of wind, roof and flood damages.
3. **File Claims Promptly:** Submit your claim as soon as possible, adhering to the insurer’s deadlines.
4. **Seek Legal Assistance:** If your claim has been unfairly denied, consult with an attorney experienced in insurance disputes.
