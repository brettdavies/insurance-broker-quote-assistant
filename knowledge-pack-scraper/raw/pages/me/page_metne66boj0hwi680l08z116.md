### Cost considerations for young drivers in Florida 
While teen drivers face some of the highest [auto insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) when added to their parents' policy, costs tend to climb even higher when purchasing their own coverage. By staying on their parents' policy as long as they live in the household, teens can usually save significantly.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Florida? 
Your driving record is one of the strongest rating factors an insurance company uses to determine your premium. Having an at-fault accident or moving violation may increase your rate significantly for three years in Florida. If you have multiple accidents, speeding tickets or even one DUI, you could have trouble securing auto insurance in the standard market. Drivers caught [driving without insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/) and those who require an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) may find better rates with a nonstandard carrier.

## Car insurance rates in Florida by credit
Florida is one of the [many states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) that allows insurers to use your [ _credit-based insurance score_](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-credit-score/) for pricing and policy eligibility. If you have struggled with credit in the past, keep in mind that when your credit score improves, it's the perfect time to shop for better rates. Insurance companies will pull your latest credit information, which could save you hundreds of dollars per year.

## Florida car insurance rates by vehicle type
When it's time to shop for a new car, the [make and model](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) of the vehicle you decide on will affect your auto rates. Sports cars and luxury vehicles typically carry a higher risk of expensive [auto claims](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/filing-a-car-insurance-claim/), which can raise your overall insurance costs. Choosing a car with lower-cost replacement parts is one way to keep repairs more affordable. Before deciding on your next vehicle, check with your insurance agent and compare quotes for several models to see which one best fits your insurance budget.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Since insurance is highly personalized, the best car insurance company for you might be different from the top company for someone else. To help you find the best insurance provider for your situation, consider what you’re looking for from an insurer. For example, if you prioritize customer service, you might select a carrier with convenient local offices or good customer reviews. If you have teen drivers, you might choose a company that has young driver discounts. Bankrate's analysis revealed that Geico, Progressive, State Farm and Allstate are some of the [car insurance companies in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida/) worth exploring based on their performance in several categories.
  * ###  What is the average cost of minimum coverage in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Drivers with minimum coverage in Florida pay an average of $88 per month. What makes Florida different from other states is that bodily injury liability coverage isn't mandatory for most drivers, only personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability are required. While this can make coverage cheaper, it means that drivers are legally responsible to pay out of pocket for additional medical costs from an at-fault accident that exceeds the PIP limits of the injured party.
  * ###  How much insurance is required in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Like most states, Florida requires drivers to carry a minimum level of car insurance to drive legally. All [Florida motorists](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida-car-insurance-laws/) are required to have:
    * $10,000 in property damage coverage
    * $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) coverage
Florida does not technically require you to carry insurance for [bodily injury liability](https://www.meldonlaw.com/faqs/is-bodily-injury-liability-insurance-required-in-florida/). Showing proof of a bond, for instance, could satisfy the state’s “financial responsibility law.” However, you may only qualify if your [net worth](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/self-insurance/natural-person/) is equal to or greater than $40,000. Still, most drivers will likely satisfy the requirements by obtaining insurance coverage. If you purchase bodily injury coverage, you must have the following minimum limits:
    * $10,000 in bodily injury coverage per person
    * $20,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident
Uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage must be offered to Florida drivers but can be declined in writing. However, with the state’s estimated 20.4 percent uninsured motorist rate — one of the highest nationally — you may want to consider including this coverage on your policy.
Experts also recommend considering higher liability limits or full coverage to better protect yourself financially in the event of an accident. [Full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/), which includes collision and comprehensive coverage, is not required by law but will likely be required if you have a car loan or lease.
  * ###  How much is car insurance per month in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
According to Bankrate’s analysis of premium data from Quadrant Information Services, Florida drivers pay an average of $324 per month for full coverage car insurance and $88 per month for minimum coverage. However, car insurance premiums heavily weigh factors such as where you live, the car you drive and your driving profile. Drivers with more experience, a clean driving record and good credit tend to have lower car insurance premiums in Florida than new drivers or drivers with moving violations, accidents or poor credit.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
