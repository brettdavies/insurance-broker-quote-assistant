### Cost considerations for young drivers in Florida

While teen drivers face some of the highest [auto insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) when added to their parents' policy, costs tend to climb even higher when purchasing their own coverage. By staying on their parents' policy as long as they live in the household, teens can usually save significantly.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Florida?

Your driving record is one of the strongest rating factors an insurance company uses to determine your premium. Having an at-fault accident or moving violation may increase your rate significantly for three years in Florida. If you have multiple accidents, speeding tickets or even one DUI, you could have trouble securing auto insurance in the standard market. Drivers caught [driving without insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/) and those who require an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) may find better rates with a nonstandard carrier.

## Florida car insurance rates by vehicle type

When it's time to shop for a new car, the [make and model](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) of the vehicle you decide on will affect your auto rates. Sports cars and luxury vehicles typically carry a higher risk of expensive [auto claims](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/filing-a-car-insurance-claim/), which can raise your overall insurance costs. Choosing a car with lower-cost replacement parts is one way to keep repairs more affordable. Before deciding on your next vehicle, check with your insurance agent and compare quotes for several models to see which one best fits your insurance budget.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What is the best car insurance company in Florida?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Since insurance is highly personalized, the best car insurance company for you might be different from the top company for someone else. To help you find the best insurance provider for your situation, consider what you’re looking for from an insurer. For example, if you prioritize customer service, you might select a carrier with convenient local offices or good customer reviews. If you have teen drivers, you might choose a company that has young driver discounts. Bankrate's analysis revealed that Geico, Progressive, State Farm and Allstate are some of the [car insurance companies in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida/) worth exploring based on their performance in several categories.

* ### What is the average cost of minimum coverage in Florida?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Drivers with minimum coverage in Florida pay an average of $88 per month. What makes Florida different from other states is that bodily injury liability coverage isn't mandatory for most drivers, only personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability are required. While this can make coverage cheaper, it means that drivers are legally responsible to pay out of pocket for additional medical costs from an at-fault accident that exceeds the PIP limits of the injured party.

* ### How much insurance is required in Florida?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Like most states, Florida requires drivers to carry a minimum level of car insurance to drive legally. All [Florida motorists](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida-car-insurance-laws/) are required to have:

  + $10,000 in property damage coverage
  + $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) coverage

  Florida does not technically require you to carry insurance for [bodily injury liability](https://www.meldonlaw.com/faqs/is-bodily-injury-liability-insurance-required-in-florida/). Showing proof of a bond, for instance, could satisfy the state’s “financial responsibility law.” However, you may only qualify if your [net worth](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/self-insurance/natural-person/) is equal to or greater than $40,000. Still, most drivers will likely satisfy the requirements by obtaining insurance coverage. If you purchase bodily injury coverage, you must have the following minimum limits:

  + $10,000 in bodily injury coverage per person
  + $20,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident

  Uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage must be offered to Florida drivers but can be declined in writing. However, with the state’s estimated 20.4 percent uninsured motorist rate — one of the highest nationally — you may want to consider including this coverage on your policy.

  Experts also recommend considering higher liability limits or full coverage to better protect yourself financially in the event of an accident. [Full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/), which includes collision and comprehensive coverage, is not required by law but will likely be required if you have a car loan or lease.

* ### How much is car insurance per month in Florida?

  Caret Down Icon 

  According to Bankrate’s analysis of premium data from Quadrant Information Services, Florida drivers pay an average of $324 per month for full coverage car insurance and $88 per month for minimum coverage. However, car insurance premiums heavily weigh factors such as where you live, the car you drive and your driving profile. Drivers with more experience, a clean driving record and good credit tend to have lower car insurance premiums in Florida than new drivers or drivers with moving violations, accidents or poor credit.

For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
