There are other companies out there called progressive insurance that have nothing to do with PGR. Think of anything you might have signed up for that would be a monthly payment. I’d also call the service dept to see if they can assist you.

Your routing number is public information, and your account number can be made up I could one day just say my account number is 12345678 and actually match someone’s account number obviously not 1234 but you get what I’m saying. I would call progressive so they can gather more information on the matter maybe the customer who paid their policy told the rep my account ends in 5 and they typed 6 and it so happens to match yours.

You don’t need to call. They’ll just refer you back to your bank to handle it. Once the bank does the charge back the policy will be flagged for the fraud payment & the funds will be withdrawn. It very well could have been a simple error of mistyping your acct. but no way to know if someone has your banking info, and you financial institution should handle that manner from here on out to keep your funds safe & secure

That doesn't ring a bell as one of our subsidiary companies. The closest I could find is Progressive Premier Insurance Company of Illinois.

It's hard to say, it's just not in line with any of our subsidiary companies that I see listed. Definitely call your bank.

Yeah, it's strange. Prog premier ins prem would be a pretty standard thing to see from a legitimate progressive charge. I can't figure out what the ON after that would be though.

* [ Picking an insurance provider for the first year off of an employer plan and onto the ACA has been difficult even aside from sticker shock.  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1ol5s2b/picking_an_insurance_provider_for_the_first_year/)

This sub is for those who fall between r/FIRE and r/FatFIRE. We are focused on the financial side of early retirement at an asset level that allows an upper middle class lifestyle. That level will vary by location, household size and other variables, but a general guideline is $2.5M - $6M in your retirement portfolio. If you plan to retire with a leaner lifestyle in spite of a Chubby portfolio, r/FIRE might be a better fit.
