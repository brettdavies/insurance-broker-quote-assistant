Best for New Homes
Pros: 
  * Lower rates for newly built homes, among other discounts
  * Ranks at No. 2 for value to customers in our survey


Cons: 
  * Charges one of the highest monthly premiums
  * Policyholders may need to file claims with a third-party insurer


* Quote Access:

    Yes
* Multi-policy Discount Available:

**Review:** In our consumer survey, Progressive achieved second place for value and third place for its likelihood to be recommended by its customers. However, it has one of the higher sample monthly rates at about $158, though you may be able to save significantly based on how recently your house was built or with several other discount opportunities.  
  
Because Progressive works with a network of independent insurers, your policy may not be underwritten directly by Progressive, which may affect how you file claims.  
  
**Availability:** Progressive is generally available in all 50 states and D.C., but at times it may stop writing new policies in certain areas because of weather issues.

Best for Customizable Coverage
Pros:
  * Includes credit card and ordinance or law coverage
  * Smart home program provides risk detection devices and discounts


Cons:
  * Ranks low for customer loyalty and average cost
  * Not available in every state


* Quote Access:

    Yes
* Multi-policy Discount Available:

**Review:** Nationwide ranks at No. 9 for both our best and cheapest home insurance ratings, but the customizable nature of its policies and extensive array of discounts may appeal to consumers. It placed second for claims resolution in our consumer survey, though its scores were low in other categories.  
  
Unlike most other providers, Nationwide’s standard coverage includes losses from credit card fraud and new building requirements. It has an impressive array of add-ons, including service line, equipment breakdown, roof replacement, and other optional coverages.  
  
**Availability:** Nationwide does not sell homeowners insurance in Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. In recent years, the provider has also limited or stopped offering policies in certain areas at high risk of natural disasters.

Pros:
  * Wide variety of discounts, including green home and military
  * Add-ons include residence glass and matching of undamaged property


Cons:
  * Highest average premium and low customer satisfaction scores
  * Not available in all states


* Quote Access:

    Yes
* Multi-policy Discount Available:

**Review:** Coming in at No. 10 overall, Farmers also has the most expensive sample rate of any company on this list and did not qualify for the cheapest home insurance rating. Its scores in our consumer survey were midrange to poor as well.  
  
Farmers stands out for having at least 14 discounts. These can reward customers for staying claim-free, owning a newly built or certified green home, having an eligible profession or degree, and more. Farmers also offers two less common endorsements, which can waive the deductible for glass-related claims or ensure repaired property matches the undamaged parts.  
  
**Availability:** Farmers does not sell homeowners insurance in Washington, D.C., or these states: Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia.

## How To Choose the Best Homeowners Insurance Company
While our rating identifies the best homeowners insurance companies overall, the right company for you is personal. When selecting an insurer and policy, you want to consider several factors including how much coverage you need, the type of company you want to work with, and the premium you can afford.
Taking the following steps can help you find the best policy:
**1. Determine your coverage needs**
First, decide how much insurance coverage you need. Factors to consider include the value of all of your personal belongings (you can [create a home inventory](https://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory)) and the total cost to rebuild your home.
Also, think about special considerations such as if you’re in a [flood zone](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home) or an [earthquake-prone area](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/earthquake/hazard-maps). In those cases, you may need additional coverage not typically provided by a standard policy.
If you want help determining how much coverage you need, a licensed insurance agent can walk you through the process.
**2. Compare insurance companies**
Next, verify that the insurance company you’re considering offers the type of policy and coverage limits you need. Also, research the company’s:  

  * Policy management options (e.g. online, mobile app, agent)
  * Third-party reviews and rankings (like J.D. Power and AM Best)
  * Customer reviews
  * Claims process


**3. Review premium quotes**
Now it’s time to get quotes from different insurance companies to see which one offers a policy that fits your budget. You may be able to get a quote online or you might have to speak to an agent, depending on the company.
When comparing quotes, look at apples-to-apples coverage. Sometimes prices could be lower because the policy excludes the coverage that’s important for you.
Once you know the company and policy you want, it’s time to sign up. This may be an online process or you may have to consult with an agent from the company. Some insurance companies will require or recommend that you get a home inspection, which verifies that the information you provided in your application is accurate.

## What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?
Homeowners insurance is designed to cover unexpected losses and damage to your property. Here is a general overview of [what standard home insurance covers](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover).  

#### Dwelling
This covers the physical structure of your house, built-in appliances, and any attached structures like a deck. Your [dwelling coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-insurance) limit is based on the cost of rebuilding your home.
#### Other Structures
Your policy also covers structures on your property that are not attached to your home, such as a fence or detached garage. The standard coverage is usually 10% of your dwelling coverage.
#### Personal Property
Your [personal belongings](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-insurance), including furniture and clothing, are covered if they’re stolen or destroyed in a covered event. Expensive items like jewelry may not be fully covered without an endorsement.
#### Loss of Use
Also known as additional living expenses, [loss of use coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-loss-of-use-coverage) pays for costs such as hotel stays and pet boarding if you can’t live in your home due to a covered peril.
#### Personal Liability
If you, your family members, or your pets are responsible for causing bodily injury or property damage to someone else, your policy covers legal fees and other related costs.
#### Guest Medical Payments
This coverage pays for medical expenses if a guest is injured on your property, regardless of whose fault it is.
### What Doesn’t Homeowners Insurance Cover?
Home insurance policies are designed to cover many types of damage, but they [don’t cover everything](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-exclusions). Some causes of loss – such as sewer backups, flooding, and earthquakes – are excluded unless you pay for extra coverage. Other exclusions will not be covered at all, such as damage from negligence, pests, and normal wear and tear. 
## How To File a Homeowners Insurance Claim
If you experience a loss or damage covered by your policy, you can [file a claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-file-a-homeowners-insurance-claim) with your insurance company to request that they cover the cost of it. The exact process may vary by company, but you can generally report the claim online or by phone, providing details and documentation of the damage. Next, a claims adjuster will review the damage. If your claim is approved, your insurer will issue a claim payment after applying your deductible.   

## FAQ
**Who has the best rates on homeowners insurance?**
How much you pay for homeowners insurance will vary. In our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies, however, Amica has the cheapest rates. You can compare quotes to find the lowest rates for you.
**What’s the best homeowners insurance for seniors?**
There isn’t one best homeowners insurance company for seniors. Instead, you can determine your coverage needs, research insurance companies, and compare quotes to find the insurer that best meets your needs as a senior homeowner.
If price is a major consideration, we have a guide on finding [affordable homeowners insurance for seniors](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/affordable-homeowners-insurance-for-seniors).
**What is the 80% rule in homeowners insurance?**
This rule states that you should insure your home for at least 80% of its [replacement value](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost). Otherwise, your insurance company could cover less than any of your claims, even small claims. This is done to encourage homeowners to purchase adequate coverage.
Note that unless you buy a surplus line or high-risk policy, insurers typically won’t offer less than 100% replacement cost, and they use their own internal calculators to determine the replacement cost.
**How many quotes should I get for homeowners insurance?**
The general industry recommendation is to get at least three homeowners insurance quotes before selecting a policy.

## How We Rated Home Insurance Companies
To compile our ratings, we researched 21 home insurance companies, surveyed 1,125 home insurance policyholders, and analyzed a total of 10,482 product features.The following describes our approach to researching home insurance companies to guide prospective consumers.
### **U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Home Insurance Companies**
**1. We identified the companies people care most about.**
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about home insurance companies. We found 21 home insurance companies that offer home insurance policies in the U.S. We then narrowed our list down to 12 home insurance companies that had the highest volume of consumer searches online, a wide reach of consumers in various states, and a good complaint record according to data provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC reports complaint counts and annual premiums for insurance companies at the subsidiary level. The complaint data points were weighed by the size of the annual premium written, and we aggregated the weighted data points to calculate the NAIC score at the parent company level.
**2. We collected data needed to make product comparisons.**
With the companies determined, we conducted a comprehensive data collection on the features and plans of their home insurance policies to create a general summary of what consumers should know to assist with their purchasing decisions. We collected data via a consumer survey, company feature analysis, and information on premiums from Quadrant Information Services.
(a) We surveyed 1,125 home insurance customers (593 women and 532 men, with an average age of 55.8 years) to assess their satisfaction with their policies. The survey was conducted in March 2025, and the target respondents were individuals in the U.S. who currently have a home insurance policy from one of the 12 companies we identified. Survey respondents were located in the South (29.5%), Northeast (25.9%), Midwest (23.0%), and West (21.4%). We asked respondents to rate companies on the following topics: 
  * Value
  * Claim outcomes
  * Discounts
  * Customer service


(b) We collected data on 10,482 company features from the websites of the home insurance companies. These features were selected based on what consumers care most about according to our survey results, including:  

  * State availability
  * Optional coverage add-ons
  * Purchasing options
  * NAIC complaint information


(c)To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with Quadrant Information Services. To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual homeowner profiles. The following represents our profiles for the premiums collected with Quadrant Information Services:  

  * Applicant age:
    * 56-year-old married applicant
    * 38-year-old married applicant
  * 720 FICO credit score
  * A 3-person family living in a wood frame house
  * Deductibles:
    * $1000
    * $2500
  * Home age
    * 2024 construction
    * Median home age for each state
  * Dwelling coverage from $300,000 to $800,000
  * Liability coverage from $100,000 to $300,000
  * Structures coverage at 10% of dwelling coverage
  * Loss of use coverage at 20% of dwelling coverage
  * Personal property coverage at 50% of dwelling coverage
  * Guest medical coverage limited to $5000


We also collected information for applicants with a 620 FICO score, as well as for an applicant with a single wind claim in the past 5 years, but these profiles were not included in our U.S. News Rating calculation.
**3. We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the product features (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment.
### **Conversion to Standardized Scores**

**4. We assigned weights to the standardized scores.**
To integrate standardized scores into our model, we used the survey results and industry knowledge to identify which scores should influence the purchasing decision more strongly. We also considered the heterogeneity of the scores. If a score was highly heterogeneous across products, we assigned more weight to that score. But, if a score was uniform for all products, we reduced the weight of that score. For example, if all plans offered dwelling coverage, we removed its scores from the model. This allowed us to enhance the model’s ability to detect meaningful differences by emphasizing the scores with stronger discriminant power. As a result, we arrived at the following weights:
(a) Price Data (40% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 30% premium information provided by Quadrant Information Services
  * 10% survey score for value


(b) Claim Handling (25% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 20% survey score for claim handling
  * 5% NAIC complaint information


(c) Coverage (15% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 3% core coverages (dwelling coverage, other structures coverage, loss of use coverage, personal property coverage, personal liability coverage, guest medical coverage)
  * 4% other optional coverages
  * 4% property replacement options
  * 2% water backup coverage
  * 2% valuable possessions coverage


(d) Discounts (10% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 7% discount options
  * 3% customer satisfaction with discount programs


(e)Customer Service
  * 4% customer satisfaction with customer service
  * 3% availability of online signups and mobile applications
  * 3% customer satisfaction with the ease of opening a policy and filing claims

**5. We aggregated the weighted scores into the U.S. News Rating.**
We combined the weighted scores and converted the value to the U.S. News Rating on a 5-point scale, with 5.0 being the best possible rating.
