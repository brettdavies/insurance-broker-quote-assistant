Get your free quote
Homeownership in Texas is at an all-time high, and more people must protect their assets in the Lone Star State. And since Texas experiences major weather threats year-round—from thunderstorms, hail, and tornadoes in the spring to high winds in the fall—protecting your home or property becomes more important. 
This is where homeowners insurance in Texas comes in. It helps protect your home and personal belongings if they're destroyed or damaged by a covered peril. 
This article will explain everything you need to know about home insurance in Texas, including how much it costs, what it covers, how to buy one, and more. 
## What is the average homeowners insurance cost in Texas?
Wondering how much is homeowners insurance in Texas? The average [home insurance cost in Texas is $4,400,](https://www.axios.com/local/dallas/2024/04/08/home-insurance-costs-texas-oklahoma) which is amongst the highest nationwide. However, the rate varies based on several factors, such as the value and age of your home, the coverage you choose, your claims history, and other considerations.
Here's a look at the average [homeowners insurance](https://www.hippo.com/homeowners-insurance) costs in Texas over the past five years:
**Year** | **Average Annual Premium**  
---|---  
2024 | $4,437  
2023 | $4,456  
2022 | $3,626  
2021 | $2,146  
2020 | $2,000  
### What factors influence my home insurance rate?
The cost of homeowners insurance in Texas can vary based on several factors. Here are a few common elements that insurance providers use to evaluate risk and determine your house insurance cost in Texas:
  * Credit score: If you have a low credit score, your premiums will likely be higher because insurers may see you as a higher risk.
  * Claims history: If you have filed a claim in the last three to five years, your Texas homeowners insurance may cost more.
  * Home's loss history: If the previous homeowner made a claim in the last three years, it could affect your coverage cost.
  * Location: Living in an area prone to damage – like near the Texas coast – can lead to higher premiums and possibly require special coverage.
  * Deductible: Choosing a higher deductible means paying more out-of-pocket for damages, but your premiums will be lower. A lower deductible means higher premiums.
  * Home renovations: Upgrading your home, such as adding more space or using expensive materials, can increase your premiums.
  * Liabilities: Having features like pools or trampolines, which can be risky, may lead to higher premiums since you're liable for anyone using them – even without your permission.
  * House's age: Older homes usually cost more to insure. In Texas, on average, homes are about 27 years old, and newer homes often qualify for discounts.
  * Home-based business: Running a business from home may increase your premium to cover inventory, equipment, and supplies.
  * Coverage: The type and amount of coverage you choose, including personal property and liability protection, also impact your insurance cost.


### Common insurance discounts in Texas
Unlike most other states, homeowners insurance quotes in Texas are increasingly higher. Want to lower your home insurance cost in Texas? 
Although there are several ways to save on house insurance, one of the most effective ones is to [get discounts](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/column/how-to-get-home-insurance-discounts.html). If necessary, ask your insurance provider whether you get every discount you qualify for. 
Here are some discounts that Texas homeowners commonly get:
  * Advanced quote: If you switch companies before your current policy ends, you may qualify for an early shopper discount.
  * Multi-policy discount (Bundling): You can often get a discount if you buy more than one type of insurance from a similar company. Common bundle discounts include home and auto insurance, but you can also bundle home insurance with life, RV, motorcycle, and other types of insurance.
  * Home security: If your home has active, monitored security systems such as smoke detectors, fire alarms, fire extinguishers, burglar alarms, water shut-off devices, or deadbolts on exterior doors, you may qualify for a home security discount.
  * Claim-free: If you haven't filed a property insurance claim in the past, you may be eligible for a discount. Some insurance providers require you to be claim-free for three to [five years](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/tips/lower-your-home-insurance-by-asking-for-discounts.html) to qualify.
  * New/Renovated home discount: New or [renovated homes often qualify for discounts](https://www.hippo.com/blog/home-improvement-3-upgrades-will-lower-insurance-premiums) because upgraded systems, such as plumbing and wiring, are less likely to fail.
  * Roof discount: Homes with roofs made from materials that prevent damage, resist fire, or have newer roofs may qualify for a discount.
  * Umbrella package discount: Texas homeowners may get a special discount if they purchase umbrella insurance.
  * Seniors or retirees: Some companies offer a discount if you're over 55, retired, or a senior working part-time (less than 24 hours a week). Remember, the house must be your primary residence to qualify.


### Tips for lowering home insurance rates
Every year, many homeowners look for ways to get better rates or discounts on their home insurance without losing important coverage. 
In Texas, where unique risks and challenges exist, certain strategies can help you save on home insurance renewals. 
Here's a list of actionable steps to lower your homeowners insurance cost in Texas.
Shop around
Before you renew or buy a new policy, it's best to collect Texas home insurance quotes from several providers. [Compare quotes](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/consumer/lower-your-home-insurance-costs-tips-for-saving-money.html) to find the coverage you need at a price you can afford.
Bundle your policies
If you buy your home and auto insurance from the same company, you may qualify for a 5% to 15% discount. 
Just ensure that the combined cost is cheaper than buying the policies separately from different companies.
Increase your deductibles
A higher deductible typically means lower premiums. According to the Insurance Information Institute, raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can help save you [up to 25% on your premiums](https://www.iii.org/article/12-ways-to-lower-your-homeowners-insurance-costs). 
However, it also means you'll pay more out of pocket if you need to file a claim.
Lower your coverage limits
Reducing your coverage limits can also lower your premiums. But, like with higher deductibles, lower limits could mean paying more out of pocket if you need to make a claim.
Ask about discounts
Check with your insurer about discounts for security systems, storm shutters, or being a long-term policyholder. Discounts are often available but aren't automatically applied to your policy.
Avoid filing small claims
It can be tempting to file a claim for minor damages, but you may save money in the long run by paying for small expenses out of pocket. Some insurers even provide discounts if you go a few years without filing a claim.
Review your coverage
Make sure you aren't over-insured. If the value of your belongings has gone down or you've made home improvements, adjust your coverage to reflect these changes.
## What does Texas home insurance cover?
Homeowners insurance helps protect your home, belongings, and even individuals who may get hurt on your property. 
Here's a breakdown of what a typical homeowners insurance policy in Texas covers.
Dwelling coverage
This coverage is the main part of your home insurance. It helps cover the cost of repairing, replacing, or rebuilding your home if it's damaged by a covered peril such as fire, vandalism, theft, or weather events like lightning, wind, or hail. However, you'll need separate insurance for earthquakes or floods.
Personal property coverage
This covers your personal belongings inside your home, such as heating or cooling systems, furniture, kitchen appliances, clothing, and other items. 
You may need an insurance rider or additional endorsement if you have valuable items like artwork or jewelry. 
Other structures
This policy helps cover buildings on your property that aren't attached to your home, such as a garage, shed, or barn. It also includes outdoor items such as grills, fireplaces, swing sets, walls, and fences. 
If you have a trampoline, swimming pool, or other recreational equipment, they may require additional liability coverage due to their higher risk.
Personal liability coverage
This helps protect you if someone gets injured on your property. If they sue you, your insurance policy can help cover your legal fees and expenses. 
In addition, the personal liability coverage also pays for medical expenses, such as ambulance rides, X-rays, and hospital stays.
Loss of use
If you can't live in your home because it's being repaired or rebuilt, this coverage helps pay for living expenses, including hotel stays, restaurant meals, and parking. 
These policies usually have limits on how much they'll pay and for how long, so it's important to know the details of your coverage.
### Additional Texas insurance coverage options
In addition to standard home insurance, Texas homeowners should also consider additional endorsements or separate policies to get more coverage.
Here are some additional coverage options Texans must consider:
  * Earthquake insurance: If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, you may need this coverage. It helps pay for rebuilding your house or replacing your belongings after an earthquake.
  * Flood insurance: This is separate from your standard homeowners insurance policy and covers damage from flooding. You can get it through the National Flood Insurance Program or private insurers.
  * Umbrella policy: An umbrella policy offers extra protection for your assets if you exceed the personal liability limits on your home insurance.
  * Wind/Hail coverage: If you live near the coast or in a windy area, your insurance policy may not cover wind damage. The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) can provide coverage in such cases.
  * Sewer/Water backup: This covers damage if a sewer line, sump pump, or drain causes water damage in your house.


### What coverage is recommended in Texas
In Texas – due to its varied weather and natural disaster risks – it's suggested for homeowners to have the following insurance coverage policies:
Flood insurance
Floods are common in Texas, especially between April and September. Homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover flood damage, including flash floods. 
According to a Blue Ribbon Study, during a 14-year period (1986-2000), Texas had [4,722 flash floods](https://www.texasfloodinsurance.org/flood-facts/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20Blue%20Ribbon,Texas%20had%204%2C722%20flash%20floods.&text=The%20same%20study%20showed%20that,did%20not%20have%20flood%20insurance.&text=In%20May%202015%2C%2035%20trillion%20gallons%20of%20rain%20fell%20in%20Texas.). The study also showed that out of eight million buildings in flood-prone areas, three million didn't have flood insurance, leading to millions and [billions of crop and property damage](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237420/economic-damage-caused-by-floods-and-flash-floods-in-the-us/#:~:text=Economic%20damage%20caused%20by%20floods%20in%20the%20United%20States%201995%2D2022&text=In%202022%2C%20floods%20and%20flash,damage%20in%20the%20previous%20year.). This is why flood insurance is highly recommended. Even if you're not in a designated flood zone, floods can still happen.
Windstorm insurance
Windstorm insurance helps cover damage from strong winds, such as hurricanes or tornadoes. 
It can cover structural damage, loss of personal items, rebuilding costs, and living expenses if you have to leave your home. You can get this coverage as a separate policy or add-on. 
Scheduled personal property
[Scheduled personal property coverage](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/scheduled-personal-property) protects valuable items that exceed the limits of your standard policy. It includes jewelry, watches, computers, and collectibles. To get this coverage, the insurance provider may require you to provide receipts or appraisals for the items.
Replacement cost coverage
This coverage helps you rebuild or replace your home and belongings without considering depreciation. It means you'll receive the full amount needed to replace your items or rebuild your home.
## Insuring your home in Texas
Whether you have owned a home for years or are a first-time homeowner, you can easily purchase house insurance in Texas. 
Follow the steps to the T:
  * Assess your needs: Determine the type and amount of coverage you need based on your home's value, location, and personal preferences.
  * Get a quote: Look around and get home insurance quotes in Texas from multiple insurance companies to find the best coverage at the best price.
  * Review and compare: Compare the policies. Check the coverage limits, deductibles, and any exclusions or additional coverages.
  * Choose a policy: Select the policy that best meets your needs and budget. From actual cash value to replacement cost value, the options are many.
  * Purchase and finalize: Complete the application process and review the policy details before finalizing your purchase.
