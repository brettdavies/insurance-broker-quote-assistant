# Progressive insurance scam

This morning I recieved an alert for ACH payment from my savings account, which was wierd. When I checked , it's from progressive premier insurance. I've never had an account with them and neither my family members. The interesting thing is I dont even have a car. I called the bank to stop the payment. But what I'm confused is how did they get my account number and routing number? Another thing, I only called bank to stop the payment. Should I call progressive insurance customer service too ? I'm worried that my bank info is somehow out there. What should I do?
