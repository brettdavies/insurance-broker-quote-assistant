Those eyes.

That nose.

Your hair.

Your nana's smile.

Grandad's sense of humor.

Dad's ear for music.

And…your mom's work ethic

We all inherit things from our families…

But what many of us don't?

The wealth needed to buy our first home.

That’s why in 2024, Progressive contributed over seven million dollars to help make home buying a reality for many.

## Increasing access for home buyers

In an economy where homeownership is the cornerstone of financial stability, many find themselves locked out without a key. [The Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/wealth-gap-between-homeowners-and-renters-has-reached-historic-high) reveals a staggering wealth gap between homeowners and renters, driven largely by real estate — a gap that has reached unprecedented levels.

[According to Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/home-equity-and-building-generational-wealth/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20current%20market%20conditions%2C%20homeownership,able%20to%20start%20building%20wealth.%E2%80%9D), homeownership can often be a key driver of wealth accumulation. However, this challenge is especially daunting for first-generation homeowners, whose families have never owned a home. Costs like down payments and closing fees are major barriers that cut across all racial and ethnic backgrounds and geographies.

Progressive is passionately committed to breaking down these barriers by equipping individuals with the essential knowledge and resources needed to [purchase](https://www.progressive.com/about/purpose/homeownership/buy-a-home/), [maintain](https://www.progressive.com/about/purpose/homeownership/stay-in-home/), and [build wealth](https://www.progressive.com/about/purpose/homeownership/build-wealth/) through homeownership. **We've made it part of our purpose to open the door for aspiring homeowners, fostering financial security for generations to come.**

### In 2024, we contributed over $7M

Our investments are helping more families purchase, retain, and build a lasting legacy through homeownership. Last year, we partnered with various organizations to lay the foundation for tangible impact. We're not stopping there — we're investing more in 2025 and beyond to greatly expand our efforts and reach even more hopeful homeowners.

## Delivering down payment assistance

### $13.5k towards a down payment with the UpPayment program

Talking about solutions is great. Doing something about them is even better. That’s why we launched UpPayment — our down payment assistance program created to help first-generation homebuyers get into homes faster. This year, 100 participants will receive a $13.5k grant toward their down payment — and we're just getting started.

Application window is now closed. Stay tuned for the next submission opportunity.
