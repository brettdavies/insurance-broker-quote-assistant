Oh, like when I’m logging everyone's hours so I get to sit for a while.
Flo
…No.
Eva
Or like when I’m making a delivery in my van and a song comes on that I like.
Flo
…No.
Eva
So, like when I take my work van to the car wash and it's all quiet in that tunnel for like 5 minutes?
Flo

Man 1:
[In the grocery checkout line] Oooh…you want to put the heavier items on the bottom.
Dr. Rick:
Let's let him do his job.
Man 1:
Right.
Dr. Rick:
Young homeowners love to get involved with everything.

[At a restaurant] Ooh. I think the chicken Marsala.
Julie:
Ooh. I would not have that.
Dr. Rick:
Julie…
Man 2:
J-A-N. Jan as in January.
Man 1:
Canned goods, OJ, root beer, then probably sandwich cookies.
Voiceover:
Progressive can't protect you from becoming your parents. But we can protect your home and auto when you bundle with us.
Man 2:
Could be Jan, I guess. Jan? [Pronouncing Jan as "Yan"]
Jan going once. [Laughs nervously]
Jan going twice.
Dr. Rick:
Remember, you're not an auctioneer. We talked about that.

YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
[Watching someone do drills while trying on running shoes] He does know he's in public…
DR. RICK:
[Chuckles] Oh, he doesn't care.
DR. RICK:
When a young homeowner starts to turn into their parent, it helps to show them just how bad it can get.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
So they just hang out here —
DR. RICK:
— Naked? Yeah.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
[Sees plate collection on wall] What the…?
DR. RICK:
Believe it or not, she's made progress.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
Really?
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
[In a gym locker room] They don't have changing rooms here?
DR. RICK:
No, they do.
VOICEOVER:
Progressive can't save you from becoming your parents, but we can save you money when you bundle home and auto with us.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
Why is he eating his lunch in here?
DR. RICK:
You're asking the right questions.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
[Watching someone try on a shirt at a store rack] Well, at least he's not buying pants.
DR. RICK:
Oh, wait for it.
YOUNG HOMEOWNER:
No.
DR. RICK:
Yes.
DR. RICK:
Keep your shirt on. There are more fun videos over here. And the changing rooms are that way.
