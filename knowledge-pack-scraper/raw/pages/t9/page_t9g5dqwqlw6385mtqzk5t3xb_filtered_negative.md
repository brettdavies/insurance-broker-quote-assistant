# High-Risk Driver Insurance: Top 10 Best Providers & Coverage.
October 16, 2025
by carpolicyusa
**High-risk driver insurance** refers to auto policies for drivers labeled as _risky_ by insurers, typically due to past infractions like accidents or DUIs. These policies cover the same liability and optional benefits as regular car insurance, but with significantly higher premiums.
In fact, insurers often charge **30–60% more** for drivers with high-risk records. In this guide, we explain what makes a driver “high risk”, highlight specialized coverage (including SR-22 and DUI-related insurance), and review the **[10 best High-Risk](https://carpolicyusa.com/pay-per-mile-insurance/) Driver Insurance** providers in 2025. Throughout, we share data and tips to help you find affordable high-risk auto insurance.
## **Who Qualifies as a High-Risk Driver?**
A [**High-Risk Driver Insurance**](https://carpolicyusa.com/pay-per-mile-insurance/) typically has a record that makes insurers think accidents or claims are more likely. Common factors include:
* **Multiple violations or tickets.** Speeding tickets or moving violations on your record.
* **At-fault accidents.** One or more recent crashes where you were responsible
* **DUI/DWI convictions.** A drunk driving or similar offense.
* **Lapse in coverage.** A gap in your previous auto insurance.
* **Young or inexperienced.** Teen drivers or new licensees.
* **Poor credit.** Credit issues (in some states) may flag you as higher risk.
Drivers with these issues often need specialized [**high-risk auto insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/high-risk-auto-insurance-companies) (sometimes called non-standard insurance). Even a single DUI or multiple speeding tickets can trigger an insurer to classify you as high-risk
. Note that the policy **coverage** itself (liability limits, collision, etc.) is no different than normal auto insurance, High-Risk Driver Insurance, because you’re deemed more likely to file a claim.
### **Special Requirements: DUI Coverage and SR-22 Insurance**
If you have a DUI or similar serious violation, you may be legally required to get an **SR-22 certificate**. An SR-22 is _not_ an insurance policy itself but a state-mandated form filed by your insurance company to prove you carry the minimum liability coverage. It is commonly called “proof of financial responsibility.
For example, after a DUI or uninsured accident, most state DMVs demand an SR-22 to reinstate your driving privileges. The SR-22 requirement typically lasts 3–5 years, depending on your state and the offense.
Most major insurers can file SR-22 forms. However, not all carriers issue SR-22 in every state. If you’ve had a DUI, ask your insurer about SR-22 filing. In the meantime, your [**High-Risk Driver Insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/high-risk-auto-insurance-companies) will jump significantly. Studies show a DUI conviction raises premiums by about **$1,178 per year** on average.
MoneyGeek notes that after a DUI, State Farm, Travelers, and Progressive tend to offer the most affordable coverage, whereas some carriers like Geico can be much pricier for a DUI offender.s
**Important:** Even as a high-risk driver, you still must carry at least the state’s minimum liability insurance (bodily injury and property damage). These are often called **High-Risk Driver Insurance** plans. High-risk status doesn’t change coverage requirements, but some companies market special plans for drivers needing extra support after violations or an SR-22 filing.

#### **How to Reduce High-Risk Car Insurance Costs?**
Even with a history of tickets or DUI, you can sometimes lower your premiums:
* **Bundle policies.** Put home, auto, and other coverage with one insurer to earn discounts
* **Avoid small claims.** Since high-risk drivers pay more per claim, they only claim major losses.
* **Improve credit score.** In most states, better credit means cheaper rates. A higher credit score can reduce the “risk” surcharge.
* **Take a defensive driving course.** Many insurers offer discounts or goodwill for completing a safe-driving course, which can help even after violations.
* **Compare multiple quotes.** As one guide suggests, “Compare quotes from multiple companies to find the cheapest high-risk car insurance near you.” If your current insurer’s rate is too high, shopping around often uncovers a significantly lower premium.
* **Increase deductibles.** Raising your collision and
* comprehensive deductible reduces your premium. Just be sure you can afford the higher deductible if you claim.
By actively managing these factors, a high-risk driver can sometimes shave hundreds off annual premiums. For example, one analysis notes that a DUI raises annual costs by about $1,178 on average, so even a 10-20% saving is substantial.
