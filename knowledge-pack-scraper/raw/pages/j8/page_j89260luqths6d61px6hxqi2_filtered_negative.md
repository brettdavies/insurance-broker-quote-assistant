I don't want to *cheap out* on insurance, but just do some competitive shopping. We'll have 4 insured cars shortly as another kiddo gets their license.

The "importance" is relative to you.
Do you want someone you can visit in person to walk through coverages, who (should) check your account once a year for any eligible discounts or products that might be of interest to you, or can be another resource to initiate a claim or follow up with claims for you?
Then you might want a local agent.
Now keep in mind that you have captive agents who only sell one carrier and those often have a little higher premiums.
Look for [independent brokers](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=independent+insurance+brokers&cId=c86c8526-3d7e-4afa-b15b-2809de0902b7&iId=e6d808fd-a1d4-4e50-b7d2-06849cbecb46) in your area who can quote multiple companies. That will also let you make a better financial decision, especially if having someone local is important to you.

Also as an agent, the value of one of us is entirely dependent on the agent. Many are useless. Some are great.
Our office does everything we can to help customers through claims for instance. Other agents won't even call one in for you. Some will be super active in reviewing your policies, and others won't ever reach out to you unless there's a payment issue.

As an agent, I think it is pretty important. If everything goes perfectly, you may never need one. But things rarely go perfectly. If they did, you wouldn't need insurance. Find it hard to believe that there aren't any [Progressive agents](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Progressive+insurance+agents&cId=b9b3e87e-2610-4e23-ac20-dcf0ba9abee0&iId=c0bd3768-611f-47ce-b935-7280c7599b2e) near you...Progressive is everywhere.
Progressive is a killer with youthful drivers. You'll likely find a lot of savings switching to them.

If the kids grow up as Progressive customers, the company hopes they will continue to be PRO customers when they start buying their own policies. Interesting strategy.

Thanks. I'll keep hunting. How does Progress fair with home insurance? A friend in the roofing industry said SF has been a nightmare lately, and recommended Progressive or Liberty Mutual. I know the roofing industry has... been in "ambulance chasing mode" for a while and has made things worse:D

I am more cautious about their home product. They are still young in the home market and they still have some issues to iron out. We have trouble placing any new business with their [home insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=home+insurance+underwriting+criteria&cId=ab3d6c61-e518-4cec-aebe-c054bf572583&iId=d6e3db73-b6b8-41ab-8ab1-e481fa18e93c) because they have really tightened up their underwriting criteria. They have good rates, but your home has to fit several criteria before they will accept you. If you are comparing quotes and the savings is slight, I'd go elsewhere.

Your mileage may vary. The most concrete benefit of an agent is that many carriers will not write except through an agent so an agent can get you access to carriers you would not otherwise have access to. Secondary would be that a good agent should be able to discuss your coverages with you help you understand them and explain the major features of your policy in a way that online text can struggle to do. Depending on the carrier the agent may be able to help reconnect you with your adjuster or a supervisor if something's going poorly with a claim, or even push back if they feel your claims been handled unfairly (don't expect a miracle, your agent is not a claims adjuster, but they might be able to involve higher-ups in a review if they truly feel you're being mistreated. Again this will depend heavily on Carrier)
In my state progressives main home carrier is ASI, they purchased them a few years ago. ASI traditionally liked newer homes but they got really overexposed on the coast because they were writing homes with wind at a low rate and so they basically froze everything on their dp3 market, started taking huge rate increases on their home product and took new roof acceptance down to two years. Since then they've gradually been expanding their roof acceptance back out but anything older than a few years typically doesn't get great rates with them. Progressive may be using a different home carrier in a different state that has different underwriting rules and rates.
Also worth noting that progressive direct basically undercuts their agents by offering a discount for the first term when written online, but it's a differently rated product that will eventually automatically increase beyond the agent rate. Most carriers don't do that.

I have clients that are next door and clients that are across the state. We serve them the same. I think its more important that you have an agent vs just one that is local. Ultimately that is your own decision, if you are the kind that likes to go in and sit down face to face, of course a local agent is a must. But if you don't have to have that physical interaction, but you still want a familiar person handling your account then an agent hundreds of miles away will be fine.
Like the other commenter, I'm surprised you don't have anyone locally that writes with Progressive. Now they aren't appointing but just a couple of years ago, I'm pretty sure their only requirement was if you could fog a mirror.

It depends on the person. As an insurance agent, it's not at all important for me because I know what I want and know what to expect if I do need to file a claim. I work for a local agent now but carry Progressive for my cars because it's $165/month cheaper than if I were to go with the company I work for. My house is with my work though because the home policy was cheaper.
That being said, a lot of people have no clue what they're paying for when it comes to insurance. Having an agent that can help go over everything for you is super helpful when you're getting lost in the jargon of it all. It's also really nice to be able to speak to the same person every time if you do happen to have an ongoing issue, not having to explain yourself every time you call in is its own benefit. Also: older people often would be better served with a local agent who isn't going to have quite as many security questions every time you call.

State Farms agent business model is very antiquated.
You can't do any [policy changes](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+policy+changes&cId=eef99c06-e4c7-41fc-93e2-02ae1f048d09&iId=7d6c8353-2b63-417e-84f7-ad715d2ff151) without speaking to your agent.
Call the SF 800 number requesting a policy change? They say sorry, you need to call your agent. Then the agent fills out the request and then sends it to underwriting (hopefully as quick as they receive your request). I've heard anecdotally that some people would make policy change requests and it would take 2-3 WEEKS for it to process because it has to go through the agent and then to corporate.
If you're mostly online with your life, you would benefit much more from using a company that doesn't rely on a single agent to make policy changes on your behalf.
I have progressive and it's much easier to just dial the 800 number and anyone who answers can help me and the change is instant.

Honestly - you got downvoted but this has been my exact experience with State Farm. Every change takes entirely too long to get done and then it’s a back and forth between the agent and underwriting and you’re left in limbo not knowing if the change was made or what. The last new vehicle we bought took a _month_ to be fully added to the policy because underwriting couldn’t figure out how to rate it (new model).

Yeah I even worked for State Farm so I know this is how it works haha.
I had the same experience with my homeowners at State Farm, I tried cancelling it and called the 800# because why wouldn't they be able to help? The person was helpful but said changes are processed at the agents office BUT said she will send the office a note through the system to process the cancellation so I didn't have to call the agent.
I follow up 2 weeks later, policy not cancelled. So I call the agents office spoke with someone there and they confirmed yep we got the message but haven't processed the request yet. Uhhh what? They finally did get it canceled for me.
State Farm has a good product imo but some of the service lacks.

Same here. Was with State Farm and with two young drivers (20F and 17F) they kept raising our premiums every 6 months. Switched to Progressive for $2,100 for 6 months for 4 vehicles full coverage (2019 Lincoln Nautilus, 2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan, 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan). State Farm was $3,800 and GEICO quoted $2,470.

Progressive is basically eating losses on youthful drivers to try and gain market share. State Farm has basically tried to stop writing that same segment. Makes sense that the premiums are so different.

You have some great answers but also know you can switch State Farm agents very easily. Log into your account on a PC (not the app) and click on your agent info. You will see a change agent option.

Not really. Unless you’re conceding that most agents are nothing more than order takers or salespeople, which is what I believe.

I have never had nor needed an agent. Much more important to go with an insurer committed to excellent customer service like Amica. Every interaction I've had with an agent has been about them saying what is best for them - protecting their industry and selling what is profitable for them. Some of them even drink their own Kool aid on things like whole life.
