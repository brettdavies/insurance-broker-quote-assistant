# How important is a "local agent"? Currently with State Farm for home and auto, but online quotes for Progressive are \*much\* cheaper for auto. But no one nearby sells Progressive

Normally, I'd be comfortable going all online. I've not be super happy with my local SF agent, and their recent reviews and price jumps are making me look elsewhere.

In memory, the only value add the local agent has had was shifting around which adult was the "primary driver" for which vehicle for some cost savings. But I don't know if that really matter or not.

We've not had any accidents, or home issues, so we've not tested that side of "local is better" yet either.

We quoted Life Insurance recently through Policy Genius and had a positive experience. But in poking around a bit, the online quote comparisons for home + auto aren't feeling as useful as going direct, but I'm open to suggestions!

I don't want to \*cheap out\* on insurance, but just do some competitive shopping. We'll have 4 insured cars shortly as another kiddo gets their license.
