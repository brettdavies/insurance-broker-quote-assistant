Insurance laws in Connecticut are designed to protect consumers while ensuring that insurers operate fairly and transparently. Understanding these regulations can help policyholders avoid unexpected issues and ensure their rights are upheld.

This article covers key aspects of Connecticut’s insurance laws, including coverage requirements, claims handling rules, and regulatory oversight.

## Mandatory Coverage Requirements

Connecticut mandates specific types of insurance coverage to ensure financial responsibility. Auto insurance laws require all drivers to carry liability coverage with minimum limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident for bodily injury, along with $25,000 for property damage. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage must also be included at these same minimums unless the policyholder opts for lower coverage in writing. These requirements are outlined in Connecticut General Statutes 38a-334.

Health insurance policies must comply with state-mandated benefits, including coverage for mental health services, infertility treatments, and mammograms. The Connecticut Insurance Department enforces these mandates under statutes like 38a-488a, which ensures parity between mental and physical health coverage. Employers offering group health plans must adhere to these requirements, preventing discriminatory exclusions.

While homeowners insurance is not legally required, mortgage lenders typically mandate it. Connecticut law regulates aspects of these policies, such as coastal property coverage and protections against unfair exclusions. Insurers cannot deny coverage solely based on a home’s proximity to the coast, and policies must include replacement cost coverage unless the policyholder opts for actual cash value coverage in writing.

## Prohibited Claims Handling Tactics

The Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA), codified in Connecticut General Statutes 38a-815 et seq., prohibits insurers from engaging in deceptive or unfair claims settlement practices. This includes misrepresenting policy provisions, failing to respond promptly to claims, and refusing to pay without conducting a reasonable investigation. The Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) further allows policyholders to take legal action against insurers acting in bad faith.

Insurers must adhere to reasonable timelines when handling claims. They must respond within 15 business days of receiving proof of loss and complete investigations within a reasonable timeframe. Failure to do so can be classified as an unfair claims practice, exposing insurers to regulatory scrutiny. Policyholders also have the right to request written explanations for claim denials to ensure transparency.

Lowball settlement offers are prohibited. If an insurer intentionally undervalues a claim to pressure a policyholder into accepting an inadequate settlement, it may be considered bad faith. Courts in Connecticut have ruled against insurers in such cases, reinforcing that settlements must be based on fair and objective damage assessments.

## Cancellation and Nonrenewal Rules

Connecticut law limits when and how insurance companies can cancel or refuse to renew policies. Auto insurers may only cancel a policy mid-term for specific reasons, such as nonpayment of premiums, fraud, or a suspended driver’s license, as outlined in Connecticut General Statutes 38a-343. Homeowners insurance follows similar restrictions under 38a-323, with mid-term cancellations allowed only for material misrepresentation, substantial risk changes, or nonpayment. Insurers must provide written notice at least 45 days in advance, except in cases of nonpayment, where 10 days’ notice is required.

Nonrenewals are also regulated. Insurers must notify policyholders at least 60 days before the policy term ends, providing a clear explanation. If a policyholder challenges a nonrenewal, the insurer may need to provide further justification. The Connecticut Insurance Department oversees compliance and may intervene if an insurer unfairly denies renewals.

## Rate Filing and Approval

Insurance companies in Connecticut must comply with regulations when setting premiums to ensure rates are fair and nondiscriminatory. The Connecticut Insurance Department (CID) oversees this process under Connecticut General Statutes 38a-665 for property and casualty insurance and 38a-481 for health insurance. Insurers must submit rate filings detailing actuarial justifications for proposed adjustments, including claims data, administrative costs, and risk assessments.

The CID reviews these filings to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. For health insurance, public hearings are held for significant rate increases, allowing policyholders and consumer advocacy groups to provide input. The Affordable Care Act also requires regulators to assess whether rate hikes exceeding 10% are justified. For auto and homeowners insurance, the CID ensures rate changes adhere to Connecticut’s prohibition on price discrimination based on non-risk-related factors, such as geographic redlining.

## Licensing and Oversight

Insurance companies, agents, and adjusters in Connecticut must obtain licenses from the Connecticut Insurance Department. Under Connecticut General Statutes 38a-769, all insurance producers, including brokers and agents, must complete pre-licensing education and pass a state exam. They must also complete 24 credit hours of continuing education every two years to maintain licensure. Failure to meet these requirements can result in suspension or revocation.

Insurance companies must also be authorized by the CID to operate in Connecticut. This involves filing financial statements, demonstrating solvency, and complying with market conduct regulations. The CID conducts periodic financial examinations under 38a-14 to ensure insurers have sufficient reserves to pay claims. Unauthorized insurers operating without approval face fines and cease-and-desist orders.

## Enforcement and Administrative Actions

When insurers or insurance professionals violate Connecticut’s laws, the CID has the authority to take enforcement actions. Under Connecticut General Statutes 38a-817, the Commissioner of Insurance can impose fines of up to $5,000 per violation or $25,000 for willful violations. In cases involving fraud, such as misrepresentation of policy terms or deceptive advertising, the CID can revoke licenses, issue cease-and-desist orders, or refer cases for criminal prosecution.

Administrative hearings allow insurers and agents accused of violations to present their case before the CID. These hearings follow the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, ensuring due process. If an insurer disagrees with a CID ruling, they may appeal in Connecticut Superior Court under 4-183. If violations persist, the state can impose additional sanctions, including placing companies under supervision or liquidation if financial instability threatens policyholders.
