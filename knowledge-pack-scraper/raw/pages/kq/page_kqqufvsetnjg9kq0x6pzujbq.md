## Do college students need renters insurance for dorm rooms?
While renters insurance might be optional for college students living in dorms, your college or university typically isn't responsible for your personal belongings if they're stolen from your dorm room. Renters insurance is generally affordable and may provide protection and peace of mind for students concerned about replacing [stolen items](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-renters-insurance-cover-theft/).
If you choose not to carry renters insurance on campus, you may still be covered under your parents' home insurance. Home insurance policies typically extend a sub-limit of the limit for [personal property coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-property-coverage/) — for instance, 10% or $1,000, whichever is greater — for belongings away at school. College students may also have access to [personal liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-liability-insurance/) under their parents' home insurance, up to the policy's limits.
**Example:** Suppose your parents have $100,000 in contents coverage on their home insurance policy. If you're a college student living in a dorm room, you may be covered up to $10,000 for your own belongings, depending on your policy. Keep in mind, special limits may apply for certain items such as jewelry or electronics.
## Do students need renters insurance for off-campus apartments?
If you're renting an apartment or home off-campus, your landlord may require you to carry [renters insurance](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/).

Depending on your state and insurer, you may be able to [list your roommate on your renters insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-renters-insurance-cover-roommates/) for an additional cost. However, if you're sharing a policy, filing a claim could be complicated when it comes to shared items or property in the rental home. Moreover, it may be difficult to accurately split the cost of a renters insurance policy if you have more belongings to protect than your roommate, or vice versa.
