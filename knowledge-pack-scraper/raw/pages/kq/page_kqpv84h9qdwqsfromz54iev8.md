#  Let me tell you a story about how democracy and regulation led to Californians losing their homes 
[ Asking Everyone  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/?f=flair_name%3A%22Asking%20Everyone%22)
Basically, California voters passed a law in 1988 called Proposition 103, which made it way harder for insurance companies to operate in the state without getting their asses kicked. 
On top of requiring insurance companies to get government permission from an elected commissioner before raising rates (I’m suuuuuuure that doesn’t distort the market, wink wink), the law makes it far more difficult for actuaries—the math nerds who rake in gobs of money making sure insurance companies don’t price their policies too low and, you know, go out of business) to do their jobs. 
You know that whole thing about “the future might not look like the past”? Insurance companies in California are only able to use old historical data, not advanced statistical models that account for how the world might be changing (such as southern California becoming hotter or drier or windier). 
Insurance companies in California—unlike in literally every other state in America!—also aren’t allowed to pass on the cost of reinsurance (think of reinsurance as big boy insurance policies that little boy insurance companies purchase to pass along the risk of having to make massive payouts after largescale disasters, such as half the city of Los Angeles getting wiped off the face of the earth), which means any insurance company that operates in California pretty much has to eat a big whopping shit sandwich whenever something bad happens. 
Because of all this, many of the major insurance companies—State Farm, Allstate, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide, all the usual suspects you see advertising with cartoon mascots during the Super Bowl—have reduced coverage across the entire state, and State Farm pulled out of Pacific Palisades entirely. 
1,400 of the 9,000 homes in the neighborhood had insurance through the state’s insurance company of last resort, a janky government operation called the FAIR Plan. 
But the FAIR Plan only has around $200 million set aside, and its exposure in Pacific Palisades alone is close to six billion-with-a-B dollars. 
Whoops! Now pour me another glass of champagne and let’s talk about those fire hydrants that somehow ran out of water.

Global warming represents a significant threat to our well-being and the future of our planet. It is essential to challenge the notion of global warming being tied to capitalism, as acknowledging it could impose limitations on the unrestricted exploitation of environmental resources for profit.

Just because fires occurred naturally in the past doesn't logically negate current human economic activities influencing their frequency, intensity, or broader climate patterns. 
"Ice cream has always melted, therefore shrinking land ice in the polar regions isn't tied to global warming linked to capitalist activity" 
Over simplification.

What the people are going through in Los Angeles is terrible but the sad part is that their suffering is only beginning 
By electing leftist politicians and passing leftist policies a lot of rich blues are going to learn the true cost of being socialist 
Between permitting and environmental regulations now in place, their ability to rebuild will be slowed to a crawl IF THEY ARE EVEN ALLOWED TO REBUILD. 
It will be 3 years before you see any lumber being parked at someone's home and the cost will be through the rooof 
Example : want to rebuild that pool of yours .. well you will need to make sure its double-hulled and that is going to cost you easily $600k 
You are going to see a lot of pissed off people looking to those offering deregulation like Trump and Musk are pushing asa it will be their only path to rebuild in a timely and inexpensive manner

You mention it but it’s worth mentioning specifically. Prop103 was a response to rates skyrocketing. Rates were skyrocketing because California switched to no fault insurance and requiring everyone get car insurance coverage. This was in response to all the hit and run accidents caused by illegal aliens as well as the litigation against Californians by illegal aliens. The whole situation is one reaction after another with lawmakers doing nothing right. Imho

Because establishing regulations is easy, reverting one isnt. Politicians, whenever bandaid is introduced and instead of helping wound heal, it infects it, rather than removing said bandaid and introduce a different solution, they just slap another bandaid on previous bandaid. Rinse and repeat. At some point just burning half of legislature at random may bring better results, than keeping current, bloated one.

That's not socialism though. In socialism, human need and safety would be put before profits, and developers wouldn't be allowed to build in wildfire zones. 
Well there wouldn't be any developers in the first place but you get my point.

We can't rely on for-profit insurance companies to handle wide spread and regular disaster, in order to have that kind of liquidity they rely on a combination of mitigation to exposure: 
  * Reinsurance, which is insurance for insurance companies, which then becomes reinsurance for reinsurance, this is called Retrocession, a Russian nesting doll of profit seeking companies each with their own administrative costs passing the bag up the chain. 
  * These layers are also backed by CAT bonds from investors, they want their ROI too. If a layer of this chain goes insolvent, then you have an entire system collapse or they'll just refuse to pay out arbitrarily. 
  * Insurance companies also depend heavily on state and government programs to remain solvent, this creates a moral hazard, where insurance companies take excessive risk as they know the government will step in to bail them out or cover the cost if it gets too expensive. 


So you have a 6 Billion dollar disaster multiplied by each insurance layers markup passing that total cost onto claimants. Or, you can do the sensible thing and fund it entirely through state and federal taxes. 
Switching to the sensible solution would be politically difficult as stakeholders would be very grumpy, you'd have to prioritize individual risk mitigation and it would take some time of course. FAIR is meant to be the cherry on top while private insurance eats the ice cream. 
This leads to my final point, hybrid models on services with inelastic demand don't work, especially if the private option is the majority and the public option is the last resort or the bare minimum, attempts by the government to intervene and make things nicer results in push back or the moral hazard of the private sector maximizing profit and risk by relying on the buffer of the government. 
This is why our healthcare sucks, why public education sucks, why insurance sucks, why transportation sucks and why social security sucks. There is no fair market when there's an infinite willingness to pay, there's is no cap for the price on Pay or die, pay or be homeless, pay or you don't get to work, pay or your child doesn't get a diploma, pay or you work till you're dead. 
You think the government is inefficient? Try a potentially endless array of middle men taking their slice from an infinite pie. There's your Ancapistan.
