## Get Help with the Progressive Claim Time Limit from Personal Injury Lawyers

Progressive claim time limits can significantly impact whether you’re able to receive a settlement or not, making it crucial to start the insurance claims process as soon as possible. If you’ve recently been in a car accident, you should hire a [Chicago car insurance claim attorney](/updates/chicago-car-insurance-claim-lawyer/) who can guide you through the process and ensure that Progressive Insurance follows state laws.

This article will explain the typical timeline for an insurance claim and offer helpful tips for dealing with insurance companies throughout the claims process.

![A Chicago car accident lawyer helping a client with a Progressive claim time limit case.](/static/2025/06/chicago-car-accident-lawyer-progressive-claim-time-limit.jpg)

## Insurance Claim Time Limits

Illinois sets deadlines for both car insurance companies and claimants. While this may seem like it only benefits insurers, it actually helps all parties. Prompt investigations ensure you receive a settlement faster, and insurance companies can keep premiums lower by not reviewing claims from years earlier. However, it does mean you have to act quickly if you want to settle.

### Statutory Requirements

In Illinois, an insurance company must provide the proper paperwork for a car accident claim within 15 business days of receiving the request (§[215 ILCS 5/357.7](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/021500050K357.7.htm)). If you have a valid claim, they must start investigating quickly and make an effort to communicate with you within 21 working days of the accident ([Ill. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 919.40](https://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/050/050009190000400R.html)).

If the insurer chooses to deny the claim, they must provide a written explanation of why within 30 working days of the denial ([Ill. Admin. Code tit. 50, § 919.50](https://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/050/050009190000500R.html)). Lastly, if they do agree to a settlement, it must be provided within 30 days of the agreement, or you may be entitled to interest on any payments ([§215 ILCS 5/357.9](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=021500050HArt.+XXIII&ActID=1249&ChapterID=22&SeqStart=114100000&SeqEnd=115900000&Print=True#:~:text=All%20claims%20and%20indemnities%20payable,of%20due%20proof%20of%20loss.)).

### Promptness and Fairness

Like most states, Illinois has laws against improper claims practices. [§215 ILCS 5/154.6](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/021500050K154.6.htm) bars companies like Progressive from knowingly misrepresenting claimants, failing to respond quickly, not negotiating in good faith, altering claimants’ statements, or demanding evidence that isn’t necessary to prove the claim.

### Variations by State

Some states allow insurance companies even less time to settle with claimants. For example, New Hampshire requires insurers to give notice within 10 working days and make a full decision within 30 business days. If there are any delays, the company has to explain the reason for the delay every month after that ([N.H. Admin. Code § Ins 1002.05](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-hampshire/N-H-Admin-Code-SS-Ins-1002.05)).

These state variations make it crucial that you contact a law firm familiar with the insurance requirements in your state. If you’ve been hurt in a car accident in Chicago, call one of our [car accident attorneys](https://www.rosenfeldinjurylaw.com/chicago-car-accident-lawyer/) to help you make a claim.

Most states, including Illinois, have a two-year statute of limitations on personal injury claims ([§735 ILCS 5/13-202](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K13-202)). This means you have to file any insurance claim or personal injury lawsuit within two years of the accident. If you don’t file within this deadline, your claim may be dismissed, and you may not receive any compensation.

## Progressive’s Claim Handling Process

Progressive’s claims process has several steps: acknowledgment, investigation and evaluation, and a settlement offer or denial. If you’re a Progressive client, review your insurance policy to understand the process and your coverage limits and deductibles.

### Initial Steps

First, you will need the other driver’s and your own insurance information. After you’ve gone to the closest hospital, such as the University of Illinois Medical Center or Northwestern Memorial Hospital, for an examination, you should contact a lawyer and submit a claim to Progressive.

You can file a claim using Progressive’s mobile app or website, or by calling the company. When Progressive receives a claim, the company has to acknowledge receipt. This usually happens within a few days. You will receive the acknowledgment as a written or electronic notification. It should include your claim number and your adjuster’s contact details.

The adjuster will handle your case and act as a point of contact between you and the company. They review your claim, contact all parties, and begin the investigation process.

### Investigation and Evaluation

Your adjuster will investigate the claim and gather evidence, including:

* Accident report
* Medical records
* Footage of the accident
* Witness testimonies
* Vehicle and other property damage

After assessing the damages and determining liability, they will calculate your compensation for repairs, medical bills, and other damages.

### Settlement Offer or Denial

Once the insurance company finishes investigating the claim, it will either make you a settlement offer or deny the claim. If it approves your claim, your adjuster will explain how much the company will pay for repairs, medical expenses, or other damages. You should receive a written summary of the offer.

You should never sign anything regarding a car accident settlement without speaking to a lawyer. In most cases, Progressive and other companies will undervalue your claim in hopes you will accept the first offer. They know most people aren’t familiar with what a fair settlement looks like and won’t push for more. Thanks to our years of experience, we can help you obtain maximum compensation.

[If your Progressive claim is denied](/updates/chicago-car-insurance-claim-progressive-denied/), the company must explain the reasons for the denial in writing, whether they’re related to insurance policy coverage, insufficient evidence, or something else. You can either accept the settlement or dispute it with the help of a personal injury attorney.

## Time Limits for Responding to a Claim

The time limits for responding to a claim vary by state and claim type, so it’s essential to check the rules in your state. We will provide typical timeframes so you know what to expect.

### Initial Response

Most states, including Illinois, require insurance companies to complete this step within 15 business days of receipt. The adjuster usually begins the investigation several days after that.

### Claim Decision

Progressive typically has 30 days to decide on the claim, whether it’s approval, denial, or a request for more information. In complex cases, the insurer can ask for an extension, which is again regulated by state laws.

Progressive must notify the claimant about the reason for the extension, whether it’s the need for additional evidence or waiting for third-party reports.

### State-Specific Timeframes

In Illinois, insurance companies are required to provide the necessary forms to file a claim within 15 working days of your request. They must affirm or deny liability on claims within a reasonable time and offer payment within 30 days of affirming liability, provided the claim amount is determined and not in dispute.

If a property damage liability claim remains unresolved for more than 60 days from the date it was reported, the insurer must provide a reasonable written explanation for the delay.

## Factors Affecting Claim Processing Time

Car accidents can vary from simple to highly complex cases, with several factors affecting the length of the claim process. These factors include the complexity of the claim, the availability of information and evidence, the existence of disputes, and finally, the cooperation between the parties.

### Complexity of the Claim

The investigation and settlement timeline will depend on the severity of the accident, the extent of the injuries, and the number of parties involved.

More severe accidents often involve complex injuries and extensive damages, which prolong the investigation, evidence gathering, and damage determination. For example, a seriously injured person will often need more medical evaluations and treatments, and it takes time for them to recover and determine all their medical expenses.

Similarly, multiple claimants or at-fault parties can lead to more prolonged negotiations and liability assessments, as insurers need time to establish fault. This may involve disputes and lengthy talks to account for each person’s damages.

Readily available documentation, such as police reports, medical records, and witness statements, can significantly impact processing time.

For example, a police report can help establish liability, as it explains the circumstances of the accident in detail. In Chicago, you are required to submit a police report for any accident involving more than $250 in property damage ([§9-56-010](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2645906)). Not having this paperwork may make it harder for you to prove your claim.

Readily available medical records help the insurer calculate medical damages. Witness statements provide additional perspectives and may reduce the chance of disputes. For example, if you were in an accident on State Street and there were a lot of witnesses, you’ll have an easier time proving your side of the story.

### Cooperation of Involved Parties

Witnesses, claimants, and the at-fault party must submit information and cooperate with the insurance company. The investigation may stall if the claimant or the other party delays their responses or refuses to cooperate, such as in hit-and-run accidents.

Third parties, such as law enforcement or medical providers, should also respond quickly.

### Disputes and Negotiations

Disagreements over liability or the claim’s value can lead to delays in settling. Differing opinions on who’s at fault may complicate the process substantially.

Similarly, disputes over the claim’s value can lead to extended negotiations. For example, a claimant may not agree with the damages they have been awarded for their injuries, which may lead to back-and-forth discussions with the insurance company.

Also, disputing the claim usually involves gathering more evidence to support each party’s argument, which may take additional time.

## What to Do if Progressive Misses Deadlines

Progressive is required to provide a valid reason for extending the claims process, and it’s necessary to address each claim promptly and fairly. If the company misses deadlines, you have legal and other options to address the delay.

### Follow Up

If you haven’t received a response from Progressive in the expected timeframe, you should contact your insurance adjuster or the company’s customer service. This may help you determine the status of your claim and the reason behind the delay. In many cases, it’s missing information.

When calling the company, prepare your claim number, adjuster’s details, and any other information you believe may help your claim.

### Escalate the Matter

If you contact Progressive and still feel that the company hasn’t addressed your concerns, take the matter to a higher level and speak to a supervisor or manager.

Explain your situation, and have your claim number and relevant information ready. You should also document and mention any prior communications with your adjuster and company representatives.

### File a Complaint

Hopefully, the company will address the delay after you speak to a supervisor. However, if Progressive isn’t meeting its obligations, consider filing a complaint with the state insurance commissioner.

Gather documentation such as your policy details, correspondence with Progressive, and evidence of the claim’s status. Most states allow for online filing, so fill out the complaint form, submit your complaint, and keep a copy of the submission.

### Consult a Lawyer

You can take legal action if you’re experiencing unreasonable delays, unfair treatment, or believe the company is acting in bad faith.

An [experienced car accident lawyer in Chicago](https://www.rosenfeldinjurylaw.com/chicago-car-accident-lawyer/) will know how to deal with the insurance company’s tactics. They can review your claim, communicate with the insurer, negotiate a settlement, and, if needed, prepare for litigation.

In addition to seeking the damages you’re entitled to, it’s also possible to sue an insurance company for bad-faith claims, such as in [*O’Neill v. Gallant Insurance Company*](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Resources/0090ea12-423c-4a84-a52d-11b8646587d4/5000505.htm)*.* This car accident case netted the victim over $3 million because the insurance company refused to play by the rules.
