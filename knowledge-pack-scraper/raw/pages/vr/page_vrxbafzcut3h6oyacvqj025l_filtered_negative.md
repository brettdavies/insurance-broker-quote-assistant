* Flood Insurance: What To Know
![A few houses and a street affected by a flood.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/do-i-need-flood-insurance.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Floods are the most common and expensive natural disasters in the United States, [causing billions of dollars in damage to homes, businesses and infrastructures yearly](https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-flood-insurance). Just one inch of floodwater [can cause about $25,000 of damage](https://agents.floodsmart.gov/sites/default/files/fema_nfip-just-one-inch-of-floodwater-flyer-06-2023.pdf) to your home and 90% of natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The most significant flood disaster to hit the U.S. with [168,200 paid losses was Hurricane Katrina](https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-flood-insurance#Top%2010%20Most%20Significant%20Flood%20Events%20By%20National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Program%20Payouts%20\(1\)). Yet despite the considerable damage flooding causes, many homeowners may not understand the importance of flood insurance coverage.
Flood insurance can help protect homeowners and renters from the financial devastation caused by flooding. The NFIP, managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), defines a flood as an overflow of water on land that is normally dry, affecting two or more acres or properties. Flooding can be triggered by various events, including tidal waters, [mudslides](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/landslides-and-mudslides), the overflow of inland waters and the accumulation of rapid rainfall.
Unlike standard [homeowners](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners) and [renters insurance policies](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/renters), which usually exclude floods, flood insurance specifically covers property damage resulting from a flood. Coverage is available to communities within the U.S. that participate in the NFIP. The NFIP has tools that show [flood maps](https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-zones-and-maps) and can help assess the flood risks in your area.
Additionally, flood insurance does not cover certain damages such as sewer backup unless directly caused by a flood, nor does it cover living expenses, vehicles, outdoor property or [preventable mold damage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-causes-household-mold).
* **Backup of sewer and drainage:** Standard homeowners’ policies usually do not cover damages from sewer backup caused by heavy rain, failure of the [sump pump](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/sump-pump-basics) or blockage of the drain without a backup of sewer rider or an endorsement from your insurance company that is attached to your homeowner’s policy.
* **Water from windows:** [Water infiltration from windows](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/reduce-sewer-or-drain-losses-in-your-basement) (on the main floor or above) due to heavy rain is typically covered under accidental direct physical loss on a standard homeowners policy. [Water damage to a basement](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/flooded-basement-common-causes) coming from the window is typically excluded from a standard homeowner’s policy but may be covered under a flood policy in the event of a declared flood.
