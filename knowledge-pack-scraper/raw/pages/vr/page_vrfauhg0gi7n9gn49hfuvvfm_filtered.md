# Umbrella Policy vs. High Liability Coverage: Which Makes More Sense?

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

I am planning to buy a $1 million umbrella policy and realized that some insurance companies offer $1 million liability coverage on auto and renters policies directly (for example, Amica and Geico). When I do the math on what each policy costs, just getting $1 million liability on auto and home comes out ahead.

# For example, with Amica:

**Option 1: Minimum Coverage + Umbrella**

* Minimum required for auto: 250k/500k/100k which costs $945 (6 months)
* Renters policy: 300k which costs $87 (12 months)
* Umbrella $1 million: $301 (12 months)

**Total = $950 (6 months) + $90 (12 months) + $301 (12 months) = $1,341**

**Option 2: High Liability Coverage Only**

* $1 million on auto and renters: $1,059 (6 months) + $100 (12 months) = $1,159

Would it make sense to just get $1 million coverage on auto and renters, or am I missing something?
