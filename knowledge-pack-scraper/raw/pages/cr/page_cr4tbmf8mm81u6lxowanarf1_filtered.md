## Homeowners insurance rates by state

Knowing both the national average and how the average rate in your state compares could be useful baselines while [shopping for home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/). The map and table below shows homeowners insurance rates by state and the percentage of income spent, giving a quick view of how your state compares to others.

We’ve also shared some of the common risks to homes and property in each state below. Keep in mind that while flooding is a concern in many states, flood insurance is not part of standard homeowners policies. If you live in an area at risk for flooding, you will need to purchase a [separate flood insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/). Earthquakes are also a common homeowners insurance exclusion. Like floods, [earthquake damage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/is-earthquake-insurance-worth-it/) must be covered by a separate policy.

### Alabama

Alabama’s geographic location makes it vulnerable to numerous strong storms. Tornadoes and hurricanes are relatively common, and parts of the state are vulnerable to [widespread flooding](https://www.fema.gov/data-visualization/historical-flood-risk-and-costs). The higher likelihood of home damage in Alabama could be why its average homeowners insurance rates are higher than the national average.

### Alaska

### Wisconsin

Sinkholes are relatively common in parts of Wisconsin, especially in the [western region](https://www.sccwi.gov/979/Sinkhole-Program#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20sinkholes%20is,hundreds%20to%20thousands%20of%20years.) of the state due to the soft limestone beneath the surface. While sinkholes tend to be small compared to other states, even a small sinkhole could cause significant damage to structures. Southern Wisconsin is also particularly prone to flooding, and the entire state faces cold winters that can freeze and burst pipes.

> "Rising home insurance premiums continue to be driven by a large volume of catastrophe losses. In 2024, the U.S. property/casualty industry sustained more than $100 billion in natural disaster losses for the third time in the last four years. This included five landfalling hurricanes and more than $50 billion in severe convective storm losses for the second consecutive year. Other factors driving the increase in home premiums are higher costs of construction materials and labor, and an expanding trend of legal system abuse. Billboard attorneys are preying upon vulnerable catastrophe victims with marketing tactics to convince them that the only way to settle a damage claim is to hire a lawyer. This escalation in litigated claims is costing all homeowners more for their insurance."

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What factors affect homeowners insurance rates?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Several [factors impact home insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/), such as square footage, claims history, age of the dwelling, ZIP code, age of the roof and more. Aside from California, Maryland and Massachusetts, where it is prohibited, your credit history may also be a rating factor that can increase or decrease your home insurance premium. The dwelling amount needed to insure your home, as well as any optional coverage types you choose, can all play a role in [determining your final premium](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-calculator/) amount.

* ### How can I reduce the cost of home insurance?

  Caret Down Icon 

  You may be able to find a [cheaper rate for your coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/) by shopping around and asking for quotes from a range of insurers. Since each company uses its own methods for determining rates, you are likely to end up with a handful of different prices, and can then pick the most affordable one. From there, pay attention to discounts — many of which are easy to earn and can save you significantly on your premium. You may be able to save money, for example, by purchasing your home insurance from the same company that insures your vehicle, called [bundling](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/). If you live in an area at risk of natural disasters, you may also be able to save by installing damage mitigation features like hurricane shutters or a reinforced garage door.

  Lastly, avoiding small claims and paying them yourself rather than having your insurer cover them may mean your premium will not increase because you have filed too many claims.

* ### Is homeowners insurance required in my state?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Home insurance is not legally required in any state or in Washington, D.C. However, homeowners with mortgages or other types of home loans will likely have to carry home insurance as a requirement of their loan. Even if you aren’t required to buy a policy, most financial experts recommend purchasing home insurance to protect one of your most significant financial assets. Since liability coverage is also part of home insurance, it may also help protect your financial future if someone gets hurt on your property and you are found negligent.

* ###### What are the cheapest states for home insurance?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Homeowners insurance rates by state vary significantly across the U.S., influenced by factors such as local climate and weather patterns, crime rates and the cost of living. Generally, states with lower risks of natural disasters and lower property values tend to have more affordable home insurance rates. According to our research, Vermont, Delaware and Alaska offer some of the cheapest average home insurance premiums. Hawaii also has very low average rates, but wind is excluded as a covered peril in this state, so homeowners see higher rates after adding wind and flood coverage.
