Bankrate promise  Summary
Bankrate logo
The Bankrate Promise
At Bankrate, we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. To help readers understand how insurance affects their finances, we have 9 licensed insurance agents on staff who have spent a combined 78 years in the insurance industry. While we adhere to strict  editorial integrity, this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here’s an explanation of how we make money. Our content is backed by [Coverage.com](https://www.coverage.com/) LLC, a licensed entity (NPN: 19966249). For more information, please see our Insurance Disclosure.
If you own a home, you are probably aware of the need for insurance to protect your investment. Unlike car insurance, states do not require you to have home insurance, but your mortgage lender may. The cost of your insurance will vary depending on factors such as the types and amount of coverage that you buy. Another element that plays a role in determining your premium is your location.
Because different parts of the country have different levels of risk, home insurance rates by state vary throughout the U.S. For example, homes in the Midwest tend to have higher premiums because of the increased risk of tornadoes and windstorms. Bankrate's insurance editorial team took a detailed look at risks and rates to help you understand why you pay the premium you do.

The Bankrate Promise
At Bankrate, we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. To help readers understand how insurance affects their finances, we have 9 licensed insurance agents on staff who have spent a combined 78 years in the insurance industry. While we adhere to strict  editorial integrity, this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here’s an explanation of how we make money. Our content is backed by [Coverage.com](https://www.coverage.com/) LLC, a licensed entity (NPN: 19966249). For more information, please see our Insurance Disclosure.
If you own a home, you are probably aware of the need for insurance to protect your investment. Unlike car insurance, states do not require you to have home insurance, but your mortgage lender may. The cost of your insurance will vary depending on factors such as the types and amount of coverage that you buy. Another element that plays a role in determining your premium is your location.
Because different parts of the country have different levels of risk, home insurance rates by state vary throughout the U.S. For example, homes in the Midwest tend to have higher premiums because of the increased risk of tornadoes and windstorms. Bankrate's insurance editorial team took a detailed look at risks and rates to help you understand why you pay the premium you do.
