A DUI raises your car insurance rates by around 85%. That's an average increase of $149 per month for full coverage insurance.

Drunk driving can mean higher rates for several years, up to five in some states. Car insurance is more expensive after a DUI because insurance companies believe you're more likely to file a claim in the future.

## How much is insurance with a DUI in my state?

Michigan has the most expensive rates after a DUI, at $631 per month for full coverage. That's double the cost of insurance for Michigan drivers with a clean record. This makes sense, as Michigan has the second-highest car insurance rates in the country for drivers with a clean record.

## How long after a DUI does your insurance go down?

A DUI typically raises your insurance rates for three to five years, depending on the state you live in.

Three years after the DUI, your rates may return to their normal levels, depending on your insurance company. It's a good idea to shop for new rates at this point.

You may also need to keep an [SR-22 form](/sr-22-auto-insurance#what "What is SR-22 Insurance?") on file for three to five years.

**A drunk driving ticket can stay on your driving record for five to 10 years, and in some cases longer.** But it likely won't impact your rates for that long.

## What else affects your auto insurance rates after a DUI?

Many factors affect your rates after a DUI. Where you live plays a big part, as do age, gender, insurance company and how recently you got a ticket.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/static/icons/dad-child)

**Age:** Car insurance companies generally consider younger drivers riskier to insure. That's because they have less experience behind the wheel. So, age plays a big role in how much your rates increase after a DUI. For example, insurance for an 18-year-old with a DUI costs an average of 47% more than coverage for an older driver.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/static/icons/calendar)

**Time since your DUI:** The amount of time since your most recent DUI also affects your rates. Insurance companies generally consider the past three to five years of driving history to calculate your DUI insurance quote.

---

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/dui-square)

**Number of DUIs:** The number of DUIs you've had in the past three years also affects your rates. A 30-year-old with four DUIs can expect full coverage rates to be 52% more expensive than rates for someone with one DUI.

---

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/static/icons/building)

**Companies:** Every insurance company considers different factors when setting rates. For that reason, the cheapest company after a DUI typically isn't the same for everyone. Comparing quotes from multiple companies can help ensure you get the cheapest car insurance rates after a DUI.

## How do insurance companies find out about a DUI?

**Your state's DMV will tell your insurance company when you get a DUI, DWI or DWAI.** It's a good idea to contact your insurance company in advance so you can file an SR-22 form and get back to driving.

**Insurance companies typically check your driving record when you renew your policy.** They do this to decide what your new quote will be. Your record will show any recent DUIs.

The best thing you can do is be honest with your insurance company. You may also need to ask your company to file an [SR-22 or FR-44 form](/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance: Compare Quotes and Find Cheap Coverage").

This form is required in 42 states and Washington, D.C. It proves to the DMV that your insurance limits are high enough to meet the state requirement. You'll need it to keep your license after a major traffic incident like a DUI.

When you ask your insurance company to file an SR-22 or FR-44 form, you must pay a fee of around $15 to $50. You may need to keep the form on file for three to five years, depending on your state.

Some insurance companies won't file an SR-22 or FR-44 for you. And if you have a lot of tickets or accidents on your record, your insurance company may cancel your policy.

If that happens, you might need to turn to a [high-risk car insurance company](/high-risk-auto-insurance "Best Cheap Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers"). You can expect to pay even higher car insurance rates with these providers.

**Not telling your insurance company about a DUI won't keep your rates from going up.** And your insurance company may drop your policy entirely.
