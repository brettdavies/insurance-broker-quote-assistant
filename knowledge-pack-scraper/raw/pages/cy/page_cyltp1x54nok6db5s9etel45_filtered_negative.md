GEICO is one of the largest auto insurance companies in the United States by market share, and its long-running advertisements suggest that a call to [**GEICO**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/) can save drivers 15% or more on their insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-1)
[**The Hartford**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/the-hartford/) doesn’t have as large a market share, but it’s offered auto insurance since 1913, a full 23 years before GEICO’s founding. The Hartford offers specialty insurance that caters to drivers older than 50.
To determine if The Hartford or GEICO is the [**best car insurance company**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/) for you, take the time to [**compare quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), discounts, customer service, and coverage options from each company so you can make an informed decision.
* GEICO has a high complaint index score with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), meaning it receives more complaints than expected for its size.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-2)
While both GEICO and The Hartford offer similar [**auto insurance coverages**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/), senior drivers may find exclusive services with The Hartford’s partnership with AARP.
GEICO insurance may have the best rates, but it has a much worse record for customer satisfaction. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index is 1.35, meaning it has a higher rate of complaints compared to the average.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-2) In other words, GEICO receives nearly one and a half times the number of complaints as the national average. The Hartford’s NAIC index of 0.78 means it receives fewer complaints than expected.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-3)

* **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
GEICO is the third-largest auto insurance company by market share, according to the NAIC, and it offers competitive rates and a long list of potential discounts. While it’s a nationally known insurer, it also has a lower-than-average J.D. Power rating for claims satisfaction.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-4)

IQ ScoreThe [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) uses more than 15 criteria to objectively rate insurance companies on a one-to-ten scale. The Insurify editorial team researches insurer data to determine the final scores. |  9.2 /10
Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $91/mo
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $139/mo
