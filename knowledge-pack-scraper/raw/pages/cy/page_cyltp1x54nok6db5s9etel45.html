The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.</p> <p>We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Third-party financial ratings:</strong> Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&amp;P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.</li> <li><strong>Customer satisfaction:</strong> To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.</li> <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.</li> <li><strong>Customer support and transparency:</strong> This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.</li> <li><strong>Availability and reach:</strong> Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.</li></ul></article></article></li></ul></div></div></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="geico" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"><h2>GEICO</h2><p>GEICO is the third-largest auto insurance company by market share, according to the NAIC, and it offers competitive rates and a long list of potential discounts.

In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.</p></div><div class="cq_l6"><div class="b9_kX"><div class="lt-flex-col b9_b3 b9_kW"><span class="b9_g4">Pros<!-- --> </span><ul><li><p>Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers</p></li><li><p>Accident forgiveness available</p></li><li><p>A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best</p></li></ul></div><div class="lt-flex-col b9_b4 b9_kW"><span class="b9_g4">Cons</span><ul><li><p>High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs</p></li><li><p>No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available</p></li><li><p>Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D.

Once you sign up for DriveEasy, the mobile app uses your phone’s sensors to track various driving behaviors, including distracted driving, hard braking, cornering, and smoothness. It also tracks factors like distance driven, time of day, route regularity, and weather. The program assigns you a driving score based on this information.</p><p>Each time you renew your policy, GEICO partly determines your premiums based on your DriveEasy score. This means it’s possible to lower or raise your premiums with DriveEasy, and there’s no guaranteed discount. Additionally, every driver on your policy must enroll in DriveEasy if you sign up for the program.</p><p>The Hartford’s telematics program, TrueLane, offers an automatic discount of up to 12% when you enroll. The app automatically collects information about your driving behavior, including your speed, phone usage, cornering, braking, and acceleration.</p><p>When it’s time to renew your policy with The Hartford, your new policy premium will depend partly on your driving behavior. Good drivers can potentially save up to 25% at renewal. Not every driver on your policy has to enroll in TrueLane for you to take advantage of this program.</p><a class="m_2 m_7" href="/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/usage-based-insurance/"><figure><div class="m_6"><img alt="See Next: How Does Usage-Based Car Insurance Work?" loading="lazy" width="400" height="300" src="https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/1000x700/4f495ad394/rideshare-driver-with-phone-in-hand-pattern-orange-compressed.jpg/m/400x300/smart/filters:quality(90)"></div><figcaption><h3 data-cy="articleTitle">See Next: How Does Usage-Based Car Insurance Work?</h3><div class="m_8"></div></figcaption></figure></a></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="which-is-cheapest" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"><h2>GEICO vs. The Hartford: Which is the cheapest?</h2><p>GEICO has <a href="/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/"><strong>cheaper car insurance rates</strong></a> than The Hartford, based on Insurify data.
