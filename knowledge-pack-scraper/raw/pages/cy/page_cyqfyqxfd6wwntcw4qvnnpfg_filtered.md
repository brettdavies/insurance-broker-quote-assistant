With below-average car insurance rates, more discounts than many insurers, and excellent coverage, GEICO is one of the top insurers in the U.S. for good reason (the third-largest by market share, to be exact). It also has a strong record of customer satisfaction and reliability, and it differs from some companies for being available in all 50 states.

There aren't many drivers I wouldn't recommend this insurer for, at least to get a quote, but I can see the insurer being an especially good fit for higher-risk drivers. The gap between the average GEICO quote for a driver with a crystal clear record and a driver with a traffic violation or even DUI on their file isn't all that wide, and even teen drivers will enjoy lower rates.

As far as possible downsides, some of the discounts can be hard to qualify for, and the company doesn't have as many local agents as others, though that might be changing. Here's my honest take on GEICO car insurance, including how much it costs, what it covers, how it compares to competitors, and more.

## GEICO pros and cons

Pros

* Available in all 50 states
* Lower premiums than many other insurers
* Wide range of discounts and coverage

Cons

* Fewer local agents than other big companies
* Some discounts can be difficult to qualify for

## How much does GEICO cost?

All in all, GEICO's average car insurance costs are lower than costs from many of its competitors. For both [liability-only coverage](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage) and [full coverage](https://financebuzz.com/full-coverage-car-insurance), which includes [comprehensive](https://financebuzz.com/comprehensive-car-insurance) and [collision insurance](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-collision-insurance), GEICO's average quotes are a good deal below the national average. However, its rates aren't quite the lowest I've seen — that distinction would probably go to [USAA](https://financebuzz.com/usaa-auto-insurance-review), although far more people are likely to qualify for GEICO coverage than with USAA.

It can be helpful to look at how costs shake out for different driver profiles since average rates can vary widely depending on your age, driving history and experience, and other factors that affect auto insurance premiums. (Note GEICO's rates for people with incidents on their records and teen drivers.)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **GEICO liability-only monthly premium** | **GEICO full-coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $97 | $143 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $129 | $192 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $116 | $172 |
| DUI on driving record | $131 | $195 |
| Teen driver | $173 | $256 |
| Senior driver (60s) | $71 | $105 |
| Senior driver (70s) | $69 | $102 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | |  |

Now, see how those premiums compare to national averages across companies, and it'll become clear why the gecko is so confident in his claims of lower prices.

## Is GEICO car insurance good?

**Company ratings:**

* **AM Best:** A++
* **J.D. Power claims satisfaction:** 692/1,000
* **BBB:** A+
* **NAIC complaints:** 0.75

When you look at GEICO's ratings for customer satisfaction, financial stability, and overall trustworthiness, the data support this being a good company. In fact, I'd call it one of the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies) for reliability.

GEICO's AM Best and BBB ratings are as good as they get. (An A+ BBB grade indicates transparency and responsiveness.) Its National Complaint Index of 0.75, compared to the national index of 1.00, is also impressive, especially given GEICO's massive reach. GEICO customers, it seems, are happier than many other car insurance customers, if a lack of complaints issued with state insurance departments is anything to go by (and I feel it really, really is). For complaints made against GEICO, common themes I found were unsatisfactory settlement/offer and delays. These are not at all unusual frontrunners for auto insurance complaints.

In the 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study by J.D. Power, GEICO scored a slightly below-average rating of 692 out of 1,000. The study average was 697, so GEICO wasn't far behind the middle of the pack, but [Amica](https://financebuzz.com/geico-vs-amica), [Nationwide](https://financebuzz.com/nationwide-auto-insurance-review), [Liberty Mutual](https://financebuzz.com/liberty-mutual-auto-insurance-review), [State Farm](https://financebuzz.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review), and a host of other well-known companies scored higher. I'll also note that while GEICO has a strong BBB grade, its customer rating is just 1.11 out of 5 stars. This is based on over 1,400 BBB reviews, with many complaints centering on frustrating claims processes and poor communication from and with support. This is similar to GEICO's 1.3 out of 5-star rating on Trustpilot. However, I've found that people are generally more likely to complain about their experiences with financial companies and insurers than they are to praise them.

Editor's note

This disconnect between different research bodies is proof that not everyone has the same experience with a company, so it's important to understand an insurer's potential strengths and weaknesses (and avoid companies that are at the bottom of the pack, no matter what analysis you're looking at).

## GEICO discounts

GEICO's vast array of car insurance discounts sets it apart from many other insurers, including State Farm, which is known for offering many options to [save](https://financebuzz.com/save-money-on-car-insurance)[on car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/save-money-on-car-insurance).

GEICO offers many discounts that are commonly available with other providers, like those for bundling policies or driving safely, and discounts that are less common, such as those for new cars, installing certain safety devices, and passing approved defensive driving courses.

Side-by-side with the two competitors that beat it in size, [Progressive](https://financebuzz.com/geico-vs-progressive) and State Farm, it offers more discounts.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discount** | **Does GEICO have it?** | **Progressive** | **State Farm** |
| Loyalty | No | No | Yes |
| Multi-policy/bundling | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Multiple vehicle | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Airbag | Yes | No | Yes |
| Anti-lock brakes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Anti-theft | Yes | Yes (select states) | Yes |
| Safe driver | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Good student | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Away-from-home student | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| New car | Yes | No | No |
| Pay in full | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| GAP insurance | No | No | No |
| Senior | No | No | No |
| Military | Yes | No | Yes (select states) |
| Defensive driving course | Yes | Yes (select states) | Yes |

Editor's note

I didn't include these in the table above because they're even more rare, but the company also provides discounts for [federal employees](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-for-federal-employees) and people who are members/employees of over [500 partner groups](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/organization-member/) (think alumni associations, other companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway, etc.) and a variety of price reductions for getting a policy before you need to and paying ahead.

### GEICO DriveEasy

If you enroll in the DriveEasy telematics program with GEICO, the insurer's mobile app will track your driving habits to determine how safely you drive. Basically, it'll be looking at how cautiously you operate a vehicle, from how hard you brake and accelerate to how well you stay focused on the road. A program like this may help you [lower your car insurance rates](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-lower-car-insurance), and it's low risk. However, I'd really only suggest this for the really great drivers among us — if people like riding shotgun in your car, try it out.

This setup and program aren't too different from what I've seen other insurers offer, but it is notable that you can save as much as 25%, according to some reports, on GEICO's already low rates.

## Coverage

Compared to other car insurance providers, GEICO offers broader coverage.

It has your standard coverages, like liability-only policies, collision and comprehensive, and uninsured motorist policies, but its available insurance options extend to more types of vehicles and situations than most. A few types of coverage that stand out are rental reimbursement, medical coverage (common but still nice to see), and mechanical breakdown insurance to cover repair costs, as well as insurance for people who might drive their cars in Mexico.

Types of coverage GEICO provides include:

* Liability insurance
* Medical coverage
* [Uninsured and underinsured motorist](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-uninsured-motorist-coverage)
* [Collision coverage](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-collision-insurance)
* [Comprehensive coverage](https://financebuzz.com/comprehensive-car-insurance)
* Emergency roadside service
* [Mechanical breakdown](https://financebuzz.com/does-car-insurance-cover-engine-failure)
* Rental reimbursement
* Motorcycle insurance
* ATV insurance
* Recreational vehicle (RV) insurance
* Boat insurance
* Collector car insurance
* Mexico car insurance

## GEICO vs. competitors

Apples to apples, GEICO generally provides lower car insurance premiums (with more discounts), better or comparable coverage options, and above-average customer service compared to many of its competitors. It also stands out for being one of only a few companies I've reviewed with an AM Best grade of A++ for financial strength, which is a testament to how stable the insurer is overall.

Take a look at where GEICO's rates fall relative to the most popular insurers.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Company name** | **Average monthly full coverage** | **Average monthly liability-only coverage** |
| USAA | $99 | $46 |
| GEICO | $118 | $55 |
| State Farm | $119 | $55 |
| Allstate | $132 | $62 |
| Progressive | $148 | $101 |
| American Family | $157 | $72 |
| Nationwide | $181 | $85 |
| Travelers | $191 | $90 |
| **National average** | **$199** | **$105** |
| Farmers | $236 | $110 |
| Liberty Mutual | $250 | $169 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | | |

More specifically, I want to compare GEICO to Progressive and State Farm not only because they offer similar overall benefits but also because these are the only two providers that are bigger than GEICO.

### GEICO vs. Progressive

GEICO likely has an edge over Progressive when it comes to customer satisfaction, but not a huge one. In the J.D. Power claims satisfaction study, Progressive scored a 672, the second lowest in the analysis. But the company also has a below-average NAIC index and an A+ BBB grade, so we're not talking about a major difference here.

Where GEICO more decisively beats Progressive is on average premiums. For example, while the average monthly quote for liability-only coverage for a driver with a speeding ticket is $129 with GEICO, it's $125 with Progressive.

### GEICO vs. State Farm

State Farm is the largest car insurance company by market share, so it's only natural to wonder how GEICO stacks up. The two companies have about the same number of car insurance discounts, and both have AM Best ratings of A++. However, GEICO's rates are generally lower than State Farm's, sometimes by a touch and other times by a wide margin. I'd call it smart to get quotes from both.

## FAQs

### How do I contact GEICO?

To talk to a real person at GEICO, call 1 (800) 207-7847. This is the company's general customer service line. You can also live chat with an agent through the site or app.

### Who is cheaper, GEICO or Progressive?

For a lot of people, GEICO is likely to be cheaper than Progressive. But that all depends on your driving history, the type of car you drive and where you drive it, and other [factors that affect car insurance rates](https://financebuzz.com/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates). The exact discounts you qualify for are also important, and you might find that you'll qualify for more with Progressive than you would with GEICO, and vice versa. To be safe, get a free quote online from both insurers for more personalized rates.

### How to cancel GEICO car insurance

If you're a current GEICO customer but you're looking to change that, you can follow these steps to [cancel GEICO car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-cancel-geico-auto-insurance):

* Call customer service and tell them you want to cancel your policy. Be prepared to answer questions they might have about why (and possibly fend off attempts to get you to change your mind).
* Provide your policy information.
* If you've paid your premium in advance, request a refund.

Before doing any of this, make sure you have a new policy lined up. You shouldn't cancel your car insurance policy before having one from another company in place when switching.

  

## Bottom line

GEICO is a car insurance company you can trust, and its policies come with lower price tags than I see from a lot of similar providers. If I had an accident or incident on my driving record or needed to insure a teen, this would be one of the first insurers I'd get a quote from.

You're likely to have a good experience as a customer with GEICO, and there are many coverage options from this insurer that aren't available from others.
