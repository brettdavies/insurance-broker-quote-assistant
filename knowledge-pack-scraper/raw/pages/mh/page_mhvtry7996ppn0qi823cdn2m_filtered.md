**Why you can trust NerdWallet:** Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) to ensure fairness and accuracy in our coverage so you can choose the insurance policy that works best for you. These carrier ratings are specific to auto insurance — a company's rating for other products may be different on our site. See our criteria for [evaluating auto insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

* ### How we review auto insurance companies

  In our auto insurance reviews, our editorial team considers both the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength.** We use A.M. Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints.** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use.** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts.** We look at both the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Where GEICO stands out

GEICO offers plenty of discounts and may be an affordable choice for many drivers. The company regularly appears as one of the cheapest options in recent NerdWallet cheap car insurance analyses.

## Where GEICO falls short

GEICO doesn’t offer gap insurance. And if you prefer to work directly with an agent, you might have difficulty finding one near you. The company has a limited number of local agents depending on the state you live in.

GEICO doesn’t rank as high for customer satisfaction as some other auto insurers. The company has close to the expected number of complaints you’d expect for a company of its size.

GEICO ranked No. 14 out of 17 companies in J.D. Power's 2024 Auto Insurance Shopping Study for overall customer satisfaction[1].

Mechanical breakdown coverage is renewable for up to seven years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first, and does not pay for regular maintenance, such as tuneups.

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews.
