Like every U.S. state except New Hampshire, Illinois requires drivers to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance to legally operate a vehicle.

Before taking your vehicle on the road, it’s crucial to understand the coverage requirements in your state. Failure to properly insure your car can result in penalties such as fines and suspension of your vehicle registration.

Here’s what you should know about [**car insurance**](/car-insurance/) requirements in Illinois.

## Illinois car insurance requirements

Illinois requires all drivers to carry [**liability car insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/). It comprises bodily injury and property damage insurance, and the state sets specific coverage limits for each. Illinois also requires all drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage, which fewer than half of states require.[[1]](#cite-1)

| **Coverage**  sort ascsort desc | **Minimum Requirements**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- |
| Bodily injury liability | $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident |
| Property damage liability | $20,000 per accident |
| Uninsured motorist bodily injury | $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident |

### Bodily injury liability coverage

[**Bodily injury liability coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) pays for costs that result from injuries to other people when you’re at fault for a car accident. Bodily injury insurance may also cover other passengers in your car who aren’t members of your household.

Illinois requires all drivers to have at least $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident of bodily injury liability coverage. But you can carry higher limits for each if you want more thorough coverage.

### Property damage liability coverage

Property damage liability coverage pays for damages to other people’s property when you’re at fault for an accident. Covered property can include other people’s vehicles, fences, signs, and more. But it doesn’t cover your vehicle or personal property.

Illinois drivers must have at least $20,000 per accident of property damage coverage. However, as with bodily injury liability coverage, it may be wise to buy more. Given that the average new car price is more than double the minimum requirements in Illinois, you could easily find yourself on the hook for damages above and beyond your insurance limits.[[2]](#cite-2)

### Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage

[**Uninsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) pays for your injuries and those of your household members if you’re in an accident where the person at fault is an uninsured driver or if they drive away without taking responsibility for the accident. Illinois requires all drivers to carry at least $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident of uninsured motorist coverage.

Good to Know

Illinois also requires underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage for drivers who purchase higher limits of uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage. Underinsured motorist coverage pays the difference between your uninsured motorist coverage limits and the liability coverage limits of the at-fault driver.

## Illinois Automobile Insurance Plan

The Illinois Automobile Insurance Plan (ILAIP) provides insurance to drivers who otherwise couldn’t purchase it. Insurers may deny some high-risk drivers because of violations on their driving histories, like driving without insurance, DUIs, and more.[[3]](#cite-3)

[![The Best Car Insurance for Bad Drivers (2025)](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/800x600/a01e833051/blue-car-aquamarine.png/m/400x300/smart/filters:quality(90))

### The Best Car Insurance for Bad Drivers (2025)](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/bad-driving-record/)

## Do you need more than state-minimum coverage in Illinois?

Illinois’ minimum insurance requirements represent the absolute least amount of coverage you need to drive legally. But you should consider carrying more coverage, especially if you drive frequently, as damages in an accident can easily exceed the minimum liability requirements in Illinois.

If you want more protection, consider collision and comprehensive coverage. These two coverages, along with liability coverage, make up [**full-coverage car insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/). Though it’s more expensive, full coverage pays for damages to your vehicle after collisions with vehicles and other objects, theft or [**vandalism**](/car-insurance/coverage/car-vandalism/), inclement weather, and other covered incidents.

If you drive an older vehicle that isn’t worth much or you could afford to replace it out of pocket if it’s totaled, you might only need liability coverage. But if you drive a more valuable vehicle or can’t afford to replace it, it’s probably worth paying more for full coverage. Additionally, most auto lenders require that you carry full coverage as long as you have a loan on your vehicle.

[![What Does Collision Insurance Cover?](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/800x600/55f75a2e1e/hero-how-much-will-insurance-pay-for-my-totaled-car.jpg/m/400x300/smart/filters:quality(90))

### What Does Collision Insurance Cover?](/car-insurance/knowledge/what-does-collision-insurance-cover/)

## Penalties for driving without proof of insurance in Illinois

Driving without insurance is illegal in Illinois, and if you’re caught doing so, you’ll be subject to certain penalties:

* **Driving without insurance (first offense):** You’ll need to pay a fine of at least $500. You’ll also have your vehicle registration suspended until you pay a reinstatement fee of $100 and provide proof of insurance.
* **Driving without insurance (repeat offenses):** You’ll pay a fine of at least $500. You’ll also have your vehicle registration suspended for four months, at the end of which you must pay a $100 reinstatement fee and provide proof of insurance.
* **Driving without insurance and with a suspended vehicle registration:** You’ll have to pay a fine of at least $1,000.
* **Driving without insurance (third or subsequent offense):** In addition to the penalties outlined above, you’ll need to file an SR-22, proof of financial responsibility, for three years after the incident or have your license suspended.[[4]](#cite-4)

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Yes. Car insurance is required in Illinois. All drivers must have bodily injury liability coverage, property damage liability coverage, and uninsured motorist coverage to operate a vehicle legally in the state.

Yes. You must provide proof of car insurance to register a vehicle in Illinois. Additionally, the state’s Electronic Liability Insurance Verification program verifies each vehicle’s coverage at least twice per year.

Car insurance in Illinois follows the car, which means that if someone else drives your vehicle and causes an accident, your insurance should still cover it. But your insurer may deny your claim if a member of your household drives your car regularly but isn’t listed on your auto insurance policy.

No. Driving a car without insurance is never permissible, even if you just bought it. But if you already have an insurance policy, your insurer may grant you a grace period of between one week and 30 days to add your new vehicle to your policy.

Illinois’ state government made car insurance mandatory in 1988. A judge from southern Illinois ruled the law unconstitutional, but the state’s Supreme Court upheld it in 1991.[[5]](#cite-5)

If you get pulled over in Illinois and can’t provide proof of insurance, your license plates will be suspended, and you could face a minimum fine ranging from $500 to $1,000.
