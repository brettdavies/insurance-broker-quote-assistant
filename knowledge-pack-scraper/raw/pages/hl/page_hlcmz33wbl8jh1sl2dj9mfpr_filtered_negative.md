If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, your insurance premiums are likely to be higher. **Those with a[DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) may find Travelers preferable to rates offered by GEICO.** However, GEICO's rates for most other infractions remain relatively affordable. Remember that each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.

GEICO and Travelers have both moved into the realm of [telematics car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) in recent years. For safe drivers, this can lead to reduced rates. Take a look at the comparison below to see if one option stands out for your insurance needs.

While both companies are major providers of auto insurance, Travelers has a much larger presence in the [home insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) market. GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner. That said, both companies can offer a variety of coverage types with plenty of [add-ons](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/) that many homeowners could find sufficient. Read more about each company's [home insurance offerings](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/) in our comparison below.

* **Claims satisfaction (J.D. Power Rating) — Average:** In J.D. Power's most recent property claims satisfaction report, Travelers came in just below the industry average.
* **Customer satisfaction (J.D. Power Rating) — Below average:** Travelers fell below the industry average in J.D. Power's customer satisfaction study.
* **Financial strength — Excellent:** According to AM Best, Travelers has strong financials and will be able to handle your claims.
* **NAIC Rating — Good:** Fewer complaints were logged by the NAIC in regards to Travelers' homeowners insurance, falling just below the national complaint index.

Both GEICO and Travelers can pair customers with respectable [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Travelers. For that reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.

Based on the data we have available, **Travelers has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $125 per month**.
