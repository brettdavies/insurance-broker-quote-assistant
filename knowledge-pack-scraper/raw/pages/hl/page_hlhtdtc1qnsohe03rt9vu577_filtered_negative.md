_“Illinois’ minimum insurance requirements are there to provide a safety net, but in serious accidents, those minimums often fall short. Drivers should understand their coverage and consider whether additional protection is worth the investment.”_ — John J. Malm, Illinois injury attorney
_“Car accidents can lead to unexpected financial stress, especially when minimum insurance limits don’t cover the full extent of damages. Understanding your coverage and having the right legal guidance can help you navigate these challenges and protect your future.”_ — John J. Malm, Naperville car accident attorney
