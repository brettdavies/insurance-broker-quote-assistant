### GEICO vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, your insurance premiums are likely to be higher. **Those with a [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) may find Travelers preferable to rates offered by GEICO.** However, GEICO's rates for most other infractions remain relatively affordable. Remember that each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVELERS VS. GEICO

| **Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | n/a |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | n/a |
| DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $2,004 |
| Reckless driving | $2,238 | n/a |
| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $1,752 |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### GEICO vs. Travelers: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers because of their increased odds of being involved in an accident. Rates tend to get more affordable as drivers age. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) will pay more for coverage. However, **both GEICO and Travelers tend to be more affordable for teens than many competitors.** Take a look at how other age groups compare below.

##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. GEICO

| **Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $3,508 | $3,622 |
| **20s** | $1,438 | $1,645 |
| **30s** | $1,218 | $1,348 |
| **40s** | $1,189 | $1,237 |
| **50s** | $1,160 | $1,167 |
| **60s** | $1,065 | $1,165 |

Costs aside, GEICO and Travelers both have intriguing qualities, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings and policy [add-ons](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-endorsements/).

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Tie

---

Both GEICO and Travelers can pair customers with respectable [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Travelers. For that reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.

---

### GEICO vs. Travelers: home insurance rate comparison

Travelers's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,500. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile. Some companies, for instance, may place more weight on factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a many different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
