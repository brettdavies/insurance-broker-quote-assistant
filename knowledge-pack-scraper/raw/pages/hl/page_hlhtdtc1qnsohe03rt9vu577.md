# What Is the Minimum Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Amount in Illinois?

If you’re a driver in Illinois, you’re likely aware that auto insurance is not just a good idea—it’s a legal requirement. One of the most critical components of car insurance is bodily injury liability coverage, which protects you financially if you’re responsible for injuries in a [car accident](https://www.malmlegal.com/personal-injury/car-accidents/). But how much bodily injury liability coverage is required by Illinois law, and is the minimum coverage enough?
Understanding Illinois’ minimum insurance requirements is essential for drivers to stay compliant with the law and protect themselves from financial risk in the event of an accident.
_“Illinois’ minimum insurance requirements are there to provide a safety net, but in serious accidents, those minimums often fall short. Drivers should understand their coverage and consider whether additional protection is worth the investment.”_ — John J. Malm, Illinois injury attorney
In this blog, we explore the minimum bodily injury liability requirements in Illinois and why having more than the minimum might be a smart choice.
**What Is Bodily Injury Liability Coverage?**
Bodily injury liability coverage pays for injuries you cause to another person in a car accident. It covers expenses such as:
  * **Medical Bills** : Emergency care, hospital stays, surgeries, and follow-up treatments.
  * **Lost Wages** : Compensation for income lost due to the injury.
  * **Pain and Suffering** : Non-economic damages for emotional distress or reduced quality of life.


Importantly, bodily injury liability only covers injuries to other people—it does not cover your own medical expenses or those of your passengers.
**Minimum Bodily Injury Liability Requirements in Illinois**
[Under Illinois law (625 ILCS 5/7-601)](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K7-601), all drivers must carry auto insurance that includes bodily injury liability coverage. The minimum required limits are:
  * **$25,000** per person injured in an accident.
  * **$50,000** total for all injuries in a single accident.


This is commonly referred to as 25/50 coverage.
**Example of 25/50 Coverage in Action**
Imagine you’re at fault in an accident that injures two people:
  1. **Person A** incurs $30,000 in medical bills.
  2. **Person B** incurs $20,000 in medical bills.


Your insurance would pay:
  * Up to $25,000 for **Person A** (leaving $5,000 uncovered).
  * Up to $20,000 for **Person B**.
  * The total payout would be $45,000, staying within the $50,000 per-accident limit.


In this case, you may be personally responsible for the $5,000 difference for Person A. If the injuries were more severe and costs exceeded $50,000, you’d be liable for any amount beyond your policy limits.

**Is the Minimum Coverage in Illinois Enough?**
While Illinois’ 25/50 minimum provides a baseline level of protection, it may not be sufficient in serious accidents with [catastrophic injuries](https://www.malmlegal.com/personal-injury/injuries/catastrophic-injuries/). Medical expenses can quickly exceed $25,000 per person, especially if there are long-term injuries or extensive treatments. Similarly, the $50,000 per-accident cap might not cover all claims in a multi-injury accident.
**Potential Risks of Minimum Coverage**
  1. **Personal Financial Exposure** : If damages exceed your policy limits, you may be personally responsible for the remaining amount. This could mean tapping into savings, assets, or future earnings.
  2. **Lawsuits** : In severe cases, injured parties may file lawsuits against you to recover unpaid damages, putting your financial future at risk.
  3. **Limited Peace of Mind** : Minimum coverage may leave you worrying about “what if” scenarios, especially in high-cost accidents.


**Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**
In addition to bodily injury liability, Illinois requires drivers to carry [uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage](https://www.malmlegal.com/personal-injury/car-accidents/illinois-uninsured-underinsured-motorist-claims/) with the same minimum limits of 25/50. This coverage protects you if:
  * You’re injured in an accident caused by an uninsured driver.
  * The at-fault driver’s liability coverage isn’t enough to cover your damages.


For example, if you’re hit by a driver with no insurance, your UM/UIM coverage can step in to pay for your medical expenses, up to the limits of your policy.
**Why Should You Consider Higher Insurance Coverage Limits?**
While minimum coverage meets legal requirements, many drivers choose to purchase higher liability limits to better protect themselves. Commonly purchased limits include:
  * **50/100** : $50,000 per person / $100,000 per accident.
  * **100/300** : $100,000 per person / $300,000 per accident.


**Benefits of Higher Coverage**
  * **Better Protection** : Covers more of the costs in severe accidents, reducing your out-of-pocket liability.
  * **Increased Peace of Mind** : You won’t have to worry as much about financial fallout from a serious accident.
  * **Legal Safeguards** : Reduces the likelihood of lawsuits or personal financial exposure.


**Cost Considerations**
Higher coverage limits do come with slightly higher premiums, but the additional cost is often modest compared to the potential financial risk of being underinsured and being financially responsible for medical bills exceeding your insurance coverage.
**How Does Fault Affect Liability in Illinois?**
Illinois operates under a [modified comparative negligence](https://www.malmlegal.com/personal-injury/injury-info-resources/understanding-the-comparative-negligence-rule-in-illinois-accide/) system, meaning your level of fault in an accident can affect your liability:
  * If you are **50% or more at fault** , you cannot recover damages.
  * If you are **less than 50% at fault** , your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault.


Even with insurance, being found at fault for an accident can have financial consequences, especially if damages exceed your policy limits. This underscores the importance of having adequate coverage.
**How the Car Accident Attorneys at John J. Malm & Associates Can Help**
If you’re involved in an accident and are concerned about liability or insurance coverage limits, consulting [an experienced car accident attorney](http://www.malmlegal.com/) can make a significant difference. An attorney can:
  * Help you understand your insurance policy and coverage limits.
  * Assess the damages and determine if additional compensation is available.

  * Protect your financial interests if damages exceed policy limits.


_“Car accidents can lead to unexpected financial stress, especially when minimum insurance limits don’t cover the full extent of damages. Understanding your coverage and having the right legal guidance can help you navigate these challenges and protect your future.”_ — John J. Malm, Naperville car accident attorney
**Closing Thoughts**
In Illinois, the minimum bodily injury liability requirement of 25/50 coverage provides a basic level of financial protection. However, in serious accidents, these limits may fall short, leaving you exposed to significant financial risk. For many drivers, increasing coverage limits is a smart investment that provides greater peace of mind and security.
