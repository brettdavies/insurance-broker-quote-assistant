New York is a no-fault state, and personal injury protection is a mandatory form of auto insurance for all drivers. New York PIP insurance covers three things: medical costs, economic losses and death benefits. The minimum amount of PIP you can [purchase in New York](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-york "Cheap New York Car Insurance") is $50,000. The amount you opt to buy will be the maximum you're entitled to recover with a PIP claim.
Most medical costs stemming from a car accident will be covered by your [personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "PIP Insurance") and include the following.
New York does not give consumers many ways to reduce no-fault insurance costs, as other states do. You may select a higher deductible, such as $200, which will lower your premiums slightly, but you cannot coordinate the coverage with your health insurance like you can in New Jersey or Michigan. If you feel the $50,000 won't be enough coverage, you can also buy optional basic economic loss insurance (OBEL), as well as additional PIP coverage that will increase your limits. The cost of PIP insurance varies based on your driving history and location, so NYC residents may pay a different rate than people in Albany. Below are a few sample [car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance "Auto Insurance Rates") for two types of drivers.
