### **_Author’s _understanding_ and _opinion_ on Unfair Trade practices_**
Examining the notion of UTP in India, the essay looks at the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Laws created in response to the problem. This research project aims to examine the problem of UTPs in India in addition to evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and divergent interpretations of “consumer welfare” in connection to unfair trade practices that are contained in both legislations. The development of UTPs in the MRTP Act, the Consumer and Competition Act (p. 2), the MRTP Act’s repeal, and other measures implemented by the Sachar and Raghavan Committees.
### _The Pharmaceuticals Industry_
### _Food Industry_
Such unfair and immoral business tactics pose a serious risk to the health of their clients. (In May, during a raid on a mango dealer’s store in Pune, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspectors found 500 weight unit mangoes worth Rs. 25,000 that had been aged with a chemical called calcium carbide.) Under the limitations of the Food Adulteration Act (p. 5). It is forbidden to artificially ripen food by using inorganic ingredients. Insurance Industry: The number of insurance customers is constantly rising, and people view insurance as a crucial component of the financial services sector. In this industry, the prevalence of unethical business practices rises with the number of clients. Insurance guarantees that, in the case of a future contingent event, a client will be entitled to receive a particular benefit or payment for a loss or harm.8The promise would not be fulfilled or would be fulfilled slowly if there was no commission. Consequently, it is evident that the insurance industry values the public’s confidence in its ability to fulfill the promises it has made.

* **__Godfrey Phillips India Ltd vs. Ajay Kumar__** “The lawsuit focused on the tobacco company’s challenged The product was oversubscribed under the name “red &White,” which included the statement “Red &White smokers are one of a kind.” The packet also included a photograph of actor Akshay Kumar and a statement emphasizing the dangers of smoking. The petitioner was confident that exhibiting a big celebrity supporting a cigarette10 with a tag on it would give people the notion that they possessed the authority to carry out such actions. Businesses regularly use tempting deals to entice customers, but then attempt to increase their commitment.
* **__Ravindranath Kamath v. Spice Communications Limited(IV2)__** “According to a Karnataka map provided by WHO, the tower would be built near the Virajpet area. Kamath submitted an application for affiliation based on their assurance and paid them Rs. 3,100. A SIM card valued Rs. 6,800 was handed away. Despite being charged Rs. 22/- per day, Kamath was unable to use his mobile phone from Virajpet due to Spice Communications’12 inability to construct the tower. For additional information, please contact Chris. Spice Communications chose not to build the tower because it was not economically feasible. Kamath received a combined payment of Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 10,000, which the Commission ruled was an unfair business practice”.
### _Authors _Opinion_ on “Service” under Consumer Protection Act, 2019_
**__Indian Medical Association vs. V.P. Shanth 15__**– According to a ruling by the Supreme Court, the Consumer Protection Act applies to the medical industry and instances of medical misconduct. This implies that patients who suffer as a result of medical malpractice are entitled to reimbursement for inadequate care from physicians or healthcare facilities in a civil court. But the only condition being the services rendered by doctor should not be free.
**__Gurshinder Singh vs. Shriram General Insurance Co. Ltd. & Others 202016__**-Reiterating its ruling from Om Prakash v. Reliance General Insurance and Anr., the Supreme Court stressed in this case that insurance claims shouldn’t be denied on the basis of procedural grounds if the cause of the delay is adequately stated and supported. The Court went on to say that if a claim has already been proven to be legitimate, it would be unfair and wrong to reject it because of a postponed complaint of theft or robbery. As a result, the Court decided that merely postponing informing the insurance company is insufficient justification for rejecting a reasonable insurance claim.
