## Do I need umbrella coverage?

Also referred to as “additional liability coverage”, umbrella insurance covers your assets in the event you are sued. Most insurance policies include some level of personal liability protection, but umbrella policies supplement existing coverage and provide extra protection for the value of your assets. We can help you find a policy that provides additional security for your home, car, boat and more.

## Automotive Coverage

An umbrella policy can protect you beyond the limits of your current car insurance plan. If there are multiple vehicles involved in an accident, this type of policy can help you be better protected from hazards on the road.

## Protection on the Water

When you drive your boat, you could hit another vehicle and potentially injure the passengers onboard. Umbrella coverage can help cover the costs of property damage and medical bills if this happens.

## Personal Protection

In addition to covering your assets, umbrella personal liability insurance provides protection and helps cover legal fees related to libel, slander, and defamation suits.

Why is umbrella coverage important?

Your checking account, savings and investments, homes and vehicles are all part of your assets. If you’re sued, these assets could be left in a financially vulnerable position. Umbrella policies help protect you from the threat of financial ruin and limit your personal liability risks.

How much coverage is right for me?

Finding the right coverage will depend on a few factors. First, it’s important to consider your risks. What areas of your life pose the most risk for injuries or accidents? The amount of coverage you need also depends on the value of the assets you wish to protect. Think about the long-term consequences of a personal liability claim. Would your future losses be significant? If you don’t have the answer to these questions, that’s okay. A member of the Turbo team can help you find an umbrella coverage policy that’s right for you.

Does umbrella coverage protect me from lawsuits?

An umbrella policy could protect you from some liability claims, like personal injuries or property damage, but this is only the case if the claims do not result in legal action. These policies can, however, protect your assets from some of the risks of potential lawsuits. The extent of these protections depends on the extent of the coverage you choose.
