## State Farm vs. Farmers: The verdict

State Farm has more competitive rates and a strong financial strength rating, which indicates a solid outlook for paying out future claims.

Farmers, on the other hand, has more extensive coverage options, including customized equipment coverage and [**accident forgiveness**](/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-accident-forgiveness/). But the extra coverage options come at a cost since Farmers’ average rates are nearly double what you can find with State Farm.

Farmers’ [**car insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) might offset some of the higher prices, but if you want [**cheaper car insurance rates**](/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/), State Farm is probably a better fit.

## State Farm Drive Safe & Save vs. Farmers Signal

State Farm and Farmers offer optional [**telematics programs**](/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) that track driving habits through a mobile app, allowing drivers to earn discounts for driving safely. State Farm’s [**Drive Safe & Save**](/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) provides a discount of up to 30%, and drivers must download the Drive Safe & Save app or enroll eligible vehicles in Connected Car. Driving patterns determine the discount amount, but you can also earn a discount for signing up. State Farm calculates rate deductions every six months.[[1]](#cite-1)

Farmers offer Signal, a similar discount program that rewards safe drivers. Drivers must download the Signal by Farmers app and allow it to track their driving. The discount amount varies depending on your driving habits, but young drivers between 15 and 24 years old can earn an extra discount.[[2]](#cite-2)

Keep in mind that both of these programs track all your driving habits — not just the positive ones. If you exceed the speed limit, brake suddenly, or take turns too sharply, your rates could increase.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

State Farm and Farmers are separate companies. Both offer auto insurance, but they have different owners and operators.

State Farm is one of the most well-known insurance companies in the country, and its competitors include other large insurance companies, like Farmers, [**GEICO**](/car-insurance/companies/geico/), [**Allstate**](/car-insurance/companies/allstate/), and [**USAA**](/car-insurance/companies/usaa/).

State Farm has a solid reputation as a long-standing and well-known insurance company in the United States. The company has a strong financial rating and a big market share. Based on ratings from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, complaints are lower than average.

The primary difference between State Farm and Farmers insurance policies is the average price. State Farm offers cheaper rates that are usually half the price of Farmers, according to Insurify data. If you want the best deal on car insurance, State Farm is probably the better pick.
