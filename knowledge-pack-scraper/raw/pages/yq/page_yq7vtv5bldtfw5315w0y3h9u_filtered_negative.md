**By[Megan Fan Munce](https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/megan-fan-munce/), SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE**
Drivers [insured](https://www.sfchronicle.com/home-insurance/) by [State Farm](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/insurance-state-farm-finances-19545699.php) can expect to see their rates rise by double digits for the second year in a row in 2025.
On Friday, the insurer — California’s largest — was approved to raise rates on [personal auto insurance](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-car-insurance-18145165.php) by an average of 17.7% starting at the end of January, filings with the California Department of Insurance show. About 4 million customers will be affected, according to the filing.
At the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara ordered auto insurers to partially refund customers’ paid premiums because fewer people were driving — and subsequently, getting into accidents — due to shutdown orders.
Since then, several major insurers, including GEICO, Nationwide and AAA, have filed for large rate increases to reflect increased costs. Last February, Allstate [raised its auto insurance rates](https://www.sfchronicle.com/climate/article/allstate-car-insurance-18665199.php) by 30%.
State Farm initially applied for a 23.4% rate increase. But Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group, objected to the filing through California’s public intervention process, according to the group’s Executive Director Carmen Balber. The process allows outside groups to provide further scrutiny on insurers’ rate filings and to be compensated for the analysis they do by the insurers, according to Deputy Insurance Commissioner Michael Soller. After holding discussions with State Farm, the Department of Insurance and Consumer Watchdog, State Farm lowered its request to 17.7%. The smaller request means consumers will pay $326 million less in premiums than they would have under the original request, Balber said.
The approved auto rate request is unrelated to State Farm’s ongoing requests to raise home insurance rates by 30% for homeowners, 52% for renters and 36% for condominium owners[avoid potential insolvency](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/state-farm-insurance-rates-19544180.php). That request is being made by State Farm General, the insurer’s [California-only subsidiary](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/state-farm-insurance-19792469.php), while auto insurance in the state is written by State Farm Mutual, its national parent company.
