Health insurance costs $486 for a 21-year-old and $1,319 for a 60-year-old. Rates go up as you get older because you usually need more medical care.

Age is one of the biggest factors for setting the [cost of your health insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-health-insurance "Average Cost of Health Insurance").
However, most people don't pay the full price for health insurance. More than 9 in 10 people who buy plans from HealthCare.gov or state marketplaces get [subsidies Using subsidies to save on health insurance ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-health-insurance-costs#subsidies "Using subsidies to save on health insurance") that make health insurance cheaper. And when you reach age 65, you likely won't need a regular health insurance plan anymore. You can get on Medicare, which is generally cheaper.
---|---
These guidelines apply to most people. However, there are different rules in [eight states and Washington, D.C. #states ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-health-insurance-costs#states "#states")
The [cost of health insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/rising-health-insurance-costs-survey "74% of Americans Stressed About High Health Insurance Costs") starts to get very expensive in your 50s, with rates more than 75% higher than the base rate. The average cost of health insurance at age 50 is **$868 per month**, and it's more than $1,000 per month by age 54.
By age 64, the cost of health insurance will be as high as it will go, at an average of **$1,458 per month** in 2025. Federal law requires that people age 64 and up pay no more than three times the base rate. And when you turn 65, you will usually stop buying  private health insurance and be [covered by Medicare](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-eligibility "Medicare Eligibility: Age 65 and Other Ways to Qualify").
[Health insurance subsidies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / Affordable Care Act Subsidy Calculator") are one of the best ways to get affordable health insurance. The subsidies will give you a discount based on your income, which will usually mean large savings.
**You can get these health insurance discounts at any age**, as long as you meet the  income limits and are  not eligible for another plan.

* Your health insurance costs will nearly always go down at age 65 after you sign up for Medicare. **The[cost of Medicare](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-cost "How Much Does Medicare Cost?") is usually between $185 and $409 per month** in 2025, depending on the coverage options you choose.
* * *
Once you're eligible for Medicare at age 65, it's nearly always better and cheaper to [choose Original Medicare over private health insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-vs-private-insurance "Medicare vs. Private Health Insurance: Which Is Better?"). That's because Original Medicare costs are fixed each year and don't increase with your age. There's usually only small annual adjustments to account for inflation.
* Your choice between [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-advantage-vs-medigap "Medicare Advantage vs. Medicare Supplement \(Medigap\): Which Is Best?") can affect both your monthly costs for insurance and how much you pay when you get medical care. In general, Medicare Supplement plans have higher monthly costs than Medicare Advantage, but they will pay for more of your medical bills.
* If you have a low income, you can make Medicare cheaper with the [Medicare Savings Program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-savings-programs "Medicare Savings Programs: Reduce Costs on Medicare"). This program can help lower the monthly cost of Medicare and, in some cases, help you pay for medical care.
* * *
* When shopping for health insurance on the marketplace, **young adults pay the same amount for a plan whether they're getting coverage as a part of a family plan or buying on their own**. That's different from [car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheap Car Insurance for Teens and Young Drivers"), where it's much cheaper to have a family plan.
* However, **health insurance rates can change if you're switching the type of coverage you have**. For example, if you're changing from having insurance through work to  buying your own plan on the marketplace.
Most health insurance plans cost the same amount for men and women. That's because of the rules set by [Obamacare](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cost-of-obamacare-health-insurance "How Much Is Obamacare?"), which is also called the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
You can't be denied a policy because of a preexisting medical condition, and plans must provide what's called [minimum essential coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/obamacare/minimum-essential-coverage "What to Know About ACA Minimum Essential Coverage"). That means plans include prescription benefits, doctor appointments and hospital care.
Teenagers can get their own health insurance through [Medicaid](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance/medicaid-eligibility-requirements "Find Out if You're Eligible for Medicaid"), a student health plan or the Obamacare marketplace (also called HealthCare.gov).
Teens shopping for their own health plans on HealthCare.gov are only eligible for [discounted rates on health insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / Affordable Care Act Subsidy Calculator") if no one claims them as a tax dependent.
That's for a Silver plan that gives you good all-around coverage. But if you only need basic coverage, consider a Bronze or [Catastrophic plan](https://www.valuepenguin.com/catastrophic-health-insurance "Benefits and Costs of Catastrophic Health Insurance"). This can help you lower your monthly costs. However, the trade-off is that you'll pay more when you need medical care or prescriptions.
Rates will go up as you get older. By [age 26](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-age-26 "Health Insurance at Age 26: Leaving Your Parent's Plan"), when you can no longer be on your parent's health insurance plan, the cost of health insurance averages $498 per month.

In [Alabama](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-alabama "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Alabama"), [Minnesota](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-minnesota "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Minnesota"), [Mississippi](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-mississippi "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Mississippi") and [Oregon](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-oregon "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Oregon"), each health insurance plan has a flat rate for those under age 21.
[New York](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-new-york "Best Cheap Health Insurance in New York") and [Vermont](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-vermont "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Vermont") don't allow health insurance companies to use your age when setting the cost of health insurance plans.
* [**Massachusetts:**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-massachusetts "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Massachusetts") Health insurance rates in MA are  cheaper than federal standards before age 21. They're more expensive than federal standards throughout middle age. Then they return to being cheaper in your later years, starting at age 49.
* [**Utah:**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-utah "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Utah") Health insurance age calculations in Utah generally mean rates go up more quickly after age 21 than the federal standards. By the time you reach age 59, you'll be paying three times as much as a 21-year-old. In other states, you don't hit that point until you turn 64.
* [**Washington, D.C.:**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-washington-dc "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Washington, D.C.") Age has less of an impact on the cost of health insurance in Washington, D.C., than it does in other states. Your rate still increases with age, but it's a smaller and more gradual change.

Yes, age affects your health insurance rates in most states. The [average cost of health insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-health-insurance "Average Cost of Health Insurance") is higher for older people since you typically need more medical care as you age. But insurance companies have to follow state and federal laws about how rates change by age. Someone who is 64 or older can't be charged more than three times what a 21-year-old pays, for example.
Most states use your age to determine your health insurance rate. Only two states do not use age when setting rates: [New York](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-new-york "Best Cheap Health Insurance in New York") and [Vermont](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-health-insurance-vermont "Best Cheap Health Insurance in Vermont"). If you live in any other state, your health insurance rate changes based on your age.
