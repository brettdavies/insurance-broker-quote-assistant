* **Keep your distance.** Keeping a safe distance between you and other vehicles is one of the best ways to avoid an accident. Always be aware of vehicles and other obstacles around you and maintain a safe distance.
* **Always expect the unexpected.** This is a significant component of defensive driving. Always be ready for the unexpected when out on the road. Never assume you know what another driver is going to do, and try to anticipate mistakes that another driver could make.
* **Always stay alert on the road.** This is probably one of the most important things defensive driving teaches you. Being aware of other vehicles, cyclists and even pedestrians can mean the difference between a safe day out on the road and an accident. Check your mirrors often and keep an eye on the road several vehicles in front of you, which will help you anticipate unexpected stops.
* **Legal requirement.** If you have been convicted of a DUI or other serious driving offense, you may be required to take a defensive driving course to reinstate your driver’s license.
* **New drivers.** A newly licensed driver (think teens) can often benefit from a defensive driving course. These courses tend to be more in-depth than a standard driving course and teach new drivers strategies for staying safe out on the road. As a bonus, some insurance companies offer discounts on your teen's car insurance if they take a defensive driving course.
* **Remove a ticket.** Some states allow you to take a defensive driving course to keep a ticket off your driving record. This can help keep points off your driving record and keep your auto insurance premium from going up.
* **Lower your insurance premium.** Among the many [car insurance discounts](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts.html) offered by insurance companies is a discount for taking a defensive driving course. This is particularly common for **young drivers and older drivers (65+)**, but some car insurance companies will offer a discount regardless of your age.
* **Being a safe driver.** Taking a defensive driver course can keep you safer on the road, which is a good thing for everyone.
In most cases, a defensive driving course is worth the cost whether it's for a discount or to prevent a ticket from increasing your rates. A ticket could result in a premiumThe payment required for an insurance policy to remain in force. Auto insurance premiums are quoted for either 6-month or annual policy periods. increase of **20 to 25%**.
While it can vary by course, most defensive driving classes cost between**$25 and $100**, with the average coming in around**$50**.
Once you have completed the course, you should receive a discount between **5% and 15%**, which lasts for three years with most insurers. So how much does taking a defensive driving course lower your insurance rates? Here's an example.
If you are paying **$100** a month for car insurance and receive a**10% discount** after taking a defensive driving course, you would be saving **$120 a year** on your auto insurance premium and over **three years**, that savings would hit **$360.** If you paid **$50 for the course**, that savings would make the defensive driving class well worth the cost.
Many insurance companies offer a defensive driving course discount, so check with your insurance company. Here are a just few examples of insurers that offer a defensive driving discount:
* **[Farmers](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers/farmers.aspx): **Up to **10%**.
* **State Farm:** Discount of **10% to 15%**.
* **[Nationwide](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers/nationwide.aspx):** Discount of around **5%**.
* **[Esurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers/esurance.aspx): **Up to **10%** for three years. In most states, drivers 55 and older can get a discount for three years after completing an approved defensive driving course.
* **[GEICO](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers/geico.aspx):** A **5 to 10%** discount.
* **[Allstate](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers/allstate.aspx):** Amount varies by state.
* [AARP Driver Safety](https://www.aarpdriversafety.org/): Offers discounts to members, and AARP is well known for safety courses.
