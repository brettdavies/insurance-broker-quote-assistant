* How Much To Budget for Home Maintenance
![Man kneeling in front of the kitchen sink reading instructions a woman is holding. A toolbox is open beside the man.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/budget-for-home-maintenance_750.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
From the roof to the furnace (and every appliance in between), the average cost of home repairs for major house components can range from several hundred to thousands of dollars. While homeowners can't escape home maintenance or updates, they can help prevent those [financial surprises](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/homeowners-insurance-maintenance-repairs "Does homeowners insurance pay for home maintenance repairs") by preparing early for inevitable fixes. Here are some important things to consider and plan for.
Don't get caught with empty pockets. Try to set aside a portion of your [monthly budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/lets-get-going-on-that-budget "Budget and Start Saving Money Today") in a home repair or [emergency fund](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/building-an-emergency-fund-calculate-how-much-to-save "Building an Emergency Fund Calculate How Much to Save"). Keeping the money separate can also make it harder to [spend](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-to-create-better-spending-habits "The psychology of spending money and why you may be spending so much") it on something else. Even a small amount can quickly add up.
Find the percentage that works best for your [budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/calculate-spendings-and-see-the-benefits-of-spending-less "Calculate spending and see the benefits of spending less") and set up automatic transfers into an emergency fund account. A rule of thumb is to set aside [1% - 4% of your home's value](https://www.investopedia.com/home-maintenance-budget-8608913#:~:text=The%20Percentage%20Rule,year%20for%20repairs%20and%20replacements. "External link: How Much Money to Budget for Home Maintenance") for a home maintenance fund. For example, for a home valued at $200,000, you would budget $2,000 to $8,000 per year to spend on annual upkeep.
* [**Roof (asphalt shingles):** 20-30 years](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/roofing/how-long-does-a-roof-last "External link: How Long Do Roofs Last")
* [**Furnace:** 15-20 years](https://todayshomeowner.com/hvac/guides/how-long-should-furnace-last/ "External Link: How Long Should a Furnace Last")
* **Perform routine maintenance.** To help prolong the life of your home's systems and [appliances](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/appliance-maintenance "Appliance maintenance to-dos for your home"), regular maintenance is important. Create a schedule for inspecting and cleaning components every [summer](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/summer-maintenance-for-your-home "Summer home maintenance checklist") and [fall](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/fall-home-maintenance-checklist "Fall home maintenance checklist"). Throughout the year, create a regular to-do list such as [replacing furnace filters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/furnace-maintenance-must-knows "Furnace maintenance tips"), cleaning air vents, and testing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.
