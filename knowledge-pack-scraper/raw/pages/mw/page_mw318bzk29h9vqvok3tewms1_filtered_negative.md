* [ How Are Car Insurance Quotes Calculated? ](https://www.thegeneral.com/going-places/blog/car-insurance/what-is-a-car-insurance-quote/#h-how-are-car-insurance-quotes-calculated)
* [ How to Find Car Insurance Quotes ](https://www.thegeneral.com/going-places/blog/car-insurance/what-is-a-car-insurance-quote/#h-how-to-find-car-insurance-quotes)
* **Coverage limits.** Before getting quoted, you input your desired amount of car insurance coverage. You need to select more than the [minimum insurance requirements](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/what-is-liability-car-insurance/) in your state, but any [additional coverage](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/do-i-need-comprehensive-collision/) after that is optional.
* **Add-ons.** Selecting optional add-ons, such as [roadside assistance](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/what-is-roadside-assistance/) or rental reimbursement, raises the price of your quote by extending your coverage.
* **Policy length.** Your car insurance quote will vary based on the length of your coverage. You can decide if you want your policy to renew in six months or one year. Based on your selection, the quote might also tell you when you need to make payments and the estimated cost of your payments.
* **Applicable Discounts.** Quotes usually include a list of the discounts you qualify for that the insurer offers. Factors like driving record and personal information are used to determine your eligibility for any discounts.
* **Deductible limit.** Your [car insurance deductible](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/making-sense-of-your-car-insurance-deductible/) is the amount you agree to pay out of pocket after making a claim before your insurer covers the rest. Deductible limits range from $500-1000, with a higher deductible resulting in a lower quote and vice versa.
* **Driving record.** Your [driving record](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/bad-driving-record-insurance/), including accidents, speeding tickets, and DUIs, all factor heavily into your final car insurance quote. Having no driving record—being a new driver—can also raise your quote as insurers see this as an indication of risk.
* **Details about your vehicle.** Insurers examine your car’s make, model, and any additional safety features to determine safety and the cost of any potential repairs. A luxury car with parts that are expensive to replace will increase the price of your quote.
* **Credit history.** Insurers check your credit-based insurance score to determine the likelihood of you filing a claim. This score reflects your regular [credit score](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/buying-a-car-with-bad-credit/) but is slightly different and includes other factors.
If you’re shopping for car insurance, it’s important to [compare multiple quotes](https://www.thegeneral.com/blog/compare-car-insurance-quotes/) to ensure you’re getting the most affordable coverage available. The easiest way to find car insurance quotes is by shopping for them online. Many carriers offer free auto insurance quotes via their website, mobile app, or phone. Quotes are meant to be low-pressure, and a quote isn’t a receipt or a commitment. If you decide to finalize your purchase, you confirm your coverage, provide additional details and a form of payment, choose your policy’s desired start date, and receive proof of coverage.
If you’re looking for affordable insurance, The General has a range of different policies for every driver, regardless of driving record or credit score.
