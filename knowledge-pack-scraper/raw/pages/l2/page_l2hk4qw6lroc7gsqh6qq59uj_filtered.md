Is uninsured motorist coverage required in California? It’s a question many drivers only think to ask after an accident. You might be driving home from work when another car runs a red light and hits you. The other driver steps out, apologizes, and then admits they don’t have insurance. Suddenly, you’re worried about medical bills, repair costs, and who will pay for everything. By the law, [uninsured motorist coverage](https://deldarlegal.com/auto-accidents/uninsured-motorist-coverage-california-what-does-it-mean/) isn’t required in California.

This situation happens far more often than most Californians realize. According to the [Insurance Information Institute (III)](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), roughly 15% of all drivers in the U.S. have no insurance at all. With millions of vehicles traveling across the state each day, that means thousands of people are one accident away from serious financial trouble.

If you’re recovering from a recent collision or [shopping around for car insurance](https://deldarlegal.com/insurance-claims/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive-in-california/), understanding how uninsured motorist protection works can help you make informed choices and avoid costly surprises after an accident. Follow along with our experienced California car accident attorneys at [Deldar Legal](https://deldarlegal.com/) to learn more. Before we get started, let’s highlight some key takeaways:

* California doesn’t require uninsured motorist (UM) or underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage.
* Insurers must offer UM/UIM coverage when you buy a policy, and you must decline it in writing to exclude it.
* UM coverage protects you if the at-fault driver has no insurance.
* UIM coverage applies when the at-fault driver’s policy isn’t enough to cover your losses.
* After any car accident, you should contact an experienced California car accident lawyer to explore your coverage options and potential claims.

## What Uninsured Motorist Coverage Does in California

Uninsured motorist coverage helps when you’re hit by a driver who doesn’t carry liability insurance, or in a hit-and-run where the at-fault driver can’t be found. Without UM coverage, your only options are to pay out of pocket or sue the uninsured driver directly. That process can be useless if the other parties have no assets. There are two main types of UM protection:

* **Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI)** – Covers medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering for you and your passengers.

* **Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD)** – Pays for repairs to your vehicle when the other driver is uninsured.

## How Underinsured Motorist Coverage Works

[Underinsured motorist coverage (UIM)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/glossary/#term-63) applies when the at-fault driver has insurance, but not enough to fully cover your damages. For example, if your medical bills total $100,000 but the other driver’s policy only covers $30,000, your UIM coverage can pay the difference, up to the policy limits. In California, insurance companies must offer both UM and UIM coverage when you purchase a policy. If you choose not to buy it, you’ll have to sign a waiver acknowledging that you declined it. Many drivers sign this form without realizing how important the coverage could be later.

## Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage Required in California?

Legally, no, California drivers aren’t required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage. The minimum liability insurance required under [California Vehicle Code §16056](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=16056.&lawCode=VEH) is:

* $30,000 for injury or death to one person
* $60,000 for injury or death to two or more persons
* $15,000 for property damage

These limits doubled starting in 2025, but they still might not cover the real costs of a serious crash. That’s why Deldar Legal recommends carrying UM/UIM coverage equal to your liability limits, especially in a state where so many people drive without insurance. Even though it’s optional, uninsured motorist coverage acts like a safety net, ensuring that your medical bills and lost income are covered when the other driver can’t pay.

## Why This Coverage Matters in California

California has more registered vehicles than any other state, and urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco experience heavy traffic every day. The odds of being hit by an uninsured driver are higher in these dense areas, where accidents happen frequently. According to the [California Office of Traffic Safety,](https://www.ots.ca.gov/) there were 3,998 fatal crashes statewide last year. Many involved drivers who were uninsured or underinsured.

If you rely on your health insurance alone, you could face:

* High deductibles or out-of-network hospital bills
* Limited physical therapy or rehabilitation coverage
* No reimbursement for lost wages or pain and suffering

UM/UIM coverage fills those gaps. It’s one of the few protections that directly benefits you, not the other driver.

## 6 Things You Should Do After an Accident with an Uninsured Driver

#### 1. Call 911 and Get Medical Help

Even if you feel okay, get checked by a medical professional. Some injuries, like concussions or whiplash, don’t appear immediately.

#### 2. Call the Police

Request an official accident report. This document will be vital for your insurance claim and any potential lawsuit.

#### 3. Exchange Information

Get the other driver’s name, license number, and plate number. If they admit they don’t have insurance, make note of it in your statement to the officer.

#### 4. Take Photos & Gather Evidence

Capture damage, road conditions, and any visible injuries. Collect witness names and contact details.

#### 5. Notify Your Insurance Company

Report the accident promptly, but avoid giving a recorded statement until you’ve spoken to a lawyer.

#### 6. Contact a California Car Accident Lawyer

An attorney can help you file a UM or UIM claim, review your policy, and negotiate with your insurer for the compensation you deserve.

## How UM and UIM Claims Work

When you file a claim under your UM or UIM coverage, you’re technically filing against your own insurance company. That might sound simple, but insurers often treat these claims as if you’re the opposition. Common tactics include:

* Delaying or denying claims without clear explanation
* Questioning your medical treatment or injury severity
* Offering quick settlements for less than your case is worth

A California car accident lawyer can manage communications, gather medical documentation, and push your claim forward. If your insurer refuses to act in good faith, your attorney can file a bad faith insurance claim to hold them accountable. In California, insurers have a legal duty to handle claims in good faith, meaning they must investigate promptly, communicate clearly, and offer fair settlements. When they fail to do so, the policyholder can take legal action to recover the money owed plus additional damages for the insurer’s misconduct.

## Evidence You’ll Need for a Strong Claim

Insurance adjusters look for reasons to minimize payouts. Keep the following records organized:

* The police report number and investigating officer’s name
* Medical records and treatment receipts
* Photos of vehicle damage and injuries
* Employer letters or pay stubs proving lost wages
* Any written communication with your insurance company

Avoid signing blanket medical authorizations, which allow insurers to dig through unrelated records. Always have an attorney review these forms first because it will help you recover damages. If you’re hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver, your policy may cover:

* [Medical expenses](https://deldarlegal.com/auto-accidents/who-pays-for-medical-bills-in-a-car-accident/) for hospital care, physical therapy, and medication
* Lost income if you miss work due to injuries
* Pain and suffering for physical and emotional distress
* Property damage (through UMPD coverage, if included)
* Future care costs if your injuries require ongoing treatment

The best part about hiring an attorney is all these damages and assessments are done for you. With Deldar Legal, our team of car accident lawyers can calculate your total losses and pursue a fair settlement based on your medical evidence and the long-term effects of your injuries.
