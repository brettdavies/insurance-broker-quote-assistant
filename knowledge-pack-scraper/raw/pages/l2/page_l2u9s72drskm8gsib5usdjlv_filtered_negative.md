Under new rules, state insurers for the first time will be allowed to use[ so-called catastrophe models](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-12-13/california-home-insurance-catastrophe-modeling-insurance-commissioner-laraa) to help determine the cost of home insurance. The models, developed by firms such as Verisk Analytics and Moody’s, are complex computer programs that aim to better determine the risk a structure faces from wildfires amid a changing climate. Here are five things to know about the models:

###  [California issues landmark rules to improve home insurance market](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-12-13/california-home-insurance-catastrophe-modeling-insurance-commissioner-laraa)
That’s a matter of debate. Catastrophe models are not specifically intended to lower rates, but insurers and the insurance department maintain that catastrophe models, by allowing insurers to more accurately calculate their risk, should allow for more gradual rate increases over time rather than requests for large one-time rate hikes, such as the[ 30% increase sought by State Farm](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-28/state-farm-insurance-rate-increase) in the summer.
