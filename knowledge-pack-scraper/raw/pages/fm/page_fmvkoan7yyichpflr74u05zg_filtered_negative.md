GEICO's rates are significantly lower than those of its top competitors, like State Farm and Progressive. This is _largely due to their direct-to-consumer sales model_.
**Consider reading:** [Why Does Insurance Go up after a Claim](https://www.cgaa.org/article/does-a-collision-insurance-claim-affect-your-rates)

A key difference between Geico's DriveEasy and Liberty Mutual's RightTrack is the duration of tracking. RightTrack only tracks your _driving behaviors for 90 days_, while DriveEasy continues to monitor your driving behaviors while you're enrolled in the program.

GEICO offers a wide range of discounts that can help lower your premium. These _discounts include a special discount_ for serving in the military, good student discount for maintaining above average grade points, and discounts for features like inbuilt airbags, anti-lock brakes, and anti-theft systems.
If you're a _good driver with a clean record_, you may be eligible for GEICO's good driver discount. You can also save money by completing the driver's education course or buying a policy for more than one vehicle.
