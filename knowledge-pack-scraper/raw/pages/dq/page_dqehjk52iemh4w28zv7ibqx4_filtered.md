Perhaps best known for its roadside assistance programs, AAA also offers [auto insurance](/auto-insurance/) to its members. In most cases, coverage is not provided by AAA themselves, but through partner companies. AAA simply acts as an intermediary, meaning that coverage options and experiences can be vastly different based on location.

### AAA vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers

If you've got a [speeding ticket](/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/) or [DUI/DWI](/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/) in your driving record, **Travelers** could be a better choice than AAA. Each auto insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVELERS VS. AAA

### AAA vs. Travelers: rates by age

Auto insurance companies rely on a driver's age to indicate risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is commonly more expensive for [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) — due to their inexperience — and most affordable for middle-aged and older drivers. Because every car insurance company rates ages differently, it's wise to compare rates and find great coverage.

For drivers in every age group — including teen drivers — Travelers was significantly more affordable than AAA.

##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. AAA
