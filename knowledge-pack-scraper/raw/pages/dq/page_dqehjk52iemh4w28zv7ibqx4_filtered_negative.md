Perhaps best known for its roadside assistance programs, AAA also offers [auto insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) to its members. In most cases, coverage is not provided by AAA themselves, but through partner companies. AAA simply acts as an intermediary, meaning that coverage options and experiences can be vastly different based on location.

If you've got a [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/) or [DUI/DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/) in your driving record, **Travelers** could be a better choice than AAA. Each auto insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.

Perhaps no other company is more closely associated with [roadside assistance than AAA](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-vs-aaa/). For that reason, it's no surprise that the company has an expansive selection of options available to both members and policyholders. Below is a list of options available:
---|---|---
Towing |  Yes (up to 15 miles)  | Yes (up to 100 miles)
Jump starts |  Yes | Yes
Fuel Delivery |  Yes | Yes
Flat tire change |  Yes | Yes

*Covers up to $200 per day, up to a maximum of $600
** Provides $500 of coverage for personal property damaged or stolen
* * *
While both companies have a sizable presence in the auto insurance industry, Travelers is more popular for [homeowners coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) than AAA. See our comparison to find out which company might be the best fit for your home insurance needs.
