I question your sources ("top insurers?"). Are you actually going though [market share reports](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=car+insurance+market+share+reports&cId=2661d580-716c-4501-8073-01d8137c0c68&iId=8025d69d-60ea-4cfb-b2e3-4f14a6b5ba8b) to properly weigh averages? And are these top insurers publishing average premium by state?
As for 'top insurers' - if you're just going to GEICO, State Farm, Progressive and Erie; you're way off. Although my home state (CA; arguably the largest for premium) doesn't publish market share by line of business, it's clear that AAA, CSAA, Farmers, Allstate, Mercury are large players for **personal** private auto insurance; all of whom write more auto premium in the state than Progressive. Erie doesn't even write in the state (in fact, they only write in 12 states; so why are you using them at all?)
Source: 2024 California Dept of Insurance Market Share Report [[link](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/120-company/04-mrktshare/2024/upload/Top25grps2024.pdf)]
Finally - I guess in the macro, 'average premium' tells a story but rates and formulae are so minute; **especially** when you don't break out premium by liability and physical damage coverage (the former which would be impacted by accidents/legal; the latter by weather/theft)
Edit: Your average is based on a 'mix of drivers and coverage levels?' I came back to ask if the 'average' was per vehicle, per policy or per driver; and those three numbers would be different.

we just moved from Ohio to Georgia. Georgia is actually about 2x Ohio rates. We have family in Colorado and Illinois. The rates are significantly different in their rates, with no accidents or other incidents that would increase/decrease their rates. Consequently, I would question the accuracy of this data.

My experience of moving between Minnesota and Iowa doesn't support your chart. Car Insurance in Minnesota is roughly 70% more than in Iowa.

What factors do you think drive these costs up the most? Accidents, weather, theft, legal system… or something else?
Data Source: The data in this visualization was collected from major insurance providers including Geico, State Farm, Progressive, and [Erie Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Erie+Insurance+car+insurance&cId=b7d43e4a-fde1-4637-ab62-47137475ff8d&iId=968b38d6-9c83-4345-a692-dc54a4490753). Visualization Tool: Created using Canva.
What it shows: This map presents the average annual cost of car insurance in each U.S. state for the year 2025. The values represent estimates based on a mix of driver profiles and coverage levels.

I know for Florida, it's because it's the most litigated state. Everything becomes a lawsuit and people use every cent of their PIP because the lawyer directs them too. Thats why there's an asinine amount of personal injury lawyer ads everywhere in Florida. And insurance doesn't want to deal with it.

The cost of car insurance is truly insane in the US. I've also read that most policies cover only like $100k damages to other people or property - at that level, you may as well just not have it at all, break someone's ankle in an accident in the US and it could easily cost $100k after medical bills and damages.
I'm in Europe and pay around 1000 euros a year for my insurance and I have a fast, new BMW. If I had a crappy car it would be more like 600 euros. That's full coverage (for my car as well), and by law it must cover 7.5 million euros in personal damage and over 1 million euros in property damage.
Either you guys crash a lot over there or your insurance companies are seriously ripping you off.
