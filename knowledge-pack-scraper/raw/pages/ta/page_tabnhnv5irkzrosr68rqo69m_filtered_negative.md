If the initiative qualifies for next year’s ballot and is approved by voters, it could also throw a wrench into Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s [plan](https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/03/california-home-insurance-market/) to try to fix the state’s insurance market as insurers have refused to renew policies or write new ones as wildfire risk has grown.
Lara crafted his plan around the confines of current insurance law while giving the insurance industry certain concessions, such as allowing them to use catastrophe modeling and to factor in their reinsurance costs when setting their rates. In exchange, the insurance department asks that insurers retain or increase their policies [in areas considered at high risk for wildfires](https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/06/california-pushes-insurers-to-cover-more-homes-in-these-areas-is-your-zip-included/). The plan’s implementation began this year.
Consumer Watchdog, the Los Angeles-based advocacy group whose founder wrote Prop. 103 mostly to address rising auto insurance rates, said in a statement that the proposal does not seem to be a “serious” or well-funded campaign. The group also cited a [report](https://consumerfed.org/press_release/30-years-and-154-billion-of-savings-californias-proposition-103-insurance-reforms-still-saving-drivers-money/) that found Prop. 103 has saved California drivers more than $150 billion in auto insurance rates over the years, as well as a [poll](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/3/25/voters-want-their-government-to-address-the-property-insurance-crisis) that found consumers blame insurance companies for rising premiums.
