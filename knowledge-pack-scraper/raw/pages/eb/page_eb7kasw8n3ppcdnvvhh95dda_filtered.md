## Do you need RV insurance in Florida?

Before you’re able to get behind the wheel of your motorhome, Florida requires that all motorists carry coverage for personal injury protection and property damage liability. Personal injury protection (PIP) may pay for injuries you sustain in an accident, up to the limits of your policy and regardless of fault. Property damage liability coverage may pay for damages you cause while driving your motorhome, up to your coverage limit.

| Coverage | What it covers | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Required: [Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-injury-protection/) | What it coversYour medical bills, lost wages, death benefits, and other services if you’re injured in a motor vehicle accident. | Amount$10,000 |
| Required: [Property damage liability coverage (PD)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/) | What it coversDamage you cause to another vehicle or property while driving your motorhome. | Amount$10,000 |
| Optional: [Bodily injury liability coverage (BI)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/) | What it coversInjuries you cause to someone else while driving your motorhome. | Amount$10,000 per person, $20,000 per accident |
| Optional: Uninsured/underinsured bodily injury coverage (UM/UIM BI) | What it coversInjuries to you or your passengers caused by a motorist with no insurance or not enough coverage. | Amount$10,000 per person, $20,000 per accident |

Florida doesn’t mandate coverage for bodily injury and liability or uninsured/underinsured bodily injury, but they are important coverages. Bodily injury liability coverage may pay for injuries you cause to others while driving your motorhome and uninsured/underinsured bodily injury coverage can cover you if a driver with no insurance or not enough coverage damages your RV or causes injuries. Note that bodily injury liability coverage is required if you purchase uninsured/underinsured bodily injury coverage.

## Is travel trailer insurance required in Florida?

Since your travel trailer is towed, and not driven like a motorhome, there are no state requirements for insuring a travel trailer in Florida. A policy with PIP and property damage liability coverage is needed for the vehicle used to pull your travel trailer.

### Comprehensive and collision coverage

If you're financing your motorhome or travel trailer, your lender typically requires [RV comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-collision-comprehensive-coverage/). These coverages aren't required by Florida law, but can be valuable for protecting your RV against physical damage. Comprehensive covers events out of your control, including theft, vandalism, fire, hitting an animal, and weather-related issues. Collision covers your RV if you collide with another vehicle, tree, fence, guardrail, or any object.

## How much is RV insurance in Florida?

The average premium for a 12-month Florida RV insurance policy at Progressive for 2024 was $1,386.04 for a motorhome and $841.16 for a travel trailer. While Florida may be more costly for RV insurance compared to other states, Progressive offers RV insurance for as little as $125/year.\*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. Your policy's price depends on many factors, such as:

* **Claims history:** Your history of filing insurance claims may affect your rate.
* **Driving record:** Violations can increase the price of your policy.
