## The cheapest car insurance companies in West Palm Beach

To find cheap car insurance companies in West Palm Beach, we looked at average rate data for companies who write the majority of policies in Florida. The Sunshine State has a reputation for high average rates [compared to other states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/), but we were able to find a few companies offering [affordable coverage for Florida drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-florida/).

## How much is car insurance in West Palm Beach, FL?

We discovered that drivers in West Palm Beach pay an average rate of $4,862 for full coverage, which includes optional collision and comprehensive insurance, while state-mandated minimum coverage is available for an average cost of $1,326. That’s 25 percent more than the [Florida state average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-florida/) and 80 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). Why is it so pricey? There could be several reasons, including the fact that the city's urban area often features heavy traffic — leading to an increased number of accidents and subsequent claims.

### West Palm Beach rates for teens

The average cost of full coverage car insurance for a 16-year-old on their parents’ insurance in West Palm Beach is $9,292 per year; the average cost for an 18-year-old driver on a standalone policy is $11,015 per year.

Teen drivers are [statistically more likely](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) to engage in risky driving practices, such as texting while driving, and have less experience behind the wheel. Because of this, insurers generally charge a higher rate for their coverage. Some insurers, however, offer [teen-focused discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/) which can mitigate the high rates somewhat. Keeping a teen on the parents’ policy can also reduce costs. On average, a full coverage insurance policy in West Palm Beach with an 18-year-old and two married parents costs 8,092, which is 27 percent less than a standalone policy for the same 18-year-old. The following companies offer the most affordable coverage for teen drivers in West Palm Beach.

### West Palm Beach rates for young drivers

As young drivers transition from their teens into their 20s, they should start seeing their rates [start to decline](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/), as long as they have maintained a clean driving record and all other factors remain equal. Young drivers moving out of their teens may see an increase, however, if they switch from their parents' policy to a policy of their own. On average, a 20-year-old driver on a standalone full coverage policy pays $9,009 per year in West Palm Beach, while a 25-year-old driver pays an average of $5,728 per year for the same coverage.

Most insurers offer [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/student-discounts/) designed for young drivers, and these can help keep high rates in check. The rates below are for young drivers on their own policy, not their parents'.

### West Palm Beach rates for adults

On average, a 30-year-old driver in Tampa pays $5,062 per year for full coverage auto insurance, while a 50-year-old driver pays $1,404 per year, on average. Average rates for adults continue to drop as they enter their middle years, as the tables below show, although earning marks on their license may result in higher rates.

### West Palm Beach rates for senior drivers

Accident rates begin to rise again for drivers in their 70s and beyond, so there may be a slight uptick in premium rates for older drivers. On average, we found that Tampa drivers pay around $1,207 per year for full coverage at age 60 and $1,340 per year at age 70. Rate increases can often be kept to a minimum, however, by maintaining a clean driving record and driving cars that are [cheaper to insure](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-cars-to-insure/) rather than luxury or sports vehicles. Other factors may also play a role in your rate, which may make it a good idea to compare rates from several insurers to see if you can find more affordable coverage.

## The cheapest car insurance in West Palm Beach by driving record

As we've noted above, one of the most significant factors in determining your premium rate is your driving history. If you have earned speeding tickets, been involved in an accident or been convicted of a DUI, it's likely that your rates will be higher than a comparable driver with a clean record. Insurers are likely to see you as a higher risk to insure, so they compensate by increasing the premium.

### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in West Palm Beach

Typically, speeding ticket conviction in West Palm Beach will increase your auto insurance when it renews. On average, West Palm Beach drivers with a single speeding ticket pay $5,282 per year for full coverage insurance, compared to $4,862 prior to their conviction. This means that drivers with a [single speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) conviction typically pay 9 percent more for full coverage.

### Car insurance after an accident in West Palm Beach

On average, West Palm Beach drivers with a [single at-fault accident](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-after-an-accident/) on their driving record pay 37 percent more for full coverage than drivers with clean records. A driver who’s found at fault for an accident represents a greater risk to insurance companies, which charge an average of $6,661 per year for West Palm Beach drivers with a single at-fault conviction. You may be able to avoid an increase, however, if you have an [accident forgiveness endorsement](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/) on your policy, which waives the rate surcharge after a single accident.

Minimum coverage requiremets in West Palm Beach

Drivers in West Palm Beach and throughout Florida are required by [Florida state law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida-car-insurance-laws/) to have a minimum amount of liability insurance. Florida's minimums are low compared to many other states, however, and might not be enough to protect you fully if you were in a serious accident. Many insurance experts would recommend that you purchase higher levels and consider optional types of coverage to provide more robust protection.

To drive legally in Florida, you will need to have at least these minimums:

* $10,000 in [personal injury protection](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) (PIP) coverage
* $10,000 in [property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) coverage

Bodily injury liability is not required in Florida but drivers do have to prove their ability to pay for damages under the “financial responsibility law.” If a driver does purchase car insurance to satisfy the law, the minimum requirements are:

* $10,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $20,000 bodily injury liability per accident

## Frequently asked questions

* ### How can I lower my car insurance rates in West Palm Beach?

  Caret Down Icon 

  There are [a number of strategies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) you can adopt to help you earn lower car insurance rates. First, when searching for the best rate, ask for quotes from more than one insurer, so you can compare quotes. Make sure you're asking for the same types and levels of insurance from each one, so you can do a level comparison. Second, make sure you're receiving all the discounts for which you qualify. Third, consider if you truly need all the coverage you have. You don't want to be caught short after an accident, of course. But if you have an older vehicle, for example, you may not need collision and comprehensive coverage, since the vehicle might not be worth fixing. If you don't drive very much, consider [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/pay-per-mile-insurance/), which is becoming more popular. Finally, work to improve your credit rating, which can earn you a preferable rate.

* ### Is car insurance expensive in West Palm Beach?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Yes, the average cost of car insurance in West Palm Beach tends to be high. The average rate in the city is $4,862 a year for full coverage and $1,326 for minimum. Contrast that with the state averages, which are 3,884 for full coverage and $1,056 for minimum coverage. For an even more stark comparison, consider the [national averages](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), which are $2,671 for full and $806 for minimum. There may be several reasons why rates in the city are so high. One possible factor could be the high rate of accidents in the city's crowded urban streets, which lead to a higher-than-usual number of insurance claims.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
