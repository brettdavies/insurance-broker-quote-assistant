Teen drivers are [statistically more likely](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) to engage in risky driving practices, such as texting while driving, and have less experience behind the wheel. Because of this, insurers generally charge a higher rate for their coverage. Some insurers, however, offer[ teen-focused discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/) which can mitigate the high rates somewhat. Keeping a teen on the parents’ policy can also reduce costs. On average, a full coverage insurance policy in West Palm Beach with an 18-year-old and two married parents costs 8,092, which is 27 percent less than a standalone policy for the same 18-year-old. The following companies offer the most affordable coverage for teen drivers in West Palm Beach.

As young drivers transition from their teens into their 20s, they should start seeing their rates [start to decline](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/), as long as they have maintained a clean driving record and all other factors remain equal. Young drivers moving out of their teens may see an increase, however, if they switch from their parents' policy to a policy of their own. On average, a 20-year-old driver on a standalone full coverage policy pays $9,009 per year in West Palm Beach, while a 25-year-old driver pays an average of $5,728 per year for the same coverage.

Accident rates begin to rise again for drivers in their 70s and beyond, so there may be a slight uptick in premium rates for older drivers. On average, we found that Tampa drivers pay around $1,207 per year for full coverage at age 60 and $1,340 per year at age 70. Rate increases can often be kept to a minimum, however, by maintaining a clean driving record and driving cars that are [cheaper to insure](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-cars-to-insure/) rather than luxury or sports vehicles. Other factors may also play a role in your rate, which may make it a good idea to compare rates from several insurers to see if you can find more affordable coverage.

Florida law takes DUIs seriously, and you are likely to face stiff fines or other penalties if you are convicted of one. Tampa drivers pay average annual rates of $7,413 for full coverage and $2,330 for state minimum coverage after a single DUI conviction. Drivers with a single DUI pay 52 percent more for full coverage and 52 percent less for minimum coverage, on average, than drivers with clean records. There are, however, ways to keep increases to a minimum. Consider taking a [defensive driving course](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/defensive-driving-courses/), for example, which may earn you a discount while at the same time helping you to improve your skills behind the wheel.

* ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in West Palm Beach?
* ###  Is car insurance expensive in West Palm Beach?
Yes, the average cost of car insurance in West Palm Beach tends to be high. The average rate in the city is $4,862 a year for full coverage and $1,326 for minimum. Contrast that with the state averages, which are 3,884 for full coverage and $1,056 for minimum coverage. For an even more stark comparison, consider the [national averages](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), which are $2,671 for full and $806 for minimum. There may be several reasons why rates in the city are so high. One possible factor could be the high rate of accidents in the city's crowded urban streets, which lead to a higher-than-usual number of insurance claims. Car theft rates can also impact your premium costs, as can Florida's volatile weather patterns, which can damage cars and lead to claims on a policy's [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/).
