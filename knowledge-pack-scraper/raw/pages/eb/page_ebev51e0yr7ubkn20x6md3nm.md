Mom, 55 and I (25) are on policy in Florida. Has anyone done the defensive driving course for the discount and got any worth it discounts?

Florida you have to be 55+ for the discount. Only NY, NJ, GA, and OK you can take it any time. Wish other states did the discount for all ages, kinda dumb its just for old people

I don’t know Fl but it’s usually worth it. The discount is for three years and then some. What I mean is 3 years from the completion date of the class but if it falls in the middle of a policy term, the discount will stay on the policy for the rest of the policy period. 
But before both of you take the course, depending on the state and your policy there are usually rules that the discount goes by who is rated on a particular car. So check it out before one of you takes it unnecessarily. Also take the class for that state, either in person or online. Go though the GEICO website and pick the online class from there. Plus then it connects it to your policy and they have deals where when you complete the course and complete the survey at the end (or the class isn’t considered completed) but it also guarantees you take the appropriate class for your state. In so many cases it it isn’t DMV approved, it isn’t acceptable. You have to take the class for your state or it isn’t acceptable. You can’t just take a class for any state that may be cheaper. 
But the discount is worth it. Even if the class is 30 bucks now, even if the discount is the same amount, it will be this times 6 or 7 so it absolutely pays.

Isn’t it a percentage? So if you have a cheaper policy or vehicle, it is less money. For some it is a bigger discount. Depends on how many cars. 
It also may depends by state. My state it’s decent .
