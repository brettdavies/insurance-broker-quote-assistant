3. **Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost:** These are two methods for valuing damaged property. Actual Cash Value is the cost to replace an insured item of property at the time of loss, minus depreciation. Replacement Cost is the current value of materials to be replaced. When computing claim payments after a remodeling disaster, Zurich uses actual cash value for the[ existing structure valuation ](https://go.usassure.com/BR_WC_2021_Video-NovAfterHours_LP-Video.html#remodeling_claims "Video: How are Claims Payments Calculated for Remodeling Projects") and replacement cost for the new materials used during the renovation.
![frame new home construction](https://usassure.com/media/k03nv2ii/19141674_l_680x680.png?rmode=max&width=151&height=151)[Frame construction](https://usassure.com/resources/articles/builders-risk-insurance-3-considerations-when-insuring-frame-construction#builders_risk_frame "Article: 3 Considerations When Insuring Frame Construction")* refers to structures built using combustible materials, like wood. Sometimes, builders mix frame materials with non-combustible or slow-burning materials. These can include masonry / brick veneer or metal cladding for exterior walls or other parts of the building. Even so, Zurich classifies the construction type as frame.
![home construction with wood frame roof and concrete base](https://usassure.com/media/5ield3kf/joisted-masonry.jpg?rmode=max&width=135&height=135) Joined masonry refers to buildings that have exterior walls of masonry material (adobe, brick, concrete, gypsum block, wood iron cladding, hollow concrete block, stone, tile, etc.) combined with wood frames, roofs and floors. Some examples of accounts secured with these materials are single-family homes, offices, or warehouses.
![](https://usassure.com/media/jydbdbhu/non-combustible.jpg?rmode=max&width=136&height=136) Non-combustible construction materials are either slow-burning or do not ignite, burn, or fuel a fire. The most common non-combustible material is steel. Builders can combine it with masonry fill (such as perlite or vermiculite), brick veneer, and metal sheathing. It can also include an exterior insulation finishing system.
[![shopping center development](https://usassure.com/media/d1hdcxwp/masonry-non-combustible.jpg?rmode=max&width=138&height=138)](https://usassure.com/resources/articles/builders-risk-insurance-3-considerations-when-insuring-frame-construction#builders_risk_frame "Article: 3 Considerations When Insuring Frame Construction") Similar to joisted masonry, masonry non-combustible construction requires builders to use masonry materials for exterior walls. Materials may include [concrete block](https://usassure.com/resources/articles/insuring-tilt-up-construction-vs-concrete-block/#concrete_block "Insuring Tilt-Up Construction vs. Concrete Block"),reinforced masonry or tilt-up concrete combined with heavy steel framing. These walls must be at least four inches thick.
![high rise construction](https://usassure.com/media/uslbq1io/modified-semi-fire-resistive.jpg?rmode=max&width=143&height=143) Modified or semi-fire-resistive buildings have exterior walls, floors, and roofs composed of masonry or stonework. These materials must be at least four inches thick. Some examples of this construction include protected steel, concrete, or heavy masonry as examples.
![](https://usassure.com/media/3vbhwrps/fire-resistive.jpg?rmode=max&width=136&height=136) Fire-resistive structures require walls that can endure significant heat and strain, such as reinforced concrete. To insulate the interior from fire, the walls must be at least four inches thick.
Regardless of construction type, owners and builders need course of construction coverage to protect themselves from financial loss. The “A” rated Builders Risk Plan insured by Zurich [can cover a variety of residential and commercial projects](https://usassure.com/resources/articles/what-does-builders-risk-insurance-cover#builders_risk_overview "Article: What Does Builders Risk Insurance Cover?") up to $75 million.
