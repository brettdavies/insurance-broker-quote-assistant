## Fellowships

The Consumer Reports Fellowship funds researchers, technologists, and entrepreneurs to design and scale solutions to the problems facing consumers today. The non-residential fellowship includes a generous stipend and numerous resources to help fellows bring their research and ideas to reality. We give preference to Fellows whose work makes contributions to the field of public interest tech and/or results in libraries, reference implementations, and open source code.

What

This is a non-resident fellowship that helps researchers, technologists, and entrepreneurs design and scale solutions to the problems facing consumers today. We support the development of solutions that can concretely benefit consumers- examining everything from the behavior of connected appliances to the data practices of major internet platforms to the harms and benefits of generative AI.
