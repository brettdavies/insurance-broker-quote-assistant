[Home](https://sagesure.com/) › [For Homeowners](https://sagesure.com/homeowners-insurance/) › [Product Offerings](https://sagesure.com/homeowners-insurance/products/) › New York
New York is historic, untamed and iconic. The Empire State has something for everyone, from white-sand beaches, world-class wineries, majestic mountains and “the good side” of Niagara Falls to the most vibrant arts, culture, museums and shopping around.
New York is an inspiring place to build a life. We love New York and its unique people, too. We’re here to help New Yorkers protect the things that matter most. And we’re not going anywhere, so you can rest assured that we’ll always have your back.
SageSure offers the following products for residents in Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan and Westchester counties:
### Homeowners Policy (HO3)
Our HO3 homeowners policy protects your home, other structures and belongings from damages caused by an unforeseen loss. Your home and other structures are covered on an open peril* basis, subject to the exclusions listed in the policy. Your personal belongings are covered for the named perils** listed. The policy can help pay for bodily injury or property damage you are legally responsible for, such as when a guest is injured on your property, or you or a family member accidentally injures someone or damages their property.
Most homeowners insurance policies do not cover damage from floods or earthquakes. However, there may be additional coverage options available to purchase.
Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.
Floods may:
* Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges and overflows of dams and other water systems.
* Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.
* Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings and create landslides.
### **Homeowners Policy (HO5)**
A critical distinction between an HO3 and HO5 policy is that while both policies provide extensive open peril* coverage for your home’s physical structure, an HO5 policy offers open peril* coverage for both your home and your belongings.
### Dwelling Fire (DP3)
A [DP3 dwelling fire](https://sagesure.com/insurance-insights/what-is-a-dp3-policy/) policy is the most comprehensive policy available for rental and other non-owner-occupied homes. The DP3 provides dwelling and other structure coverage, and covers the landlord’s furnishings, loss of rent, and on-premises liability.
###### *Open perils – coverage is provided for all loss types unless specifically excluded. Standard exclusions include but not limited to earthquake, flood, nuclear disaster, acts of war and intentional loss.
**Named perils – coverage is provided for specific perils only. Typically include fire, lightning, windstorm or hail, explosion, riot, aircraft damage, vehicle damage, vandalism, theft, among others. Some perils may still be excluded.
###### _Actual coverage will be determined at the time and location of the loss, based on the coverage in place, and laws in effect in the jurisdiction where the loss occurred._
