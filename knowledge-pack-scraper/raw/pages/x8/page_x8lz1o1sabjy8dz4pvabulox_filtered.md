# Bundle Auto + Home Insurance through Allstate: getting incredible home insurance rates and terrible car insurance rates

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out the best way to proceed with insurance as my policies are set to renew in about three weeks. I have Allstate for both auto and home insurance, and I get a $300 discount on both the auto and home premiums as a result. My home insurance for this coming year (12 month rate) is set to be $2270 - when I looked online and talked to a couple of agencies, the lowest I got was ~$2800 with some of those quotes going well into 3k and even 4k. I'm not sure why my home insurance rate with Allstate is so good comparatively to other agencies, though the discount section does mention responsible payments (haven't missed any mortgage payments) contributing to a $600 bonus, and a loyalty bonus of $250.

On the other hand, my auto insurance rates are way higher than anything I'm being quoted on. My rate for the next 6 months of auto insurance is $1262 for a 2021 Subaru Forester. As far as classification goes, I'm 26, male, and married. I've had a single accident just under 5 years ago (late 2020 - minor bump to the car in front of me, and I was the at fault driver). Upon doing quotes with other agencies using the exact same deductibles/coverage amounts, I got anywhere from $770 (from a local independent agent) to just under $1000.

I'm trying to determine if it's worth swapping to another agency for cheaper car insurance, but I'd lose my bundle discount and the convenience of handling all of my insurance from one place, with one agent. Would y'all say it would be better to stick with Allstate, or should I try and pursue a better auto policy?
