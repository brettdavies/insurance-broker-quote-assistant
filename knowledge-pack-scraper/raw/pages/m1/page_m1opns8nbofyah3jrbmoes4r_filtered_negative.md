##  What Is Travel Insurance?
Travel insurance is a type of insurance covering financial losses associated with traveling, and it can be useful protection for domestic or international travel. Whether you missed your flight to Florida, lost your bags in Berlin, or broke your ankle in Ankara, the [best travel insurance companies](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-travel-insurance-11703963) can help remedy all kinds of travel mishap costs.
##  How Travel Insurance Protects Your Trip
##  How Travel Insurance Functions and Where to Buy It
Travel insurance may be sold online by travel agents, travel suppliers (airlines, cruise lines), private insurance companies, or insurance brokers when booking your flight, accommodations, or car. Travel insurance companies include AIG Travel, Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection, Generali Global Assistance, GeoBlue, Nationwide, and more.
###  Primary and Secondary Coverage
###  Essential Coverage Requirements for Travel Insurance
###  Understanding Policy Limits in Travel Insurance
###  Common Exclusions in Travel Insurance Policies
##  Comprehensive Travel Insurance: What It Includes
###  Exploring Trip Cancellation and Interruption Coverage
With most of the above, acceptable cancellation and interruption causes and reimbursement amounts vary by provider. Acceptable reasons for a claim might include the following:5
When traveling, register your travel plans with the State Department through its free [travel registration website](https://travelregistration.state.gov/), the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The nearest embassy or consulate can contact you if there is a family, state, or national emergency.
###  Protecting Against Damage and Baggage Losses While Traveling
For example, the insurance may not pay for lost and damaged luggage due to airline fault. Most carriers, such as airlines, reimburse travelers if baggage is lost or destroyed due to the airline's error. However, there may be limitations on reimbursement amounts, so baggage and personal effects coverage provide an additional layer of protection.1
###  Understanding Rental Insurance: Cars and Vacation Rentals
###  Navigating Travel Health Insurance Options
Medical coverage can help with unexpected international medical and dental expenses, and help with locating doctors and healthcare facilities abroad. As with other policies, coverage will vary by price and provider.
* **Medical evacuation:** May cover airlift travel to a medical facility and medical evacuation to receive care.
###  Insights Into Accidental Death and Dismemberment Coverage
Accidental death coverage may not be necessary if you already have a [life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp) policy. However, benefits paid by your travel insurance coverage may be in addition to those paid by your life insurance policy, leaving more money to your beneficiaries.
###  Additional Travel Insurance Coverage Options
##  Steps to Secure Travel Insurance for Your Trip
Travel insurance varies in cost, exclusions, and coverage. Coverage is available for single, multiple, and yearly trips. To get travel insurance, you fill out an insurance company's application about your trip, including the following:
The insurance company reviews the information using underwriting guidelines to guide issuing a policy and the rate. If it accepts your application, the company will issue a policy covering your trip. If the company rejects your application, you can apply with another insurer.
Your [homeowners](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp) or renters insurance may provide some protection for personal belongings, and airlines and cruise lines are responsible for loss and damage to your baggage during transport. Also, credit cards may provide automatic protection for things like delays and luggage or rental car accidents if used for deposits or other trip-related expenses.
