The most expensive states for [full coverage car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest and Best Full Coverage Car Insurance") are Nevada ($286 per month), Florida ($272) and Michigan ($263). These three states are all 50% more expensive than the national average rate of $175 per month.
The three states with the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") barely crack $100 per month for the same policy. Maine drivers pay an average of just $103 per month, while neighboring New Hampshire and Vermont are tied at $107 per month — all for the same level of coverage.
---|---|---
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that people paid an average of 19% more for [car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "/auto-insurance") in 2024 than in 2023, though that also includes increased coverage amounts and higher vehicle replacement costs.

The Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V are the [cheapest new cars to insure](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-and-cheapest-cars-insure "The Cheapest Cars to Insure") in 2025.

While electric cars continue to grow in popularity, their insurance prices compared to gas cars have stayed steady. The top 10 EVs cost an average of $344 per month to insure — 23% more than the top gas-powered cars, or [the same difference as last year](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-of-auto-insurance-2024#cars "State of Auto Insurance in 2024").
[Teslas are typically very expensive to insure](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tesla-car-insurance "The cost to insure a Tesla EV").

The most important thing any driver can do to save money on their car insurance is to compare prices from multiple companies — at least five insurers, or more if you have a recent incident. That could [save drivers more than $100 each month](https://www.valuepenguin.com/shopping-auto-insurance-study "How Much Does Shopping Around Save You on Insurance?").
Insurers in almost  every state use your credit score to set car insurance rates. A driver with good credit can bring their rates down from $341 to $175 per month compared to one with bad credit.
Another effective discount is to [bundle your home and auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "/best-home-car-insurance-bundle"). That can save you between 11 and 24% among top insurers.
