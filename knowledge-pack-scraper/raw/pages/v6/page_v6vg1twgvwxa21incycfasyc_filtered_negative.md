* **Dwelling coverage** – Pays for repairs to your home and attached structures when damaged by covered perils, including floors, walls, roof, and cabinetry
* **Other structures** – Protects detached buildings like sheds, garages, pool houses, or greenhouses
* **Personal property** – Covers furniture, appliances, clothing and other movable belongings if damaged or stolen
* **Personal liability** – Provides protection if someone is injured on your property
* **Medical payments** – Helps pay medical bills of guests injured on your property
* **Additional living expenses** – Assists with costs if you cannot live in your home after a covered loss
State Farm specifically protects against fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, theft, and certain types of abrupt water damage. The policy has inflation coverage as a standard feature that automatically adjusts your coverage yearly to match rising construction costs.
Regular wear and tear falls outside coverage guidelines. Your roof’s gradual deterioration and resulting leaks would likely not qualify for coverage. State Farm assesses whether sudden accidents or gradual degradation caused the damage before determining coverage.
In stark comparison to this, roof leaks from poor maintenance or general wear and tear aren’t covered. A State Farm claims handler can explain differences between normal aging and damage from specific incidents like hailstorms.
Your roof’s age and condition significantly affect claim approval. An older roof in poor condition creates greater insurance risk since storms damage it more easily. Professional roofers should regularly maintain your roof to keep it in coverable condition.
* **Windstorms** – State Farm covers wind-related roof damage, including shingles that blow off or bend and crack
* **Hailstorms** – You’re covered for hail damage to your roof, which matters a lot in states like Texas where hailstorms happen often
* **Falling objects** – This includes damage from tree limbs or other objects that crash onto your roof
* **Fire and lightning** – These events usually qualify for a complete roof replacement if the damage is bad enough
State Farm’s claim handlers help you understand the difference between normal wear and tear and damage from specific events like hailstorms. The company’s guidelines say they cover damage “when water-shedding ability or the life expectancy of the material is reduced”.
State Farm might not give you full replacement coverage if your roof is 15 years old or older. They might only offer an **actual cash value (ACV)** policy that factors in depreciation. This is a big deal as it means that your payout could be much less than what you need for a new roof.
Some insurers might not cover 20-year-old roofs at all or they’ll have strict rules about coverage. State Farm might also need to inspect your roof before they agree to cover any replacement.
How well you’ve maintained your roof matters too. Insurance companies don’t like risky roofs that haven’t been taken care of. Regular checkups, fixing small problems, and keeping gutters clean can help you get your claim approved, even with an older roof.
Some policies cap their maximum coverage amounts. You’ll need to pay any costs above this limit yourself.
State Farm often charges higher deductibles for older roofs in areas that get lots of hurricanes or bad storms. Your policy might also have a separate deductible for hurricane damage.
You’ll usually get an original payment based on your damaged structure’s actual cash value. If you have replacement cost coverage, you can get more money after you finish the repairs.
You can pick your own contractor after State Farm checks the damage. They suggest you go with “an established, licensed, or bonded roofer” and get detailed estimates before starting repairs.
Your roof’s age plays a vital role in coverage decisions. State Farm will likely cover the full replacement cost if your roof is under 10 years old. Roofs 15 years or older might only qualify for actual cash value (ACV) coverage, which includes depreciation. This means you could get much less than what a new roof costs.
Some insurers might deny coverage or add strict conditions for roofs around 20 years old. Insurance data shows most roofs last about 20 years. However, roofs in hail-prone areas need replacement every 7-10 years.
Your maintenance history also shapes claim outcomes. State Farm looks more favorably at well-maintained roofs. You can build a stronger claim, even with an older roof, through regular inspections, quick repairs, and basic upkeep like clearing debris and cleaning gutters. Detailed maintenance records provide valuable proof when you file claims.
Each roofing material ages differently, which affects how State Farm reviews your claim. Metal roofs can last up to 50 years. Asphalt shingles usually need replacement after 20-25 years.
State Farm recognizes that impact-resistant roofing products save money over time through reduced damage risk. Homeowners in some states might get insurance premium discounts by using qualified impact-resistant roofing products.
For homes with composite asphalt roofing, hail damage might take years to show up. State Farm’s guidelines acknowledge natural granular loss during weathering. They might approve claims when “excessive granular loss” comes with actual hail damage that affects your roof’s integrity.
The company doesn’t typically cover wear and tear, rot, deterioration, or improper installation and repairs. State Farm paid $2.90 billion for homeowner hail claims in 2022, showing how important this difference is.
Normal weathering that causes granular loss isn’t covered “since it does not affect the watertight integrity of the roof”. The company also examines water damage claims carefully to see if they came from sudden events or ongoing leaks.
Professional inspections provide vital documentation. Complex cases might need an engineering assessment from State Farm. Keep photos, receipts, and inspection reports to create a detailed record of your roof’s condition over time.
File your claim quickly and document any damage right after major storms. Note that storm damage can create tiny openings where moisture slowly enters, even if your roof isn’t leaking now. This might cause problems months or years later.
3. A claim representative sets up an inspection. Houses with bad damage usually get checked first.
Your claim representative checks your property’s damage. Sometimes contractors or engineers need to check things for State Farm. You can pick your own contractor.
State Farm often turns down roof claims because of policy exclusions or how old the roof is. They might say it’s just normal wear and tear, point to existing damage, blame poor maintenance, or cite wrong installation. Many denials happen when State Farm says age caused the damage instead of storms. Claims filed too late—usually 1-2 years after a storm—get rejected right away.
After a denial, you should ask for a different adjuster to look at your roof again. If both adjusters say no, you might want to bring in a structural engineer to check the damage. Make sure you take clear photos of the damage from every angle and keep all your maintenance records.
Start by reading your denial letter to see exactly why they said no. You can appeal straight to State Farm or take your case to your state’s Department of Insurance. You might want to try intervention, though it won’t force anyone to change their mind. Note that each state has strict deadlines for filing insurance appeals.
Public adjusters handle tricky claims for a fee—usually 5-20% of what you get. They help track damage, figure out repair costs, read through policy details, and talk to State Farm for you. This option makes sense for big claims or when State Farm gives multiple reasons for saying no.
