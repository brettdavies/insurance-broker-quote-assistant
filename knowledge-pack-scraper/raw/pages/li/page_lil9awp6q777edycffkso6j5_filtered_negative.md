**Review:** Amica tops our cheapest and [best home insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance) ratings with the lowest sample rate and highest customer satisfaction for its value.
While Amica offers two tiers of home insurance, the cheapest option is its standard policy, which comes with [dwelling](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-insurance), other structures, personal property, personal liability, guest medical payments, and additional living expenses coverage. If you need more protection, you can purchase add-ons or upgrade to the Platinum Choice policy.
Lower your premium even further by taking advantage of Amica’s nine discount options or by choosing a dividend policy rather than the traditional plan. Amica’s dividend policies charge more up front but can return up to 20% of your premium if certain conditions are met.
**Availability:** You cannot buy Amica home insurance in Alaska or Hawaii.

Best for Low Credit
Pros:
* One of the top options for homeowners with lower credit scores
* No. 2 cheapest sample premium
* Inflation coverage comes standard
Cons:
* Ranks last for most categories in our consumer survey
* Fewer endorsement options than some competitors
* New policies not available in California, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island
* Quote Access:

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** Coming in second place with a sample monthly premium of $129 is State Farm. It’s also the No. 3 home insurance company in our overall best home insurance rating, though State Farm ranked last in the customer evaluation of its value.
While having a lower credit score can make your rate significantly more expensive, our data analysis found that State Farm’s premiums increased by a smaller margin than some of its competitors – about $50 more a month – for homeowners with a credit score of 620.
You may be able to lower your rate if you take advantage of one or more of State Farm’s seven discounts.
Inflation coverage comes standard with State Farm homeowners insurance, so your policy will be automatically adjusted every year to account for inflation.
**Availability:** State Farm does not currently offer new policies in California, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island.

Best for Military
Pros:
* Provides added benefits unique to military personnel
* One of the best and cheapest home insurance options
* Standard policy covers identity theft and replacement cost
Cons:
* Only available to USAA members, who must have a military connection
* Offers fewer discounts than some competitors
* No green improvement coverage
* Quote Access:

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** USAA offers the No. 3 cheapest rate for a standard policy: $129.67 per month. USAA is the No. 2 best home insurance company overall and ranks at No. 3 for value to customers.
However, this provider is limited to the [military community](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-for-veterans). USAA provides uniform coverage specific to customers on active duty. Unlike most insurers, USAA’s standard policy also includes coverage for dwelling and personal property replacement costs and expenses associated with identity fraud.
This provider may not offer as many discounts as some of its competitors, but it’s already one of the cheapest options and ranks at No. 1 for our [home and auto bundles rating](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles). You may also qualify for a lower premium by remaining claim-free, installing protective or smart home devices, and staying with USAA for three years.
**Availability:** USAA home insurance is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

* Ranks at No. 2 for customer service in our survey
* Add-on options include ordinance or law, and equipment breakdown
Cons:
* Customers can’t apply for a quote or file a claim online

* Quote Access:

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** Auto-Owners’ average monthly premium in our study is $141.17, which lands in fourth place. It’s the No. 5 best home insurance option overall, but only achieved a No. 7 rank for policy value.
According to our analysis of the rates data, Auto-Owners is one of the top options for homeowners who have recently filed a claim because it had one of the smallest increases for homeowners with a recent wind damage claim.
With about a dozen advertised discounts, you may qualify for a lower rate by paying on time, going paperless, not having a mortgage, installing protective devices and systems, and more.
**Availability:** You can purchase an Auto-Owners home insurance policy in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Best for Higher Deductibles
Pros:
* Good option for customers who want a higher deductible

Cons:
* Residents of certain states cannot get an online quote
* Average or below-average scores in our customer survey
* Did not make our rating of best home and auto bundles

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** Allstate’s home insurance is the No. 5 cheapest and the No. 6 best overall. Its average rate for the standard coverage limits in our study is $143.92 per month.
Allstate is a solid option if you want a higher deductible because our rates analysis found it had a significant premium reduction for an increased deductible.
Allstate offers at least nine discounts, but it also has a couple of optional features that may save you some money as well. Claim RateGuard helps ensure your rate doesn’t increase when you file a claim; it applies to only one claim in five years. Allstate’s Deductible Rewards feature gives you $100 off your deductible when you join and in subsequent years if you stay claim-free.
**Availability:** Allstate home insurance is sold in most of the U.S., but in recent years, the company has stopped writing new policies in California.

Pros:
* Offers one of the most comprehensive policies on the market
* Received above-average scores for customer loyalty and value
* Its complimentary services can proactively identify problems in your home
Cons:
* Falls below average for price and customer service
* Provides fewer discounts than competitors
* Online quotes not available

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** No. 6-ranked Chubb has a sample monthly premium of $154.08. However, Chubb ranks No. 4 in our overall best homeowners insurance rating and our consumer survey on value.
Chubb tends to cater to higher-value homes, so it’s not the cheapest option on the market, but it is one of the most comprehensive. Its Masterpiece policy covers replacement costs, sewer backups, extra costs from new building codes, and a wildfire prevention service in select areas – all of which would typically be add-on purchases with other providers.
Chubb’s complimentary services for homeowners help you save in the long run by identifying problems in your home, such as insulation or electrical issues behind the walls. It only offers a few standard discounts.
**Availability:** Chubb home insurance is available in all 50 states and D.C.

* Ranks at No. 2 for value to customers in our survey
* Offers online tools to help you compare quotes, create a home inventory, etc.

**Review:** Progressive may have placed seventh for the cheapest home insurance rating and eighth for the best options overall, but it came in second for value in our consumer survey. We calculated an average monthly rate of $157.58 for the standard level of coverage in our analysis.
Progressive offers at least eight discounts for homeowners, including one based on how new your house is.
If you buy a home or switch from renters to home insurance, you may also qualify for a discount, even if the house isn’t newly built. Other discounts may be available for getting a quote in advance, paying the full yearly premium up front, bundling homeowners insurance with other policies, and more.
**Availability:** Progressive sells home insurance in all 50 states and D.C. However, because of weather issues, the provider may at times stop writing new policies in some states.

Pros:
* Offers discount for green homes and coverage for eco-friendly materials
* Ranks as our No. 2 option for home and auto insurance bundles

* Quote Access:

* Multi-policy Discount Available:
**Review:** With a sample monthly rate of $171.25, Travelers has the No. 8 rank for cheapest home insurance. It’s the No. 7 best home insurance company overall and ties for No. 5 in the customer assessment of its value.
Travelers is particularly suitable for environmentally conscious homeowners who have or want a green home. If your home is certified as green by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, you may get 5% off your premium. Additionally, homeowners can purchase an optional endorsement that covers eco-friendly building materials to rebuild their house after a covered loss.
Aside from the green home discount, Travelers only has a handful of advertised discounts. You may qualify for some savings if you get both a home and auto policy from Travelers: It ranks at No. 2 for our best home and auto bundle rating.
Another way to save as a long-term policyholder in certain states is with Travelers’ Decreasing Deductibles program, which puts a $100 credit toward your deductible annually.

In our consumer survey, Nationwide comes in eighth for value. One of its primary attributes for customers is the wide range of discounts and optional endorsements that allow you to tailor your policy.
One discount option is Nationwide’s smart home program, which provides free devices to detect water damage. You may also be eligible for discounts when you buy or renovate your house, live in a gated community, have a certain type of roof, get multiple Nationwide policies, and more.

Average premiums based on $300,000 dwelling coverage and $100,000 in liability coverage.
## How Much Does Homeowners Insurance Cost?
The cost of home insurance varies widely based on many different factors. In our study, average monthly rates for a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage and $100,000 in liability coverage ranged from Amica’s $97 to Nationwide’s $172.92, with an overall mean of about $144. By contrast, for a policy with $500,000 dwelling and $300,000 liability coverage, the mean rate for these nine companies is roughly $220.
Our analysis is based on average rate data from Quadrant Information Services for a married homeowner in a three-person household with a wood-frame house. This study looked at average rates for a 38-year-old and a 56-year-old homeowner with a credit score of 720 and a deductible of either $1,000 or $2,500.
We strongly recommend you [compare quotes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/quotes) from multiple home insurance companies before committing to one, since rates can vary significantly.
## Factors That Could Impact Homeowners Insurance Costs
Here are some variables that home insurance providers may take into account to calculate your premium:
* **Location:** Your house’s ZIP code is a major cost factor. Insurers will evaluate whether the area is prone to crime or natural disasters and how close you are to fire stations, among other considerations.
* **Home Value:** The cost of rebuilding your home in the event of a total loss is another important variable. This amount takes into account the home’s construction type and materials, its square footage, and local building costs.
* **Home Features:** While certain protective and security devices may lower your rate, features like pools and trampolines can increase it, due to the greater risk of someone getting injured on your property.
* **Home Age:** Newly built homes tend to cost less to insure. Older homes may have outdated plumbing and electrical systems that pose a greater risk of damage, among other concerns.
* **Claims History:** Home insurance companies typically offer a discount for claim-free homeowners and raise rates for those with a history of filing claims. They will likely review your [CLUE Report](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-a-clue-report) to see the property and auto claims you’ve filed in the last seven years.
* **Level of Risk:** Insurers will evaluate how risky you are as a customer, based on your credit history, marital status, age, past claims, and other factors.
## Why Are Homeowners Insurance Costs Increasing?
Two primary causes of rising home insurance rates are natural disasters and inflation.
As catastrophes like wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes increase in frequency, insurance companies often end up [paying out more in claims](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12375) than they receive in consumer premiums. In an attempt to protect their business against these risks and recoup losses, providers continue to request rate hikes for policyholders – particularly those in disaster-prone areas.
Another main culprit for rising costs is [inflation](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA04/20231102/116528/HHRG-118-BA04-Wstate-WebelB-20231102.pdf), which can affect the prices and availability of building materials. Because a large portion of home insurance claims involve rebuilding and repairing property, those inflation-driven price hikes for materials feed into higher insurance rates.
## How To Save on Homeowners Insurance
#### Bundle Your Coverage
Most insurers offer discounts when you purchase another type of insurance along with your homeowners policy, such as car or life insurance. The most common bundle is [home and auto](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles).
#### Enhance Security
Installing protective devices and security systems may lower your premium. Beyond the standard fire alarms and deadbolts, consider more advanced features such as water and gas shutoff devices, internal sprinklers, and remote monitoring.
#### Adjust Deductibles
With a higher [deductible](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible) on your policy, you typically pay a lower premium. While you will face greater out-of-pocket costs in the event of a loss, you may save more in the long run.
#### Stay Claim-Free
If you don’t file any claims within a certain amount of time, your insurer may give you a discount, whereas your rate may go up if you do have to [file a claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-file-a-homeowners-insurance-claim), depending on the circumstances.
#### Clean Credit
Many states allow insurers to consider your credit when calculating your premium, resulting in higher rates for homeowners with lower credit scores. Make sure you are paying on time and maintaining a clean credit history.
#### Ask for Discounts
Discounts vary by provider, so be sure to research and ask about specific discounts that apply to you. For example, some companies provide discounts for new homebuyers, green homes, renovations, certain professions, and more.
## FAQ
Amica is the No. 1 company in our best home insurance rating, based on its low prices, high customer satisfaction, coverage options, discounts, and more. Rounding out the top three are USAA, which caters to the military community, and State Farm.
Keep in mind, however, that the best home insurance for you will depend on your individual coverage needs, budget, and circumstances.
You may face an increased rate after claiming a loss, but that’s not always the case. Some states regulate how filing claims affects your insurance and limit providers’ ability to change your rates as a result.
Insurers will typically take into account the type of claim and your broader claims history. If it’s your first time filing a claim, you’re not at fault, or the damage is minor, your premium may not be affected. You may want to discuss options with your agent or broker before filing a claim.
This rule refers to the convention that home insurance providers will fully cover damage to your house only if you have purchased dwelling coverage equal to at least 80% of your home’s replacement cost.
However, many companies may require you to get 100% coverage rather than 80% to avoid penalties for being underinsured. Check your insurer’s specific requirements.
You should compare quotes from at least three providers, but we recommend evaluating as many options as possible to find the best deal.

## How We Rated Home Insurance Companies
To compile our ratings, we researched 21 home insurance companies, surveyed 1,125 home insurance policyholders, and analyzed a total of 10,482 product features.The following describes our approach to researching home insurance companies to guide prospective consumers.
### **U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Home Insurance Companies**
**1. We identified the companies people care most about.**
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about home insurance companies. We found 21 home insurance companies that offer home insurance policies in the U.S. We then narrowed our list down to 12 home insurance companies that had the highest volume of consumer searches online, a wide reach of consumers in various states, and a good complaint record according to data provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC reports complaint counts and annual premiums for insurance companies at the subsidiary level. The complaint data points were weighed by the size of the annual premium written, and we aggregated the weighted data points to calculate the NAIC score at the parent company level.
**2. We collected data needed to make product comparisons.**
With the companies determined, we conducted a comprehensive data collection on the features and plans of their home insurance policies to create a general summary of what consumers should know to assist with their purchasing decisions. We collected data via a consumer survey, company feature analysis, and information on premiums from Quadrant Information Services.
(a) We surveyed 1,125 home insurance customers (593 women and 532 men, with an average age of 55.8 years) to assess their satisfaction with their policies. The survey was conducted in March 2025, and the target respondents were individuals in the U.S. who currently have a home insurance policy from one of the 12 companies we identified. Survey respondents were located in the South (29.5%), Northeast (25.9%), Midwest (23.0%), and West (21.4%). We asked respondents to rate companies on the following topics:
* Value
* Claim outcomes
* Discounts
* Customer service
(b) We collected data on 10,482 company features from the websites of the home insurance companies. These features were selected based on what consumers care most about according to our survey results, including:
* State availability
* Optional coverage add-ons
* Purchasing options
* NAIC complaint information
(c)To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with Quadrant Information Services. To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual homeowner profiles. The following represents our profiles for the premiums collected with Quadrant Information Services:
* Applicant age:
* 56-year-old married applicant
* 38-year-old married applicant
* 720 FICO credit score
* A 3-person family living in a wood frame house
* Deductibles:
* $1000
* $2500
* Home age
* 2024 construction
* Median home age for each state
* Dwelling coverage from $300,000 to $800,000
* Liability coverage from $100,000 to $300,000
* Structures coverage at 10% of dwelling coverage
* Loss of use coverage at 20% of dwelling coverage
* Personal property coverage at 50% of dwelling coverage
* Guest medical coverage limited to $5000
We also collected information for applicants with a 620 FICO score, as well as for an applicant with a single wind claim in the past 5 years, but these profiles were not included in our U.S. News Rating calculation.
**3. We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the product features (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment.
### **Conversion to Standardized Scores**
![Graph visualizing top standardized scores](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000196-ef18-d572-a796-ff5ad1c00000/unnamed-3.png?update-time=1752520502478&size=responsiveFlow640)
**4. We assigned weights to the standardized scores.**
To integrate standardized scores into our model, we used the survey results and industry knowledge to identify which scores should influence the purchasing decision more strongly. We also considered the heterogeneity of the scores. If a score was highly heterogeneous across products, we assigned more weight to that score. But, if a score was uniform for all products, we reduced the weight of that score. For example, if all plans offered dwelling coverage, we removed its scores from the model. This allowed us to enhance the model’s ability to detect meaningful differences by emphasizing the scores with stronger discriminant power. As a result, we arrived at the following weights:
(a) Price Data (40% of the U.S. News Rating)
* 30% premium information provided by Quadrant Information Services
* 10% survey score for value
(b) Claim Handling (25% of the U.S. News Rating)
* 20% survey score for claim handling
* 5% NAIC complaint information
(c) Coverage (15% of the U.S. News Rating)
* 3% core coverages (dwelling coverage, other structures coverage, loss of use coverage, personal property coverage, personal liability coverage, guest medical coverage)
* 4% other optional coverages
* 4% property replacement options
* 2% water backup coverage
* 2% valuable possessions coverage
(d) Discounts (10% of the U.S. News Rating)
* 7% discount options
* 3% customer satisfaction with discount programs
(e)Customer Service
* 4% customer satisfaction with customer service
* 3% availability of online signups and mobile applications
* 3% customer satisfaction with the ease of opening a policy and filing claims

**5. We aggregated the weighted scores into the U.S. News Rating.**
We combined the weighted scores and converted the value to the U.S. News Rating on a 5-point scale, with 5.0 being the best possible rating.
### **U.S. News Rating Formula**
