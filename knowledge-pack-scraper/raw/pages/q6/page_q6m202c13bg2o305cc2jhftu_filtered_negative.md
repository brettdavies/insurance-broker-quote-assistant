Forbes Advisor’s home insurance calculator is a fast and simple way to calculate your home insurance costs. Get started by answering a few quick questions to find the cheapest homeowners insurance that matches your needs.
## Home Insurance Calculator
## How To Estimate Home Insurance Costs
[How much home insurance you need](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/how-much/) depends on the cost to rebuild your house, how much personal property coverage you need, how much liability insurance you want and other factors. Start by assessing the following coverage types:
* **Figure out dwelling coverage:** To decide on the [best home insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) amount for your situation, first look at the foundation of home insurance: dwelling coverage. Dwelling insurance pays to rebuild or repair your house if it’s damaged due to a problem covered by your homeowners insurance policy, such as a fire or tornado. Your home insurance company can provide an estimate of the cost of rebuilding your house, which can help you decide on the limits you should choose.
* **Consider extended or guaranteed replacement cost coverage:** Insurance companies may offer [extended and guaranteed replacement cost coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/extended-and-guaranteed-replacement-cost/) as a way to make sure you’re not underinsured. Extended replacement cost coverage increases your dwelling coverage by a percentage amount, such as 25%. Guaranteed replacement pays whatever it costs to rebuild your home to its former state when damaged by a problem covered by your policy. These add-ons help offset high inflation or building costs, but they also typically add to your insurance costs.
* **Decide on personal property coverage:** Personal property coverage pays to repair or replace your belongings, such as furniture, appliances, clothing and other belongings, if they’re damaged or destroyed by a problem covered by your policy. Personal property coverage is generally set at 50% to 70% of your dwelling limit. You can pay to increase your personal property coverage. Completing a [home inventory](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/home-inventory/) will help you determine your coverage needs.
* **Look at actual cash value vs. replacement cost coverage:** Another factor that can play into the cost of your personal property coverage is whether you have [actual cash value (ACV) or replacement cost coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost-vs-actual-cash-value/). ACV factors in depreciation when reimbursing you for damaged or stolen property. Replacement cost reimburses you the full cost to replace those items. ACV is cheaper, but it doesn’t provide as much coverage as replacement cost coverage.
* **Understand homeowners liability insurance:** The [liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) within a homeowners policy pays for injuries and property damage you or household members accidentally cause others. For example, if your dog bites someone, your liability insurance can cover their medical expenses. Liability insurance also covers your legal expenses if you’re sued over the incident. You should buy enough liability insurance to cover what could be taken from you in a lawsuit.
* **Select a home insurance deductible:** An [insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/insurance/insurance-deductible/) is the amount subtracted from a claim check. Typical deductible amounts range from $500 up to $2,000. Home insurance deductibles apply to your structure and personal property coverages. Deductibles are usually flat dollar amounts, but there are exceptions, including hurricane deductibles and hail and windstorm deductibles.
* **Understand additional living expenses coverage:** Additional living expenses coverage reimburses you for extra expenses (such as hotel bills and takeout meals) if you can’t live at home due to an incident covered by your policy. [Additional living expenses coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use/) is usually set to 20% of your dwelling coverage limit, but you may be able to increase that amount.
Once you make these coverage choices, a home insurance company can estimate how much you’ll pay for homeowners insurance.

## Factors Used to Calculate Home Insurance Rates
Location, the cost to rebuild your house, past claims history, how much coverage you choose and your credit are the main factors in home insurance costs.
Summary
---
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Location@2x.svg)
### **Location**
Your ZIP code is a major factor in a home insurance estimate because it reveals risks such as weather and crime where you live. Insurance companies also look at your proximity to emergency services, such as the fire station.
[![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house@2x.svg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house@2x.svg)
### **The Cost To Rebuild Your House**
The cost of rebuilding your house dictates how much dwelling coverage you should buy. The higher the costs, the higher the dwelling limits you need. The materials your house is built with, such as brick, stucco, wood or stone, are also considered. Certain materials can make your home more or less risky to insure.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Document-1.svg)
### **Past Claims History**
Your past claims history reveals if you make a lot of claims, making you riskier to insure. Your property's claims history is also often reviewed. That shows the issues of previous homeowners that could also affect you.
[![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wallet@2x.svg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wallet@2x.svg)
### **How Much Coverage You Choose**
The higher the limits you choose for your house, the higher the potential home insurance payout. Don’t skimp on the coverage. You don’t want to be underinsured and unable to rebuild your home and replace your belongings after a disaster.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Credit-score@2x.svg)
### **Your Credit**
Homeowners insurance companies generally use credit-based insurance scores when calculating rates—except in California, Maryland and Massachusetts. Although using a person’s credit to calculate rates is controversial, home insurers say people with lower credit scores are likelier to file more claims and/or make claims with higher payouts. In turn, insurers typically charge people with lower credit more for coverage.
## What Information Do I Need To Get a Quote?
If you have the following information on hand when [comparing home insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/compare-home-insurance-quotes/), it should be a smooth process:
* Home’s address
* Type of property (single family, duplex, multi-family)
* Property use (primary residence, seasonal/vacation home or rentalhome or rental)
* Year the house was built
* Number of stories
* Style of the home
* Living area’s square footage
* Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
* If you have a garage (attached or detached)
* Detached structures such as a fence
* The type and age of the roof
* Exterior materials (stucco, brick, stone, etc.)
* Type of foundation, such as slab or basement
* Improvements or upgrades recently made to the home
* Information on electrical, plumbing and heating systems
* If any business is conducted on the property, such as a home day care business
* Number of people living in the home
* If you have dogs, a pool and/or a trampoline
* Safety devices (deadbolt, security system, fire alarms)
* Accessibility to fire services
* Distance to closest fire hydrant
* Name of current home insurance company
* Personal information, like your date of birth and marital status
* Whether you have a mortgage
## Methodology
We used data from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/), a provider of insurance data and analytics. Rates are based on ZIP codes across the nation for varying coverage limits, deductibles and credit.
Rates are based on a 45-year-old homeowner with good credit. The home insurance calculator tool features by state data for:
* **$200,000 dwelling coverage** with $100,000 personal property, $100,000 liability and $20,000 additional living expenses coverage and a $1,000 deductible.
* **$350,000 dwelling coverage** with $175,000 personal property, $300,000 liability and $35,000 additional living expenses coverage and a $1,000 deductible.
