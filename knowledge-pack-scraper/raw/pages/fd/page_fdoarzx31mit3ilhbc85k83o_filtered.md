## What does mobile home insurance in Florida cover?

Mobile home insurance coverage is similar to [homeowners insurance coverage](/homeowners-insurance-coverage "What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?").

Both forms of insurance typically provide coverage for your home's structure and your personal belongings, along with liability protection.

### Standard mobile home insurance coverage

Dwelling coverage

[Dwelling coverage](/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance?") protects the permanent parts of your mobile home, like the walls, roof and deck. If these components are damaged in a covered accident, your insurance will help pay to repair the damage.

Personal property coverage

[Personal property coverage](/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?") protects your personal belongings — like furniture, bikes and electronics — from theft or damage. Your property is protected whether the damage happens inside or outside of your mobile home.

Other structures coverage

[Other structures coverage](/does-homeowners-cover-other-structures "What Is Other Structures Coverage for Home Insurance?") provides protection for structures that are on the same lot as your mobile home but not attached to it, like a detached shed or carport.

Liability protection

[Personal liability coverage](/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?") helps pay for medical bills and legal costs if you accidentally hurt someone or damage their property.

Additional living expense coverage

[Additional living expense coverage](/loss-of-use-homeowners-insurance "What Is Loss of Use Coverage for Homeowners and Renters?") helps pay for you to live elsewhere if your mobile home is damaged to the point that you can't live in it while repairs are being made. This can include a hotel stay, moving expenses and meals if your temporary home doesn't have a kitchen.

Mobile home owners can usually customize their policies with extra coverage, or endorsements, for an extra cost. This could include extra coverage for expensive jewelry or sports equipment, identity theft protection or water damage due to a sewer backup.

### Extra coverage recommended for Florida mobile home owners

Florida has the most hurricanes of all states in the U.S., so residents should be prepared to deal with flood and wind damage to their homes.

#### Flood insurance for Florida mobile homes

A typical mobile home insurance policy doesn't include any protection against flood damage. Florida residents should consider [purchasing flood insurance](/flood-insurance/florida "Cost of Flood Insurance in Florida and How Coverage Works") to help cover the cost of storm damage.

It's also important for Florida mobile home owners to understand their policy's wind coverage. According to Florida law, home insurance policies must cover wind damage from a storm that's declared a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center.

However, your insurance company can exclude wind damage that's not caused by a named hurricane. About 4% of mobile home insurance policies in Florida don't include wind coverage. These homeowners should consider [buying a separate windstorm insurance policy](/homeowners-insurance/florida-wind-insurance "Florida Wind Insurance and How to Lower Costs With Wind Mitigation Credits").

In addition, your mobile home insurance may have a higher deductible for damage caused by a named storm, which means you'll have to pay more yourself to repair your home after a hurricane or tropical storm.
