Mobile home insurance quotes in Florida will vary, depending on your home's location, value, age and coverage limit. For example, the average cost of insurance for a mobile home with  wind coverage in Florida is $116 per month, while a policy with  no wind coverage costs $31 per month, on average.
Mobile home insurance companies in Florida typically offer discounts to homeowners who install wind-resistant features to their homes, which can help lower insurance costs. However, the best way to save money on mobile home insurance is to [shop around and compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-mobile-home-insurance "Best Mobile Home Insurance Companies").

Foremost, [American Modern](https://www.valuepenguin.com/american-modern-insurance-review "American Modern Insurance Review") and Sutton National have the best-rated mobile home insurance in Florida for most people.
Company |  NAIC score (lower is better) | Market share
---|---|---
Foremost |  0.41 | 24%
[Citizens Property Insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/citizens-property-insurance-review "Citizens Property Insurance Review") | 3.65 | 18%
[Tower Hill](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tower-hill-home-insurance-review "Tower Hill Insurance Review") | 4.59 | 7%
If you have a mortgage on your mobile home, your lender will usually require you to have insurance. In addition, [mobile home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/mobile-home-insurance "Mobile Home Insurance: Do You Need It and What It Covers") is typically required if you place your home in a mobile home community or park.
Even if you aren't required to buy mobile home insurance, it's a good idea for most homeowners to have insurance coverage. It will help cover the cost to repair or replace your mobile home if it's damaged by fire, wind or another  covered event.

Mobile home insurance coverage is similar to [homeowners insurance coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?").
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance?") protects the permanent parts of your mobile home, like the walls, roof and deck. If these components are damaged in a covered accident, your insurance will help pay to repair the damage.
[Personal property coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?") protects your personal belongings — like furniture, bikes and electronics — from theft or damage. Your property is protected whether the damage happens inside or outside of your mobile home.
[Other structures coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-homeowners-cover-other-structures "What Is Other Structures Coverage for Home Insurance?") provides protection for structures that are on the same lot as your mobile home but not attached to it, like a detached shed or carport.
[Personal liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?") helps pay for medical bills and legal costs if you accidentally hurt someone or damage their property.
[Additional living expense coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loss-of-use-homeowners-insurance "What Is Loss of Use Coverage for Homeowners and Renters?") helps pay for you to live elsewhere if your mobile home is damaged to the point that you can't live in it while repairs are being made. This can include a hotel stay, moving expenses and meals if your temporary home doesn't have a kitchen.
A typical mobile home insurance policy doesn't include any protection against flood damage. Florida residents should consider [purchasing flood insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/florida "Cost of Flood Insurance in Florida and How Coverage Works") to help cover the cost of storm damage.
However, your insurance company can exclude wind damage that's not caused by a named hurricane. About 4% of mobile home insurance policies in Florida don't include wind coverage. These homeowners should consider [buying a separate windstorm insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/florida-wind-insurance "Florida Wind Insurance and How to Lower Costs With Wind Mitigation Credits").

The [average cost of mobile home insurance in Florida #rates ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/mobile-home-insurance-florida#rates "#rates") is $112 per month, or $1,349 per year. However, your rate may vary based on the size and age of your home, your insurance history, your proximity to the coast and a number of other factors.
If you're unable to buy a policy from a private company, you should consider [Citizens Property Insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/citizens-property-insurance-review "Citizens Property Insurance Review"), which is a state-run company that provides home insurance to Floridians that can't get coverage elsewhere.
[American Modern](https://www.valuepenguin.com/american-modern-insurance-review "American Modern Insurance Review"), Foremost and Sutton National have the highest customer satisfaction among Florida mobile home insurance companies, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All three companies also have solid financial strength ratings from AM Best, which means they should be able to pay out claims, even in difficult economic situations.
