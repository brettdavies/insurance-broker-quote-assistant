## Average Homeowners Insurance Cost in New York
While the average annual cost of homeowners insurance in New York is about $1,900, the companies on our best list range from around $1,800 up to $2,560. Part of this increased cost – the national average is around $1,700, [per our analysis](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheapest) – is due to the average cost of a house in the state of New York, which is just shy of $480,000. If you’re looking for a cheaper company, consider State Farm or Travelers Insurance, which have low average annual costs of around $1,800 and $1,850, respectively.

## New York FAIR Plan for Homeowners Who Are Denied Coverage
If you’re having trouble finding home insurance in New York, consider getting a policy through the [New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association](https://www.nypiua.com/) (NYPIUA). Learn more about this program and eligibility on the New York Department of Financial Services website. However, if at least three licensed insurers have denied you coverage, you may be permitted to buy home insurance from unlicensed companies, otherwise known as excess line insurers.

## Coverage Options for Natural Disasters in New York
New York is the seventh [most disaster-prone state](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/the-most-disaster-prone-states-in-the-us). According to the National Centers of Environmental Information, from 1980 to 2024, New York state had 95 weather/climate disaster events with losses of over $1 billion, including 21 winter storms, 16 tropical cyclones, and 48 severe storms. Keep in mind that not all [homeowners insurance policies cover](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover) all natural disasters.
#### Cyclones
If your home is damaged or completely knocked down by a tropical cyclone, your home insurance should pay to repair or replace it, including its roof, walls, and flooring.
#### Wind Storms
While home insurance covers damage to your home and personal property up to your policy’s limits, you’ll have to check your policy declarations page to find out if it covers any trees that have fallen in your yard. Typically, policies do not cover dead or fallen trees.
#### Flooding
Home insurance will only cover flooding if you have a flood endorsement or alternative flood insurance. To get flood insurance, you can either use a private insurer or the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.floodsmart.gov/).
## New York Insurance Department
New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulates its insurance industry. You can [file a complaint with the New York DFS](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/complaint-old) online, or check out its website for more information.
## FAQ
No, homeowners insurance is not required in New York. However, the state recommends purchasing it anyway to protect against losses from disasters.
In New York, basic homeowners insurance covers dwellings, garages, storage sheds, personal property on and off premises, and additional living expenses. You may be able to purchase more coverage that protects you from judgments in lawsuits that exceed your homeowners policy and covers your home computer, workers’ compensation, or home day care.
Home insurance companies are dropping customers in New York due to weather events that have increased the number of claims and losses for insurance companies. This is especially common in parts of Long Island, which are surrounded by water.
Part of the reason homeowners insurance is so expensive in New York is due to the high average cost of homes in the state compared to the rest of the U.S. While the average cost of a home in the U.S. is around $370,000, the average in New York is 30% higher at about $480,000.
Houses with higher property values require larger amounts of dwelling coverage, which results in higher premiums. While the sample premiums from our rate study are based on $300,000 worth of dwelling coverage, in New York, our rates are based on dwelling coverage of $500,000.
To save on homeowners insurance in New York:
1. Bundle your insurance with another type of insurance, like auto.
2. Pay a higher deductible.
3. Wait until you improve your credit score to apply for a policy.
4. Ask your provider what discounts it offers. For example, you may be able to get a discount for installing a home security system.
5. Avoid filing claims for a certain period of time.

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Local Homeowners Insurance
To build our ratings, we researched 16 homeowners insurance companies and insurance agencies and analyzed data from a consumer survey with 1,125 responses, product features collected from company websites, and data on insurance costs provided by Quadrant Information Services. U.S. News worked with Quadrant to analyze a report of publicly available insurance rates using 34,595 ZIP codes across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the companies in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies that operate in that state. The insurance rates in our study are based on averages of sample rates for a 38-year-old and 56-year-old married applicant household with a 720 FICO credit score. The rates were obtained for an HO3 policy covering a wood-frame house with 10% Other Structures Coverage, 20% Loss of Use Coverage, 50% Personal Property Coverage, and a guest medical limit of $5,000.
