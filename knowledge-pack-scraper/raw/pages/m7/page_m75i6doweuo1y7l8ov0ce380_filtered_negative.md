* What To Know About Disability Insurance
![Man with an injury looking at his disability insurance benefits on his phone](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/si-disability-insurance-wide.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
While many might think their chances of becoming disabled are slim, the reality is that more than one in four adults in the United States have a disability, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html). Given this statistic, you may want to consider extra precautions. One way to do so is to obtain disability insurance coverage which may help protect your [financial well-being](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/follow-these-steps-to-achieve-financial-wellness) in case of an [emergency](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/building-an-emergency-fund-calculate-how-much-to-save).
The causes of disability are as diverse as their duration: For example, Short-term disability for an injury that requires a hospital stay, or Long-term disability for recovery from an accident or debilitating illness. Whatever the cause or length, a disability has the potential to cause a [financial crisis](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/create-a-financial-emergency-plan) in your household. Here’s what to know about the financial impact of disabilities and what you can do to help protect yourself.
While [health insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/health) is there to help cover medical bills, disability insurance is meant to help provide coverage for part of an employee’s missing income when they’re unable to work due to an illness or disabling injury. Disability insurance can help provide benefits that cover [50 to 60% of an employee's salary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/110415/group-and-individual-disability-insurance-what-you-need-know.asp#:~:text=GLTD%20disability%20benefits%20are%20usually,70%25%20of%20earnings%20or%20salary.) on average.
* [**Short-term disability insurance**](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/disability/short-term-disability) — provides funds to help with monthly expenses like car loans, mortgage, rent and credit cards or to help replace lost income if you become disabled.
* [**Long-term disability insurance**](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/disability/long-term-disability) — provides funds to help replace lost income if you become disabled for an extended period of time.
* **A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)** benefit to help protect against inflation by increasing your monthly disability payments each year.
* **Residual disability riders** that continue to pay out in reduced amounts if you're able to work part-time.
* **Accidental death and dismemberment (AD &D) **gives a lump-sum payment
* **Social Insurance Supplement Rider (SIS)** provides an additional benefit amount. Your disability benefit amount will be reduced proportionally once the SIS benefit is approved.
* **Five Year and to Age 67 Own-Occupation** options which changes the qualification of a claim so it's specific to your occupation (if you can do another job, you would still get the benefit).
While Social Security Disability Insurance and disability insurance offered by your employer may be convenient in various ways, there are some downsides that may make [individual disability insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/disability) more enticing.
Planning, [strategizing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/small-business/strategic-small-business-startup-tips) and mitigating risk is especially important when you have a business and are self-employed. Disability insurance is a particularly important tool to help mitigate risk for people who own [small businesses](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/small-business/choosing-coverage-to-protect-your-homebased-business) and are self-employed. Disability insurance may help protect the business, too.

* **Benefit period** —
* **Inflation protection** —
* **Cost-of-living adjustments** —
* **Policy renewability and cancelability** —
