One of the easiest ways to save on car insurance costs is to take advantage of [discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts). If you drive less than the national average of 13,476 per year, you may qualify for a low-mileage discount.[[1]](#cite-1)

The average low-mileage driver can save around 27% on [GEICO](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico) auto insurance for driving less. Let’s take a look at the GEICO low-mileage discount — how it works, how to get it, and what you can save. We’ll also provide more [cost-saving tips](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) to help you get the best auto insurance rates.

## **What Is the GEICO Low-Mileage Discount?**

A [low-mileage discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/low-mileage-insurance-discount) isn’t as common as other car insurance discounts, but driving less lowers your chance of accidents and [filing claims](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/how-to-file-insurance-claim), which could mean [cheaper insurance rates](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance).

While GEICO doesn’t advertise a specific low-mileage discount, it does consider annual [mileage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/annual-mileage) when determining premiums. Other auto insurers may as well, so it’s worth reaching out if you drive fewer miles than the national average.

You could get even more savings with GEICO’s [DriveEasy](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico/driveeasy) telematics program. DriveEasy uses a mobile app to track your mileage usage and driving habits. The safer you drive and the fewer miles you put on your vehicle, the more you can save. You get an initial 10% enrollment discount, then the chance for an additional 10% rate reduction at your next policy renewal.

## **How Much Can You Save With the GEICO Low-Mileage Discount?**

GEICO doesn’t publicize cost savings or mileage requirements for the low-mileage discount. On average, drivers save around 27% with an annual mileage estimate of 7,500 vs. 15,000. That said, your savings can vary by several factors, including [coverage options](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage), mileage, [vehicle type](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/vehicle-model), and other policy discounts.

Real-world experiences can help you gauge your potential savings. One GEICO customer on Reddit says they saved $20 per month after notifying GEICO customer service that they were now [working from home](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/work-from-home-car-insurance) and no longer commuting.[[2]](#cite-2) Another GEICO customer — a single driver with two vehicles — completed a mileage report and lowered their premium by $40 per month.

It’s a good idea to do an insurance review if your circumstances change, like getting a job that shortens your commute or owning more vehicles than household drivers. It could lead to more savings.

### **How does GEICO’s low-mileage discount compare to competitors?**

Only a few insurance companies, like [State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-low-mileage-discount) and USAA, offer a low-mileage discount. Neither company discloses how much you can save.

The table below shows how GEICO’s average monthly rates and low-mileage discount compare to some of its top competitors, according to our research.

Most auto insurers focus on [usage-based programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) that monitor driving behavior and actual mileage rather than offering low-mileage discount options. Each of the above companies has usage-based programs. Here are more details about each program to help you determine if one may be right for you:

## **How to Get the GEICO Low-Mileage Discount**

![Man in a blue shirt talks on the phone while working on a laptop at a desk, with papers and folders around him.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/5d2604dbc6/man-with-landline.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

GEICO doesn’t have a stand-alone low-mileage discount, but lower annual mileage could lead to better insurance rates.

If you’re not a current GEICO customer, start by getting an [auto insurance quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance). When you’re adding your vehicle information, include your annual mileage estimate. You can calculate it by multiplying how many days per week you travel to work or school and how many miles it takes to get there.

If you already have a GEICO insurance policy, contact your agent or customer service to ask about eligibility requirements. Be ready to provide your odometer reading and mileage usage to see if you’re eligible for a rate reduction.

While talking to the GEICO rep, consider verifying other policy details, like your car insurance coverage levels and [deductibles](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles). This step ensures your policy still meets your [insurance needs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/how-much-auto-insurance-need) and you’re not missing out on other discounts or savings opportunities.

Make sure your mileage estimate is accurate. If you estimate too low and drive more than expected, your rate could increase.

Your other option is to enroll in the DriveEasy program. Once you download the mobile app, it will track your mileage in real time. Depending on your driving habits and usage, you may receive a discount.

GEICO doesn’t have a discount for low mileage, but the insurer factors mileage into its premium calculations. If you drive less than the national average of 13,476 miles per year, you could get a rate reduction on your policy.

Few auto insurers offer a low-mileage discount and usually don’t advertise savings. We found [American Family](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/american-family-insurance), USAA, and State Farm offer lower rates when you drive fewer miles. Getting car insurance quotes from different companies to compare their discounts and coverages can help you find the cheapest options for your driving habits.

GEICO doesn’t advertise its low-mileage discount. That said, driving less than the national annual average, which is 13,476 miles, might lower your premium. Savings can vary by mileage usage, policy details, state, and other factors.

GEICO has an extensive list of car insurance discounts to help you get a lower rate. Ask your GEICO agent what discounts you qualify for and stack them to maximize your savings. Raising your [comprehensive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/comprehensive-insurance) and [collision](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance) deductibles can also lower your premiums, but it will cost you more out of pocket if you file a claim.
