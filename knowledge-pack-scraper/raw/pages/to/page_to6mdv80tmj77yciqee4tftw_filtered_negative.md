An umbrella policy extends above your standard [homeowners liability](https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance/coverage/personal-liability-insurance-coverage) and [auto liability](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/auto-liability-insurance-guide.html) policies, giving you a higher total coverage limit than any of those policies offer. If the amount of coverage on those policies isn't enough to protect your assets, you need an umbrella policy.
