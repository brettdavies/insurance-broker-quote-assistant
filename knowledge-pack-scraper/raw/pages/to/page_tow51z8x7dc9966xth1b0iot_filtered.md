Bankrate insight

When trying to save on car insurance, it can be easy to want to buy the least amount of coverage. While it’s impossible to purchase less than the [minimum coverage required by law in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/), you should still understand what your coverage limits are in case of an accident. Minimum coverage often isn’t enough to cover the extent of expenses from a serious accident. You may consider purchasing higher coverage limits or add-ons to provide more financial protection.

## Cheapest car insurance in California for drivers with prior incidents

Out of the many [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) that insurers in California use to calculate the cost of car insurance, the insured's driving record is one of the most important. One of the three mandatory rating factors used by all California insurers, driving history includes incidents like speeding tickets, at-fault accidents and DUIs that can raise your insurance risk and cause your premiums to go up.

If you have any incidents on your driving record in the last five years, you may need to search for an insurer with competitive rates for drivers like you.

* For a speeding ticket
* For an at-fault accident
* For a DUI

## Cheapest car insurance for young drivers in California

Driving experience is another mandatory rating factor in California. While insurers aren't permitted to base rates directly on age, insurers do consider the number of years a driver has been licensed as a measure of their relative driving experience and potential risk of accidents. Drivers who have been licensed for less than three years — including [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) and many [young adults](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-adults/) — see the highest rates for car insurance, especially when on a standalone policy.

## Car insurance discounts in California

* Young driver discounts
* Safety device discounts
* Organizational discounts
* Billing discounts
* Loyalty discounts

If you have a teen or young adult driver listed on your policy, you may save by taking advantage of [discounts for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/). These may include savings for students who maintain good grades or those attending college at least 100 miles away from home without a car.

These discounts may be earned by having safety features such as anti-theft systems, anti-lock brakes, airbags or other features designed to minimize injuries or theft.

Some carriers offer discounts to those in certain professions, such as teachers, first responders or military members. Others offer savings for members of organizations such as alumni groups or professional societies.

These easy-to-earn discounts may include one for paying your bill electronically or for paying your entire premium at the beginning of the service period rather than monthly.

You may earn a discount if you have multiple policies with one company (called [bundling](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/)), insure more than one car with the same company or have been a policyholder for a certain period of years.

## California car insurance laws

Bodily injury liability

$30,000

per person

Bodily injury liability

$60,000

per accident

Property damage liability

$15,000

per accident

California only requires a basic level of auto insurance to drive legally, but that minimum may not be enough in a serious crash. Many drivers choose to raise their liability limits and add comprehensive and collision coverage if they can afford it. Doing so can help avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses following a major accident. To note, instead of buying a car insurance policy, California drivers have a few other options. They can make a $75,000 cash deposit with the DMV, get a self-insurance certificate from the DMV or purchase a $75,000 surety bond from a company licensed in the state.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What is the best car insurance company in California?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The best car insurance company for you will depend on your insurance preferences. When shopping, it’s helpful to start by making a list of your priorities. Once you know what you want from your insurance, you can do some research (or let Bankrate do it for you) to hone in on the [best company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for you. For example, some drivers prefer to manage their policies completely online or through an app, while others may want to go to an office and speak with an agent in person. Price is another consideration. It’s helpful to look at average rates in your area so that you can identify a good deal when you see it. Also, when getting quotes, don’t forget to ask about your discount eligibility — it could reduce your rate even further.

* ### Does my credit score impact my car insurance rate in California?

  Caret Down Icon 

  In most states, insurers can review your credit score when determining rates since individuals with higher credit ratings generally pose a lower risk. California, however, is an exception to this rule. Carriers may not access credit scores or penalize drivers with low credit ratings in California. California is one of four states where this is true; the others are Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

* ### Why is my California car insurance so expensive?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Your own California car insurance rates likely don't line up exactly with the averages listed on this page. Insurance premiums are highly personalized and based on [multiple factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), like your age and driving record as well as your vehicle's age, make and model. If you have past marks on your license, for example, your rate may be above the state average. Repair costs and medical costs in the Golden State tend to be on the high side, and this can cause insurers to charge more for their policies. The state's high population density, especially in coastal areas, can lead to road congestion and increased accidents, which also drives up coverage costs.

#### Other profiles

* ### Credit-based insurance scores:

Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

* ### Age:

  Caret Down Icon 

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
