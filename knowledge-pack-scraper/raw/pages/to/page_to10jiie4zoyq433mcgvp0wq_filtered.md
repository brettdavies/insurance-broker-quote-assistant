Reviewed in Alabama on November 2025

I found out from a previous employee about their directive that they are not supposed to cover roof damage. Unfortunately, it was after my roof was damaged. They said it was not wind damage even though two trees were blown down and my son's trampoline was blown over 30 feet.

Why we picked this company

The fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer by market share, Allstate is available in all 50 states. The company has been in business for more than 90 years and also sells home, renters, and condo policies — so it’s a good option for those who want to save by bundling auto with another type of policy. Allstate also offers helpful optional auto coverages, like gap insurance and accident forgiveness. AM Best gives the company a high rating for financial strength, but Allstate has a higher-than-average number of complaints in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Consumer Complaint Index.

Pros 

* Ample opportunities for bundling discount
* Offers a pay-per-mile option
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* Low customer satisfaction
* Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
* Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study

## GEICO

GEICO currently holds the second-highest spot in terms of auto insurance market share and boasts the highest-possible financial strength rating from AM Best: A++.

Why we picked this company

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
* No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
* Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

## Allstate Drivewise vs. GEICO DriveEasy

Allstate and GEICO offer optional [**telematics programs**](/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) for drivers who want to save even more on their premiums. These programs use smartphone apps to log trips, identify driver habits, and even detect crashes. People who demonstrate safe driving habits can qualify for discounts on their policy, though neither insurance company specifies how much you can save.

Allstate’s Drivewise program tracks driver speed, braking events, mobile phone usage, and what times of day drivers are on the road to determine how much risk a driver poses. The less risky the behavior, the greater the savings. Good drivers can also qualify for additional safe driver performance rewards every six months.

GEICO’s DriveEasy program is also app-based and tracks many of the same data points: how often you use your phone behind the wheel, how fast you drive, whether you brake quickly, and even how fast you take turns. The better your driving habits, the better your driver score and greater your discounts.

## Allstate vs. GEICO: Which is the cheapest?

On average, auto insurance through GEICO is cheaper than Allstate. The average GEICO premium is $91 per month for liability-only coverage and $139 per month for full coverage, while Allstate averages $74 per month and $139 per month for liability and full coverage, respectively.

But premiums vary among drivers depending on factors like age, driving record, coverage level, and even ZIP codes. While these are Allstate’s and GEICO’s average rates, your quoted premiums may be different, which is why you should always [**shop around and compare quotes**](/car-insurance/).

### GEICO: Cheapest for drivers with a clean driving record

For the average driver with a clean driving record — which means no [**at-fault car accidents**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), [**driving under the influence**](/car-insurance/knowledge/what-does-dui-mean/) (DUI) convictions, or speeding tickets — GEICO offers cheaper auto insurance coverage than Allstate.

For drivers with a [**speeding ticke**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/)[**t**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/) on their record, GEICO offers more affordable liability coverage than Allstate.

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### GEICO: Cheapest for teen drivers

Insurance companies view young and [**teen drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) as high-risk drivers, so they charge them higher premiums. But GEICO charges cheaper monthly premiums for teen drivers than Allstate.

| **Driver Type** | **Allstate** | **GEICO** |

### GEICO: Cheapest for drivers with bad credit

Many drivers may be surprised to learn that their [**credit history**](/car-insurance/driver/credit/) can affect their auto insurance premiums. While GEICO is still the more affordable option for [**drivers with bad credit**](/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/), Allstate is close behind.

| Drivers with bad credit | $90 | $111 |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### GEICO: Cheapest for senior drivers

[**Senior drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) may see slight increases in their car insurance rates when they hit their 70s because age-related health issues can affect their driving capabilities. However, senior drivers still pay relatively affordable premiums on average. Between Allstate and GEICO, GEICO is the cheaper auto insurer for senior drivers.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

On average, Allstate’s auto insurance coverage is slightly more expensive than GEICO’s, based on Insurify data. The average cost of insurance through Allstate is $74 per month for liability insurance and $139 per month for full coverage. The average GEICO premium is $91 per month for liability-only coverage and $139 per month for full coverage.

In 2023, AM Best affirmed Allstate’s financial strength rating of A+ (Superior), indicating that it’s able to pay out future claims.[[2]](#cite-2) Additionally, J.D. Power gave Allstate a score of 889 out of 1,000 points in its 2022 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.[[3]](#cite-3) These ratings suggest Allstate is good at paying out claims.

GEICO and Allstate are very similar insurers offering many of the same coverages. However, Allstate offers rideshare and gap insurance coverages, and GEICO doesn’t.

The best car insurance company is the one that best meets your needs and budget. But Allstate does have a few coverages that GEICO doesn’t offer, while GEICO has higher financial strength ratings and lower average rates.
