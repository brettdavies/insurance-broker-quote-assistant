Homeowners insurance in Florida often includes law and ordinance coverage, which helps cover the cost of bringing a damaged home up to current building codes. Given the state’s strict regulations and frequent exposure to hurricanes, this coverage can be crucial for avoiding unexpected expenses after property damage. Without it, homeowners may have to pay out-of-pocket for code-related upgrades required during repairs or rebuilding. 
## Key Policy Features
Law and ordinance coverage addresses the financial burden homeowners face when repairing or rebuilding a property that no longer complies with updated building codes. Standard homeowners insurance covers damage from covered perils but does not account for the additional costs required to meet new regulations. This coverage helps pay for demolition, increased construction costs, and necessary upgrades mandated by local or state codes. Florida law requires insurers to offer this coverage as part of replacement cost policies, ensuring homeowners have the option to protect themselves from these additional expenses. 
The coverage is generally divided into three components: the cost of demolishing the undamaged portion of a home if required by law, the increased cost of construction to meet updated codes, and the cost of bringing an undamaged portion of the home into compliance if repairs are being made to a damaged section. For example, if a hurricane damages half of a home but local regulations require the entire structure to be rebuilt to meet new wind resistance standards, this coverage would help pay for those additional costs. 
Most policies offer law and ordinance coverage as a percentage of the dwelling coverage limit, typically ranging from 10% to 50%. For instance, if a home is insured for $300,000 and the policy includes 25% law and ordinance coverage, the homeowner would have up to $75,000 available for code-related expenses. Selecting an adequate coverage percentage is particularly important in coastal areas where hurricane-resistant materials and structural reinforcements are required.
## Florida Building Code Enforcement
Florida’s building code enforcement is among the most stringent in the country due to the state’s history of hurricanes and the need for resilient construction. The Florida Building Code (FBC) sets uniform standards that all new construction and major renovations must meet. Local governments enforce these codes through permitting, inspections, and compliance measures. Every three years, the Florida Building Commission updates the code to incorporate new safety measures. 
Before any major repair or rebuilding project begins, homeowners must obtain the necessary permits. Inspectors verify that work meets FBC standards before issuing a certificate of occupancy. If violations are found, corrections must be made before construction can continue, which can increase costs and delay the project. Insurers often require proof of compliance before approving reimbursement claims. 
Substantial improvement rules can also trigger mandatory upgrades for existing structures. If repairs exceed 50% of a home’s market value, the entire structure may need to be brought into compliance with current codes. Municipalities can impose stricter local amendments to the FBC, meaning homeowners in certain regions may face even more rigorous requirements.
## Claim Steps and Required Documentation
Filing a law and ordinance coverage claim requires homeowners to follow a structured process. The first step is notifying the insurance company as soon as possible after the damage occurs. Florida law imposes a strict deadline, requiring claims to be reported within two years of the date of loss. Delayed reporting can complicate the process and may result in denial. Once the claim is initiated, the insurer will assign an adjuster to assess the damage and determine the extent of coverage. 
Documentation is crucial. Homeowners should gather repair estimates, contractor bids, engineering reports, and official notices from building authorities mandating compliance with updated codes. Photographic evidence of the damage, along with pre-loss condition documentation, can strengthen the claim. Obtaining copies of relevant building codes cited by local officials can further justify the claim’s validity. Insurers must acknowledge receipt of a claim within 14 days, so keeping detailed records of all communication is advisable. 
Once the adjuster completes the inspection, the insurer will issue a coverage determination. If approved, payments are typically disbursed in stages, with an initial payment covering direct damage and subsequent payments addressing code compliance costs as work progresses. Homeowners should ensure contractors provide itemized invoices separating standard repairs from code-required improvements, as insurers may require this breakdown before releasing funds. Any discrepancies or delays in payment should be addressed promptly, as Florida law mandates insurers to pay undisputed claims within 90 days.
## Disputes With Insurers
Conflicts often arise when insurers contest the necessity or scope of code-related repairs. Disputes frequently center on whether certain upgrades are mandated by building officials or if they exceed the policy’s coverage limits. Insurers may argue that specific improvements go beyond compliance requirements, classifying them as elective upgrades rather than covered expenses. Florida law requires insurers to provide a written explanation for any denial or partial payment, which can serve as a basis for challenging their decision. 
Homeowners can request a re-evaluation by submitting additional documentation, such as written directives from local building authorities explicitly stating that certain upgrades are required. If the insurer remains uncooperative, policyholders can invoke Florida’s appraisal process, which allows each party to hire an independent appraiser to assess the loss. If the appraisers disagree, an impartial umpire is brought in to make a binding decision. This process can be faster and less expensive than litigation but does not always resolve disputes over policy interpretation.
