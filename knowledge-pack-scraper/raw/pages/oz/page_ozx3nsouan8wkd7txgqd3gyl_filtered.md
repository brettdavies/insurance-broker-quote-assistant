## How to Qualify for the Best Driver’s Ed Car Insurance Discount

If you’re looking to save on [new driver car insurance](https://clearsurance.com/blog/new-driver-car-insurance) through a driver’s education discount, there are a few key steps to ensure you qualify for the best possible rate. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Choose a State-Approved Driver’s Ed Course:** Insurance companies typically require that the driver’s education program be approved by your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).
* **Verify Insurer Requirements:** Each insurance provider has specific criteria for their driver’s ed discount. Some may only offer discounts for in-person courses, while others accept online programs.
* **Maintain Good Grades:** Many insurers combine driver’s ed discounts with good student discounts. If you’re a student, maintaining a B average or higher can further reduce your premium.
* **Complete the Course:** Upon finishing the course, you’ll receive a certificate of completion. Most insurance companies require you to submit this documentation as proof before applying the discount.
* **Apply the Discount Before Policy Renewal:** If you’re already insured, make sure to notify your provider and apply for the discount before your policy renewal to maximize savings.

By following these steps, you can take full advantage of driver’s ed discounts and lower your car insurance costs. But finding the best teen car insurance always requires looking at multiple companies since each provider has a different way of determining rates.

![blog image 11](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

While you can fill out quote requests forms at every company you’re interested in, you can also use an online quote generating tool to look at multiple rates at once.

Why is it so important to compare rates? Teen auto insurance rates are usually much higher than older adults because they are considered riskier to insure. Check below to compare average monthly rates for full coverage auto insurance for teen drivers with those of a 25-year-old.

| Age & Gender | Monthly Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 16-Year-Old Male | $628 |
| 16-Year-Old Female | $563 |
| 17-Year-Old Male | $523 |
| 17-Year-Old Female | $469 |
| 18-Year-Old Male | $462 |
| 18-Year-Old Female | $413 |
| 19-Year-Old Male | $364 |
| 19-Year-Old Female | $324 |
| 25-Year-Old Male | $191 |
| 25-Year-Old Female | $185 |

While everyone should compare quotes, it’s especially important for teens. If you skip this vital step, you’ll likely overpay for the same coverage you could get elsewhere.

## Best Companies for a Driver’s Ed Car Insurance Discount

Insurance companies understand that teen coverage rates are high and probably hard for most young drivers to afford. That’s why most major insurance companies offer a discount for teens who complete a driver’s education course.

Choosing the right company is integral to getting affordable rates for teen drivers, but that’s not the only thing that can be done. Aside from getting teen driver discounts, a parent or guardian can help teens save by adding them to an existing policy. Check the rates below to see how much you can save by adding a teen to your policy.

Your driving record is extremely important when it comes to how much you’ll pay for insurance. Drivers with clean records typically pay much less for insurance than people with speeding ticlets or at-fault accidents on their records. To see how your driving record impacts insurance rates, take a look at the rates below.

It’s crucial for teens to keep their driving records clean. Insurance rates typically drop to a much lower price around age 25 if you keep your record clean. While you can look at the [best car insurance companies that decrease rates after you turn 21](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-car-insurance-companies-that-decrease-rates-after-driver-turns-21), insurance can become prohibitively expensive for teens who get marks on their driving records.

The best companies for driver's ed discounts often do more than give teens a way to save on their insurance. Many providers offer learning programs to help teens improve their driving skills, like the State Farm Steer Clear program. Others work closely with the teenSMART program to offer incentives to teens.

## Other Car Insurance Discounts for Students

While a driver's education discount is a great way to save money on your insurance, it’s not the only way. From auto insurance discounts to usage-based insurance (UBI), you can find the [top ways customers save money on their car insurance](https://clearsurance.com/blog/top-ways-customers-saved-money-on-car-insurance) below.

### Good Student Car Insurance Discount

The good student discount is a reward for young drivers who maintain strong academic performance.

![blog image 23](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

Insurers see good grades as an indicator of responsibility, which often translates to safer driving habits. This discount is typically available to high school and college students under the age of 25.

To qualify, most insurance companies require students to have at least a B average (3.0 GPA) or be on the honor roll or dean’s list. You’ll likely need to provide a report card or transcript as proof each policy term. Some insurers may also extend this discount to homeschooled students who score well on standardized tests.

### Student Away at School Car Insurance Discount

The student away at school discount is designed for students who attend college far from home and don’t drive regularly.

![blog image 24](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

To qualify, parents or students must provide proof of enrollment at an eligible school and confirm that the car remains parked at home. Some insurers may require occasional verification to maintain the discount. However, the student will still be covered if they drive the vehicle while visiting home on breaks.

### Teen Driver Car Insurance Discount

Adding a teen driver to an auto insurance policy can be expensive, but many insurers offer discounts to help offset the cost. These discounts often apply when a teen completes a driver’s education course, maintains good grades, or is listed on a parent’s policy instead of having their own.

To qualify, parents should check with their insurer about available discounts for young drivers. Some companies also provide savings for teens who participate in safe driving programs or use monitoring devices that track driving habits.

However, it’s not unheard of to get a discount simply for adding a teen driver to your policy. For example, Progressive helps parents and guardians by offering a discount just for adding a teen driver to their policy.

### Usage-Based Insurance

Usage-based insurance programs offer discounts based on how safely and how often you drive.

![blog image 25](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)

These programs use telematics technology — via a mobile app or plug-in device — to track factors like speed, braking, acceleration, and mileage. Drivers who regularly practice safe driving habits can save significantly with this safe driving discount.

To qualify, you must enroll in a UBI program with your insurer and agree to have your driving monitored. Discounts vary based on performance, with safer driving habits leading to greater savings. Some programs offer immediate sign-up discounts, while others apply savings after a monitoring period.

## Why Young Drivers Pay More for Car Insurance

Wondering [why car insurance is so expensive](https://clearsurance.com/blog/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive) for teens? Young drivers typically pay higher car insurance rates because they are considered high-risk due to their lack of experience on the road. While there are many factors at play when it comes to teen driving, insurance companies focus on the following:

* **Reckless Driving:** Teen drivers are more likely to engage in reckless driving behaviors, like racing.
* **Distracted Driving:** Young people are more likely to be distracted by phones and friends.
* **Inexperience:** Since teens haven’t had the chance to get road experience, they’re less likely to know how to handle dangerous situations.

Since insurance companies base premiums on risk assessment, they charge higher rates to offset the increased likelihood of claims.

Additionally, young drivers often have little to no credit history or insurance record, making it harder for insurers to predict their level of responsibility. Without a proven track record of safe driving, insurers err on the side of caution by setting higher premiums.

The good news is that insurance rates tend to lower significantly by age 25, as long as you keep your driving record clean. Until then, completing either an in-person or online defensive driving course can help keep your costs down.

## Find the Best Discounts After a Driver’s Ed Course Today

When you need cheap teen car insurance, finding the best driver’s ed car insurance discounts can lower your premium by up to 15%. While there are other teen car insurance discounts, a driver’s ed discount comes with the benefit of teaching teens how to be safer on the road.
