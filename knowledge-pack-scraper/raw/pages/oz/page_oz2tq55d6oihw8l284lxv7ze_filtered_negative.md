Data Methodology Chevron down icon
Of the companies listed above, USAA is one of the cheapest but it's also the most exclusive. USAA is only available to military members and their families – so while the lower premium is appealing, not everyone will qualify.
Outside of its services, a company might be more expensive because of simple economics. If your current company paid out more claims than it earned in premium, it could account for that by increasing rates next year.
Even if you didn't file a claim, your rate can still increase because your insurance company's cost of doing business increased. In fact, 43% of customers who use our product state they are paying too much with their current provider.[[2]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/#footnote-2)
##### Zebra Tip: Price isn't everything – consider company reputation
* * *
* * *
* Personal information — including date of birth, driver’s license number*, and address
* Vehicle information of all vehicles including VIN*
* Payment. If you’re getting a policy for the first time, the insurance company will likely require a down payment before the policy is bound (accepted)
_*Note that you can get a quote without a VIN or driver license number, but you will not be able to buy your policy without it._
##### Zebra Tip: Don't "forget" to mention that speeding ticket
* * *
It’s important to be as accurate as possible when requesting quotes. The more honest you are during this process, the more accurate your final rate will be. If you leave out a ticket or accident in your quote to try to get a cheaper premium, insurance companies eventually find out and update your rate when they finalize your policy.
The benefit of using online insurance comparison sites is obvious: avoid the tedious task of going through the quoting process for many different companies.
If you want to avoid spam emails, texts and phone calls, pay close attention to the website's privacy disclosures and how they earn money. We recommend looking for websites or companies that are **independent agents of insurance providers.** Independent agents are licensed and authorized to write policies for multiple insurance companies.
Start the process online or reach out by phone to speak to one of our agents. [Our in-house agency](https://www.thezebra.com/about/the-zebra-insurance-agency/) is licensed to write policies for many top insurance companies.
