Just know that if you make a claim, you'll be responsible for more out-of-pocket. Use our [home insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/calculator/) to determine what your deductible could be.
* **Build a bundle**: The bigger the bundle, the bigger the savings. [Bundle homeowners with an existing auto policy](https://www.progressive.com/insurance/bundling/) and save. Have a couple of toys to throw in? Add a boat, RV, or motorcycle to get the lowest home insurance cost.
* **Take advantage of discounts**: Who doesn't love a discount? And boy, do we have [homeowners insurance discounts](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/discounts/). Something as simple as going paperless can make it so you have more paper in your pocket.
* **Adjust your coverages**: Compare your policy and your [home inventory](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-create-a-home-inventory/) to make sure you have the coverages that are right for you.

* **Consider key home renovations**: Some home renovations and improvements increase your rate, but certain upgrades can help reduce your rate for some insurers, too – especially if you live in an [older home](https://www.progressive.com/answers/homeowners-insurance-for-older-homes/). See what [home improvements or renovations](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-improvements-renovations-insurance/) could impact your rate.
* **Know the score**: You might keep an eye on your credit score, but did you know that your insurance score could also play a factor in your [homeowners insurance cost](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-homeowners-insurance-cost/)? Keep tabs on your driving and accident history in addition to your credit score, even if it is for homeowners insurance.
