# Progressive’s Snapshot program: What’s the catch?
![reviewer icon](https://www.carinsurance.com/images/blueberry/highlight.svg) Updated on: Mar 07, 2025
Drivers can save an average of $94 when they sign up for Progressive's Snapshot program and $231 a year at program completion.Skip to article
CarInsurance.com Insights
  * Progressive Snapshot offers good drivers a discount after proving they practice safe driving habits through a monitoring system. 
  * If you don’t mind letting Progressive monitor your driving habits, you could tap into significant savings. 
  * But beware – Snapshot could lead to a higher insurance premium for drivers with bad habits.


Progressive’s Snapshot program is a usage-based insurance program. The idea is simple: Drive carefully and save. Drive less, save more. And if you avoid driving during peak accident hours (Progressive says that’s between midnight and 4 a.m.), you save more.

## What is Progressive Snapshot?
Progressive Snapshot monitors your driving behavior to determine your car insurance rates. Safe drivers can generally expect to save money through this program. You’ll even get an automatic discount for signing up in some states. 
The Snapshot app monitors your vehicle speed, how many miles you drive and your frequency of hard braking. In turn, drivers can save an average of $94 upon program sign-up and $231 a year at program completion with Progressive’s Snapshot program, according to Progressive.
The device must be installed for at least 30 days, but you can leave it in longer for a broader profile and a bigger discount.
## How does Progressive Snapshot work?
The Snapshot process starts when you enroll in the program. You can participate through a mobile app or device plugged into your vehicle. 
Once you’ve signed up, Progressive begins to monitor your driving habits. You can check in about Snapshot’s perception of your driving behaviors online or through the mobile app. 
Generally, Snapshot considers the following driving metrics:
  * **Hard braking and acceleration:** Generally, you’ll want to avoid hard braking and fast accelerations. 
  * **Avoid late-night driving:** Progressive prefers drivers limit their trips between midnight and 4 a.m. on weekends. 
  * **Driving time:** Less time spent behind the wheel means lower chances of an accident. 
  * **Phone usage:** Staying off your phone on the road can improve your driving score. 


You’ll likely see your rate drop when you have good driving habits. But if you have high-risk driving habits, your rates might increase. According to Progressive, two out of 10 drivers see a rate increase due to the Snapshot program. 
## Pros and cons of the Progressive Snapshot program
Like any other insurance decision, enrolling in Progressive Snapshot has advantages and disadvantages. 
Let’s start with the pros:
  * **Potential for lower rates:** Safe drivers might see lower car insurance rates after enrolling. 
  * **Straightforward for good drivers:** Good drivers can tap into a lower rate without much effort. 


Now for the cons:
  * **Potential for higher rates:** You could see a rate increase if your driving isn’t up to par. 
  * **Tracking:** Snapshot tracks your driving behaviors, which might not sit well with drivers concerned about privacy.

## Is Progressive Snapshot right for you?
Nick Schrader, owner of Texas General Insurance, says drivers must consider their driving habits and comfort with being monitored when enrolling in a telematics or usage-based program like Progressive’s Snapshot. 
“If you are confident in your safe driving and have no issue with sharing data like speed or phone usage, go for this program,” he says. “It is the key consideration of choosing a telematics program.”
![Tip icon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2020%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)Real-world experience from a Snapshot driver
Snapshot works well for some drivers, like William Parsons, who received an almost 15% rate cut for participating in the program. 
“I didn’t have any hassles,” says Parsons, who lives in New York. “After a week or so, I kind of forgot that it was in there.”
Parsons says he was optimistic about the results because he fits the profile of a driver who would qualify for a premium cut: “I’m pretty anal when I drive. Slow and steady, 10K miles a year.”
Parsons says he wasn’t overly concerned about the company having a detailed report on him.
“If I were a bad driver, I’d probably feel different,” he says. 
But he wouldn’t sign up if that was the case. Although generally satisfied, Parsons says the brake monitoring seemed inconsistent – even though he still got his discount.
“There were trips where I know I didn’t brake hard, but it showed that I did. (Other times), I think I did hit them a little hard, but I’m not sure if they registered.”
## How much can I save with the Progressive Snapshot program?
Progressive’s Snapshot program allows drivers to save an average of $94 upon program signup and $231 a year upon program completion, according to Progressive.
But remember: The amount you save varies based on your driving habits. Drivers with bad habits might see their rates increase. 
### Is the Progressive Snapshot program available nationwide? 
No, the Progressive Snapshot program isn’t available in every state. 
## Final thoughts
Progressive Snapshot allows drivers to save money through safe driving habits. But it’s not the right fit for everyone. If you are worried about your driving habits or have privacy concerns, skip Snapshot.
