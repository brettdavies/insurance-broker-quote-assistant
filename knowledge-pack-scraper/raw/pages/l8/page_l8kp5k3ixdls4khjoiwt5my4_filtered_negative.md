We found that **Travelers** is more affordable than USAA, with an average **monthly cost of $110**.
* * *
If you have [bad credit](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/), USAA could be the way to go. Similarly, if you have fair to excellent credit, USAA is generally more affordable. Check out average insurance costs by credit tier for Travelers and USAA below.

Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA could be a better choice than Travelers. USAA was significantly less expensive for those with certain violations in their recent driving history. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.
---|---|---
Auto insurance companies use a driver's age as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for young drivers [under the age of 25](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) — due to their relative inexperience compared to [older drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/). Because every car insurance company rates [age brackets](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA, which we found was more affordable than Travelers. USAA was also cheapest for drivers in most age groups.
---|---|---
Cost aside, USAA and Travelers each carry pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, add-ons and financial stability. Dive into the data before making your decision and be sure to [see personalized quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) before purchasing a policy.

Things such as your [claims history](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/guide/when-to-file-homeowners-insurance-claim/), crime rates in your area and your proximity to [fire stations](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-cover-fire-damage/) can have a big impact on how much you pay. As with car insurance shopping, we suggest [comparing home insurance rates](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) from many different companies when looking for home insurance policies.
According to our data,**U****SAA and Travelers are essentially tied with home insurance rates at around $125 and $127 per month, respectively.**
