## USAA or Travelers: Which company is best for you?

USAA and Travelers are each among the [top insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/) in the United States. USAA is unique, however, in that its policies are only available to members of the armed forces and certain family members, and membership is required before you can purchase a policy. Travelers has widespread brand recognition, but does not enjoy the same levels of customer satisfaction overall.

Both companies have coverage options that will satisfy the needs of most customers — but which one is right for you? Have a look at our in-depth comparison to see which company comes out on top.

USAA is unique in that customers must be in the [armed forces](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/military-discount/) or be close family members. The company has many insurance options that can be paired with your auto policy. Membership also allows access to other benefits, like banking services. In terms of market share, USAA comes in fifth place.

In general, USAA receives stellar ratings from customers and third-party rating agencies alike, including the top score in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. If membership is an option for you, the company is definitely worth looking into.

The company holds a strong reputation for providing [customizable coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/) at affordable prices and also offers a number of bundling options. One potential drawback, however, is that Travelers' overall customer satisfaction scores tend to be lower than many competitors. Read more below.

##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: TRAVELERS VS. USAA

### USAA vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers

If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA could be a better choice than Travelers. USAA was significantly less expensive for those with certain violations in their recent driving history. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVELERS VS. USAA

| **Citation** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,304 | n/a |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $947 | n/a |
| DUI/DWI | $1,952 | $2,004 |
| Reckless driving | $1,472 | n/a |
| Speeding ticket | $1,124 | $1,752 |

### USAA vs. Travelers: rates by age

Auto insurance companies use a driver's age as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for young drivers [under the age of 25](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) — due to their relative inexperience compared to [older drivers](/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/). Because every car insurance company rates [age brackets](/auto-insurance/driver/age/) in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA, which we found was more affordable than Travelers. USAA was also cheapest for drivers in most age groups.

##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. USAA

| **Age** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $2,864 | $3,622 |
| **20s** | $1,261 | $1,645 |
| **30s** | $963 | $1,348 |
| **40s** | $957 | $1,237 |
| **50s** | $889 | $1,167 |
| **60s** | $845 | $1,165 |

Cost aside, USAA and Travelers each carry pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, add-ons and financial stability.
