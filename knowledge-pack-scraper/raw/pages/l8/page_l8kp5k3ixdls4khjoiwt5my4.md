## USAA or Travelers: Which company is best for you?
USAA and Travelers are each among the [top insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/) in the United States. USAA is unique, however, in that its policies are only available to members of the armed forces and certain family members, and membership is required before you can purchase a policy. Travelers has widespread brand recognition, but does not enjoy the same levels of customer satisfaction overall.
Both companies have coverage options that will satisfy the needs of most customers — but which one is right for you? Have a look at our in-depth comparison to see which company comes out on top.

USAA is unique in that customers must be in the [armed forces](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/military-discount/) or be close family members. The company has many insurance options that can be paired with your auto policy. Membership also allows access to other benefits, like banking services. In terms of market share, USAA comes in fifth place.
In general, USAA receives stellar ratings from customers and third-party rating agencies alike, including the top score in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. If membership is an option for you, the company is definitely worth looking into.

Car insurance rates are determined by a [number of factors](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/), including [where you live](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/car-insurance-rating-factors-by-state/), your driving history and even your credit score (a factor in almost all states). Both USAA and Travelers weigh these factors differently, meaning that you are very likely to get a different quote from each company.
To give you a sense of how USAA and Travelers insurance rates compare rates, we've put together average rates based on a few different factors. Have a look at the figures below to get a sense of which company could be most affordable for you.
Cheapest average rates

Similarly, if you have fair to excellent credit, USAA is generally more affordable. Check out average insurance costs by credit tier for Travelers and USAA below.
##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: TRAVELERS VS. USAA
**Credit level** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $2,682 | $3,224  
Fair (580-669) | $1,247 | $1,773  
Good (670-739) | $1,057 | $1,375

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### USAA vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers
If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA could be a better choice than Travelers. USAA was significantly less expensive for those with certain violations in their recent driving history. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVELERS VS. USAA
**Citation** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,304 | n/a  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $947 | n/a  
DUI/DWI | $1,952 | $2,004  
Reckless driving | $1,472 | n/a  
Speeding ticket | $1,124 | $1,752  
### USAA vs. Travelers: rates by age
Auto insurance companies use a driver's age as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for young drivers [under the age of 25](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) — due to their relative inexperience compared to [older drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/). Because every car insurance company rates [age brackets](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA, which we found was more affordable than Travelers. USAA was also cheapest for drivers in most age groups.
##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. USAA
**Age** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $2,864 | $3,622  
**20s** | $1,261 | $1,645  
**30s** | $963 | $1,348  
**40s** | $957 | $1,237  
**50s** | $889 | $1,167  
**60s** | $845 | $1,165  
Cost aside, USAA and Travelers each carry pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, add-ons and financial stability. Dive into the data before making your decision and be sure to [see personalized quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) before purchasing a policy.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
