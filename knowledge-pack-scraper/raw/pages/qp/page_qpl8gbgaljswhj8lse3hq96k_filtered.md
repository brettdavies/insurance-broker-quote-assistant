Although State Farm offers various insurance products, it actually started with car insurance as its only offering. In 1922, retired farmer G. J. Mecherle started the company to provide car insurance to rural drivers. Over time, the company grew, and now it offers numerous different products to customers.[[3]](#cite-3)

Customer Care - Lacking. Need to Find a Caring P&C Agency!

Reviewed in Florida on November 2025

I was a State Farm policyholder for over 30 years, and when I needed them, I got no support or help. Prior agents were significantly better than this one, who doesn't seem to care about her clients.

### State Farm auto insurance rates by driving history

## State Farm car insurance discounts

State Farm, like many other auto insurers, offers several [**car insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) for drivers to save money. Here are some of the most popular ones:

* **Safe driver:** State Farm has a program called Drive Safe & Save. You enroll via a mobile app that tracks your driving and then receive discounts for enrolling and driving safely. Drivers with no moving violations or accidents in the past three years can save on their premiums.
* **Steer Clear:** This is a program for new drivers or drivers younger than 25. Through this program, you learn how to become a safer driver. If you complete the program requirements and have no at-fault accidents or moving violations, you can earn a premium discount.
* **Good student:** You can get a good student discount if you rank in the top 20% of your class, have a 3.0 GPA, made the dean’s list, or are on the honor roll.

Customer Care - Lacking. Need to Find a Caring P&C Agency!

Reviewed in Florida on November 2025

I was a State Farm policyholder for over 30 years, and when I needed them, I got no support or help. Prior agents were significantly better than this one, who doesn't seem to care about her clients.

Not bad but a bit disappointing

Reviewed in Ohio on November 2025

Good, other than I have to wait until I renew my policy in 6 months. Can I get them to rerun my thing because I had some things fall off last month?

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

But it has had accusations of fraudulent and allegedly discriminatory practices. In one instance, the Equal Opportunity Commission agreed with a former State Farm employee that State Farm carried out racial discrimination practices. Other agents came forward with similar claims, and the insurer has faced multiple lawsuits, according to *The* *New York Times*.[[6]](#cite-6) In 2022, a U.S. district court found a State Farm subsidiary guilty of committing insurance fraud against the federal government after Hurricane Katrina and ordered the company to pay $100 million in restitution, according to the Associated Press.[[7]](#cite-7)
