# Driving laws for older drivers by state
[](https://lifelanes.progressive.com/auto/)
5 min read
If you’re an older driver, you may be nervous about whether you’ll have to give up your driver’s license at a certain age. Of if you have an older driver in your family, you might wonder, “Is there a maximum driving age?” Driving laws are different in every state. However, there are no states that require older drivers to surrender their license because of their age.
To simplify things, we’ve compiled a list of some elderly driving laws by state, including how often you must renew your license and whether you’re required to take vision or written tests to maintain your driving privileges.
## Tips for older drivers renewing a driver’s license:
  1. Find your state in the list.
  2. Visit the website for your local motor vehicles department to learn about the current senior citizen driving laws for your state.
  3. Review your state’s driver’s handbook to refresh your memory on the driving laws.
  4. Be prepared to take a written knowledge test or a driving test if required before you can renew your license.
