##  What Is Permanent Life Insurance?
Once you've picked the policy that's right for you, remember to thoroughly research the firms you're considering to ensure you'll get the best life insurance available.
##  Understanding Permanent Life Insurance
##  Permanent Life Insurance vs. Term Life Insurance
For this reason, many term life policies offer the option to [convert ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertible-insurance.asp)the coverage to a permanent policy later, often [without needing to take medical exams](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance-8773567) or meet other qualification standards. The conversion feature could be appealing for someone with medical issues that could make a new policy prohibitively expensive, or those with chronic conditions that might eventually require them to draw ongoing expenses from the savings portion.
##  Advantages and Disadvantages of Permanent Life Insurance
##  The Bottom Line
