## Got questions? We got answers!
####  How long is the course? 
Our course meets the Connecticut time requirement of 6 hours, but the total course time is 5 ½ hours, with 30 minutes allowed for breaks. The good news is that our course saves your progress as you go, which allows you to complete it at your own pace. You can log in and out as many times as you need without ever losing your progress.
####  What tests do I have to take? 
The course is 10 chapters, and for each chapter, there is a short quiz with 4 questions. Answer 3 correct to pass. There’s no final quiz at the end of the course.
####  How long is the insurance discount valid? 
The discount is valid for three (3) years, when you can repeat the course for renewal if you’d like.
####  Will my insurance really give me a discount if I take this course? 
Yes – it’s a state law. This law requires insurance companies to offer a 10% discount of auto or motorcycle liability and collision insurance if you complete a Connecticut State Department of Motor Vehicles-approved accident prevention course.
####  How much money will I save? 
This will depend on your individual policy. The state-mandated discount is 10% from the base of your collision and comprehensive portion of your policy. Many of our students averaged anywhere from $900-$1500 over the course of three years.
####  How does it work? 
A. First, complete the course at your convenience in the same day or over 30 days; it’s up to you!
B. Your original certificate of completion will be mailed to you the very next day after you complete the course. We will also report your completion to the DMV to ensure your point reduction.
## Got more questions?  
More info about the course
####  Can I take this course for insurance reduction if I am NOT a GEICO customer? 
Yes, most insurance companies will give you a discount on your auto premium for completing a Defensive Driving/Insurance Discount course. In some states, insurance discounts are mandatory to all insurance companies. If you are insured with another carrier, please [register here](https://myimprov.com/defensive-driving/connecticut/).
####  When will I be able to get a discount from GEICO after completion of the course? 
We report your certificate of completion directly to GEICO within 24 hours. Your discount should be applied shortly after that. It will likely to be shown on your next billing.
####  Is this an online course? 
Yes, we are 100% online. You can take the course on ANY device.
####  How does the course work? 
It’s really simple. Sign up online and log into the course. You can complete all at once or at whatever pace you like. You can use any digital devices, including your computer, phone, or tablet. Once you finish the course, we will provide your certificate of completion for your insurance carrier.
####  Will I save more if my family members take it? 
That’s a good thought! Absolutely! The discount can be applied to any GEICO primary driver who meets the age requirement. You can find the eligibility requirements [here](https://www.myimprov.com/geico/connecticut/?hl=en) after selecting your state from the dropdown.
####  How much will I save? 
It depends on your policy. Each insurance company sets their own rate. Every state has different rules and qualifications for defensive driving discounts. Eligibility requirements also vary. You can learn more [here](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/) by selecting your state from the dropdown.
####  What do I do when my insurance discount expires in 3 years? 
Taking a one-time course will ensure your insurance savings for 3 years (those who move to another state or anyone who has a lapse in coverage may not be able to get a full 3 years discount). After 3 years, you simply need to take the course again and then you can secure your savings for another 3 years.
####  Can I take this course for ticket dismissal? 
NO, this course is ONLY for the insurance premium discount for GEICO customers. If you have a current traffic ticket and need to take a dismissal course, find your course at [www.myIMPROV.com](https://myimprov.com/)
####  What if I have more questions?
