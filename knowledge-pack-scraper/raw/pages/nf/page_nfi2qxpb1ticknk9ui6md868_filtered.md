One of the easiest ways to lower the [cost of car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/average-car-insurance-cost) is to take advantage of discounts. Many discounts are stackable, allowing you to rack up the savings more easily. But not all apply to your policy automatically, so it’s worth researching how to apply them to get the most savings on your auto policy.

[Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) offers 13 discounts, with the multi-car and Snapshot discounts being the largest. This guide breaks down Progressive’s discounts by type, potential savings, how to apply, and other savings opportunities.

## **Full List of Progressive Discounts**

You can get up to 13 [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) from Progressive. Discount availability, eligibility, and savings can vary by state. The table below shows the full list of Progressive discounts.

## **Progressive Age-Related Discounts**

[Young drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) are expensive to insure. Fortunately, many insurers offer age-related discounts to help offset the higher [insurance premiums](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium). Here’s the ones Progressive offers:

* **Teen driver discount:** [Add a teen driver](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/adding-child-to-insurance) 18 or younger to your Progressive auto policy to get the teen driver discount.
* **Good student discount:** Full-time students with a B or above GPA can save up to 10%.
* **Distant student discount:** If you go to school at least 100 miles from home, you can save on your car insurance policy by leaving your car at home.

## **Progressive Homeowner Discounts**

![A man sitting on the floor of his house using his laptop](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/60b47d87b1/man-sitting-on-floor.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality(90))

Few companies offer car insurance discounts specifically to homeowners, but Progressive does.

You can qualify for this discount simply by owning your home, even if you don’t insure your home with Progressive.

## **Progressive Payment Discounts**

Being flexible with your insurance payments and how you receive policy documents can help you save a good chunk of money on your auto policy. Progressive offers multiple ways to save with payment and online discounts:

* **Online quote discount:** Save an average of 7% by [getting a quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) for car insurance online, even if a Progressive representative finishes the quote by phone.
* **Sign online discount:** Sign your policy documents online to get an average of 9% savings.
* **Paperless discount:** Receive your policy documents by email and sign your documents online to get Progressive’s paperless discount.
* **Pay in full discount:** Pay your entire premium at once to receive the paid-in-full discount.
* **Automatic payments discount:** If you can’t pay in full, set up auto pay on your monthly payments to get a discount.

## **Progressive Loyalty Discounts**

![A black car driving on an empty road](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/dc42c22e07/car-driving-empty-road.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality(90))

Staying loyal to one car insurance company could land you one or more loyalty discounts. Progressive offers the following three loyalty discounts:

* **Continuous coverage discount:** When you switch to Progressive, you can earn a continuous coverage discount at your first policy renewal, which varies depending on how long you’ve had continuous insurance with your prior insurer.
* **Multi-policy discount:** With the multi-policy discount, you can save an average of 7% on your car and home insurance with Progressive. You could save more by getting more policies, like RV or motorcycle insurance.

## **Progressive Telematics Discounts**

If you’re comfortable with your insurance company tracking your driving habits, consider Progressive’s [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount). This increasingly common [usage-based insurance program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) can help safe drivers save on car insurance when driving less, staying off the phone, and avoiding late-night driving, hard braking, and fast acceleration.

Progressive’s Snapshot program comes with an enrollment discount, which offers an average savings of $94, according to the company’s website. After your first renewal with Snapshot, you’ll lose the enrollment discount but typically gain a program completion discount, saving an average of $231 per year.

That said, around two out of 10 drivers see their rates increase for risky behavior, like driving late at night, braking hard, and driving faster than the posted speed limit.

## **Progressive Driving Record Discounts**

Progressive doesn’t offer any explicit discounts for having a good driving record, but your driving record can help you save in other ways. For example, you’re eligible for [accident forgiveness coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-accident-forgiveness-insurance) if you don’t have any tickets or at-fault accidents in your recent driving history. Though the coverage may increase your premium when you add it, it can provide substantial savings by preventing a policy surcharge when you cause an accident.

Progressive also offers a [deductible savings bank](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/vanishing-deductible) feature for a small fee, which it doesn’t advertise. You can bank $50 at each policy renewal toward your [comprehensive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/comprehensive-insurance) or [collision](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance) deductibles if you remain ticket- and accident-free.

## **Progressive Vehicle Discounts**

Insurers typically offer discounts based on the type of car you drive and the equipment it comes with. For instance, if you have a factory-installed anti-theft device, like a car alarm or GPS tracker, you could qualify for an [anti-theft device discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/anti-theft-discount).

Another common discount is for [safety features](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/passive-restraint-discount), such as anti-lock brakes, airbags, and locking seat belts.

Unfortunately, Progressive doesn’t offer vehicle discounts. While a lack of vehicle-related discounts may mean Progressive isn’t a good fit if you have a [new car](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/new-car-discount) with the latest safety features and anti-theft protection, it may be a good fit if you have an [older vehicle](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/are-older-cars-cheaper-to-insure) that lacks these features.

## **How to Add Discounts to Your Progressive Policy**

![A group of young girls driving in a car](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/8d80dcdede/young-girls-driving-car.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality(90))

Adding a car insurance discount to your Progressive auto policy depends on the discount. Some have certain requirements you must meet first, while others apply automatically.

For example, if you sign your policy documents online, go paperless, or set up automatic payments from your bank account, Progressive will automatically apply those discounts to your policy. Likewise, the company will verify your prior insurance history and automatically apply the continuous coverage discount.

But for discounts like the good student discount, you’ll need to provide proof of a qualifying student’s grade report, dean’s list, or honor roll certificate to get the discount. You may also need to provide a copy of your homeowners insurance policy from another company, your tax assessment, or closing documents to get the homeowner discount.

## **Other Ways to Save With Progressive**

Although discounts are an easy way to [save on your auto policy](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks), they aren’t the only option. Consider these other ways to save with Progressive:

* **Use the Name Your Price tool.** If your budget is limited, consider Progressive’s Name Your Price tool. You’ll enter some basic info about yourself and how much you can pay, then the tool will provide coverage options within your budget.
* **Avoid accidents and tickets.** Progressive estimates drivers with no [at-fault accidents](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/at-fault-collisions) or [tickets](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/tickets) in the last three years pay an average of 34% less for auto insurance than drivers who do.
* **Stick with Progressive.** Continuous insurance for at least six months gets you priority call routing in most states. If you stick with Progressive for 20 years — or 16 with Progressive and four continuous with a prior insurer — you’ll get a lifetime renewal guarantee, meaning you won’t get dropped, regardless of your driving record.

Progressive offers 13 car insurance discounts, according to our research. You can also bank $50 in savings toward your comprehensive and collision deductible every time your policy renews if you haven’t received a ticket or been in an accident. Keep in mind that not every discount is available in every state.

Progressive car insurance discount savings vary by the state you live in and other factors. For example, a good student discount can save you up to 10%, and a multi-car discount can save you up to 12%.

Yes, you can stack Progressive discounts. The more discounts you qualify for, the more you can save. For example, if you insure two vehicles and buy your homeowners insurance with Progressive, the company will apply the homeownership, multi-car, and multi-policy discounts to your auto policy.

Some of the [best car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) discounts are the multi-car and multi-policy discounts. Insuring all your household vehicles and having your home, condo, or renters insurance with the same company can provide large bundling and multi-car discounts. Plus, it makes policy management and bill paying easier.

Progressive’s safe driver discount is its Snapshot telematics program. By allowing Progressive to track your driving habits through its Snapshot mobile app or plug-in device, you can earn average savings of $231 per year. But not everyone gets a discount — around 20% of Progressive drivers see a premium increase because of their risky driving behavior.
