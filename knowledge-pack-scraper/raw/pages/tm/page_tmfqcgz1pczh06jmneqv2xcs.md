## What kind of water damage can your homeowners insurance cover?
[Your homeowners insurance may cover water damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-water-damage/) to your basement, and damage to the personal property in your basement when:
  * **A pipe bursts** : Your insurance may pay to repair or replace the things that the water damaged in your basement, up to your coverage limit.
  * **A plumbing appliance overflows** : Sudden and unintentional leaks from a home appliance, like your washing machine or air conditioning unit, or accidental overflow of your bathtub, sink, or toilet may also be covered.


## What kind of flooding will your homeowners insurance NOT cover?
A typical homeowners policy won't cover any type of flooding related to:
  * **Weather events** : Storm surges, heavy rainwater, flash flooding, etc. won't typically be covered by a homeowners policy.
  * **Sump pump overflow or sewer backups** : While not typically covered by standard homeowners insurance, you may purchase an endorsement to your policy for [sump pump overflow and/or water backup coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-water-backup-coverage/).
  * **Maintenance** : Damage associated with maintenance issues such as wear and tear typically aren't covered.


### Is damage to your basement from groundwater covered?
Groundwater is naturally occurring water underground whose levels may increase after heavy rains or snow melts, which can be destructive to basements. However, your [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) typically won't cover damage from groundwater.
## Will additional flood insurance protect my basement?
You may be able to purchase a separate [flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) to protect your basement against water damage from outside flooding. Flood insurance may be essential if you [live in an area with a high risk of flooding](https://www.progressive.com/answers/am-i-in-a-flood-zone/). Understand that not all flood insurance policies include below-ground-level spaces, so check with your insurer to see how you're protected. You can, however, purchase separate flood insurance through the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or other private insurers](https://www.progressive.com/answers/private-flood-insurance-vs-nfip/).
## Can having a sump pump in my basement influence insurance coverage?
A sump pump may help minimize the risk of water damage from occurring in your basement. Some homeowners insurance companies offer a separate endorsement for discharge or overflow from a sump pump, which may cover the repairs to your damaged basement.
