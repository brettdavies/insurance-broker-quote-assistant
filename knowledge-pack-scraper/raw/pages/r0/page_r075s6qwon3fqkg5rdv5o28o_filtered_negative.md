#  Texas Umbrella Insurance Policy Facts
June 18, 2025
Umbrella Insurance is additional insurance that provides protection beyond present limits and coverages of other policies. It offers coverage for injuries, property damage, lawsuits, and personal liability situations. They also cover claims in excess of regular homeowners, auto, or watercrafts. Also, an Umbrella Policy covers other family members or household besides the policyholder.
Umbrella Insurance is not expensive! Mainly because you need to have active homeowner’s and auto insurance before an Umbrella Policy is issued. Hence, you get a discount on all policies. Umbrella policies are available in million-dollar increases, from $1 million to $5 million.
Umbrella insurance isn’t obligatory by law but is most often acquired by people who have a lot of assets to protect or a high possibility of being sued. If you are involved in some activity that puts you at greater risk of incurring excess liability, you’re an even better candidate for an umbrella policy.
With respect to your primary residence, it’s possible that at least part of this component of your net wealth need not be included when determining an appropriate level of umbrella coverage. This depends on the degree of protection under the homestead exemption2 for a given state of residence (intended to prevent the forced sale of a home to meet the demands of creditors).
* Farmers Insurance Exchange’s  _Special_ Personal Umbrella Policy, 56–5490, 3rd Edition, 9–2017
**“Business” Definition.** Nearly all personal umbrella policies exclude business-related activities of the insured. Some forms define the term succinctly, and others define it in an expansive manner by adding specificity to address as many situations as possible. The Farmers form stipulates that it includes any “part-time or full-time trade, profession or occupation.” Under this definition, any side jobs would likely qualify as a business (thus restricting coverage). The AAIS form is even more specific. It stipulates what constitutes business use and what does  _not_ constitute business use _._ The Allstate form does not consider any occasional or part-time work of an insured person under age 21 to be a business exposure (more expansive coverage).
**“Insured” Definition.** An “insured” is a commonly defined term in personal lines policies. Some forms, such as the AAIS form, simplify this process by stipulating an insured means all persons or entities covered by “underlying insurance,” with an exception pertaining to insureds under certain motorized vehicles or watercraft-related circumstances.
**Concealment or Fraud.** Most personal umbrella forms carry this condition, which states that coverage is void to all insureds if any insured has intentionally concealed or misrepresented a material fact. A “fact material to risk” is “a fact that may increase the risk and that, if disclosed, might induce the insurer either to decline to insure or to require a higher premium” (_Black’s Law Dictionary_, 11th ed.). Some forms (e.g., Nationwide) specify that the insurer may deny coverage if the named insured or any other insured has engaged in misrepresentation, concealment, or omission of any material fact or engaged in fraudulent conduct (narrow coverage). Conversely, other forms (e.g., Farmers) are not so strict and only deny coverage for “any insured who purposely conceals or misrepresents any fact or circumstances material to issuance, continuance or renewal of this insurance” (broader coverage). Thus, coverage could apply to innocent insureds. Be aware that state statutes sometimes necessitate the amendment of this provision.
**Policy Period/Policy Territory.** Most forms include a policy period provision. The State Farm policy stipulates that this policy applies only to a “loss which first occurs during the policy period shown on the declarations page.…” Some policies also include provisions concerning the policy territory. The ISO form specifies that coverage applies to “an ‘occurrence’ or offense which takes place anywhere in the world.” In contrast, the Markel form provides worldwide coverage, but the territory is restricted for uninsured and underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage to the policy territory defined in the UM/UIM coverage of the primary auto insurer listed in the umbrella schedule.
