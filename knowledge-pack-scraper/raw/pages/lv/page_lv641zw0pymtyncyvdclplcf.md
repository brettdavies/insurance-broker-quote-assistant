From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
State-run property insurance program in California
The **California FAIR Plan** (California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) is a fire insurance program created by the state of California that is used by property owners who cannot find private market insurance coverage.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-3) The FAIR Plan was established in August 1968 by a statutory amendment to the [California Insurance Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Insurance_Code "California Insurance Code") (specifically, section 10091 et seq.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-5)), and is regulated by the office of the [California Insurance Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Insurance_Commissioner "California Insurance Commissioner"). The plans are typically more expensive and provide less coverage than commercial plans.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-auto-6) If the FAIR Plan does not have the money to pay out all claims, it collects money from insurance companies that operate in California.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-auto-6)
According to data from 2020, the FAIR Plan covers 2.5% of the statewide market share, but 20.4% of the market share in ZIP codes at high risk from wildfires.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-7) Between 2020 and 2024, the number of homes covered by FAIR Plan policies more than doubled, while the Plan's total exposure (including commercial properties) nearly tripled.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-8) Between 2023 and 2024, the number of homes in the ZIP code affected by the January 2025 [Palisades fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Fire "Palisades Fire") covered by the FAIR Plan almost doubled.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-auto-6)
As of January 17, 2025, the FAIR Plan estimated that it covered 22% of the structures affected by the Palisades Fire, with a potential exposure upwards of $4 billion, and 12% of the structures affected by the Eaton Fire, with a potential exposure of over $775 million.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-ForbesJan18-9) As of January 10, 2025, it had only $377 million available to pay out claims, in addition to $5.75 billion in [reinsurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance "Reinsurance").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-10) However, FAIR can only access reinsurance after it has paid out $900 million in claims.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-ForbesJan18-9) To make up the shortfall, according to [Consumer Watchdog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Watchdog "Consumer Watchdog"), all California homeowners could face a $1,000 to $3,700 surcharge as FAIR can seek money from private insurers who would likely pass the charge to their customers.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan#cite_note-12)
