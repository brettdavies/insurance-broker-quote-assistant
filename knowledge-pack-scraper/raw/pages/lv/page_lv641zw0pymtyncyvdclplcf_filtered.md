State-run property insurance program in California

The **California FAIR Plan** (California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) is a fire insurance program created by the state of California that is used by property owners who cannot find private market insurance coverage.[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) The FAIR Plan was established in August 1968 by a statutory amendment to the [California Insurance Code](/wiki/California_Insurance_Code "California Insurance Code") (specifically, section 10091 et seq.[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)), and is regulated by the office of the [California Insurance Commissioner](/wiki/California_Insurance_Commissioner "California Insurance Commissioner"). The plans are typically more expensive and provide less coverage than commercial plans.[[6]](#cite_note-auto-6) If the FAIR Plan does not have the money to pay out all claims, it collects money from insurance companies that operate in California.[[6]](#cite_note-auto-6)

According to data from 2020, the FAIR Plan covers 2.5% of the statewide market share, but 20.4% of the market share in ZIP codes at high risk from wildfires.[[7]](#cite_note-7) Between 2020 and 2024, the number of homes covered by FAIR Plan policies more than doubled, while the Plan's total exposure (including commercial properties) nearly tripled.[[8]](#cite_note-8) Between 2023 and 2024, the number of homes in the ZIP code affected by the January 2025 [Palisades fire](/wiki/Palisades_Fire "Palisades Fire") covered by the FAIR Plan almost doubled.[[6]](#cite_note-auto-6)

As of January 17, 2025, the FAIR Plan estimated that it covered 22% of the structures affected by the Palisades Fire, with a potential exposure upwards of $4 billion, and 12% of the structures affected by the Eaton Fire, with a potential exposure of over $775 million.[[9]](#cite_note-ForbesJan18-9) As of January 10, 2025, it had only $377 million available to pay out claims, in addition to $5.75 billion in [reinsurance](/wiki/Reinsurance "Reinsurance").[[10]](#cite_note-10) However, FAIR can only access reinsurance after it has paid out $900 million in claims.[[9]](#cite_note-ForbesJan18-9) To make up the shortfall, according to [Consumer Watchdog](/wiki/Consumer_Watchdog "Consumer Watchdog"), all California homeowners could face a $1,000 to $3,700 surcharge as FAIR can seek money from private insurers who would likely pass the charge to their customers.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)
