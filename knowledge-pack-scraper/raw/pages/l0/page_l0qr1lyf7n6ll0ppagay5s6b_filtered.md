MONEYGEEK EXPERT TIP

With GEICO’s multi-policy discount, you can combine your renters and auto insurance and save money. Aside from bundling and the online payment discount, GEICO offers few opportunities to lower your costs other than lowering your coverage level.

## Which Coverage Types Does GEICO Offer?

Your [GEICO renters insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/) price can also depend on the type of coverage you choose. The insurer offers renters three additional coverage options, fewer than the industry average of seven.

GEICO provides common coverages for disasters and identity theft. Additionally, GEICO has a unique coverage to replace your personal belongings in a covered loss.

MoneyGeek reviewed GEICO’s three additional coverage options. Identity theft and disaster coverage are common, while the company’s replacement cost contents coverage is a rare add-on. Learn more about each coverage in the table below.

1. 1

   Replacement Cost Contents

   After a covered loss, GEICO pays you the cost of replacing your belongings versus their cash value, which is usually lower.
2. 2

   Disasters Coverage

   You can get extra coverage for natural disasters if you live in an area prone to floods or earthquakes.
3. 3

   Identity Theft Protection

   GEICO notifies you of high-risk transactions, tracks your credit profile and offers data protection software.

It’s vital for renters to know which [renters insurance coverages](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/what-is-renters-insurance-what-does-it-cover/) are included in their policies. Make sure your policy has personal liability and personal property protection, and coverage for medical payments and loss of use. These are standard coverages. If you need flood, earthquake or insect coverage, check the fine print to see if your policy includes these options.
