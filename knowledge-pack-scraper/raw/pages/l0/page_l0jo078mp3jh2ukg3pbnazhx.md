## How homeowners insurance covers foundation damage
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling/), or Coverage A on your [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/), may cover foundation damage caused by [covered perils](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/). If the foundation damage is due to negligence, your insurance won't cover the repair cost. It's your responsibility to take [preventive measures](https://hdfoundationrepair.com/prevent-foundation-damage/), such as keeping moisture from accumulating or tree roots from causing damage to the structure.
Covered perils include:
  * [Tornadoes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-tornado-damage/), windstorms, and [hailstorms](https://www.progressive.com/answers/hail-damage-home-insurance/)
  * [Lightning strikes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-lightning-strike-damage/)
  * Damage from [trees falling on your house](https://www.progressive.com/answers/tree-falls-on-house/)
  * Sudden and accidental [water damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-water-damage/) (such as from a burst pipe)
  * Vandalism
  * [Fire](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-fire/)


## Does home insurance cover foundation cracks or settling?
Generally, foundation cracks or settling aren't covered by your homeowners policy. Your home's foundation is protected under your policy's dwelling coverage, but only for certain perils/events. Most policies cover damage due to sudden and unexpected events like severe windstorms or fire, but won't cover damage that falls under the umbrella of routine home maintenance.
## Does home insurance cover foundation movement or sagging floors?
Foundation damage caused by shifting or settling earth or sagging floors caused by rotting floor joists are typically not covered by homeowners insurance. If the damage is caused by flooding or an earthquake, you'll typically require separate coverage from homeowners insurance.
Pro tip:
Homeowners policies generally won’t cover foundation [damage from earthquakes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-earthquakes/) or [damage from flooding](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-water-damage/). Depending on your location, you may be able to purchase a separate [flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) or earthquake policy.
## What are the signs of foundation damage?
There will be [obvious signs](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/foundations/reviews/bad-foundation-signs) if you have a foundation problem, including:
  * Cracks in the basement walls and interior walls
  * Doors that don't close properly
  * Slanted floors
  * Moisture in the basement
  * Exterior wall cracks
  * Interior wall or floor cracks
  * Sagging floors
  * Mold or mildew smell


If you spot any of these issues, it's recommended to have your home examined by an expert.
Repairing a foundation can be expensive, so it may be worth investing in annual or bi-annual inspections to catch issues before they become catastrophic events. To maintain optimal moisture levels around your home's foundation, consider these tips:
  1. Water the soil around your property, at dawn and dusk, for 30 minutes
  2. Check moisture levels using a gauge or meter to make sure the soil isn't too wet or dry
  3. Direct water away from the home with gutters, downspouts, and perimeter drains


## What causes foundation damage?
Your home's foundation is one of the structure's most critical components and can suffer damage over time due to a variety of factors. Because your home's foundation sits in direct contact with the ground, many environmental factors can cause damage, including temperature changes, poor drainage around the home, water buildup, tree roots, extreme weather conditions, erosion, and inferior construction.
