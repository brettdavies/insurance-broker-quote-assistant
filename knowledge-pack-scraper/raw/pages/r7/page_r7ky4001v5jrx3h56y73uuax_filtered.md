# Catalytic converter theft

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

We share theft statistics and ways to help prevent your catalytic converter from being stolen.

With the right tools, thieves can steal a catalytic converter within minutes. Due to the location of the catalytic converter on the vehicle and the high value of some minerals inside the converter, this type of theft started to rise in 2020. Catalytic converter theft is a concern for vehicle owners across the U.S. as thieves continue to target this vital part of the exhaust system for quick financial gain.

### Key takeaways

* High-risk vehicles for theft include trucks, SUVs, sedans and hybrids.
* Models like the Toyota Prius and Ford F-Series are top targets.
* Catalytic converter theft deterrents include anti-theft devices and engraving your VIN.
* Comprehensive coverage on your auto policy may pay for a catalytic converter theft claim.

## What is a catalytic converter?

A catalytic converter is a component of a vehicle's exhaust system designed to help reduce harmful emissions. It plays a crucial role in transforming pollutants into less harmful gases by converting toxic gases like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide into carbon dioxide and water vapor before they are released into the atmosphere. This function makes it an essential part of modern vehicles.

## Why are catalytic converters being stolen?

Because the catalytic converter contains precious metals, thieves may be tempted to steal it. A single ounce of platinum, palladium or rhodium used in catalytic converters can fetch anywhere from [hundreds to thousands of dollars](https://www.metalsdaily.com/live-prices/pgms/). While there are only small amounts of the precious metals in each catalytic converter, it's still enough to make it a major target for theft.

## Catalytic converter cost

Catalytic converter prices can range anywhere between $200 and $2,500. The price varies due to your car’s make and model, the quality of the catalytic converter and the type of catalytic converter you’ll need.

## Catalytic converter theft statistics

While catalytic converter thefts were rising in 2020 and 2021, recent [State Farm® auto claim data](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-sees-74-percent-drop-in-catalytic-converter-thefts/) reflects a decline in the past two years. State Farm noted a 74% drop in catalytic converter theft claims for the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The declining thefts may be credited to a combination of factors, [according to a recent Carfax report](https://www.carfax.com/blog/catalytic-converter-theft). Cooperation between authorities, new state laws that hold merchants liable for sourcing precious metals and the declining values of those precious metals inside catalytic converters may be factors in the decline.

### Where are catalytic converters stolen?

While catalytic converter thefts have seen an overall decline, geography has an impact. According to [State Farm data](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-sees-74-percent-drop-in-catalytic-converter-thefts/), the top states for reported theft claims include California, Illinois, New York, Texas and Florida.

## Most common vehicles targeted for catalytic converter theft

According to Carfax's 2024 analysis, certain vehicle models are more commonly targeted for catalytic converter theft nationwide. The most stolen catalytic converters often come from the following vehicles:

* **Trucks** — larger vehicles, like the Ford F-Series trucks, are prime targets because their high ground clearance can make the catalytic converter easily accessible without the need for jacks or special equipment.
* **SUVs** — like trucks, SUVs, such as the Honda CR-V and the Ford Explorer, have higher ground clearance, which can make catalytic converters easier for thieves to access quickly. Additionally, SUVs often have larger engines, meaning their catalytic converters may contain more of the precious metals thieves seek.
* **Sedans** — while sedans, like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, have lower ground clearance, they are still frequently targeted due to their popularity and the sheer number of these vehicles on the road. Thieves are often familiar with these models and can remove catalytic converters efficiently.
* **Hybrid vehicles** — hybrid vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius, are among the most valuable targets. Because hybrid engines run cleaner than traditional engines, the catalytic converters in hybrids contain higher quantities of precious metals like platinum, palladium and rhodium.

Each vehicle type presents unique advantages for thieves, whether it's accessibility, the size of the converter or the value of the materials inside. Understanding these factors can help vehicle owners take extra precautions to help protect their cars from being included among the most stolen catalytic converters.

## Options to help prevent catalytic converter theft

While protecting your car is likely already a priority, consider taking extra precautions when it comes to your catalytic converter. Catalytic converter [theft prevention](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft) requires a combination of techniques, including parking in well-lit areas or garages, installing anti-theft devices — like [catalytic converter cages](https://www.bar.ca.gov/consumer/smog-check-program/catalytic-converter-theft) or clamps — and engraving your vehicle's VIN number on the converter. Additional catalytic converter theft protection options, such as physical barriers like steel bars or shields, can make the part inaccessible to thieves who don’t own specific industrial-grade cutting tools. These methods may help deter thieves and reduce the risk of theft, offering practical ways to help stop catalytic converter theft.

## Does insurance typically cover catalytic converter theft?

In some cases, claims for catalytic converter theft may be covered with auto insurance policies that have [comprehensive coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage). However, [coverage and deductibles](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) can vary depending on your provider and policy details. Consider contacting your insurance agent to check if your current policy offers coverage for catalytic converter theft and to gain their helpful [tips for auto insurance claims](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident).

## What to do if your catalytic converter is stolen

* **File a police report** — report the theft to the police right away. Having a police report on file may be required by your insurance company.
* **Contact your insurance company** — after reporting the theft, get in touch with your insurance provider. If you're a State Farm customer, you can also use the [State Farm mobile app](/customer-care/download-mobile-apps/state-farm-mobile-app). Your agent can help with questions you may have regarding your policy and assist with filing a claim.
* **Repair your vehicle** — visit a mechanic to replace the catalytic converter. Replacement costs can vary, depending on factors like location, parts and labor.

Following these steps may help you recover from the theft and reduce future risks. If you have any questions concerning car insurance policies don’t hesitate to reach out to your [local State Farm agent](/agent/).
