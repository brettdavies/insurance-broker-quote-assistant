Here’s a rundown of other coverage options from State Farm and Geico.

| Coverage | State Farm | Geico |

| Accident forgiveness | No | yes |
| New car replacement | No | No |

## State Farm vs. Geico: Price

[Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163) has the advantage on [price](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance/): Monthly premiums for full coverage average $164 with Geico, according to [Bankrate data](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/#factors-that-impact-cost-of-car-insurance), well below both State Farm’s $219 a month and national average of $193 per month. Its low rates  landed Geico on our list of [best low-cost insurers](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-companies/).

## State Farm vs. Geico: Discounts

Discounts can significantly lower your premiums and should definitely be considered when pricing a policy. Not all discounts are available in all states, however, and some may not be combined.

Both companies have [usage-based insurance discounts](https://www.cnbc.com/select/safe-driving-discounts-how-do-they-work/) that reward good driving habits. But [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d)’s Drive Safe & Save can earn you 30% off, while [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163)’s DriveEasy can only save drivers up to 25%.

In addition, DriveEasy is available in fewer states and poor scoring can result in your rates increasing.   
  
Geico does have a [military discount](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-military/) that could be worth up to 15% off, as well as lower rate options for teachers, federal employees and members of certain organizations.

## State Farm vs. Geico: Customer service

[State Farm](https://bankrate.com/landing/select/best-auto-insurance-options/?mf_ct_campaign=cnbc-statefarm-personal-auto-spl-lp&amp;product-name=State+Farm+Personal+Auto+Insurance&amp;s1=107217919) comes out on top for customer satisfaction: It was among the top three insurers in six out of the 11 regions surveyed in [J.D. Power’s 2024 auto insurance study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study). It came in fourth place out of 17 in a separate survey on [insurance shopping](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-shopping-study) and fifth out of 24 for [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study).

[Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163), meanwhile, rated below average in most regions in J.D. Power’s auto insurance study and scored poorly in the surveys on insurance shopping and claims satisfaction.

According to [the National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&amp;amp;COCODE=25143&amp;amp;:refresh), State Farm received an average number of complaints for a provider of its size. However, it received a C- from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/us/il/bloomington/profile/insurance-companies/state-farm-insurance-company-0724-6000391) which cited unresolved complaints.  
  
Geico also received the average number of complaints but received an A+ from the [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/us/md/chevy-chase/profile/insurance-companies/geico-0241-8768), the organization’s highest grade.

Both State Farm and Geico earned an A++ (Superior) for financial strength from [A.M. Best](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-are-am-best-ratings/), the agency’s highest grade and a strong indicator of their ability to pay out on policyholders’ claims.

## State Farm vs. Geico: Which is better?

Choosing the right auto insurance depends on your priorities: [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) has a much stronger record with customer service and additional coverage options Geico doesn’t, like rideshare insurance and payoff protection (a form of [gap insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-gap-insurance/)).

If you’re looking to save money, though, Geico’s shines brighter. Its average rates are lower in just about every category, especially for [teens](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-young-adults/) and drivers with [bad credit](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/).

The best way to decide between insurers is to get quotes for the same coverage and compare premiums and discounts to see which is the better fit.
