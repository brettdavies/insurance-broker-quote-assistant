* Erie is the [cheapest car insurance company](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#company "#company"), with an average rate of $43 per month for minimum coverage.

* Rates increase by an average of 50% if you [cause a car accident](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#accident "#accident") and by 85% [after a DUI](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#dui "#dui").
Where you live affects how much you'll pay for car insurance. Prices differ based on your state, city and even ZIP code, but not by the [color of your car](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/do-red-cars-cost-more-insure "Do Red Cars Really Cost More to Insure?"). You might pay less for car insurance if you live in an area with well-maintained roads or more if your state has high coverage minimums, as in [Michigan](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#expensive "#expensive").

A [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest and Best Full Coverage Car Insurance") policy costs two and a half times as much as minimum coverage, on average. But full coverage includes liability protection (to pay for property damage to other cars and injuries to other people) and comprehensive and collision coverage (to pay for damage to your car).

By switching companies, you could keep the same amount of coverage and still save hundreds of dollars per year.
Drivers with a history of drunk driving should consider getting [free car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies.

You can start by using a [free online car insurance calculator](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/estimate-car-insurance "How to Estimate Your Car Insurance: Car Insurance Calculator"). But the only way to find the cheapest and best car insurance for you is to shop around for options and get prices.
To find the best car insurance for you, always [comparison shop online](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") or talk to an insurance agent or broker.
Alternatively, you can talk to an insurance agent or [insurance broker](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-broker "Are Car Insurance Brokers Worth It?") who can help you find the best combination of price and fit. Agents and brokers get a commission from the insurance companies when they send a new customer. Independent agents work for multiple insurance companies and can compare among them, while captive agents work for only one insurance company.
The cheapest major insurance companies are Auto-Owners, Erie, State Farm and USAA. [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is widely available and a good choice for most people. Auto-Owners and Erie are only available in certain states. USAA is often the cheapest, but it's only available to those in the military and their families.
An 18-year-old driver pays an average of $223 per month for their own minimum-coverage policy. Young drivers who are [on their parents' insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens and Their Parents") will pay less than that.
