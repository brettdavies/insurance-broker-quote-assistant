## How much car insurance costs by age

[Young drivers will pay more for car insurance](/18-year-old-car-insurance "Average Cost of Car Insurance for 18-Year-Olds") because rates are affected by the driver's age and years behind the wheel.

Younger, less experienced drivers tend to take more risks and get in more accidents behind the wheel, which is why they have higher auto insurance rates.

An 18-year-old driver pays two and a half times as much for auto insurance as a 30-year-old driver.

Average car insurance costs can drop quickly between the ages of 18 and 25, as insurance companies see older drivers as both less risky and less likely to file a claim. Average insurance rates drop a little bit each year between ages 25 and 55.

[![Average car insurance quotes for young drivers age 18 to 35](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto/full-coverage-age-d_zqeku7)](#ages "Car insurance by age")

**Why do men have more expensive car insurance?**

Insurance companies often charge young men higher rates than young women because they're more likely to file claims. Young men are more likely to:

1. Drive more often
2. Get more speeding tickets
3. Get in more accidents
4. Get more DUIs

A few states prevent insurance companies from using gender when setting auto insurance prices. This means that male, female and nonbinary drivers in these states will pay the same rates for car insurance, if all other factors are equal.

* Hawaii
* Massachusetts

* Michigan
* Montana

## Average cost of car insurance after an accident

The average insurance rate after you cause a car accident is $262 per month. That's 49% more than with a clean driving record.

Every car insurance company will change your rates differently after a crash. With State Farm, rates increase by only 15% after a crash. Geico has the biggest cost increase, going up by 72% for a driver with one at-fault accident on their record.

Car insurance prices are based on risk, and a driver with a history of accidents typically pays more for car insurance because they are more likely to get in another crash in the future.

North Carolina has the largest increase in rates, with prices more than quadrupling after a DUI. For Texas drivers, rates only increase 40% after a DUI.

Insurance companies generally charge drivers with a DUI history higher rates because of the higher chance of causing an accident in the future.

## How much does car insurance cost for drivers with good credit?

The average cost of car insurance is 49% less for drivers with a good credit history compared to drivers with poor credit.

If you have good credit, State Farm offers the best overall rate and best discounts.

If you have poor credit, consider Erie or Farm Bureau, which have cheap prices, and avoid Farmers and State Farm, which charge much more for people with bad credit.

Drivers with good credit have a lower risk of filing claims, according to insurance companies. As a result, they can get cheaper auto insurance rates.

## What other factors can affect average car insurance costs?

The factors that have the biggest impact on your car insurance rates are:

* Company
* State
* Policy coverage

* Age
* Vehicle type
* Accident, insurance claim and credit history

Other factors that can affect your car insurance costs are:

1. Driving experience
2. Address and ZIP code
3. How long you've had car insurance

1. Annual mileage
2. Discounts

**Driving experience**: Age affects your car insurance cost, but so does the number of years you've been insured and driving. A 30-year-old who's had an insurance policy and been licensed since they were 16 should get cheaper car insurance prices than a 30-year-old who just started driving.

**Location within a state**: Within a state, insurance companies consider certain locations to be higher risk. If you live in an area that has more traffic, car crashes, weather damage or crime, you may pay more than the same driver living elsewhere.

**Insurance history**: If you've had continuous auto insurance coverage for three years or more, your insurance company will usually charge a lower rate.

**Claims history**: A clean driving record means you'll get cheaper rates than someone who has filed auto insurance claims in the past.

**Mileage**: Cars that are driven less often are less likely to be involved in a crash or other damaging event. Vehicles with lower annual mileage may qualify for slightly lower rates.

**Discounts**: Auto insurance companies offer discounts if you take steps to become a safer driver or demonstrate responsible behavior. For example, adults can take defensive driving lessons, while teen drivers can qualify for good student discounts.

## How much does auto insurance cost for me?

You can start by using a [free online car insurance calculator](/auto-insurance/estimate-car-insurance "How to Estimate Your Car Insurance: Car Insurance Calculator"). But the only way to find the cheapest and best car insurance for you is to shop around for options and get prices.

The cost of your policy will depend on factors like your car, age, gender and location.

![icon of insurance policy](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_80/static/icons/insurance)

To find the best car insurance for you, always [comparison shop online](/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") or talk to an insurance agent or broker.

When you **shop for car insurance online**, make sure you're comparing policies with the same amount of coverage and the same features to make an apples-to-apples comparison between companies.

Alternatively, you can talk to an insurance agent or [insurance broker](/auto-insurance-broker "Are Car Insurance Brokers Worth It?") who can help you find the best combination of price and fit. Agents and brokers get a commission from the insurance companies when they send a new customer. Independent agents work for multiple insurance companies and can compare among them, while captive agents work for only one insurance company.

## Frequently asked questions

### What's the average cost of car insurance per month?

The national average cost of insurance is $69 per month for minimum coverage or $175 per month for full coverage. Your rate will vary based on where you live, what kind of coverage you have and your driving history.

### What is the cheapest car insurance company?

The cheapest major insurance companies are Auto-Owners, Erie, State Farm and USAA. [State Farm](/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is widely available and a good choice for most people. Auto-Owners and Erie are only available in certain states. USAA is often the cheapest, but it's only available to those in the military and their families.

### How much more expensive is full coverage car insurance?

Depending on your car and driving history, full coverage insurance is typically two to three times the cost of minimum liability-only coverage. This includes collision coverage, which pays for damage to your car in a crash, and comprehensive coverage, which covers other forms of damage like hail.

### Is $200 a lot for car insurance?

Paying $200 per month is a little higher than average for car insurance. Nine states have average rates for full coverage that are higher than $200 per month, and no state has average rates that high for minimum coverage. But drivers with recent tickets or accidents on their records will likely pay that amount or more.

### Does my car insurance cost go down after my car is paid off?

No. Your car insurance rates are not determined by how much you still owe on your car. However, once your car is paid off, you can drop gap coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage. This will lower your rates, but you'll have less coverage if your car is damaged.

### How much does car insurance cost for a beginner?

An 18-year-old driver pays an average of $223 per month for their own minimum-coverage policy. Young drivers who are [on their parents' insurance](/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens and Their Parents") will pay less than that.

## Methodology

We collected quotes across all 50 states and the District of Columbia for 40 insurance companies, except where noted. Quotes are for a 30-year-old man with good credit who drives a 2015 Honda Civic EX.
