[ ![Screenshot of the NAIC Database search page showing the Consumer Insurance Search Results interface — a free online tool to verify any U.S. insurance company’s licensing and regulatory status.](https://thedatabasesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/naic-database-cover-696x365.webp) ](https://thedatabasesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/naic-database-cover.webp)The NAIC Database, managed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), enables users to check the licensing status and regulatory information of any U.S. insurance company. Source: thedatabasesearch.com.
If you require good facts on U.S. insurance companies, the **NAIC Database** is one of the best public resources you’ve likely never heard about. Accessible to everyone at no cost and without registration, and packed with detailed reports, the NAIC Consumer Information Source (CIS) is a bonanza for consumers, analysts, and journalists.
Here we shall dispel myths of what NAIC is, how one should utilize the database, and why they need it. We’ll walk you through real-life examples and highlight common search inquiries like “**What is NAIC SAP?** ” and “**How do I find NAIC?** “. Whether you’re filing a complaint, looking up an insurance firm, or analyzing trends, this database is yours to use.
## What Is the NAIC and What Does It Stand For?
**NAIC** stands for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Established in 1871, this not-for-profit company was formed by insurance regulators from all of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories. The association creates model laws, coordinates regulation, and offers strong data tools to facilitate transparency in the insurance marketplace.
The most useful public tool of the organization is the **Consumer Information Source (CIS)** or NAIC Database.
## What Is the NAIC Database?
The **NAIC Database** , also known as the [Consumer Information Source (CIS)](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm), allows access to publicly available information on insurance companies conducting business in the U.S. The system offers a complete overview of company licensure, complaint trends, contact information, and other compliance indicators.
  * **Free to use**
  * **No registration required**
  * **Publicly accessible**


This makes it an indispensable resource for:
  * Policyholders checking if their insurer is licensed in their state
  * Journalists investigating complaint histories
  * Analysts tracking complaint trends and licensing patterns
  * Regulators cross-referencing public information


For an in-depth comparison of insurance providers and how to interpret their public records, refer to our guide: [Consumer Insurance Search: Your Essential Guide to Finding Reliable Insurance Companies](https://thedatabasesearch.com/finance-databases/consumer-insurance-search-guide/).
## How to Find and Use the NAIC Database
You can access the NAIC Database directly at [naic.org/cis](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm). Using the search tool is straightforward and intuitive.
[![](https://thedatabasesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/naic-database-consumer-insurance-search-screenshot-1024x528.webp)](https://thedatabasesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/naic-database-consumer-insurance-search-screenshot.webp)

### Search Options Include:
  * **Company Name** – Input the exact or partial legal name of the insurer.
  * **NAIC Company Code** – If you have the specific numeric code, this will give precise results.
  * **State** – Use the dropdown to filter companies licensed in a specific state.
  * **Insurance Type** – Select from the dropdown (e.g., life, health, auto, property).


### Information You Can Access:
Once you search for a company, the results page provides:
  * **Company Name**
  * **Company Website**
  * **Insurance Types Offered**
  * **States Licensed In**
  * **General Contact and Company Details**


If available, a clickable “**Click for Report Options** ” link will appear next to the listing. This opens a window with the following detailed reports:
  * **Complaint Code Report**
  * **Complaint State Report**
  * **Complaint Trend Report**
  * **Licensing Report**


If you want to learn how consumer complaint databases can reveal deeper business insights, explore our article on the [CFPB Complaint Database](https://thedatabasesearch.com/finance-databases/cfpb-complaint-database-guide/).
### Exporting Data
At the bottom of the results table, users can download data using the icon to the left of the “Share” button. Export formats include:
  * **Image**
  * **Data (CSV)**
  * **CrossTab (Excel)**
  * **PDF**
  * **PowerPoint**


## What Is NAIC SAP?
Another widely searched term is “**NAIC SAP** ,” or **Statutory Accounting Principles**. These are NAIC-developed accounting principles for use by insurance companies only.
Whereas GAAP is used for basic financial reporting, SAP deals with solvency—ensuring insurers have enough capital to meet policyholder claims.
SAP is:
  * Required by state insurance regulators
  * Focused on conservative estimates of assets and liabilities
  * Integrated into the NAIC’s regulatory framework


Understanding SAP is crucial for analysts, auditors, and institutional investors who need to assess the financial strength and risk exposure of insurers.
## Real-World Example: Checking an Auto Insurer’s Complaint Record
Let’s say you’re considering buying an auto policy from a lesser-known provider. Here’s how you’d use the NAIC Database:
  1. Visit [naic.org/cis](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm)
  2. Type in the **company name** or select **“Auto”** under “Insurance Type”
  3. Choose your **state** (e.g., California)
  4. Click **Search**
  5. From the results, click “**Click for Report Options** “
  6. Select the **Complaint Trend Report**


This report shows historical data about the number and nature of complaints filed against the company, broken down by issue type and resolution.
If complaint ratios are significantly above average, that might be a red flag. Conversely, a clean trend report with consistent licensing and no major issues can provide peace of mind.
For a broader look at how public datasets like ERISA can be used similarly to assess financial reliability, check out: [How to Use Free ERISA and Actually Find What You Need](https://thedatabasesearch.com/finance-databases/how-to-use-free-erisa/).
## Who Should Use the NAIC Database?
  * **Consumers** researching prospective or existing insurers
  * **Journalists** verifying regulatory compliance
  * **Policy analysts** examining market behaviors
  * **Legal professionals** working on insurance litigation
  * **Government agencies** assessing public records


Its utility spans far beyond casual browsing—this is a regulatory-grade research tool available to the public.
## Practical Tips for Power Users
  * **Use the NAIC Company Code** when available for faster, more accurate searches.
  * Always download a **PDF or Excel** version of the report for documentation purposes.
  * Combine **Complaint Trend Reports** with **Licensing Reports** for a broader understanding of company practices.
  * Cross-check with [state insurance departments](https://content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments) for local actions.


## Final Thoughts: Why the NAIC Database Matters
Insurance is a trust-based business. Policyholders must rely on insurers to fulfill promises that may not come due for years. The NAIC Database provides a critical lens into how insurers actually perform—well beyond marketing claims.
In an era where transparency and data access are increasingly essential, the **NAIC Consumer Information Source** sets a high standard for public accountability. It is a rare example of a government-affiliated tool that is not only free, but genuinely useful.
