# IMS Markets

Let the power of 16 state associations help you get access to even more programs.

Independent Market Solutions (IMS) was established in 2017 with the goal of creating greater market access for member agents. In 2019, Independent Insurance Agents of Texas made the investment to be a part of IMS and, since that time, we have grown market availability in Texas to include many of their participating carriers that offer personal, commercial, and various specialty lines.

**Our current carrier partners include:**

* [Attune Small Commercial](https://www.attuneinsurance.com/)
* [CNA Surety](https://www.iiat.org/get-markets-1/markets-for-your-clients/commercial-lines/cna-surety)

* [Progressive Auto](https://www.progressive.com/auto/)
* [Semsee](https://www.iiat.org/get-markets-1/markets-for-your-clients/ims-markets/semsee)

* Little or no premium volume requirements for most programs
* Competitive commissions
* 100% Ownership of expirations
* Ability to “graduate” to a direct appointment available where available
