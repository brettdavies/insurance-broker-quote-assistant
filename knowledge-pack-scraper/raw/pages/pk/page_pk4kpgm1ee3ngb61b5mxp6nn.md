#  State Farm cancelled umbrella policy after 30 years 
[ Home Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)
So I obtained a $1M umbrella policy in 1995 when I purchased a house with a pool. 30 years later, I'm remarried and in a home that has my wife on the deed and homeowners. I still have auto and personal property with SF. I just got a notice that my umbrella policy is being cancelled. They claim it's because I don't have renters or homeowners with them. I haven't had either in over 4 years, since I moved in with my wife and hold my house. 
Would the best move be to get an umbrella on my wife's homeowners, or is a $1M umbrella available "a la carte" from any insurance provider? I don't want to go through the whole quiz procedure on websites just for them to say "we don't offer this." 
This is in Gwinnett County, GA 
Thanks!

Either option is viable. 
Don't go through websites to get quotes though. Call a local independent agent or two and ask if they have a market for "stand alone" [umbrella policies](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=stand+alone+umbrella+policies&cId=7e11a207-2cab-4ca5-bd2d-d84601ae71c7&iId=faaf0531-a3fa-4756-a0a4-bbf5376970bb).

I would suggest you definitely at least consider whoever is your home insurer. If the same insurer has both policies, if there is ever a loss and both need to be involved you don't have the risk of them pointing at each other as an excuse for not living up to their obligations. You may also get a multi-policy discount. Does not mean you have to go with them, but you should at least consider them. While you are looking at this, maybe you should shop your auto as well since [State Farm](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+umbrella+policy+cancellation&cId=a32a701b-6a28-40e6-8a07-32fa29761f6a&iId=c5be5e32-60b4-4470-9d1c-9757c563e964) is being difficult. Why do business with people that pull that kind of crap? 30 year is also a while to be with one company. Always good to do a price check every once in a while. Good luck.

Yep. Same reason I often advise that people don't shop at companies who contract out their product. Inevitably, the customer-facing company and the contractor will point fingers at one another when something goes wrong!

no, they aren't pulling "crap". he doesn't even have a residential policy with his name on it. no company should accept that, as an Umbrella policy covers the excess liability when the underlying auto/home liability limits are exhausted due to a claim. you have to have underlying auto and residential insurance with your name on it in order to be eligible for an umbrella policy. whether it is with state farm or not, they would accept it (unless you are ineligible due to liability claims, credit, etc). State Farm just requires that you have underlying auto/home in general. it doesn't have to be with them. regardless, depending on the state, State Farm is not offering new umbrella policies at this time.

Most companies at least want you to have auto with them. Some won't offer an umbrella unless you have the home and auto with them. 
As others have said, an independent agent should have some viable options for you.

A lot of the bigger carriers are going with policies basically saying you have to have home and auto to get an umbrella.

Most independent agents have options for standalone umbrella products and can assist you. However, it's also worth having a look at moving everything from State Farm. There are much better policy options out there.

I believe State Farm is one of the better companies when it comes to paid claims. I know everyone has anecdotes about every company, but they take a pretty big underwriting loss on fire policies. I could see them losing on other factors though, especially service if you get a poor agent. And their system stability is rough. 
What companies would you recommend?

You should use an insurance broker who has access to lots of different companies (not a captive agent who can only help you with 1 company), you tell them what you want as far as coverages and give them your info and they shop all the major insurances and a bunch of lesser known insurances (that don't spend members premiums on commercials) for you without an agent dropping your coverage to come in at the lowest price.

You need underlying coverage for some sort of property policy for most companies to write an umbrella. You’re living somewhere. Nobody’s home liability exposure is zero. 
You could honestly resolve this by writing a $100/yr renters policy through State Farm. If you’re not on the deed, it’s compliant to write a renters policy in most states.

If you can’t find a solution to your umbrella maybe you can increase your limits to $1 million on your car. You’d be $100 or $250k short depending on your underlying auto limit but better than nothing. Short more if you have split vs combined single limits.

I'm an insurance broker that specializes in umbrella, and there's good standalone options these days. There's a website out there that will show you sample policies and prices across a lot of providers, which is really valuable for umbrella since reading the policy is important I think. 
Personally I find that a lot better than calling a bunch of brokers, since brokers usually don't want to deal with a client who just wants to move an umbrella policy only, and brokers are often unfamiliar with the umbrella policy details.

I’m an independent agent. All of our standalone umbrella’s require some type of property liability as the underlying. Whether that be Renters or homeowners. A couple of options. You could either take out a renters policy, with minimum contents and 300K in liability, or get added onto your wife’s home policy. If you guys have not combined your insurance, would advise to do so. Unless you or your wife have bad claims experience or low insurance score, you’re going to get better rates when you combine all your vehicles on 1 policy, then bundle that with the home. Insurance carriers give better rates to husband/wife households, multi-car discounts. Then, whichever carrier you guys go with on those, add the umbrella. That way you AND her would fall under the umbrella as well. One thing to be leery of with some standalone umbrella’s, they may exclude the pool exposure. So if that’s the route you go, ask about that before placing

Call your agent. Much more than likely, if you provide proof that you have home coverage in force, you can keep the umbrella.

Are you sure 1 million is enough for your umbrella in the first place. If you started at 1 million 30 years ago, seems like you would need more by now.

Contact your State Farm agent! Underwriting may just need to confirm the homeowners policy with another carrier has the correct liability limits to qualify for a PLUP. I’ve seen customers get this notice and submitting a dec page is enough to rescind the cancellation. I can’t say for certain because each state has different requirements but it’s worth the phone call, if you haven’t already done so.
