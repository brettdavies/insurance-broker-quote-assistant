# State Farm cancelled umbrella policy after 30 years

[Home Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)

So I obtained a $1M umbrella policy in 1995 when I purchased a house with a pool. 30 years later, I'm remarried and in a home that has my wife on the deed and homeowners. I still have auto and personal property with SF. I just got a notice that my umbrella policy is being cancelled. They claim it's because I don't have renters or homeowners with them. I haven't had either in over 4 years, since I moved in with my wife and hold my house.

Would the best move be to get an umbrella on my wife's homeowners, or is a $1M umbrella available "a la carte" from any insurance provider? I don't want to go through the whole quiz procedure on websites just for them to say "we don't offer this."

This is in Gwinnett County, GA

Thanks!
