New California law requires an increase in the minimum limits of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage for any private passenger autos, commercial business or recreational vehicles. The law, [Senate Bill 1107](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1107), goes into effect on January 1, 2025.
The new law increases the minimum limits for coverages related to the liability portion of your auto insurance policy. This includes uninsured motor vehicle coverage. The new **minimum** liability limits will increase to 30,000/60,000/15,000***** beginning January 1, 2025. All existing policies with lower limits will renew at the new minimum limits on or after January 1, 2025, as mandated by this new state law. If your coverages are increased to comply with the new minimum requirements, there could be an impact on your premium.
***What do the three numbers mean?**
The numbers 30/60/15 represent the monetary limits of your [liability coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage) shown on your declarations page:
* The first number, 30 or $30,000, is the maximum coverage for **bodily injury liability for one person** injured in one accident.
* The second number, 60 or $60,000 is the maximum coverage for **bodily injury liability for all persons** injured in one accident.
* The third number, 15 or $15,000 is the maximum coverage for **property damage liability** in one accident.
