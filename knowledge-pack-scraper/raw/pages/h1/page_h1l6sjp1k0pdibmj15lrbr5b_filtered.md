Most states require your child, whether a provisional or newly licensed driver, to have car insurance coverage.

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

Since teens are too young to sign contracts or buy insurance, adding them to your policy is the best way to cover them.

## When to Add Your Child to Your Car Insurance Policy

You need to add your teen to your car insurance policy when they receive their learner's permit. Even those with provisional licenses need financial protection. Adding your teen to your policy makes sure they meet legal requirements.

#### Coverage for Learner's Permits vs. Full Licenses

The timing and requirements differ depending on whether your teen has a learner's permit or full license:

![vsDocuments icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/vs-documents_ujnzcc.svg)

Learner's Permit Coverage

+ Most insurers automatically cover permit holders under your existing policy during supervised driving.
+ Some states require you to formally add permit holders as listed drivers.
+ While permit holders may be covered under your existing policy during supervised driving, you should always inform your insurance company if a teen is learning to drive in your vehicle.
+ If you don't notify your insurer and your teen has an accident, your claim could be denied.

![vsDocuments icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/vs-documents_ujnzcc.svg)

Full License Requirements

+ If your child has a driver's license, lives in your household and drives a car registered at your address, they'll need to be added to your car insurance policy.
+ This becomes legally required once they receive their provisional or full license.
+ Failure to add them can result in claim denials or policy cancellation.

![locationPin icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/location_pin_ubfsub.svg)

STATE RISK ALERT SYSTEMS

Some states, like [Florida](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-florida/), provide insurance carriers with risk alert reports. These reports advise insurers of any licensed drivers who list the insured's address on their driver's license.

After receiving risk alert reports, carriers usually reach out to policyholders and request one of the following:

* The unlisted driver should be added to the policy.
* Proof that the unlisted driver is insured elsewhere.
* Proof that the unlisted driver resides elsewhere.

### How to Add Your Child to Your Car Insurance Policy

Adding your teen to the family car insurance plan requires preparation and careful consideration. Here's your complete step-by-step guide:

1. 1

   Preparation Checklist

   Before contacting your insurer, gather this essential information:

   **Teen's Personal Information**:

   * Full legal name
   * Date of birth
   * Driver's license details (number and issuance date)
   * Social Security number
   * Any driving history, including accidents or traffic tickets

   **Vehicle Information (if applicable)**:

   * Vehicle identification number (VIN)
   * Year, make, model, and trim level
   * Safety features and anti-theft devices
   * Current mileage

   **Documentation for Discounts**:

   * Recent report cards or transcripts (for good student discounts)
   * Driver's education course completion certificates
   * School enrollment verification (for distant student discounts)
2. 2

   Review Your Current Coverage

   Before adding your child, review your current policy terms to understand what additional coverage you might need. Consider whether your current [liability limits](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage/) provide adequate financial protection for a higher-risk driver.
3. 3

   Contact Your Insurance Company

   Call your insurer or agent to add your new driver. If available, you can also use your insurer's online portal or mobile app. Provide all the necessary information and ask about discounts for good grades or driver's education courses.
4. 4

   Vehicle Assignment Decision

   Your insurer will ask which car your teen will drive most often, as this affects your insurance cost. Consider:

   * Designating your teen as the secondary driver on an existing vehicle (typically less expensive)
   * Which family vehicle is safest and most appropriate for a new driver
   * Whether you're adding a new vehicle specifically for your teen
5. 5

   Explore Coverage Options and Adjustments

   Work with your insurer to determine the best coverage for your teen:

   * Consider their driving habits and your budget
   * Evaluate whether to adjust deductibles to balance higher premiums
   * Discuss additional coverages like roadside assistance for young drivers

   Request a detailed quote showing how your premium will change. Compare the costs with other insurers if the increase seems excessive, and consider [switching car insurance companies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-switch-car-insurance-companies/) if you find better rates. This is also the time to ask about additional ways to reduce the premium.
6. 6

   Finalize and Receive Documentation

   Once you approve the changes:

   * Your new premium takes effect immediately or at your next billing cycle
   * You'll receive updated insurance cards showing your teen as a covered driver
   * Keep digital and physical copies of insurance cards in all vehicles your teen might drive
7. 7

   Annual Policy Review

   As your teen gains driving experience, your insurance costs will likely decrease. Review your policy annually to ensure it still meets your family's needs and budget.

## How Much Does It Cost to Add a Child to Car Insurance?

Adding your teen to your car insurance costs an average of $2,718 per year. If they got their own policy, it would cost about $5,108 annually, which is 47% more expensive. If getting a separate policy, you'll need to co-sign it, as minors can't legally sign contracts in any state.

Nationwide offers the most affordable rates for adding young drivers of most ages. GEICO provides the best rates for 18-year-olds.

| Age | Company | Family Premium | Individual Premium | Increase in Premium |

| Show more | | | | |

#### Factors That Increase Costs Further

**Your rate increase may be higher than average if**:

* Your teen is male: Statistics show that teen boys have a higher risk of accidents and violations, so insurers tend to charge more for policies with young male drivers
* You're adding a new vehicle: Buying a car specifically for your teen, especially a new or sports car, raises rates considerably
* Your teen has violations: Even a single speeding ticket can increase premiums substantially
* You live in a high-cost area: Urban areas typically have higher teen driver premiums

**Insurance costs vary by location due to**:

* State minimum coverage requirements
* Local accident and theft rates
* Weather-related claim frequency
* Population density and traffic patterns

![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)

DO YOU HAVE TO ADD YOUR CHILD TO YOUR CAR INSURANCE?

Adding your teen to your car insurance is legally required in most states. Because children under 18 can't legally sign insurance contracts, parents must ensure teens have coverage that meets [state minimums](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/). Only New Hampshire doesn't require drivers to carry car insurance.

If your child has a learner's permit, your insurance might cover them. However, not all companies extend full coverage to permitted drivers. Some insurers require even provisional drivers to be added as listed drivers.

**Consequences of Not Adding Your Teen**:

* Claim denials if your teen has an accident
* Policy cancellation for failing to provide accurate information
* Personal liability for damages your teen causes
* Potential legal penalties for allowing an uninsured driver

### Pros and Cons of Adding a Child to Your Car Insurance

When deciding whether to add your child to your car insurance policy, weigh the pros and cons against your family's situation and needs.

Pros and Cons

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

Pros

* **Cost savings**: Young drivers usually face higher rates. Adding your teen typically costs less than getting them a separate policy.
* **Multi-car discounts**: If your teen has their own car, you might qualify for a multi-car discount to offset the premium increase.
* **Insurance history**: Keeping your teen continuously covered builds their insurance history, leading to better rates later.
* **Easier management**: Having family members on one policy simplifies payments, renewals and claims.
* **Available discounts**: Look for additional savings through good student discounts, driver's education completion or young driver safety programs.

![errorCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/ErrorCheck_wfuc3a.svg)

Cons

* **Higher premiums**: [Teens have a higher accident risk](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/teen-drivers/index.html), increasing insurance costs.
* **Policy rate impacts**: If your teen has an accident or violation, it could raise rates for your entire policy.
* **Increased claim likelihood**: Young, inexperienced drivers are more prone to accidents, potentially leading to significant claims that might affect your future premiums or policy status.
* **Coverage limitations**: Your teen's driving habits might limit your coverage options, possibly forcing you to choose more expensive coverage.

### How Long Can Your Child Stay On Your Car Insurance?

The length of time a child can remain on their parent's car insurance policy depends on several factors, including the insurer's rules, state regulations and the child's situation. Here's what typically affects this:

| Child's Situation | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Age** | Many insurance companies let young drivers stay on their parents' policy until about age 25, though this limit can vary by state and insurer. |
| **Residency** | If the child lives with their parents, they can usually stay on their family policy. However, moving out and establishing a permanent residence may require them to get their own policy. |
| **Vehicle ownership** | If the car is registered in the child's name, some insurance companies may require them to have their own policy. If the vehicle is registered in the parents' name, staying on their policy is easier. |
| **Marital status** | Getting married might require a separate auto insurance policy, even if the child is still within the age limit and lives with their parents. |
| **Student status** | Some insurers let full-time students stay on their parent’s policy even if they live on a college campus. However, students who drive regularly while living away from home may need their own policy. |
| **State regulations** | Insurance is regulated at the state level, so rules vary. Some states have specific requirements for when a driver must get their own policy. |
| **Insurer's policies** | Even if state regulations allow staying on a parent’s policy, some insurance companies may have stricter rules. |
| **Cost considerations** | Staying on a parent's policy can be cheaper for young drivers, but it may raise the parents' premium. In some cases, it might be more cost-effective for the young driver to get their own policy, especially if they qualify for discounts. |
| **Coverage needs** | If the child has certain coverage needs that differ from their parents', getting their own policy may make sense. |

![studentLoans icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/student-loans_ydnsgp.svg)

Use student discounts

Many insurers offer good student discounts to students with a B average or higher. This rewards academic achievement and helps save on coverage. If your child’s college is far away and they leave their car at home, a student away discount may also be available.

![takingNotes icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/taking-notes_x8n5oo.svg)

Take driver's education courses

A driver’s education or defensive driving course improves your teen’s driving skills, This could also get you an insurance discount.

![carColored icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_mfikug.svg)

Choose the right car

Selecting a safer, older vehicle for your child can be a smart choice. Sports cars or new models might increase premiums, while vehicles with high safety ratings often come with discounts.

![preferences icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/preferences_rximp4.svg)

Increase deductibles

Higher deductibles mean lower monthly premiums, but you'll pay more when accidents happen.

![smartphone icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/smartphone_crsddp.svg)

Use technology

Some insurers offer discounts for using telematics or tracking devices. These devices monitor driving habits, and safe driving can lead to lower premiums.

![car2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car2_xvl57e.svg)

Consider limited-usage discounts

If your teen drives mainly on weekends or certain days, check for limited-use discounts.

![checkList icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/checkList_iwqocr.svg)

Bundle policies and stick to one insurer

Bundling home, car and other policies with one insurer can lower costs. Long-term customers or those with multiple cars on the same policy might qualify for loyalty or multi-car discounts.

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

Drive safely

Encourage safe driving. A clean driving record without accidents or violations helps keep premiums low.

![vsDocuments icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/vs-documents_ujnzcc.svg)

Shop around

Premiums vary significantly between insurers. When adding a young driver, take the opportunity to compare rates.

![talk icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/talk_jkcwy2.svg)

Ask about other discounts

Different insurers offer unique discounts. Ask your agent about any other ways to lower your premium.

+ Military discounts (USAA, GEICO)
+ Professional association memberships
+ Vehicle safety feature discounts
+ Multi-policy bundling savings
+ Low mileage discounts

![trustSeal icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/trust-seal1_hoixc2.svg)

Reevaluate your coverage

If your child's car is older, it might be time to reassess whether [comprehensive or collision coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/when-should-you-drop-collision-and-comprehensive-coverage/) is necessary.

## When Should Your Child Get Their Own Car Insurance?

Adding your child to your existing car insurance policy is often the smartest financial choice. But they might benefit from their own policy if they live independently, own a car or can afford their coverage.

| Child's Situation | Coverage Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Moved out of the house for college and is still driving | If your child has moved out to attend college and is driving there, they typically need their own car insurance policy. |
| Studying abroad | Consider pausing your child's coverage if they study or travel abroad and won't drive their car. You can temporarily add them back if they plan to drive during short visits home. |
| Has a car registered under their name | When a vehicle is registered to your child, they're usually required to insure it under their own policy. |
| Can afford to pay for their own coverage | If your child is financially independent and can easily afford insurance, they might be ready for their own policy. |
| Has a bad driving record | A child with a poor driving record can increase your premiums. In these cases, they might be better off getting their own insurance. |
| Joins the military | When a child joins the military and gets stationed elsewhere without their vehicle, consider revising their status on your policy. |
| Has stopped driving | If your child stops driving permanently, you can remove them from your policy. |

### Choosing the Right Vehicle for Your Teen Driver

Picking your teen's first car feels overwhelming with safety and cost concerns pulling in different directions. The right vehicle choice protects your teen while keeping insurance premiums manageable.

## Adding Your Child to Your Auto Insurance: Bottom Line

Every driver, regardless of age, must have car insurance, including teens with provisional and full licenses. Since minors can't sign insurance contracts, parents must secure their coverage.

Adding teen drivers to your family policy is usually more affordable than separate policies and provides continuous coverage that builds their insurance history.

While costs increase, various discounts and safe driving can help manage expenses.

The key is balancing adequate financial protection with reasonable costs while prioritizing your teen's safety through proper vehicle selection and ongoing driver education.

### Adding a Child to Auto Insurance: FAQ

MoneyGeek answered frequently asked questions about adding children to car insurance policies below:

### Can you get car insurance under 18?

Drivers under 18 can get auto insurance, but it's difficult and expensive. Few companies insure minors, and those that do require a parent or guardian to co-sign. The best option is adding teens to their parent's policy.

### How young can you get a learner's permit?

Teens can get a learner's permit between ages 14 and 18, but the minimum age varies by state. Most states issue permits at 15 or 16.

### What happens if I don't add my teenager to my car insurance?

If your child isn't listed on the policy before an accident occurs, not only could your claim be denied, but you could also be dropped by your insurer for failing to provide accurate information. You could also face personal liability for damages your teen causes.

### Can my teenager be excluded from my car insurance policy?

Some states allow driver exclusions, meaning the excluded person has no coverage when driving your vehicles. However, if an excluded driver gets into an accident while driving your car, you won't have coverage. This option should be used carefully and only when you're certain the excluded person won't drive your vehicles.

### Can my college student stay on my car insurance?

Yes, college students can typically remain on their parents' car insurance policy, even when living away at school, as long as their permanent address remains with their parents and they return home for breaks and summers.

### What's the difference between adding a teen to my policy vs. getting them their own policy?

Adding a teen to your existing policy is almost always cheaper because they benefit from your established driving record and credit history. A separate policy for a teen is typically 37% more expensive and requires parental co-signing for minors.

### Do I need to add my teen if they're also covered on another parent's policy?

If divorced parents both have vehicles their teen drives regularly, the teen may need to be listed on both policies. Check with both insurance companies to understand their specific requirements and avoid coverage gaps.
