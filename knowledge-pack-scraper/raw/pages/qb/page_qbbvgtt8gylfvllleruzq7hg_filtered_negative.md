The cost of your [car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/) policy's premium is determined by many factors. When providing the average car insurance cost, it's helpful to point out some of the specific aspects that may impact your premiums. Your location, driving history, credit score, age, gender, and many other factors all go into [calculating car insurance rates](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-calculator/). When asking, "How much does car insurance cost?" you'll need to consider all these different qualifiers. You could own and drive the exact same vehicle in two different states and pay two completely different car insurance premiums.
An [independent insurance agent](https://www.trustedchoice.com/find-an-agent/?category=PERSONAL&businessLines=AUTO) can also help you find the most affordable car insurance near you. They'll get you set up with a policy that does everything you need it to do. But first, here's a breakdown of the average cost you can expect to pay for car insurance in 2025.
Car insurance rates tend to [decrease as driver age increases](https://www.trustedchoice.com/insurance-articles/wheels-wings-motors/what-age-does-car-insurance-go-down/), at least for quite a while. However, once a driver reaches a certain level of seniority, often around age 70, rates can start to increase again. This can be due to risk factors such as declining eyesight and decreased reaction time, which can create a greater likelihood of accidents.
But while a liability-only car insurance policy that meets your state's minimum coverage requirements is always the least expensive option, you'll still want to review all the different [types of car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-types/) available so you can build a policy that works best for you. Though adding more coverage to your policy may initially seem more expensive, having the additional coverage can really pay off in case you have to file a claim later.
When estimating your [car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/) premiums, an insurance provider will look into your history as a motorist. If you have a history of traffic accidents and citations, your rate will likely be higher. Insurance companies view drivers with more traffic violations as statistically more likely to be in an accident.

If the driver responsible for causing the accident does not have car insurance, or the accident was a hit and run, your insurance company would pay for your medical treatment and the repairs to your vehicle based on how much [uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-types/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) you carry and your policy's limits. Since your insurance company is more likely to pay unnecessary costs in areas where motorists tend to go uninsured, the monthly auto insurance premium in these areas is typically higher.
