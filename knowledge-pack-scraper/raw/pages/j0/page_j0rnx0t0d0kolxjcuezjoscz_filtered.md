## Minimum car insurance requirements in New York

New York is a “no-fault” state, meaning that each driver’s insurance policy covers the costs associated with injuries and damages, no matter which driver caused the accident. The state of New York requires all drivers to purchase the following minimum amounts of basic car insurance coverage.

### Personal injury protection (PIP)

[Personal injury protection](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/personal-injury-protection-172020048.html) (PIP) covers the medical costs of treating injuries that you and/or others covered in your policy have sustained in an accident, as well as certain other related expenses, payment for lost wages, and a death benefit if necessary. The minimum amount for basic no-fault coverage is $50,000 per person.

### Bodily injury liability

If someone is seriously injured or dies in a car accident that you cause, and you are sued by the person or their family and found guilty, [bodily injury liability coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/bodily-injury-liability-191054657.html) pays for the costs of the damages awarded for pain and suffering. The minimum limits are:

* $25,000 for any person who sustains a serious injury in an accident but does not die, or $50,000 if that person dies
* $50,000 for two or more people who sustain a serious injury in an accident but do not die, or $100,000 if two or more die (subject to the above per person limits)

You can sue another party for bodily injury due to an accident, but you must have sustained a serious injury as defined in the state’s insurance law. In addition to pain and suffering, you can also sue for economic damages that aren’t covered by your no-fault coverage or that exceed your policy’s limits.

### Property damage liability

[Property damage liability](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/property-damage-liability-163558769.html) coverage pays for the cost of repairing or replacing property that you damaged in a car accident. The minimum coverage amount for a basic policy is $10,000 per accident.

Insurance companies sometimes refer to these minimum bodily and property liability limits as “$25,000/$50,000/$10,000” or “25/50/10.”

**Important note:** For both types of liability coverages, your insurance company must provide your legal defense if you are sued by another party who claims you caused an accident. Your insurer is not allowed to reduce your policy’s liability limits.

### Uninsured motorist coverage

If you are in an accident with another driver who is uninsured or you were involved in a [hit-and-run](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/what-to-do-in-hit-and-run-200436018.html) crash, [uninsured motorist coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/how-does-uninsured-motorist-coverage-work-213348857.html) will pay the medical costs if you are injured, but not the repair or replacement costs if your car is damaged. The minimum limits are the same as those for bodily injury coverage.

## Types of New York car insurance coverage

Many New York drivers opt for additional car insurance coverage above the state’s minimum requirements in order to help protect their vehicles and shield themselves from out-of-pocket costs. Here are the different types of coverage add-ons to consider:

* **Additional PIP coverage.** You have the option to purchase more PIP (no-fault) coverage over the basic $50,000 minimum limit.
* **Additional bodily injury liability coverage.** If you own a home and have other assets to protect, it’s smart to carry insurance limits above the state-required minimum. Your insurance company may offer to bundle increased limits for bodily injury liability and property damage liability, paying one maximum amount for all damages per accident, no matter how many people are hurt.
* **Supplemental spousal liability insurance.** Supplemental spousal liability (SSL) insurance provides additional bodily injury liability coverage for accidents where a spouse is at fault. This provides protection if the driver who causes the accident has lower insurance limits than the person who is injured. **Note:** Effective March 26, 2025, insurers must provide SSL coverage when the policyholder includes the name of a spouse on their insurance application unless the policyholder declines SSL insurance in writing using this [form](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/01/supp-spousal-liability-ins-declination-form-12-18-24.pdf).
* **Additional property damage liability coverage.** Many New York drivers choose additional property damage liability coverage above the $10,000 minimum limit, given the higher value of their automobiles.
* **Supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists (SUM) coverage.** You can buy supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists (SUM) coverage with higher limits than the mandatory minimum.
* **Collision.** If you damage your own car, [collision car insurance coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/collision-insurance-191301984.html) will pay the repair or replacement costs. If you don’t have collision coverage and another party is at least partially responsible for damaging your car, you can make a claim against their property damage liability insurance coverage for the damages they caused.
* **Comprehensive.** Any damage that you cause to your car that is not covered by collision is covered by [comprehensive car insurance](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/comprehensive-car-insurance-182556677.html), including costs to repair a broken window, [damage from flooding](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/does-car-insurance-cover-flood-damage-205643151.html), fire, vandalism, falling or flying objects, if you collide with an animal, if [your car is stolen](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/what-happens-when-your-car-is-stolen-142424868.html), as well as the costs of a rental car or public transit until your insurance company settles your claim.

**Expert advice:** While your insurance premium will rise with the more coverage options you add on, you’ll generally be better protected and more financially insulated from all costs associated with accidents.

## What most policies don’t cover in New York

Most car insurance policies in New York have some exclusions. Here are a few examples of situations and types of damage that aren’t usually covered under a standard auto policy:

* **Vehicle maintenance.** Car insurance doesn’t typically provide any coverage for your vehicle’s routine maintenance. Things like oil changes and tire rotations are your financial responsibility.
* **Breakdowns.** If your car breaks down on the side of the road, your car insurance won’t cover the repairs unless you’ve added roadside assistance to your policy.
* **International damage.** Almost all car insurance policies exclude coverage for intentional damage or damage that occurs while doing something illegal.
* **Aftermarket parts.** If your vehicle gets damaged or totaled in a covered loss, your policy probably won’t cover aftermarket parts or modifications.
* **Personal property in your vehicle.** Car insurance doesn’t usually cover personal items that are stolen from your vehicle or damaged in a covered loss. Your home insurance or renters insurance policy typically covers belongings in your car.
* **Claims above your policy limits.** Car insurance only covers claims up to your policy’s limit. If a claim exceeds the limit, you’ll probably have to pay the difference out of pocket.
* **Commercial use.** Most car insurance policies exclude [commercial use of your vehicle](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/commercial-auto-insurance-181754910.html). This includes driving for rideshare services, like Uber and Lyft, and [delivery companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/how-car-insurance-works-for-delivery-drivers-212329760.html), like DoorDash. If you use your car for ridesharing, many insurers offer separate [rideshare insurance policies](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/rideshare-insurance-155909957.html) or rideshare endorsements.

## Can you stack uninsured motorist coverage in New York?

No, drivers are not allowed to stack uninsured motorist insurance in New York.

Stacking is when you combine the uninsured motorist coverage limits for all the vehicles insured on your policy. This results in a higher overall coverage limit, and can provide more financial protection if you get into an accident with an uninsured driver.

In New York, uninsured motorist insurance coverage limits can’t be combined. Each vehicle has its own coverage limit, which is the maximum amount of money you can receive from your insurance company if you have an uninsured motorist claim.

## Does New York have no-fault auto insurance?

Yes, New York is a [no-fault state](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/no-fault-car-insurance-213836547.html) for car insurance. That means your car insurance policy will automatically cover medical expenses for you and your passengers if you get injured in an accident, regardless of which driver was responsible. No-fault insurance also applies to pedestrians that get injured by a vehicle. New York drivers are required to carry at least $50,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) per person, also called no-fault insurance.

## Programs and resources only available in New York

### The New York Automobile Insurance Plan (NYAIP)

If your driving record, lack of experience, or age, for example, prevent you from being able to get the car insurance you need, you can purchase coverage through the New York Automobile Insurance Plan (NYAIP). Your existing insurance agent will likely be able to place you in this plan, or you can call the plan directly at (212) 943-5100 or visit the [NYAIP website](https://www.aipso.com/Plan-Sites/New-York).

You will typically pay higher premiums for NYAIP coverage, but you can obtain a careful driver discount after one year in the plan if you are accident- and conviction-free, and if you’ve had a driver’s license for at least four years.

## Cheap car insurance in New York

The cost of car insurance in New York depends on a variety of factors, including your age, vehicle type, and insurance company. If you’re looking for the most affordable auto policy, you can check out some of the [cheapest car insurance companies in New York](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/cheapest-car-insurance-new-york-185142756.html) based on average premiums.

## New York car insurance laws

### Insurance Information and Enforcement System (IIES)

Insurance companies must report to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) whenever you buy, renew, or cancel a car insurance. The DMV tracks this information on its electronic database, the Insurance Information and Enforcement System (IIES), and can detect when vehicles are uninsured. If you fail to maintain liability insurance coverage, your vehicle registration and driver’s license can be suspended, and you will also be subject to hefty fines.

### Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) / Driving While Ability Impaired (DWAI)

It’s illegal to drive your car in New York if you have a .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) or higher, if you’re driving while impaired with more than .05 BAC but less than .07 BAC, you’re driving while impaired by a drug or a combination of drugs and alcohol.

*Learn more:* [*What’s the difference between DUI and DWI?*](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/dwi-vs-dui-183213843.html)

For the first offense of these violations, you will pay a fine up to $1,000 and various surcharges, your driver’s license will be revoked for at least six months, and you will face up to one year in jail. The penalties increase per occurrence, and if you are cited with a BAC of 0.18 or higher.

*Learn more:* [*Here’s how a DUI impacts your car insurance*](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/car-insurance-after-dui-163728985.html)

Teenagers under 21 who drive with a .02 BAC to .07 BAC can be cited under New York’s Zero Tolerance Law. They will have to pay a $125 civil penalty, their license can be suspended for six months, and they will have to pay another $100 fee to lift the suspension.

### License points system

The New York DMV uses a points system to identify high-risk drivers. Drivers who get six or more points in 18 months must pay a Driver Responsibility Assessment fee (ranging from $100 to $750 over the course of three years). Drivers who receive 11 points in 18 months can face license suspension on top of any fees.

Each traffic violation conviction carries a certain number of points. Here are some examples of violations and their point value:

* **Disobeying a stop sign or yield sign:** 3 points
* **Failing to yield the right-of-way:** 3 points
* **Improper cell phone use**: 5 points
* **Reckless driving:** 5 points
* **Speeding 11 to 20 mph over posted limit:** 4 points
* **Speeding more than 40 mph over posted limit:** 11 points

Points no longer count towards your total after 18 months from the date of the violation. However, convictions may remain on your driving record for longer, and can continue to affect your car insurance premium.

### Vehicle registration requirements

In New York, drivers are required to register their vehicle with the DMV within 180 days of the car insurance policy’s effective date. Out-of-state auto insurance policies are not accepted under any circumstances for vehicles that are registered in New York State. When you apply for vehicle registration, the name on the registration application must match the name on the vehicle’s insurance ID card.

## Penalties for driving without car insurance in New York

Driving without car insurance in New York is illegal. If the DMV finds out that you were involved in an accident not covered by liability insurance, your driver’s license and vehicle registration will be revoked for a minimum of one year. You’ll face the same penalties if someone else was driving your uninsured vehicle and caused an accident.

Additionally, you’ll pay a maximum fine of $1,500 for driving without insurance in New York. There’s a separate $750 civil penalty fee to reinstate your driver’s license.

## When can New York car insurance be canceled?

You’re allowed to cancel car insurance at any time in New York, assuming you’ll no longer be driving the vehicle. However, you must follow the correct protocol to avoid penalties.

First, ask your insurance company to file an electronic notice of insurance coverage with the DMV. If your insurer fails to file the notice, it’s possible that your license could be suspended.

Before you cancel your policy, you’re required to return your license plates to the DMV prior to your coverage ending. You must return your plates even if you’ll be parking your vehicle on private property or putting it in storage. If you don't return your plates, your vehicle registration and driver’s license will be suspended.

## New York car insurance frequently asked questions

### Do you need car insurance in New York?

Yes, car insurance is a legal requirement in New York. You must carry a minimum amount of auto insurance and register your vehicle with the DMV to legally drive.

### Why is car insurance so expensive in New York?

Car insurance in New York can be expensive for several reasons, including the state's no-fault insurance law, which requires drivers to carry more coverage than those in some other states, as well as the impact of severe weather, the number of claims filed each year, and other factors. However, car insurance in New York isn’t always expensive. Rates are personalized based on factors like your ZIP code, age, driving record, and insurance company.
