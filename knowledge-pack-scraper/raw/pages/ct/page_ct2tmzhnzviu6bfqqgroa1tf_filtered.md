![You are currently viewing Florida Auto Insurance: Why Minimum Coverage is Not Enough](https://romanolawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Florida-auto-insurance.jpg)

As a personal injury attorney, I have worked with many clients who’ve suffered due to auto accidents. Because of my many years of seeing this happen repeatedly, I recommend that Florida drivers get more than the minimum car insurance coverage. I’ve seen firsthand how lacking adequate coverage can cause severe financial and emotional distress for those injured in accidents. The risks on Florida’s roads, along with its legal and insurance landscape, make extra coverage not just advisable—but essential.

### The Dangers of Minimum Auto Coverage in Florida

Florida’s minimum auto insurance requirements are dangerously low. In fact, Florida remains the only state in the country that does not require drivers to carry bodily injury (BI) liability insurance or uninsured / underinsured (UM) insurance. In a state with a high rate of fatal auto accidents, thefts, and dangerous drivers, $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability (PDL) is not enough to cover the full financial burden of a serious accident. If you or a loved one is in a crash, medical bills, lost wages, and long-term rehabilitation can quickly exceed these limits. Without proper coverage, you might struggle to pay for necessary medical treatment or face mounting debt.

I’ve represented clients severely injured in accidents who found their minimal insurance didn’t cover basic medical costs or lost income. Their injuries required extensive treatment and, sometimes, lifelong care—but their PIP and PDL couldn’t cover it all. The emotional toll is compounded by the stress of mounting medical bills and the threat of financial ruin.

### Underinsured and Uninsured Motorists: A Growing Threat

Florida has one of the highest rates of uninsured and underinsured motorists in the country. In Florida, 38.3% of drivers are underinsured, and more than 20% are uninsured. It has created a system in which good drivers subsidize the bad ones. If you’re involved in an accident with one of these drivers, you may end up stuck with the bill for all the harm someone else caused.

Uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage is vital in Florida. It’s something I urge all drivers to consider. If the at-fault driver has insufficient coverage, your own insurance will cover the additional medical costs, lost wages, pain, suffering, and other damages. Without UM/UIM coverage, someone else’s negligence could leave you with the full financial burden. As an attorney, I’ve seen how devastating this can be for my clients.

### The Importance of Comprehensive and Collision Coverage

Florida is also known for severe weather events, including hurricanes, flooding, and intense storms. Comprehensive insurance coverage protects your vehicle from damage caused by weather events, vandalism, theft, or even hitting an animal. Florida drivers are particularly vulnerable to these risks, and having comprehensive coverage can shield you from catastrophic financial loss.

Collision coverage is also essential. Accidents happen, and when they do, having the right coverage can make all the difference. Whether you hit another vehicle or a guardrail, collision coverage helps pay for repairs or replacement. It reduces the financial strain of getting back on the road.

### The Hidden Dangers of Minimum Liability Coverage in Florida

Liability coverage is another area where many Florida drivers fall short. I suggest carrying at least $100/300/100 coverage for liability. If you are at fault in an accident, this coverage can protect your assets. With rising medical care and damage costs, even minor accidents can lead to lawsuits that could strip you of savings, your home, or future earnings. The minimum liability limits of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident are often insufficient.

I’ve seen drivers cause accidents and get hit with lawsuits for medical bills and lost wages that far exceeded their coverage. Without enough liability coverage, these individuals become vulnerable, facing wage garnishments or asset seizures to pay for damages.

### The 2021 Legislative Session and Governor DeSantis’s Veto

In the 2021 legislative session, lawmakers passed a sweeping auto insurance reform bill, Senate Bill 54. This bill sought to abolish the state’s no-fault insurance system and replace it with a fault-based system in which the careless drivers who cause crashes are responsible for paying for the damage they cause. This legislation would have lowered insurance premiums for the majority of Florida drivers and placed accountability where it belongs – on those who cause the harm.

However, despite the bill passing both the Florida House and Senate with overwhelming (92%) bipartisan support, Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed the bill. The veto was a significant setback for supporters of the bill, who believed the reform would create a more fair and efficient insurance system while lowering rates. Recent reporting has revealed that insurance companies have long hidden billions of dollars in shell companies while claiming to be losing money in order to justify raising rates. The Florida legislature is now investigating these false claims.

The veto left the issue unresolved. However, discussions around auto insurance reform continue to be a hot topic. Lawmakers are currently revisiting similar reforms in this legislative session as Floridians continue to face challenges related to the high cost of insurance.

### Florida’s Proposed Auto Insurance Reform

In recent legislative sessions, Florida lawmakers have introduced bills aiming to overhaul the state’s auto insurance system. [Senate Bill 1256 (SB 1256)](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/1256/ByCategory) and [House Bill 1181 (HB 1181)](https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=81862&SessionId=105) propose significant changes, including the repeal of the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law. This change would shift the state from a no-fault system, where drivers rely on their own insurance for injury claims regardless of who is at fault, to a traditional tort system, where the at-fault driver is held responsible for damages.

The proposed legislation also seeks to revise minimum liability coverage requirements for vehicle owners and operators. If enacted, these changes could impact how drivers are required to insure their vehicles and affect the process for resolving accident-related claims. It’s important for all Florida drivers to stay informed about these developments, as they may significantly alter the current insurance landscape.

### Florida: A Changing Auto Insurance Landscape

While Florida’s auto insurance reform legislation has made strides in reducing fraud and lowering premiums, the state still faces numerous risks that can devastate drivers’ finances. Many uninsured drivers, millions of tourists, and a legal framework that protects insurance companies over the people they insure all create a challenging environment.

As an attorney, I’ve seen how insurance companies often deny claims or offer lowball settlements. This results in prolonged legal battles, where those injured must fight for the compensation they deserve. That’s why higher coverage limits are essential—it gives you peace of mind that you’re protected, no matter what unexpected circumstances arise.

### The Bottom Line: Don’t Shortchange Your Protection

Your auto insurance policy protects you and your family. In a state like Florida, with unique challenges and high risks, minimum coverage won’t cut it. As a personal injury attorney who has seen how quickly insurance claims can spiral out of control, I urge all Florida drivers to carefully consider their coverage needs and invest in more than the bare minimum.

By choosing higher liability limits, comprehensive and collision coverage, and uninsured/underinsured motorist protection, you safeguard your financial future. And if you’re in an accident, the right coverage can make all the difference in getting compensation without the added burden of financial hardship.

If you have questions about your car insurance or need advice on what coverage is right for you, consult an experienced attorney or insurance agent. Your safety and financial security are worth the extra investment.
