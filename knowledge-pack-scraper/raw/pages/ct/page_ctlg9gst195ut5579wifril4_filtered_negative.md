Welcome to Roseville, California. Come on down to the galleria and spend some money! Incorporated since 1909, Roseville was originally a stage coach station called Griders. When the railroad arrived, the name was changed to Junction, and finally to Roseville. Now, it's a thriving city with over 100,000 residents and is growing dramatically each year.

Why are tiny fast food burgers so expensive? Unfortunately, nobody will ever know. But we all do know a Chili’s 3 For Me with the new Big QP is just $10.99. So, at least we got that going for us.

Had luck with AAA, after Liberty started playing games. I believe Liberty, and Geico, were both attempting to pull out of CA, or cancelling policies at least.

Same. Although I’m in neighboring Rocklin, I got quotes from all the big names and AAA was by far the best.

Yup! Same. Renewal came up, and same moss crap. We had a company they recommended come out, and the guy (had a conscience) and was like your roof is totally fine, and didn’t feel comfortable taking the job.
We contacted AAA and got a policy same day. Even saved $. Apparently they did the same thing, to lots of folks. If there is even moss, in most cases (if you’re able/comfortable) you can go up yourself and knock it off with a broom, leaf blow everything off, then use a diluted liquid chlorine solution, to clean or prevent it from coming back (for awhile) typically only pops up in shaded areas… Don’t pressure wash (the company’s use special attachments or something, that don’t damage the roof)

We live in West Roseville and had a really hard time fining a company covering our area. Our house is 599k and 1500 square feet. We reached out to about 20 companies and only ended up with 4 companies willing to offer coverage. Quotes: SafePort $871, Mercury $3200, Bamboo $2700, Costco $1,400. We were told by a few companies that certain areas of Roseville were flagged as being “high risk” for brush fires so they suspended issuing new policies in those zone. They anticipate being able to initiate new policies in more areas of Roseville by late spring to summertime (May at the earliest)

We are in Rocklin. For a new build 2,500 sqft, 2 story, no pool, $800k house, we paid about $1,660 for our policy with Farmer's Insurance in August 2024. Have no doubt that in light of the fires in SoCal, this will go up substantially when it is time to renew in August of 2025. Still, Farmer's Insurance seemed to be decent in terms of cost to coverage when we were shopping various insurance companies. Our house does have a lot of fire resistant stuff though (asphalt roof tiles, sprinkler system inside) that help reduce fire risk so that did help lower the insurance premium a bit.

Pools, trampolines, certain breeds of dogs, and other things like being in a high risk fire zone will all make the rates jump. Like I said above, I think our rate will jump quite a bit when we renew in August due to the SoCal fires earlier this year.

This depends on what area you are in. If you are near a preserve or out on open land with lots of trees and grasses, it’s going to be different than if you are in a subdivision in a concrete jungle.

I’m not in Roseville anymore, but I’m not far away. We use Mercury and it’s hella cheap. IMO. If you’re eligible, try USAA. I’m probably going to switch to them soon. Costco is no longer offering auto insurance in California, unsure about homeowners.
