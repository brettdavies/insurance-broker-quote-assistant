##  What Is Term Life Insurance?
##  How Term Life Insurance Works
When you buy a term life insurance policy, the insurance company determines the premium based on the policy's value (the payout amount) and factors such as [age, gender, and health](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022615/how-age-affects-life-insurance-rates.asp). Other considerations affecting rates include the company’s business expenses, how much it earns from its investments, and mortality rates for each age.1
###  Cost of Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance is usually the [least costly life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-is-life-insurance-7112541) available because it offers a death benefit for a restricted time and doesn’t have a [cash value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-value-life-insurance.asp) component like permanent insurance. For example, data from Quotacy shows that a healthy, non-smoking man aged 30 could get a 30-year term life insurance policy with a $250,000 death benefit for an average of $18 per month as of October 2024. [At age 50](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-for-people-over-50-8765923), the premium would rise to $67 a month.3

##  Benefits of Term Life Insurance
##  Term Life Insurance vs. Permanent Life Insurance
###  Cost of Premiums
###  Availability of Coverage
###  Investment Value
However, financial advisors warn that the growth rate of a policy with cash value is often paltry compared to other financial instruments, such as [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) and [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).45 Also, substantial administrative fees often cut into the rate of return. This is the source of the phrase, “[buy term and invest the difference](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/120814/life-insurance-smart-investment.asp).” However, the performance of permanent insurance can be steady and it is tax-advantaged, providing additional benefits when the stock market is volatile.
