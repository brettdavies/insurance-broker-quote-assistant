Colchester, CT — With the average price of a new car hovering around $48,000, people in the market for a new vehicle can ill-afford to rely on guesswork to determine which models are likely to hold up well over time, perform to their expectations, and deliver a safe and satisfying ownership experience. Consumer Reports (CR), the nonprofit research, testing, and consumer advocacy organization, is providing new brand-level performance data and tools on [CR.org/cars](http://cr.org/cars) that will help car shoppers make the smartest vehicle choice for their needs and budget. 

CR today released its multi-faceted 2025 Automotive Report Card. The organization pored over its exclusive road test scores for more than 200 new vehicles, analyzed reliability and owner satisfaction data from its member surveys, and factored in safety performance to produce overall car brand rankings. In addition, visitors to [CR.org/cars](http://cr.org/cars) can view each brand to see where it ranks on new car reliability, used car reliability, owner satisfaction, road test score, and maintenance and repair costs. CR members will be able to dive deeper into the data, with access to “Recommended”  new and used models for each brand; they can also sort by powertrain type, drivetrain, and number of rows of seats. 

“Buying a new car is a big expense and one that requires a lot of research to arrive at the best choice,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports’ Auto Test Center. “Our new experience at CR.org makes that research easier by presenting exclusive unbiased data and insights on everything from reliability to cost of ownership in a streamlined way that’s simple to navigate.”

**Hybrid Reliability is Strong, while EVs and PHEVs are Improving**

Hybrids remain by far the most reliable electrified powertrain. On average, hybrids have the same rate of problems today as internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, which is remarkable given their added complexity. According to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1343-may-20-2024-hybrid-electric-vehicle-sales-united-states-grew-53), Americans bought more hybrids in 2023 than ever before, with sales increasing by 53 percent over the previous year.

CR’s survey shows that reliability for both electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) has improved during the past year as the technology matures. Problem rates for both EVs and PHEVs relative to traditional ICE vehicles have dropped roughly in half since CR’s last survey.

EVs now have 42 percent more problems than ICE cars on average, down from last year’s 79 percent. PHEVs have 70 percent more problems than ICE cars on average, down from last year’s 146 percent. ICE vehicles and hybrids remain the most reliable vehicle types overall. 

Hybrid technology has evolved over the years, making those vehicles extremely fuel-efficient. “Today’s hybrids deliver reliability that is similar to conventional gas cars despite their added complexity,” Fisher said. “CR’s tests have shown that they’re also often quieter, quicker, and more pleasant to drive than their gasoline-only counterparts.” 

The best hybrids—from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, and Toyota—have earned top reliability scores across several categories. 

Some EVs and PHEVs have been slow to improve while others are getting better. The reliability of the Rivian R1S and R1T, along with the Ford F-150 Lightning, for example, remains well-below and below average. However, the Volvo XC60 PHEV has improved reliability and is recommended by CR this year.

**Subaru Tops for Reliability for First Time, Asian Auto Brand Continue to Dominate**

Subaru is the number one ranked brand in CR’s latest Annual Auto Reliability Survey for the first time ever, besting Lexus and Toyota, which have traded the two top spots for many years. CR’s experts attribute Subaru’s improvement to the brand’s conservative approach to vehicle redesigns and the sharing of reliable components across its model lineup. The lone Subaru with a below-average score for predicted reliability is the Solterra electric SUV. 

CR’s survey findings were announced today at an online news conference hosted by the Detroit-based Automotive Press Association.

This is the first time since 2020 that neither Lexus (second place) nor Toyota (third place) are atop CR’s brand reliability rankings. But dominance by Asian automakers endures, with Honda (fourth place), Acura (fifth place), Mazda (sixth place), Kia (ninth place), and Hyundai (10th place) all in the top 10.

Every year, CR asks its members about potential trouble areas they’ve had with their vehicles in the previous 12 months. This year’s survey covers 20 problem areas, including engine, electric motors, transmission, in-car electronics, and more. CR uses that feedback from consumers to predict reliability ratings for new cars from every major mainstream model. This year, CR gathered data on about 300,000 vehicles from the 2000 to 2024 model years, with a few newly introduced 2025 models.

“While brand rankings can guide you to the showroom, it is critical to look at reliability for specific models before making a purchase decision,” Fisher said. “Even within high-ranking companies, there can be significant variation in reliability.”

The reliability predictions for 2025 models are based on each model’s overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn’t been redesigned during that time. If there is insufficient data on a model in any given model year, CR uses the brand reliability score to supplement that model’s new car prediction. Due to the changes in this year’s survey questions and methodology, direct comparisons to previous years’ brand reliability data cannot be made. 

**Subaru is Also Number One Overall Brand**

Subaru is also the top brand in CR’s 2025 Auto Brand Report Card Rankings for the first time since 2022, reclaiming the top spot from BMW by a narrow one-point margin. The rankings are based on the average Overall Score, a combination of CR’s road-test scores, predicted reliability and owner satisfaction data, and safety for all of the models from each automaker. 

Behind Subaru and second place BMW, are Lexus, Porsche, Honda, Audi, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, and Infiniti to round out the top 10. Five of the top 10 overall brands are mainstream brands, meaning car shoppers don’t have to pay a luxury car price to get a high-quality vehicle.

Rivian leads all brands in [CR’s owner satisfaction survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/most-and-least-liked-car-brands-a1291429338/), and its average road test score lands it in the middle of the pack. However, well-below average predicted reliability continues to plague the EV maker, landing it in second to last place in the overall brand rankings.

**About Consumer Reports Annual Auto Reliability Surveys**

The latest Consumer Reports Annual Auto Reliability Surveys gathered information from car owners on about 300,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2024 and early 2025. CR’s reliability predictions are based on overall reliability for the past three model years, provided the vehicle has not been redesigned. One or two years of data will be used if the model was redesigned in 2024 or 2023. CR bases its reliability predictions on data gathered from car owners each year about problems they had with their vehicles in the past 12 months. CR’s team of statisticians, researchers, and testers then analyzed trouble areas and created an overall reliability score for each model and year. Serious problem areas that can lead to expensive repairs are more heavily weighted. More information can be found at [www.CR.org](http://www.cr.org).
