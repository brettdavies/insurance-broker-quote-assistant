## What types of roof damage does homeowners insurance cover?

Your policy may list the individual [perils](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/) covered, or it may list what's not covered. But in general, [homeowners insurance may cover storm damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-storm-damage/) and other common perils, including:

* **Windstorms**: Damage from wind, hurricane, or tornado
* **Hail**: [Damages from falling hail](https://www.progressive.com/answers/hail-damage-home-insurance/), regardless of size, may be covered
* **Snow, sleet, or ice damage**: The weight of these winter weather events can do serious damage and may be covered, potentially including [ice dams](https://www.progressive.com/answers/ice-damage-to-home/) and [roof leaks](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-roof-leaks/)
* **Lightning strikes**: [Damage from lightning strikes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-lightning-strike-damage/), including power surges, may be covered
* **Fire**: [Fire damage may be covered](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-fire/) whether from a lightning strike, electrical fire, or other mishap
* **Falling objects**: [Damage from falling trees may be covered](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-fallen-trees/), depending on the reason for the fall

[Dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling-coverage/) may also pay to repair ceilings and walls if the loss also results in interior damage. If your belongings are also damaged, such as furniture, appliances, and clothing, your [personal property coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-property-coverage/) may pay to repair or replace those items. [Damage to your home's siding](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-siding/) and other exterior elements may also be covered in addition to the roof.

## Does homeowners insurance cover a leaking roof?

If your roof is leaking due to damage from a covered peril, your insurer may pay to repair or replace it, up to the limits of your coverage and minus your deductible. If the roof damage is a result of neglect or wear and tear, it likely won't be covered by your homeowners insurance policy.

### Does homeowners insurance cover roof damage to my shed?

If a shed, barn, detached garage, or other unattached structure on your property sustains roof damage from a covered peril, it may be covered under [other structures coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/other-structures-coverage/) on your policy. If your [fence is damaged by wind](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-fences/) or another covered peril, other structures coverage may pay to repair it as well.

Pro tip:

If you live in an area that's frequently hit by hurricanes or tornadoes, then your insurance may not cover wind or hail damage to your roof. However, many insurers may provide coverage in places where natural disasters are common. They often require separate [deductibles for hurricanes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-a-hurricane-deductible/) and windstorms, which can be a percentage of your home's total dwelling coverage or offer limited coverage. Learn more about [coverage for hurricanes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-hurricanes/).

## When doesn't homeowners insurance cover roof damage?

Homeowners insurance usually excludes coverage for the following types of roof damage:

* **Wear and tear**: Damage from your roof's materials wearing down over time (shingles especially) isn't covered by insurance.
* **Neglect**: Roof damage that results from failing to maintain your roof isn't covered. For example, if your roof starts leaking due to aging shingles, you're responsible for the repairs.
* **Flooding**: Flood damage is generally excluded from homeowners insurance, requiring a separate [flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/).
* **Earthquakes**: [Earthquake damage isn't covered by most homeowners insurance policies](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-earthquakes/).
* **Animals**: [Damage from animals](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-animal-damage/) that get into your roof or attic is generally excluded from a homeowners policy.

Pro tip:

If your roof is older, your policy may provide limited coverage or none, depending on your insurance company and policy. Find out [how your roof's age and type could affect your homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-roof-type-impacts-insurance/).

## Will homeowners insurance cover a new roof?

If your roof sustained structural damage from a covered peril, such as a windstorm or hail, then your homeowners insurance may cover the cost to replace it up to your policy's limit and minus any deductible. A roof replacement may entail installing new roofing shingles or tiles, as well as repairs to the roof's underlying structure.

## Filing a homeowners insurance claim for roof damage

When your roof is damaged by a storm, fire, or other covered peril, your first step should be to document the damage once it's safe to do so. Take photos or video of the damaged sections and include them in your insurance claim. Your insurer may ask you to get repair estimates and include them in your filing as well. They'll send a claims adjuster to assess the damage and verify the loss. If your claim is approved, your insurer will write you a check for the cost to repair or replace your roof. Learn more about [how homeowners insurance claims work](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-do-home-insurance-claims-work/).

**Important note**: If you need to make emergency repairs to avoid further damage, you can submit them for reimbursement with your homeowners claim. Make sure to keep receipts for the work and add them to your claim filing. If you must stay elsewhere while waiting for repairs, [loss of use coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/loss-of-use-insurance/) can reimburse you for lodging expenses, up to your policy's limit.
