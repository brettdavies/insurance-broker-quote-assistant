* What Happens When Term Life Insurance Expires?
![Three generations on a hike.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/what-happens-when-term-life-insurance-expires.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
You may be thinking why not just keep your current policy and let it renew every year after the guarantee period? Well, the renewal process results in one important change to your policy — [your premium cost](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/what-determines-the-cost-of-life-insurance). Your policy can renew, but your premiums will likely increase each year based on your age.
If you have a term life insurance policy about to reach the end of its guaranteed level premium period, take time to review your options along with some actions you may want to take to get the most out of your [life insurance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance).
Many term policies have a conversion privilege, which allows you to convert all or a portion of your coverage to a [whole life policy](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/whole-life-insurance), typically without undergoing additional underwriting or a medical exam. You’ll no longer need to worry about your premiums increasing yearly because a permanent policy offers level premiums for as long as you live (if your premiums are paid on time), unlike a term policy, which only offers level premiums for a certain number of years.
If you qualify for another term life policy, you’ll once again have guaranteed level premiums for the length of the term. This can be a viable choice if you have a specific need for coverage, for a certain amount of time. For example, helping to provide money to [pay off a mortgage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/pay-off-mortgage-early), provide for education expenses or income replacement.
Try to [revisit your life insurance needs regularly](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/when-to-review-life-insurance), as they can often change over time. As you think about what you want to do with your current term policy, here are some key factors to consider when [weighing your life insurance options](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/term-or-whole-life-insurance-which-is-right-for-you):
* **Your current life stage** — often times our life insurance needs can be affected by [what stage of life we’re in](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/what-age-to-get-life-insurance "Life insurance at every age").
* **Your children or grandchildren** — think about the legacy you want to leave. Perhaps you want to help the young ones in your life with [education costs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/college/how-a-529-plan-works).
