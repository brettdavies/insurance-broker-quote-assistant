* **Supercell Thunderstorms:** These kingpins of severe weather are notorious for their rotating updrafts, known as mesocyclones. The intense upward motion inside supercells repeatedly carries hailstones into the coldest regions of the storm. This process gives hailstones more time and opportunities to collect supercooled water, resulting in larger, more damaging hail. The infamous storms over the Great Plains—sometimes referred to as “Hail Alley”—are often driven by supercells.
* **Frontal Systems:** When warm, moist air slams into cooler, denser air along a front, the warm air is forced to rise quickly. This rapid ascent creates instability and fuels strong thunderstorms. These storms, bursting with energy at the collision boundary, offer the kind of vigorous updrafts that encourage hailstones to form and grow. For example, springtime in the Midwest frequently sees frontal boundaries lighting up the radar with hail-producing storms.
* **Orographic Lifting:** Mountains aren’t just for scenic views—they also influence local weather. When moist air encounters mountainous terrain, it is pushed upward by the slopes. As the air rises and cools, thunderstorm clouds can form, sometimes leading to hail. Areas downwind of the Rockies often witness this phenomenon, where the terrain helps turn an otherwise mild system into a hailstorm.

* **Dented or Bruised Shingles:** Look for small, round dents or bruises, especially on asphalt shingles. These spots might feel soft to the touch.
* **Granule Loss:** Hail impact often knocks the protective granules off the surface of shingles, leaving behind bare patches or exposing the black asphalt underneath. You might also spot granules collecting in gutters and downspouts.
* **Cracked or Broken Tiles:** On slate, clay, or concrete tile roofs, hail can cause cracks, chips, or even shattered tiles.
* **Splits in Wood Shingles:** Wooden shingles can develop sharp splits or cracks along the grain, sometimes with discoloration at the split’s edge.
* **Damaged Roof Vents and Flashing:** Metal roof vents, flashing, and skylight frames are prone to dings and dents. Look for obvious marks or misshapen metal.
* **Loose or Missing Shingles:** Severe hail can dislodge shingles entirely, leaving bare areas or loose tabs.

### Can Hail Occur Year-Round in Texas?
Hail isn’t just a springtime or summer spectacle—though those seasons do see the lion’s share of activity, thanks to heightened atmospheric instability and thunderstorm frequency. In reality, hail can fall during any month, provided the right conditions are met. For Texas, the likelihood shifts with the seasons: winter brings hail events to the Gulf region, especially along the Mississippi and Red River Valleys, while spring and early summer push those chances upward throughout the South Central U.S. as storms ramp up in intensity. So while hail is most common during warmer months, residents should remain mindful that Texas weather can serve up hail surprises at almost any time of year.
* **Stay Safe:** If you notice water entering your living space, don’t risk slipping or mishandling electrical appliances. Move cautiously and avoid standing water near exposed electrical outlets.
* **Contain the Leak:** Use buckets, pans, or towels to catch dripping water to prevent further damage to floors and furniture. If possible, place plastic sheeting or a tarp beneath the leak to offer added protection.
* **Protect Belongings:** Move valuable items—especially electronics and important documents—out of harm’s way.
* **Reduce Water Pressure:** If you spot a bulge in the ceiling, gently puncture it with a screwdriver or similar tool. This controlled release of water helps prevent a larger, uncontrolled burst.
* **Document the Damage:** Take clear photos and notes of all affected areas, inside and out. This record will be helpful for your insurance claim.
* **Call Your Insurance Agent:** Report the leak as soon as possible, and follow their guidance for the claims process.
* **Cover Problem Areas:** If it’s safe to do so, place a waterproof tarp over the damaged section of your roof to limit further water intrusion until professional repairs can be made. Only attempt this if the storm has passed and conditions are safe.
* **Arrange for Inspection and Repair:** Reach out to a licensed roofing contractor with experience in hail damage. Choose companies accredited by the Better Business Bureau, or search trusted sources such as Angie’s List or the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) for recommendations.
