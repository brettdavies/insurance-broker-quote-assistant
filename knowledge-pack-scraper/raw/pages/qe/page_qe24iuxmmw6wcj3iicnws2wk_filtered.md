With the 2025 season behind us and the hot stove ready to burn, we're taking a closer look at some of the most prominent players eligible for free agency.

**Name:** [Bo Bichette](https://www.mlb.com/player/666182)

**Position:** Shortstop

**Team:** Toronto Blue Jays  
**Age (as of Opening Day 2026):** 28  
**2025 stats:** .311/.357/.483 (.840 OPS), 18 HR, 94 RBIs, 78 R, 129 OPS+, 3.8 fWAR

**Qualifying Offer:** [Yes](https://www.mlb.com/news/bo-bichette-receives-qualifying-offer-from-blue-jays)

When the 2025 season began, it was widely assumed that Bichette was about to play his final year in Toronto.

Fresh off an injury-riddled 2024 that saw Bichette put up subpar numbers (four home runs, .599 OPS in 81 games), his value was at an all-time low. Once the Blue Jays signed Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to a new 14-year, $500 million deal in April, Bichette’s departure felt even more likely to those within the industry.

Then the Blue Jays made a run to [Game 7 of the World Series](https://www.mlb.com/news/blue-jays-lose-2025-world-series-to-dodgers).

Bichette was a key part of Toronto’s magical season, bouncing back with a strong year at the plate. He hit .311 with 18 homers, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS, though his defense at shortstop was less than ideal (his -13 outs above average was tied for the worst in the Majors). There is a thought throughout the game that Bichette’s long-term future will be at second base, where he played in the World Series after coming back from a knee injury. A potential position change could actually increase the number of potential suitors this winter.

Guerrero and Bichette have been the faces of the Blue Jays’ franchise since they arrived in Toronto. Having reached the World Series for the first time since 1993, will Bichette return on a new deal to finish the job? Or will another team pry him away from the Jays in a year where impact middle infielders are scarce on the free-agent market?

Let’s take a look at how Bichette’s offseason might play out.

### POTENTIAL SUITORS

**BLUE JAYS**

A return to Toronto is the obvious move for both sides, as Bichette is a key contributor to the reigning AL champs. The Blue Jays could even look to move Bichette to second base sooner than later, shifting Andrés Giménez to shortstop to strengthen the infield defense. Bichette has stated numerous times that he wants to remain in Toronto, so it might simply become a question of whether the two sides can find contract terms they’re both comfortable with.

**GIANTS**

San Francisco made a huge move in June with its trade for Rafael Devers, but after finishing 81-81 and missing the postseason for the fourth straight year and eighth time in nine seasons, the Giants could look to be aggressive this offseason. Assuming that Bichette is amenable to a move to second base, he could combine with Willy Adames to form an impressive double play combination, while Matt Chapman is signed long-term at third base.

**BRAVES**

The Braves have an opening at shortstop now that Ha-Seong Kim has opted out, while second baseman Ozzie Albies has a $7 million club option for 2027, potentially opening that position in a year or two. Bichette would be a huge offensive upgrade at shortstop for the Braves, who got only three homers and a .550 OPS from the position in 2025.

**DODGERS**

No list of potential suitors for a major free agent is complete without Los Angeles, which seems to be in the mix for several players every offseason. Mookie Betts made a smooth transition to shortstop, but the Dodgers can always move him to second base or back to the outfield if they choose to. Second baseman Tommy Edman can also play the outfield, giving the Dodgers a wealth of options if they decide to pursue Bichette.

**TIGERS**

Detroit seems to be a potential landing spot for nearly every free-agent hitter, but Bichette would fit perfectly into the Tigers’ lineup. Trey Sweeney played the bulk of the games at shortstop last season, posting uninspiring numbers at the plate (.549 OPS) and in the field (-6 outs above average). Gleyber Torres is also a free agent, creating a vacancy at second base if the Tigers opt to stick with Sweeney at shortstop.

**YANKEES**

With Anthony Volpe undergoing shoulder surgery that will keep him out for the start of the season, the Yankees can reassess the shortstop position following another down season by their former top prospect. Jazz Chisholm Jr. is under control for one more season, so the Yankees could use Bichette at shortstop in 2026, then move either Bichette or Volpe to second base if Chisholm leaves as a free agent. Taking Bichette away from the division-rival Blue Jays would be an added bonus.

**PHILLIES**

Philadelphia has a lot of internal business to deal with this offseason, with Kyle Schwarber, J.T. Realmuto and Ranger Suárez among their free agents. Bringing back Schwarber and Realmuto figures to be the most likely scenario, but if president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski wants to shake things up, a pursuit of Bichette would surely qualify. Trea Turner is locked in at shortstop through 2033, but second baseman Bryson Stott is arbitration-eligible for two more seasons and third baseman Alec Bohm will be a free agent next year, so either could be used in a trade to address another area. The Phillies aren’t a frontrunner by any means, but after three straight disappointing Octobers, anything is possible.

**METS**

No, Bichette isn’t going to replace Francisco Lindor at shortstop in Queens. But the idea of trading Jeff McNeil to open up second base or slotting Bichette in at third base may not be so far-fetched after the Mets missed the postseason with a disappointing 2025. New York is one of the few teams that wouldn’t blink at Bichette’s expected asking price, and given the need to add an impact bat to the lineup – especially if Pete Alonso signs elsewhere – this could be a good match.

### EXECUTIVE TAKE

“Bichette’s value hinges on health and an evaluation of his future defensive home in the short- and long-term. There is likely always a team that will be willing to pay a premium for the bat and be able to rationalize the risk or balance out the investment with a younger, cost-controlled option at shortstop.”

### BUYER BEWARE

We’ve already addressed Bichette’s defense at shortstop, and given his knee injuries, his speed – he hasn’t been a plus baserunner since 2021 and his sprint speed was below average this season according to Statcast – isn’t a given to return. One other number stood out when looking at his 2025 season: his strikeout percentage. Bichette ranked in the 86th percentile of the league with a 14.5% strikeout rate, the lowest of his career. So why is that concerning? That figure is 4.5% lower than every other season of his career, so was it an outlier or a sign of things to come? Bichette was in the 12th percentile in chase percentage, though that falls in line with the rest of his career. If he can keep his strikeout rate at last season’s number, that’s a huge plus. But will he? Only time will tell.

### FOR COMP'S SAKE

Two recent free-agent shortstops can serve as a solid guide when it comes to Bichette’s upcoming contract: Dansby Swanson (seven years, $177 million prior to the 2023 season) and Adames (seven years, $182 million last year). Bichette’s defense isn’t as strong as either of those players, but his career 121 OPS+ is higher than both Swanson (95) and Adames (109) at the time of their free agency. Bichette is also entering his age-28 season, while Swanson and Adames were free agents prior to their age-29 seasons.
