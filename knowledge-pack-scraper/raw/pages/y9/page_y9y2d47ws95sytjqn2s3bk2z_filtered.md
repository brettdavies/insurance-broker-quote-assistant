Established on March 10, 1937, in Cleveland, Ohio, by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green, Progressive Mutual Insurance Company sought to transform auto insurance. As pioneers of the first drive-in claims location, the company emphasized innovation.

In 1956, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company was founded as the inaugural nonstandard insurance underwriter, unveiling the Safe Driver Plan. By 1964, Progressive introduced a payment plan for nonstandard auto policies in Ohio and broadened coverage to include motorcycle insurance policies, establishing benchmarks for an evolving insurance industry.

In 1971, Progressive turned into a stock insurance company with an initial public offering (IPO). That same year, the company entered its commercial insurance business as well as began offering coverage for RVs.

In 1974, Progressive moved to its current headquarters in Mayfield Village, Ohio, where it would continue to set industry standards for decades. This includes:

* Being the first auto company to publish its loss reserve report.
* Streamlining data through the Progressive On-line Transaction Enquiry and Update System (PROTEUS).
* Creating immediate claim response for 24/7 service for policyholders along with the option of purchasing and comparing coverage over the phone.
* Progressive launched the first auto insurance website which evolved into real-time quotes and enrollments. This would be expanded over time to other product lines.
* Several technological innovations including apps, the popular Snapshot discount, and integration with Google Home among proprietary tools to help policyholders.

Today, the company needs no introduction. Progressive is the third-largest property and casualty insurance company in the United States known for its extensive product offerings along with illustrious resources and a quirky marketing campaign.
