**Why Geico made our list**: Geico offers one of the cheapest average minimum coverage premiums in Fresno and won the [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers. While Geico no longer has local agents in California, drivers can still get a policy online, through the mobile app or with an agent over the phone.
**Why Geico may be cheapest for minimum coverage**: Along with low rates, Geico has more discount options than most carriers, including telematics, discounts for teen drivers and affiliation discounts for various clubs and memberships. That said, Geico has a lower-than-average customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power’s [2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) in the California region.

* ###  What is the best car insurance company?
There’s no single [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) since every driver’s needs and preferences are different. For instance, if you have a teen driver in your household, the best provider for you might be the one that gives the highest good student discount. If your main goal is to simplify your insurance, you might choose the company that you already have homeowners or renters insurance with, especially if you get a bundling discount. You can compare quotes from several providers once you have a good idea of what you’re looking for from an insurance company.

Nationally, car insurance rates are at an all-time high right now, and drivers are looking for ways to save money where they can. To avoid losing coverage that is beneficial, you might start by reviewing your current [car insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-guide/) to ensure the basic information is accurate.
