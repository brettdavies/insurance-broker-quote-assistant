Why we picked this company

GEICO largely measures up to its competitors and has some of the lowest national average rates, according to Insurify data. It’s among the biggest national insurers by market share and ranks well for financial strength and long-term credit, meaning it can reliably pay claims.

The insurer offers many discounts for everything from being a good student or federal employee to driving a vehicle with anti-theft systems and taking a defensive driving course.

Here’s how GEICO compares to other large insurers.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
* No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
* Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

## How GEICO rates compare to competitors

GEICO offers competitive rates and is often among the [**cheapest car insurance insurance companies**](/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) available in all U.S. states. Only State Farm, USAA (only available to members of the military community), and a handful of regional insurers beat GEICO’s full-coverage rates, Insurify data shows. COUNTRY Financial, NJM, Auto-Owners, Erie, and Root have cheaper average full-coverage rates, but none sell insurance in all 50 U.S. states like GEICO.

Here’s how GEICO’s [**national average full-coverage rate**](/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/) compares to the rates of other national insurance companies.

#### Full-Coverage Rates by Insurance Company

| Insurance Company | Average Full-Coverage Quote |
| --- | --- |
| State Farm | $109 |
| Allstate | $139 |
| GEICO | $139 |
| Progressive | $173 |
| National General | $177 |
| Nationwide | $180 |
| Travelers | $186 |

## Average cost of GEICO auto insurance

GEICO’s average auto insurance rates are typically well below the national average for full-coverage and liability-only insurance. Even GEICO’s rates for higher-risk drivers, like teens and drivers with an incident on their record, are relatively low.

For example, teen drivers on their own insurance policy pay about 37% more for a GEICO auto insurance policy, versus 73% more for an Allstate policy, according to Insurify data.

Here’s how GEICO’s average monthly liability-only rates compare to the national averages for a few different driver profiles.

### GEICO car insurance cost by state

Several [**rating factors**](/car-insurance/knowledge/factors-that-affect-rates/) affect your auto insurance premiums, and your location is a big one. Your state insurance market, regional inflation, and local severe weather like hail or hurricanes can influence your rates.[[2]](#cite-2) For example, drivers in urban areas pay more expensive rates given the increased risk of theft and accidents in densely populated areas.

GEICO’s average rates are usually among the cheapest available in most states. Rates vary widely state-to-state, though. Arizona drivers pay an average of $119 monthly for liability coverage through GEICO, while New Mexico drivers pay $119 per month.

These are the average monthly liability-only insurance quotes for GEICO in each state, compared to the overall state average liability-only quote.

### GEICO car insurance discounts

It’s important to consider [**car insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) when choosing the right insurance company since savings vary and insurers offer different options. GEICO offers common discounts for things like [**bundling auto with a home insurance policy**](/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/), insuring multiple vehicles, and having an accident-free record. As GEICO started as an insurance company serving military members and federal employees, it still offers special discounts for those drivers.[[3]](#cite-3)

Discounts can lower your premium significantly, so always ask about what discounts you’re eligible for. Not all insurers will automatically apply them to your policy, and you may have to provide documentation to qualify for some discounts.

Here are some discounts available from GEICO and your potential savings.

| **Type of Discount**  sort ascsort desc | **Potential Savings**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-vehicle | Up to 25% |
| Emergency deployment | Up to 25% |
| Airbag | Up to 23% |
| Anti-theft system | Up to 23% |
| Good driver (five years accident-free) | Up to 22% |
| New vehicle discount | Up to 15% |
| Good student | Up to 15% |
| Military | Up to 15% |
| Federal employee | Up to 12% |
| Multi-policy (bundling) | Varies |

Reviewed in Maryland on November 2025

My experience with GEICO was fair, but after going through the whole year with a positive driving record, the new policy they offered me was more than $100 more than the previous 6 months. The fact that I live in the city and only drove maybe 5 miles a week made the renewal quote even more disappointing, which soured me on doing any more business with them.

### GEICO ratings

Industry ratings can help you understand an insurance company’s business reliability and its reputation for customer satisfaction. Global rating agency AM Best rates insurers’ financial strength and credit. A higher score indicates that an insurer has good risk management and can reliably pay claims.

Consumer insights agency J.D. Power measures customer and claims satisfaction among auto insurers, and GEICO mostly ranks around or below average. It ranks second-highest in the usage-based insurance category, likely for its DriveEasy safe driving program.

The insurer’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index score indicates how GEICO’s number of consumer complaints compares to the industry average for a company of its size.

| **Rating**  sort ascsort desc | **Score**  sort ascsort desc | **What This Means**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AM Best | * Financial strength rating: A++ (Superior) * Long-term credit rating: aaa | Highest possible score (best operating performance, business profile, and risk management) |
| J.D. Power | * 692 (2024 Claims Satisfaction Study) * 654 average (2024 Auto Insurance Study) | Ranked around or below study average (scored out of 1,000) |
| NAIC Complaint Index | 0.90 | Received 10% fewer complaints than the market average |

## GEICO car insurance coverage options

GEICO offers standard coverage options, including liability coverage that meets [**state-minimum insurance requirements**](/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/), collision, comprehensive, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages. Drivers can also purchase optional coverages like emergency road service, rental reimbursement, and mechanical breakdown insurance.

Knowing insurance terms and definitions can help you understand policies as you shop, so here’s what each type of coverage includes.

* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d7333ddf2e/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_046-car-accident.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d7333ddf2e/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_046-car-accident.svg)

  #### Liability coverage

  This includes [**bodily injury**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) and property damage liability protection, which cover injuries or damages you cause to another person or their property. It’s generally the cheapest type of insurance you can buy but provides no financial protection for your vehicle.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/31bb162db0/accident-forgiveness.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/31bb162db0/accident-forgiveness.svg)

  #### Collision coverage

  Part of a full-coverage policy, [**collision insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) pays for damage to your car if you hit another vehicle or a stationary object, like a fence or tree. Collision coverage also pays in case of rollover accidents.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg)

  #### Comprehensive coverage

  As part of full-coverage car insurance, [**comprehensive insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) reimburses you for losses from theft or damage from something other than a crash with a car or object. It covers damage from fire, flooding, windstorms, hail, vandalism, animals (including a collision with a deer), and more.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg)

  #### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

  [**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) reimburses you if a driver without insurance — or without enough insurance to cover your damages — hits your vehicle. Uninsured motorist coverage can also pay for medical expenses and vehicle damage in a hit-and-run accident.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg)

  #### Medical payments (MedPay) coverage

  [**MedPay coverage**](/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/) is optional in most states. If you and your passengers need medical attention, it helps cover related bills and funeral expenses, no matter who’s at fault.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg)

  #### Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage

  [**Personal injury protection**](/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/)covers accident-related medical expenses, lost wages, household services, and funeral expenses for you and your passengers, regardless of fault. Some states with [**no-fault insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/no-fault-insurance/) systems require drivers to carry personal injury protection.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/73ee7a876e/repair.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/73ee7a876e/repair.svg)

  #### Mechanical breakdown

  Mechanical breakdown insurance covers repair costs if your car breaks down, needs parts replaced, or has other mechanical problems and could mean you pay less out of pocket for covered repairs.

  It’s available for cars less than 15 months old and with fewer than 15,000 miles. But after you’ve purchased it, you can renew your mechanical breakdown coverage for up to seven years or 100,000 miles.

  #### Rental reimbursement

  This coverage will help pay for a rental car if your vehicle is in the shop for repairs after a covered claim.

### How GEICO DriveEasy works

DriveEasy is GEICO’s [**usage-based telematics car insurance program**](/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/), which uses a mobile app to assess your driving habits. If you participate in the program, GEICO uses information from the app to rate your policy and determine your premium.[[4]](#cite-4) Safe driving habits could result in a discount, although GEICO’s website doesn’t specify exactly how much that discount could save drivers.

The app monitors your driving by tracking things like hard braking, phone usage, and how fast you drive around corners. While some usage-based insurance programs can use your car’s internal system or an attached sensor to track your driving, GEICO’s program is only available to smartphone users able to download the app. The GEICO DriveEasy Pro app is available in the App Store and Google Play and has moderate ratings in both.

With the Accident Assist feature, DriveEasy can detect a hard brake and will send you a notification to check that you’re OK. If you need help, GEICO can help contact emergency or other services.

GEICO’s usage-based insurance product scored in the top three for customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, behind Nationwide and USAA.[[1]](#cite-1) While GEICO is available in all U.S. states and D.C., DriveEasy is only available in 37 states.

## GEICO insurance FAQs

If you’re still considering whether GEICO is a good fit for you, here are some answers to frequently asked questions to help inform your decision.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Yes. GEICO is a legitimate company. Its high financial strength and long-term credit ratings from AM Best reflect a solid business. The company is also longstanding — its founders established the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) in 1936.

A GEICO liability-only policy costs $91 per month, on average. A full-coverage policy costs $139 per month, on average. Your location, driving record, credit history, age, and other factors will affect how much you pay.

GEICO’s AM Best rating of A++ indicates superior financial strength and the appropriate risk management to pay out claims. But the company scored well below average (692 on a 1,000-point scale) in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.

You must call GEICO to cancel a policy. Be sure to have your policy number handy when you call. To avoid a lapse in coverage, be sure to set up your next auto insurance policy before canceling your GEICO policy.

In J.D. Power’s most recent studies, GEICO typically ranks around or below average for customer satisfaction. It has a below-average NAIC complaint index, though, which means the company receives fewer complaints than the market average for an insurer of its size.
