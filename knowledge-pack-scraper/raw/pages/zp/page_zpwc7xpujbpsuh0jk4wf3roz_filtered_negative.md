#  Adding my son to my auto policy - MASSIVE premium increase
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
I understand why risk/premium would increase adding a teenage son to my policy. And yes, that teenage son will be primarily driving the gas car. I really try to look at things reasonably through the insurance companies’ point of view. I would be perfectly willing to pay more for that added risk. But nearly _quadrupling_ my insurance cost, including nearly doubling the premium on the EV I don’t even let him drive, simply because I disclose that I have a teenage driver in the home seems patently excessive to me. And again, this seems to apply across all carriers.
It encourages people to not disclose teenage drivers. And, indeed, that’s what I’m going to have to do. I have no choice. I cannot afford this premium. It’s insanity. The law in my state is that _the car_ needs to be insured. And I am (and always have been) insuring the cars. While I understand that abusing the “permissive use” of one of those cars by allowing a non-disclosed individual to regularly drive it could get me in hot water with my insurer, it’s a risk I’m going to have to take.
When I talked to a couple of other dads about this, they both laughed at me. “That’s your dumbass fault for disclosing your son. I don’t. I insure _the cars._ That’s all you have to do.” I think that may be technically right as a matter of state law, but could still violate my contract.

Okay, first and foremost, your friends are idiots. Drivers in their first three years of driving have a 75% chance of causing an at fault accident. When one of their children does so and is not on a policy and your friends get their wages garnished or otherwise have to cough up tens of thousands of dollars, you will look like the smart one. And in most states, the DMV tells the insurance company that there's an uninsured driver in the household, often leading to force placed coverage so they're getting stuck with a bill regardless.
Insurance is one of the most competitive, regulated and low margin businesses in America. They literally take in less than they pay out and make the rest up with investments. So they very likely adequately priced your drivers. And yes, getting the points taken off the licenses after any non-accident related moving violation is a must if you want to keep costs down (your kid messed up there).
I try to tell people to think of it this way: we're charging you four thousand dollars a year but we're exposed to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars per driver in your household.
Yes, youthful operators are expensive. So are claims.

If you cant afford the 4,000 to add him to your insurance, how do you think you will be able to afford the $100k+ if he causes a major accident?
Its expensive because youthful drivers cause a lot of accidents, not because they are price gouging you.

So assuming 4000 a year, that's an increase of 2800, or 233 dollars a month. That sounds about right for a high risk teenage boy. If he wants to drive, he can get a job and pay for his insurance cost. He chose to drive recklessly.
I paid 150 a month for liability only when I was in highschool, because I picked up traffic tickets. And it's been a long time since then, costs and inflation have increased by a lot.

This. At 17, he's old enough to drive? He's old enough to get a job washing dishes or stocking shelves.
At $15 an hour minimum wage, can bring in that amount + a bit of fun money with only 2 shifts per week. And during school vacation, can work more than that.
Kid already has a speeding ticket, make him work to pay the fine, insurance surcharges, and the premium increase from adding to your policy. What's the problem here?

You’ll be back here soon after he gets into an accident with one of the cars and insurance will be unwilling to pay out.

So you are going to self insure by not disclosing. You can afford the replacement cost on either car plus whatever other cars and medical bills the other people who could be involved might have? Your insurer believes that’s worth at least 2,800 a year in risk betting he won’t be in an accident but realizes it could be your policy maxes if he does. That’s a brave bet on your part.
If you don’t disclose your insurer can - and will - not cover an accident he is involved with. Your assets are will.

Please do not take advice from those other dads. If you just insure the car and do not include the risk of your son as a driver, when he causes an accident, they would deny the claim and you would be on the hook for all of the damages.

You have a teenage male driver with a speeding ticket. The ink is barely dry on his license and he has already proven to be unsafe. Of course insurance is going to be high.

I don’t understand why your son needs to drive a car at all. He’s a kid, why not just stick to a bicycle?
He’s proven he can’t be trusted to drive responsibly, he’s in a high-risk driver group, and it’s unaffordable for you. Either take the keys from him, or tell him to get a part time job and use the money to pay for his own insurance.

Spend some time reading through this sub and find all the people who decided premiums were too expensive (FA) and then the driver in question got into an accident. Insurance declined to cover any of the costs since they were not disclosed or were actively excluded from the policy and now they’re crying because they facing massive judgements (FO).

Your friends are committing fraud and when one of their kids crashes their cars they will be in a world of hurt when the ins denies them for purposely hiding the information.
Your son is 17, with a speeding ticket. The fact it’s only going up a couple hundred a month is cheap. You can A. Add him and hope he drives better until the premium goes down. Or B. Exclude him completely and NEVER let him drive either car under any circumstances.

Not your attorney. Not legal advice.
Last year I took someone’s house they were renting out because they decided to save money and not insure their kid. Normally they’d have a homestead exemption but they were renting it and renting themselves elsewhere. 850K gone. If the guy had just 100k in coverage for their kid it would have settled I’m sure.
One of the firms I worked with specializes in garnishing wages and levying bank accounts on 200k+ judgments. Typically from accidents from an undisclosed minor or being uninsured themselves. These big judgments don’t go away in any state and if you have a big asset like a house you can’t BK the judgement.
Long story short. Don’t be uninsured. Don’t lie about your household members. Because you might be staring down a $200k+ judgment gaining 5-10% per year for the rest of your life. And when the judgment is renewed the interest goes to the principle. There are law firms that specialize in collecting on these judgments and unlike normal collection groups they don’t settle for pennies on the dollar. They look to collect the whole thing over the course of the rest of your life.

Permissive use oftentimes excludes people in your own household. Permissive use covers “I let my partner, who lives in a different residence, drive my car once and they got in a fender bender.” It does not cover “my son lives with me and drives my car daily, I didn’t want to pay an increased premium to cover his driving.”

There will probably be someone along in the next 2 weeks to 2 years to get pissed off at this, but teenaged boys are the dumbest people on the planet. There are exceptions, but the rule is that they're more likely to do dangerous stuff on impulse. There's science that backs me up.
So not only do you have a teenaged boy, but you've got one that's already made a mistake bad enough to be caught by a cop. That makes a high risk even higher because now there's proof that he's not a safe driver.
You can try to play the "hide the teenager game" (hopefully not in the Boy Scouts way), but if there's a claim you're going to get caught, and whoever you lied to (because you're going to have to lie) is going to deny the claim - rightfully. That will leave you solely on the hook for whatever happened, maybe if it didn't even involve your son. Your friends are idiots that will suffer the same fate if they get caught.
So if your son is at fault for something, and you haven't disclosed him, that doesn't take you - or him - off the hook for the damage he caused.
You should look at seeing what discounts he can get (good student, traffic school, etc.), consider excluding him completely so that he's your ex's problems (and not letting him drive your cars) or making him pay for at least some of the cost of his privilege to drive.

Seriously OP, have your teenager get a job. They can work 2-3 shifts a week (weekends, evenings) during school and more during vacation weeks/summer. They will easily earn enough after taxes to pay the annual increases in premiums (and you can put them on notice they will have to pay for any deductibles/damages/citations as well going forward, skin in the game and all that).
Going without insurance is insane. If your kid kills someone you are going to lose everything.

Your logic is flawed. If he gets in an accident and he is not listed on his own or your policy, your insurer will refuse to cover any damage, injury, etc and your house and jewelry and cars and all that you have worked and saved for will be gone. Manage risks accordingly. If you can afford a nice EV and the large depreciation it has taken then you can certainly afford his car insurance or he has to pay the $3k difference. Choose wisely
