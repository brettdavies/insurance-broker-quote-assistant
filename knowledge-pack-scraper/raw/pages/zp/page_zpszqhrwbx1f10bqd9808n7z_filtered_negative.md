That’s why [comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/how-to-compare-car-insurance.html) from multiple insurers is important.
* **Discounts.** Most insurers offer a fairly big multiple auto insurance discount. While it varies by insurer, you can expect up to 25% savings with a multi-car policy.
* **Car insurance stacking.** In states that allow it, you can stack your uninsured or underinsured bodily injury motorist (UM/UIM) coverage when you have multiple vehicles on the same policy.
* **One renewal date.** All of your cars will have coverage renewed at the same time.
Most insurance companies require that you have the same amount of [liability insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/auto-liability-insurance-guide.html) and [uninsured motorist](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage.html) coverage on each vehicle, but when it comes to [collision and comprehensive](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html) and other options, it varies.
When a claimAn insurance claim is a request you make to your insurance company for coverage after your car is damaged or you have an accident. You can file a claim online, by phone, or in writing. is filed, only the coverage on the car involved will apply. So, if one car has [full coverage](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/full-coverage.html) (collision and comprehensive) and one has only liability, the liability-only car will not be covered if it’s damaged.
