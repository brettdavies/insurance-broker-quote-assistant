At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes.

Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $91/mo  
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $139/mo

The insurer offers many discounts for everything from being a good student or federal employee to driving a vehicle with anti-theft systems and taking a defensive driving course.
Here’s how GEICO compares to other large insurers.
Pros
  * Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
  * No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available

## How GEICO rates compare to competitors
GEICO offers competitive rates and is often among the [**cheapest car insurance insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) available in all U.S. states. Only State Farm, USAA (only available to members of the military community), and a handful of regional insurers beat GEICO’s full-coverage rates, Insurify data shows. COUNTRY Financial, NJM, Auto-Owners, Erie, and Root have cheaper average full-coverage rates, but none sell insurance in all 50 U.S. states like GEICO.
Here’s how GEICO’s [**national average full-coverage rate**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/) compares to the rates of other national insurance companies.
#### Full-Coverage Rates by Insurance Company
## Average cost of GEICO auto insurance
GEICO’s average auto insurance rates are typically well below the national average for full-coverage and liability-only insurance. Even GEICO’s rates for higher-risk drivers, like teens and drivers with an incident on their record, are relatively low. 
For example, teen drivers on their own insurance policy pay about 37% more for a GEICO auto insurance policy, versus 73% more for an Allstate policy, according to Insurify data.
Here’s how GEICO’s average monthly liability-only rates compare to the national averages for a few different driver profiles.

### GEICO car insurance cost by state
Several [**rating factors**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/factors-that-affect-rates/) affect your auto insurance premiums, and your location is a big one. Your state insurance market, regional inflation, and local severe weather like hail or hurricanes can influence your rates.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-2) For example, drivers in urban areas pay more expensive rates given the increased risk of theft and accidents in densely populated areas.
GEICO’s average rates are usually among the cheapest available in most states. Rates vary widely state-to-state, though. Arizona drivers pay an average of $119 monthly for liability coverage through GEICO, while New Mexico drivers pay $119 per month.
These are the average monthly liability-only insurance quotes for GEICO in each state, compared to the overall state average liability-only quote.

### GEICO car insurance discounts
It’s important to consider [**car insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) when choosing the right insurance company since savings vary and insurers offer different options. GEICO offers common discounts for things like [**bundling auto with a home insurance policy**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/), insuring multiple vehicles, and having an accident-free record. As GEICO started as an insurance company serving military members and federal employees, it still offers special discounts for those drivers.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-3)
Discounts can lower your premium significantly, so always ask about what discounts you’re eligible for. Not all insurers will automatically apply them to your policy, and you may have to provide documentation to qualify for some discounts.
Here are some discounts available from GEICO and your potential savings.

When you get a quote that's greater, it's time to say later!
Reviewed in Maryland on November 2025
My experience with GEICO was fair, but after going through the whole year with a positive driving record, the new policy they offered me was more than $100 more than the previous 6 months. The fact that I live in the city and only drove maybe 5 miles a week made the renewal quote even more disappointing, which soured me on doing any more business with them.

### GEICO ratings
Industry ratings can help you understand an insurance company’s business reliability and its reputation for customer satisfaction. Global rating agency AM Best rates insurers’ financial strength and credit. A higher score indicates that an insurer has good risk management and can reliably pay claims.
Consumer insights agency J.D. Power measures customer and claims satisfaction among auto insurers, and GEICO mostly ranks around or below average. It ranks second-highest in the usage-based insurance category, likely for its DriveEasy safe driving program.
The insurer’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index score indicates how GEICO’s number of consumer complaints compares to the industry average for a company of its size.

## GEICO car insurance coverage options
GEICO offers standard coverage options, including liability coverage that meets [**state-minimum insurance requirements**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/), collision, comprehensive, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages. Drivers can also purchase optional coverages like emergency road service, rental reimbursement, and mechanical breakdown insurance.
Knowing insurance terms and definitions can help you understand policies as you shop, so here’s what each type of coverage includes.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d7333ddf2e/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_046-car-accident.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d7333ddf2e/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_046-car-accident.svg)
#### Liability coverage
This includes [**bodily injury**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) and property damage liability protection, which cover injuries or damages you cause to another person or their property. It’s generally the cheapest type of insurance you can buy but provides no financial protection for your vehicle.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/31bb162db0/accident-forgiveness.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/31bb162db0/accident-forgiveness.svg)
#### Collision coverage
Part of a full-coverage policy, [**collision insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) pays for damage to your car if you hit another vehicle or a stationary object, like a fence or tree. Collision coverage also pays in case of rollover accidents.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg)
#### Comprehensive coverage
As part of full-coverage car insurance, [**comprehensive insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) reimburses you for losses from theft or damage from something other than a crash with a car or object. It covers damage from fire, flooding, windstorms, hail, vandalism, animals (including a collision with a deer), and more.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg)
#### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
[**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) reimburses you if a driver without insurance — or without enough insurance to cover your damages — hits your vehicle. Uninsured motorist coverage can also pay for medical expenses and vehicle damage in a hit-and-run accident.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg)
#### Medical payments (MedPay) coverage
[**MedPay coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/) is optional in most states. If you and your passengers need medical attention, it helps cover related bills and funeral expenses, no matter who’s at fault.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg)
#### Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage
[**Personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/)[**no-fault insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/no-fault-insurance/) systems require drivers to carry personal injury protection.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/73ee7a876e/repair.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/73ee7a876e/repair.svg)
#### Mechanical breakdown
Mechanical breakdown insurance covers repair costs if your car breaks down, needs parts replaced, or has other mechanical problems and could mean you pay less out of pocket for covered repairs.
It’s available for cars less than 15 months old and with fewer than 15,000 miles. But after you’ve purchased it, you can renew your mechanical breakdown coverage for up to seven years or 100,000 miles.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/9997698e9e/emergency-roadside-service.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/9997698e9e/emergency-roadside-service.svg)
#### Emergency road service
Like most large insurers, GEICO offers optional emergency [**roadside assistance coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-roadside-assistance/). GEICO’s service includes 24/7 assistance for towing after a breakdown, tire changes, battery jump-starts, fuel delivery, and more.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/f82464c85b/car-sharing-96x96-orange_048-car-key.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/f82464c85b/car-sharing-96x96-orange_048-car-key.svg)
#### Rental reimbursement
This coverage will help pay for a rental car if your vehicle is in the shop for repairs after a covered claim.


### Other options for GEICO customers
GEICO offers many other types of insurance, and auto insurance customers could save by bundling with other GEICO policies, like renters or homeowners insurance.
A few more available coverages from GEICO include:
  * **Vehicle:** GEICO will insure your motorcycle, RV, boat, collector or classic car, truck, and more.
  * **Property:** GEICO sells renters, homeowners, condo, mobile home, landlord, flood, and earthquake insurance.

### How GEICO DriveEasy works
DriveEasy is GEICO’s [**usage-based telematics car insurance program**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/), which uses a mobile app to assess your driving habits. If you participate in the program, GEICO uses information from the app to rate your policy and determine your premium.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-4) Safe driving habits could result in a discount, although GEICO’s website doesn’t specify exactly how much that discount could save drivers.
The app monitors your driving by tracking things like hard braking, phone usage, and how fast you drive around corners. While some usage-based insurance programs can use your car’s internal system or an attached sensor to track your driving, GEICO’s program is only available to smartphone users able to download the app. The GEICO DriveEasy Pro app is available in the App Store and Google Play and has moderate ratings in both.
With the Accident Assist feature, DriveEasy can detect a hard brake and will send you a notification to check that you’re OK. If you need help, GEICO can help contact emergency or other services.
GEICO’s usage-based insurance product scored in the top three for customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, behind Nationwide and USAA.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-1) While GEICO is available in all U.S. states and D.C., DriveEasy is only available in 37 states.
## GEICO insurance FAQs
If you’re still considering whether GEICO is a good fit for you, here are some answers to frequently asked questions to help inform your decision.
  * ### Is GEICO legitimate?
Yes. GEICO is a legitimate company. Its high financial strength and long-term credit ratings from AM Best reflect a solid business. The company is also longstanding — its founders established the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) in 1936.
  * ### What is the average cost of GEICO car insurance?
A GEICO liability-only policy costs $91 per month, on average. A full-coverage policy costs $139 per month, on average. Your location, driving record, credit history, age, and other factors will affect how much you pay.
  * ### Is GEICO good at paying claims?
GEICO’s AM Best rating of A++ indicates superior financial strength and the appropriate risk management to pay out claims. But the company scored well below average (692 on a 1,000-point scale) in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.
  * ### How do I cancel my GEICO insurance policy?
You must call GEICO to cancel a policy. Be sure to have your policy number handy when you call. To avoid a lapse in coverage, be sure to set up your next auto insurance policy before canceling your GEICO policy.
  * ### What is GEICO’s customer satisfaction rating?
In J.D. Power’s most recent studies, GEICO typically ranks around or below average for customer satisfaction. It has a below-average NAIC complaint index, though, which means the company receives fewer complaints than the market average for an insurer of its size.


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible
