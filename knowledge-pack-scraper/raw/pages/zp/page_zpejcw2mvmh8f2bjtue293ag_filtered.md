## Best cheap car insurance companies in Fresno

Although car insurance in Fresno is pricier than the national [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), Fresno drivers still have plenty of [cheap insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) to choose from, but finding the lowest price may not be their only consideration. To find the best cheap car insurance companies in Fresno for your lifestyle, Bankrate reviewed the latest average quoted premiums using data from Quadrant Information Services.

Factors that go into our five-point Bankrate Score scale include elements like customer service, customer satisfaction, mobile app availability and local agent presence. Specifically, we analyzed the California region of the [2024 J.D. Power Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) for customer satisfaction. The closer a provider scores to five on our Bankrate Score, the better it fared across these categories.

The company offers standard coverage and endorsements.

**Why Wawanesa may be cheapest for young drivers:** While Wawanesa does have a lower Bankrate Score, the rates it offers for teen drivers are drastically lower than other carriers in the area. This low score is partially due to its limited digital tools.

## How much is car insurance in Fresno, California?

The average cost of full coverage car insurance in Fresno is $2,895 per year, which is 7 percent less than the state average of $3,102. Fresno drivers who carry car insurance with minimum coverage pay an average of $836 per year, which is 9 percent less than California's average minimum rate of $915. Car insurance is a highly individualized product. What you pay for insurance will depend on factors such as your driving history, driving experience, coverage selection and more.

### Fresno rates for teens

[Teens drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/), also referred to as youthful operators in the insurance industry, are considered high-risk drivers in most states. It takes time to learn good driving skills, such as avoiding road hazards and adjusting your driving to accommodate weather conditions. New drivers have yet to learn those skills, and behaviors like forgetting to wear a seatbelt and speeding cause more frequent and more severe accidents. Car insurance companies underwrite and rate for this added risk, which is why teens cost so much to insure.

Teens may be able to save money by staying on their parents' policy for as long as possible. When adding a new driver to an existing policy, the driving history and experience of the named insured and other active drivers might help offset a young driver's risk.

### Fresno rates for young drivers

[Car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) usually start to decrease as they age and gain more driving experience. Around the age of 20, it is common for young adults to move out of the family home and get their own place and their own car insurance. To help save money when starting a new policy, keep in mind that some discounts, like driver training and good student discounts, can move with you to your policy until you turn 25. At 25, drivers are moved into the standard risk pool where age less impacts auto premiums.

### Fresno rates for senior drivers

### Car insurance after an accident in Fresno

Between drowsy driving and distracted driving, car accidents have been on the rise nationwide. After an at-fault car accident, your insurer can surcharge your policy for up to three years in California. While drivers with accident forgiveness on their policies might not see a spike in premiums, most drivers do. Finding a carrier that charges lower-than-average rates for drivers involved in at-fault accidents can help you save money during your surcharge period.

Minimum coverage requirements in Fresno

To legally drive in the state of [California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california/), you need to carry at least a [minimum amount of liability insurance](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/), including the following coverages and limits:

* $30,000 in bodily injury per person
* $60,000 in bodily injury per accident
* $15,000 for property damage

California insurers are also required to offer uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, but drivers have the option to decline it. Although these are the listed minimums, drivers of California-registered vehicles could forego these limits by way of making a $75,000 cash deposit to the Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV), obtaining a self-insured certificate from the DMV or purchasing a $75,000 surety bond from a company licensed in California.

Minimum coverage car insurance rates vary [state by state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) and may be cheaper than full coverage plans. However, not all drivers benefit from choosing the minimum amount of coverage. If you are in an at-fault accident and the damages exceed your insurance amount, you will have to pay the difference out of pocket. In addition, liability insurance only provides reimbursement for the damages you cause others. To include protection for your vehicle, you would need [full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/). In fact, if you plan on getting a car loan or leasing a vehicle, you will likely be required to purchase a full coverage car insurance policy.

With so many options at your fingertips, you may want to take time to find the best and [cheapest car insurance in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) for your specific needs.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze the latest rates in September 2025 for ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates include the most recent approved rate changes filed by insurance companies that affect our profile. These revised rates are then weighted based on the population density in each geographic region so that policyholders can see the impact rates have in their areas. Quoted rates are based on a 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
