# Adding my son to my auto policy - MASSIVE premium increase

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

I have two cars. A nice newer EV and a cheaper older “grocery getter” gas car which I was using primarily for when I take road trips and don’t want to hassle with charging. I have no tickets, and two comp (glass) claims in the past seven years. My annual cost to insure both cars with liability and comp coverage, 100/300/100 limits, and $1,000 deductibles is a combined annual premium of about $1,200. Seems reasonable to me.

Adding my 17yo son to my policy, with one speeding ticket, increases my total premium to nearly $4,000 annually!! And yes, I’ve exhaustively shopped the policy. I’ve played around with coverages. I’ve even tried dropping comp entirely on the older car. It doesn’t make that much of a difference. Disclosing my son massively increases the insurance on BOTH cars, even the nice one I don’t let him drive.

I understand why risk/premium would increase adding a teenage son to my policy. And yes, that teenage son will be primarily driving the gas car. I really try to look at things reasonably through the insurance companies’ point of view. I would be perfectly willing to pay more for that added risk. But nearly *quadrupling* my insurance cost, including nearly doubling the premium on the EV I don’t even let him drive, simply because I disclose that I have a teenage driver in the home seems patently excessive to me. And again, this seems to apply across all carriers.

It encourages people to not disclose teenage drivers. And, indeed, that’s what I’m going to have to do. I have no choice. I cannot afford this premium. It’s insanity. The law in my state is that *the car* needs to be insured. And I am (and always have been) insuring the cars. While I understand that abusing the “permissive use” of one of those cars by allowing a non-disclosed individual to regularly drive it could get me in hot water with my insurer, it’s a risk I’m going to have to take.

It’s also a problem because I pay the insurance but I am basically being held hostage by my son and ex-wife over speeding tickets. I made CLEAR to both of them when he first started driving that if he ever got a ticket he needed to come to me to fix it - double the cost to keep it off his record - because otherwise it would cost much more in insurance. What did he do? Went to his mom whom paid the effing ticket knowing damn well it would raise my insurance rates through the roof. I cannot stop her from doing this!

When I talked to a couple of other dads about this, they both laughed at me. “That’s your dumbass fault for disclosing your son. I don’t. I insure *the cars.* That’s all you have to do.” I think that may be technically right as a matter of state law, but could still violate my contract.

Anyway, would appreciate your thoughts on the likely outcome in the event my son gets in a serious liability-inducing wreck. That’s the only thing I’m concerned about by not disclosing him.

I’m generally sympathetic to insurance companies needing to run a business, but this is freaking ridiculous.
