## About Progressive home insurance

Progressive home insurance policies come primarily from third parties. The company matches consumers with home insurers through the Progressive Advantage Agency, which shops around on your behalf.

Which insurer you purchase your policy from depends on how you buy: online, over the phone or through an agent. Although you’re limited to the insurers Progressive works with, having the company shop for you could save you time.

Options include insurers like [Homesite](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/homesite-home-insurance-review), [Openly](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/openly-home-insurance-review), [Nationwide](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/nationwide-home-insurance-review) and American Strategic Insurance, a Progressive subsidiary now known as Progressive Home. Whichever company you choose, claims will go through that home insurer.

## Get home insurance quotes in minutes

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

* ### Why doesn’t this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  We make every effort to rate each company we review. However, we’re sometimes unable to provide a NerdWallet star rating for insurers that work with multiple third parties to underwrite their policies. That’s because the quality of the policy you get may vary depending on the coverage options, financial strength and other factors of each separate underwriting company.

### Where Progressive home insurance stands out

**Discount for Progressive auto policyholders.** If you’ve already got car insurance with Progressive, you can get a bundling discount for buying a homeowners policy as well.

**Choice of carriers.** Progressive will shop around with multiple insurers to help you find a policy you’re comfortable with.

**Single deductible.** If disaster strikes your home and car at the same time, you may have to pay only one deductible. Say a storm knocks a tree over onto your house and car. As long as you have both Progressive car insurance and a homeowners policy underwritten by Progressive Home, you'll pay one deductible for both claims.

### Where Progressive home insurance falls short

**Claim filing.** You can’t file a homeowners claim on Progressive’s website the way you can for an auto claim. Instead, you’ll need to call the company that underwrites your policy.

## More Nerdy Perspective

One of the biggest factors in how much you pay for homeowners insurance is the amount of coverage you buy. Get too little coverage, and you could find yourself underinsured after a major disaster. Get too much, and you’ll overpay. Here’s how to figure out [how much homeowners insurance you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need).

## What Reddit users say about Progressive home insurance

*Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like homeowners insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

Reddit comments about Progressive home insurance tend to be negative, particularly for those matched with Homesite as their third-party insurer. In particular, Redditors complain about Homesite’s poor claims handling and customer service. More generally, some users have noticed their Progressive home insurance rates going up even if they haven’t filed any claims.

## Questions from Reddit: Our experts answer

### Why did my Progressive home insurance rates go up?

Homeowners insurance premiums are generally on the rise across the U.S. That’s partly due to inflation — homes now cost more to rebuild due to higher prices for labor and materials. Also, recent natural disasters like [hurricanes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/hurricane-insurance), tornadoes and [wildfires](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/wildfire-insurance) have forced insurers to pay billions of dollars in claims.

All of this means you may pay more for your home insurance coverage. You may even have trouble getting a policy at all, especially if you live in an at-risk area. Learn more about [how to protect your home from climate change](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/climate-change-homeowners-insurance).

### Should you work with an agent or broker when buying Progressive home insurance?

Progressive makes it possible to buy homeowners insurance online without speaking to an agent. This can be quick and convenient as long as you feel comfortable with the coverage and quote you’re offered.

However, you may benefit from working with an agent or broker if your insurance needs are complicated or you have coverage questions. Agents and brokers can also shop around on your behalf, which may save you time over reaching out to individual companies yourself.

**» MORE:** [Insurance brokers: What they do and who needs one](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/insurance-brokers)

## How to file a claim with Progressive

To file a homeowners claim, you’ll need to contact the company that issued your policy. Not sure who that is? Call Progressive at 800-776-4737, and a representative will transfer you to the right place.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

## How to contact Progressive customer service

**Phone:** Call 888-671-4405, seven days a week.

**Email:** Submit the form on Progressive’s contact page.

**Chatbot:** You can chat with Flo, Progressive’s virtual assistant, on Progressive’s contact page.

## Online tools

**Website:** You can use the site to get quotes from multiple insurers with the company's HomeQuote Explorer tool. The site also has a robust answers page dedicated to educational articles and FAQs.

**Mobile app:** Although Progressive has an app, you can't currently use it to manage homeowners policies.

## Progressive home insurance vs. competitors

### Progressive home insurance vs. State Farm

The biggest differences between Progressive and State Farm home insurance are:

**Business structure.** State Farm sells its own policies while Progressive shops around with multiple third parties on your behalf. With both companies, you can buy a policy online, by phone or through an agent.

**Coverage for the structure of your home.** State Farm policies generally come with a nice perk: extended replacement coverage for your dwelling. This feature gives you a little extra coverage for the structure of your home in case it costs more than expected to rebuild. The coverage may also be available with your policy from Progressive, depending on your third-party insurer, but it may come at an additional cost.

To learn more, read our [State Farm home insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/state-farm-home-insurance-review).

### Progressive home insurance vs. GEICO

The primary differences between Progressive and GEICO are:

**Choice of insurers.** Although both Progressive and GEICO sell home insurance through third parties, Progressive may give you more than one company to choose from when you get a quote.

**State availability.** While Progressive policies aren’t available in Alaska or Hawaii, GEICO sells homeowners insurance through partners in all 50 states.

Get more details in our [GEICO home insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/geico-home-insurance-review).

### Progressive home insurance vs. Allstate

The main differences between Progressive and Allstate home insurance are:

**Policy options.** Allstate writes its own homeowners policies while Progressive sells them through third parties. Progressive may offer you a choice of companies, while Allstate typically will give you a quote only for its own policies.

**Optional coverage.** Allstate offers a long list of coverage options, many of which you can view on its website to choose from. Meanwhile, Progressive’s coverage choices options depend on the company you’re matched with.

## Frequently asked questions

### Does Progressive offer mobile home insurance?

As with homeowners insurance, Progressive’s mobile home insurance is available through third parties. Depending on which insurer you end up with, you may be able to add trip collision coverage. This type of insurance pays out if your mobile home is damaged while in transit. Learn more about [manufactured and mobile home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/mobile-home-insurance).

### What other types of insurance does Progressive offer?

Progressive sells renters and condo insurance through third parties. Progressive offers its own auto, boat, motorcycle and ATV insurance. To learn more, see NerdWallet’s [Progressive auto insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/progressive-auto-insurance-review).

### Does Progressive home insurance cover water damage?

It depends on how the damage happened. Say a pipe bursts and ruins your carpet and drywall. That would typically be covered because it was a sudden accident that took place within your house. But if the damage comes from a slow leak that you haven’t gotten around to fixing, that wouldn’t be covered. Nor would flooding from an external source, such as a river overflowing its banks. For that, you’ll need separate [flood insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance).

Depending on which third-party insurer Progressive matches you up with, you may be able to add water backup coverage. This optional insurance pays for damage if your sump pump fails or a sewer line clogs. Learn more about [homeowners insurance and water damage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage).

### Who does Progressive use for homeowners insurance?
