* **Felony Charges and Sentences**: [DUI can be classified as a felony](https://dohmanlaw.com/is-dui-a-felony-in-Illinois/) if an injury is involved. The specific class of felony depends on the circumstances. Depending on the severity of injury you could be charged with a Class 4 or Class 2 felony. Convictions may lead to prison sentences ranging from 1 to 12 years, depending on the case and the offender’s criminal history.
* **Court-Mandated Alcohol Education Programs**: For first-time offenders or those with minimal prior criminal history, the [court often requires participation in an alcohol education program](https://dohmanlaw.com/alcohol-courses-after-a-dui/). These programs educate individuals about the risks and consequences of alcohol use, focusing on the impact of impaired driving.
* **Individual Counseling**: Focused on identifying and addressing personal patterns of alcohol misuse.
* **Group Therapy**: Provides a supportive environment where participants can share experiences and coping strategies.
* **Residential Treatment (if required)**: For those with significant alcohol dependency, the court may order inpatient treatment.
* Medical expenses for treatment and rehabilitation.
* Lost wages due to the inability to work during recovery.
* Pain and suffering resulting from physical and emotional trauma.
* Loss of quality of life if the injury leads to long-term disability or impairment.
* **Prior DUI Convictions**: A [driver’s history with DUI offenses](https://dohmanlaw.com/second-time-dui/) is another significant factor. First-time offenders may face lighter penalties than individuals with prior convictions. Repeat offenders are more likely to receive extended jail time, higher fines, and longer license suspensions.
* **Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)**: A higher BAC level at the time of the offense can lead to increased penalties. Illinois law sets harsher consequences for [drivers with a BAC significantly above the legal limit](https://dohmanlaw.com/illinois-blood-alcohol-concentration/) of 0.08%.
* Driving without a valid license or insurance.
* Having a child passenger in the vehicle.
* Fleeing the scene of the accident.
[Hiring a lawyer for DUI](https://dohmanlaw.com/what-does-a-dui-lawyer-do/) with bodily injury charges is crucial due to the serious consequences associated with such offenses. Here are several reasons why legal representation is essential:
Having [prior DUI convictions significantly increases the penalties for a DUI](https://dohmanlaw.com/penalties-for-an-aggravated-dui/) involving bodily injury in Illinois. Courts and prosecutors view repeat offenses as a sign of habitual unsafe behavior, which often results in harsher consequences.
For a [first-time DUI](https://dohmanlaw.com/first-time-dui/) involving bodily injury, penalties might include jail time, fines, and license suspension. However, if you have prior DUIs on your record, the penalties escalate. Repeat offenders face longer jail sentences, heavier fines, and extended license revocations. Additionally, a third or subsequent DUI conviction in Illinois is considered a felony, which compounds the severity of the punishment.
If you’re facing a DUI with bodily injury charge in Illinois, it’s crucial to understand the serious implications it may have on your life. The consequences can be severe, but with the right legal guidance, you can work toward minimizing penalties and protecting your future. Reach out to a [skilled DUI attorney](https://dohmanlaw.com/wheaton/dui-lawyer/) today to discuss your case and ensure you have the support needed to navigate this complex situation. Don’t wait—take action now to secure the best possible outcome.
