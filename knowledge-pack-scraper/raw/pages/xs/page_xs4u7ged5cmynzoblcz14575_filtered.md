## Auto insurance requirements in Florida

[Florida](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/florida-car-insurance/) law requires that all drivers must carry certain amounts of car insurance coverage. However, as a no-fault state, the requirements for Florida drivers are quite different than in many states. Bodily injury liability coverage is one such requirement; a mandatory coverage in most states, Florida car insurance laws do not require it, instead relying on [personal injury protection](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/pip-insurance/) (PIP) to cover injuries.

Below you’ll find the minimum car insurance requirements for the state of Florida. Keep in mind that those who [finance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-financed-vehicle/) or [lease](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-leased-vehicle/) a car could face additional requirements from a lender or leasing company.

#### What about bodily injury coverage?

Florida is a [no-fault state](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/what-no-fault-insurance/). This means your own personal injury protection (PIP) insurance provides coverage up to policy limits, regardless of who is at fault. Unlike most states, residents of Florida are not required to have bodily injury liability, as PIP coverage handles relevant medical costs. However, PIP insurance does not cover pain and suffering, which must be sought through the legal system.

| Property Damage Liability (PDL) | Personal Injury Protection (PIP) |
| --- | --- |
| $10,000 | $10,000 |

## Liability coverage in Florida

If you cause an accident, [liability insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) covers those injured or who suffer damages. Liability insurance never covers your injuries or damages to your property. It pays the other driver only. [Property damage liability](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/) will cover the cost of any damage caused to another vehicle by you. The at-fault driver is still responsible for paying for property damage caused, though the $10,000 limit is quite low.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/arizona-car-insurance/state-laws-az/#footnote-1) As such, it’s a good idea to increase these limits to avoid being at risk.

> In Florida, the minimum coverage required is listed as —/—/10 and is explained in more detail below.

## What are Florida's state-mandated car insurance *limits*?

Nearly all states require a minimum amount of insurance to be legally allowed to drive on the roads. The *limit*is simply the lowest amount of coverage that you can carry and still be legal. These limits can be increased for a relatively low addition to your premium. The state of Florida requires every driver to maintain a minimum amount of liability insurance in the $10,000 listed previously.

### Do Florida's required minimums provide enough coverage?

---

Florida’s car insurance minimums are quite low. For this reason, it’s highly recommended that drivers obtain coverage above the state-mandated limits. Low minimum coverage limits may not adequately cover most costs. This can leave you at risk of having to cover the remainder of these expenses out of pocket.

Drivers may also file a claim for compensation for any injuries that exceed the cost of their own PIP policy. If the at-fault driver causes injuries over a certain amount, it’s possible for the victim to sue. Without bodily injury liability, you could be on the line for damages.

This can be the case if you cause an accident in Florida resulting in the permanent injury of another driver. According to the Florida legislature, you can be sued if you cause one of the following situations:

* Significant and permanent loss of an important bodily function
* Permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability, other than scarring or disfigurement
* Significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement
* Death

Also, a $10,000 limit for personal property liability won’t go far if you were to damage a high-value car. The most that your insurance will pay out for property damage for any single accident is $10,000. $10,000 wouldn’t even cover half the cost of the average new vehicle. For this reason, it’s highly encouraged that all drivers carry higher amounts of property damage liability insurance.

### Florida is a diminished value state

Florida is a diminished value state, meaning drivers are allowed to recover [diminished value](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/diminished-value-claims/) from the at-fault party’s insurance company. When your vehicle experiences an accident, even if it is fully repaired to its pre-loss condition, the resale value decreases. The involvement in a collision makes your car’s value lesser than similar vehicles that have not experienced an accident. A diminished value claim allows you to recoup the losses you might experience when selling your car.

Since Florida is one of the 15 states that offer compensation for diminution in value, you may file by contacting the at-fault party’s insurer. In order to file a diminished value claim in Florida, certain requirements must be met.

#### FL diminished value claim requirements:

* You must be not at fault for the accident
* You must provide documentation (photos, repairs record, and proof of vehicle value from a trusted source)
* You must file within 4 years of the accident

## Florida's penalties for driving without proof of insurance

Drivers who operate a motor vehicle without the proper auto insurance coverage can face steep penalties, including the loss of your driving privileges. Penalties for failure to show [proof of insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/proof-of-insurance/) in Florida are as follows.

|  | Reinstatement fee | Other Penalties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st offense | $150 | Driver’s license and registration suspended for up to three years. |
| 2nd offense | $250 | Driver’s license and registration suspended for up to three years. |
| 3rd offense | $500 | Driver’s license and registration suspended for up to three years. |

Of course, if you cause an accident without insurance, the penalties above can pale in comparison to the amounts you’ll be required to pay.

## Optional car insurance coverage in Florida

Florida law only requires that you carry coverage in the amounts listed above. However, the following coverages are great add-ons to your [insurance policy](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/) if you are looking for more coverage:

* **[Bodily injury liability](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/):** This coverage goes toward covering the medical expenses of those injured as a result of an accident you caused. Required in most states, adding this coverage can be a good idea in Florida due to the low amounts of PIP coverage required by the state.
* **[Collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/)****:**This coverage steps in to cover your vehicle if you are involved in a collision with another driver or object (aside from animals).
* **[Comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/)****:** Comprehensive insurance protects your vehicle against non-collision damages. This includes perils like theft, weather damage, and hitting an animal. Comprehensive and collision coverage — when purchased together — are typically referred to as “full coverage.” These coverages may be required by some lenders or lien-holders if you are financing your vehicle.
* **[Medical payments](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/medical-payments-coverage-auto-insurance/)****:** This coverage goes toward paying the medical bills and expenses of you and your passengers in the event of a car accident.
* **[Roadside assistance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/)****:**If you find yourself broken down, this coverage steps in to help. The particulars of the coverage differ with each company, but you can typically expect roadside assistance to fix a flat tire, jump a dead battery, and cover the cost of a tow to a nearby garage, among other perks.
* **[Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/)****:**As the name implies, this coverage protects you in the event you are hit by a motorist who does not carry insurance — or doesn’t carry enough.

## Why adhering to Florida's car insurance requirements is important

Florida insurance laws are in place to protect you, your assets, and other drivers. Adhering to these requirements keeps you legal and can give you the peace of mind that you won’t be held personally liable for damages or injuries that you might cause. Of course, it’s always a good idea to increase your coverage limits to an amount you can afford and to add extra coverage that can cover your own vehicle. The best way to find affordable coverage is to compare insurance quotes from different companies. The Zebra can help you find quotes from a number of top insurers so that you can find a policy to fit your needs.
