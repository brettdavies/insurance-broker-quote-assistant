#  Progressive no longer writes umbrella policy in Nevada. 
They just wrote me a letter to that fact. I have both auto and home with them. Any suggestions? The original reason I bought umbrella still exists.

There insurers that will write stand alone umbrellas. RLI and Markel comes to mind. You access them through an independent agent/broker. Note the agent/broker may require you to bring your home & auto to them.

Call them on a weekday, they can quote a replacement policy.

A follow up- as someone suggested, Progressive referred me to RLI. They can insure me but the rate is higher than what I was paying for directly to Progressive. But, no choice.

Ask another company to write you a policy. Just because Progressive doesn't want the business doesn't mean no one else does

The problem is that almost always they want the umbrella to be bundled with auto. Progressive happens to have the lowest rate in Nevada in auto.
