## Key takeaways

* Windstorm insurance is offered either as an endorsement or a separate policy for specific windstorm events that are not covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy.
* High-risk areas like Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, the Carolinas and Texas are prone to windstorms, which can increase the cost of insurance.
* Insurers may restrict homeowners from purchasing windstorm insurance 24 to 48 hours before a major hurricane or other severe weather event occurs.
* Windstorm insurance costs vary based on several factors including your home’s age, rebuilding cost and location.

## What is windstorm insurance?

Windstorm insurance helps pay for damage to your home caused by high winds, which frequently damage roofs, siding, soffits and gutters. Standard [HO-3 policies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/ho3/) and most other home insurance types automatically include wind as a [covered peril](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-an-insurance-peril/). However, homeowners insurance companies can exclude or limit this coverage in areas at high risk of frequent wind damage.

### Do I need windstorm insurance?

While home policies may include some level of coverage for wind damage, you may need a separate policy or endorsement for certain windstorm events if you live in a high-risk area. Homeowners in coastal states and areas prone to [hurricanes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/hurricane-damage/), as well as homeowners in areas prone to [tornadoes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/tornado-insurance/) and strong thunderstorms, may want to consider confirming how wind damage is covered in their homeowners insurance policies.

Additionally, some policies include a “named storm” deductible. This means that general wind damage could be covered with a traditional flat deductible (such as $1,000), but if a storm has been given a name — as is common with hurricanes and tropical storms — the deductible is typically a percentage of the total dwelling coverage amount (such as 2 percent). If your policy has a named storm deductible, you will want to understand how the percentage-based deductible will impact your budget in the event of a hurricane or tropical storm.

> "Although the percentage-based wind deductible is usually low, from 1 to 5 percent, when you crunch the numbers, it can quickly get to several thousand dollars. On top of having wind insurance, it’s also a wise idea to stow extra cash away to ensure you can shoulder your hurricane deductible."

Currently, 19 states and Washington, D.C. permit [home insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) to add hurricane deductibles, according to the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://content.naic.org/article/consumer-insight-what-are-named-storm-deductibles#:~:):

* Alabama
* Connecticut
* Delaware
* Florida
* Georgia

Bankrate’s insight: Is a hurricane deductible different than windstorm insurance?

Windstorm insurance typically has a deductible. If a hurricane watch or warning is issued by the National Weather Service, however, a hurricane deductible may apply. A hurricane deductible is usually between 1 and 5 percent of your dwelling coverage. It will be subtracted from your homeowners insurance claim payout and is separate from the deductible related to standard windstorm coverage.

## How to purchase windstorm insurance

If you already have a homeowners insurance policy, talking to your agent can help you determine how wind damage is covered on your policy.

The options to buy windstorm insurance vary from state to state. For example, in Florida, with its high hurricane risk, insurance carriers are required by law to offer homeowners windstorm coverage. While homeowners can choose to decline coverage, [this could lead to major costs after a natural disaster](https://www.citizensfla.com/policy-types).

In the Sunshine State, windstorm-only policies are typically only available through [Citizens Property Insurance Corporation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/citizens-insurance/) for condos, renters and mobile homes. In coastal areas of Texas, the [Texas Windstorm Insurance Association](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/texas-windstorm-insurance/) (TWIA) is a source of windstorm coverage for homeowners where wind damage is excluded from standard home policies.

## When to buy windstorm insurance

There are certain restrictions that many carriers impose that limit the timing for buying windstorm insurance. Many insurers impose “[insurance moratoriums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/insurance-moratorium/)” 24 to 48 hours before a major hurricane or another significant weather event occurs. These moratoriums prevent the company from selling new policies in the designated area during the specified timeframe.

The purpose is to prevent people from simply buying this insurance immediately before a disaster and canceling once the storm passes. "Like with most types of property insurance," says Natalie Todoroff, Bankrate insurance analyst, “it’s best to have wind insurance well before you actually need to use it."

> "Ahead of a hurricane, many insurance companies won’t sell you a wind policy — you’ll need to have it before a storm rolls into town."

## How much does windstorm insurance cost?

The [national average premium for home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) is $2,408 per year for a policy with dwelling coverage of $300,000. This average rate is for an HO-3 policy with wind coverage and a 2 percent hurricane deductible, or whatever is the closest available option in the state.

Windstorm coverage on an existing homeowners policy will sometimes have a separate [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/) that is higher than your underlying homeowners policy deductible if the storm is a named storm (e.g., a hurricane or tropical storm).

In areas where windstorm damage is excluded from standard coverage, how much wind insurance costs for a standalone policy will vary depending on several factors like the age of your home, your home’s rebuilding cost, the likelihood of damage in your area and if you have taken any damage-mitigating measures like installing hurricane shutters. Texas is a good example of how the need to purchase a separate wind policy can impact the cost of insuring a home. The average cost of a TWIA policy is about $2,300 per year, which homeowners pay in addition to their regular home insurance policy premium.

Windstorm insurance can be expensive, particularly if you live in an area that is prone to catastrophic weather events. In the states where these events are a threat, wind insurance costs can vary from county to county depending on each area’s history of storm damage. Homes on the coast will generally be more expensive to insure than those built inland. It is important to review all your options with your agent and gather quotes from several companies to compare coverage and prices.

You may be able to offset the high cost of windstorm insurance by making your home more wind resistant. For example, in Louisiana, homeowners are encouraged to take advantage of [wind mitigation incentives](https://www.ldi.la.gov/consumers/insurance-type/homeowners/hurricane-resource-center/storm-mitigation-incentives). Homeowners here can request that a wind mitigation surveyor assess their home. If your property is outfitted to withstand strong winds, you may be able to receive a premium discount from your insurer or a state tax credit.

## How to file windstorm insurance claims

The damage that windstorms cause can be devastating. Approximately one out of every 35 homeowners will make a wind- or hail-related insurance claim each year, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance). If your home has been damaged by a windstorm, you may choose to [file a homeowners insurance claim](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-to-file-a-home-insurance-claim/) to help pay for the cost of repairs. Here is a snapshot of how to make a successful claim:

1. **Review your policy:** Review your applicable deductible levels on your policy. Ask your carrier how and when these are to be paid. [Read your policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-read-a-home-insurance-policy/) carefully for coverage levels and exclusions. Doing this prior to a storm may help you to be more prepared for the claims process if your home is damaged.
2. **File promptly:** As soon as it is safe to do so, examine your property for damage after a storm and file your insurance claim. Most companies allow policyholders to file claims by phone, or you may be able to file online or through an app. Make sure you note the day the storm occurred, as that will be the “loss date” when you file the claim. Most home insurance companies allow claims to be filed several months or even a year after the damage occurred but will question the reason for the delay. Additionally, because windstorms can cause widespread damage, filing your claim as soon as possible may help speed up the process.
3. **Document the damage:** Keep a timeline of the events before, during and after a storm. Be sure to keep documentation of all damage, such as photographs or receipts for emergency repairs.
4. **Schedule repairs:** If you need to have repairs done immediately, such as having a tarp put onto your roof to prevent further damage, keep the receipt so that your insurance company has the necessary information to reimburse you. You can schedule the final work to be done, but wait until your claim handler has authorized the repairs before beginning.
5. **Ask questions:** If you have any questions during the claim process, talk to your agent or claim processor for clarification.

Having a damaged home is stressful, but your homeowners insurance is designed to help cover its restoration to the state it was in prior to the damage.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### Does my homeowners insurance policy cover wind damage?

  Caret Down Icon 

  In most cases, homeowners insurance will automatically cover wind damage. However, if you live in a high-risk area like a coastal region, you may need to purchase a separate policy. Even if your home insurance policy covers wind damage automatically, there could be a separate, higher “named storm” deductible, though. Talking to your insurance company to understand how and to what extent your homeowners insurance covers damage may be a good idea.

* ### How can you protect your home from storm damage?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The best way to avoid potential windstorm damage is to mitigate your risk of damage through basic home maintenance and reducing additional hazards. Keeping your trees trimmed back so that they do not overhang your roof and clearing dead or dying trees from your property can help reduce the chance of a windstorm causing a tree to fall through your roof, which is a very common windstorm claim. Installing storm shutters and hurricane clips are mitigation measures that can reduce the likelihood of a large claim and may make your home eligible for a wind mitigation discount. Keep in mind that high winds can turn anything into a projectile, so it helps to store or secure lawn furniture, garden tools and other unattached outdoor items.

* ### What states are most prone to wind damage?

  Caret Down Icon 

  No state in the U.S. is completely free from the risk of wind damage. However, coastal states are more likely to experience hurricanes and tropical storms that come with devastating winds, and states in the Midwest and Southeast are also some of the riskiest areas for tornado damage. Wind damage doesn’t always happen from specific storms, though. High winds can happen in any state and in any season, so understanding how your insurance would respond is important for your financial protection.

* ### What are windstorm insurance mitigation inspection discounts?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Some insurance companies offer a windstorm insurance mitigation inspection discount. A wind mitigation inspection is also often referred to as Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection. During a windstorm mitigation inspection, a certified inspector assesses your home to determine features that would reduce the likelihood of damage in a severe windstorm or hurricane. Inspection points center around your home’s construction, such as your roof’s age and design type, the materials used to build your home’s structure and the presence of damage-resistant features like storm-proof garage doors.

  Having an inspection may equate to substantial savings on your policy, as it can show insurers if your home is significantly less likely to experience property damage from a windstorm event. This may lower your risk of filing a claim, bringing your insurance costs down.
