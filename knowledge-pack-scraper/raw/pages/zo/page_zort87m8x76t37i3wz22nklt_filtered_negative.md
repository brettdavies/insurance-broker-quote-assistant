Almost three-quarters of Americans are at risk for damage from an earthquake, according to the most recent report from the United States Geological Survey. Unfortunately, damage caused by an earthquake is a common exclusion in homeowners, condo and renters insurance policies. If you want coverage for earthquake damage, you can purchase an earthquake insurance policy.
Before you buy a policy, make sure to read it closely. There are typically a lot of exclusions and limits on earthquake coverage, which should give you pause.

## What Is Earthquake Insurance?
Earthquake insurance offers coverage for your house and belongings if they are damaged or destroyed in an earthquake.
A standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) or [renters insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/best-renters-insurance/) policy doesn’t cover earthquake damage, as earthquakes aren’t covered by [hazard insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/hazard-insurance/). If your house and belongings are damaged in an earthquake, you will have to pay for the repairs yourself if you don’t have earthquake insurance.
One exception is if an earthquake sparks a fire that burns your house. In that case, your home insurance policy should cover the fire-related damage since the policy covers fires. That usually also includes [additional living expenses coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use/) that will reimburse you for living elsewhere while your house is being repaired.
Homeowners insurance doesn’t usually cover earthquake-related damage except for fire damage if a quake starts a blaze.
### Percentage of Homeowners with Earthquake Insurance, by Region

## What Does Earthquake Insurance Cover?
Earthquake insurance typically covers your dwelling (house), unattached structures such as sheds, personal property and additional living expenses up to your coverage limits.
### Dwelling
Dwelling coverage includes your house and the structures attached to it. This might include concrete slab floors inside the dwelling, the foundation and structures like an attached garage.
### Other Structures
This covers structures that are not attached to the house. This might include garages, carports, storage buildings, pump houses and other structures.
### Personal Property
[Personal property coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-coverage/) includes furniture, clothes, appliances, dishes, pots and pans, jewelry, musical instruments, rugs and other personal items. Some items have “special limits,” meaning the policy will only pay up to a specific amount. For example, we reviewed a policy that had a $500 special limit on computers and another $500 on tools.
### Additional living expenses
Additional living expenses coverage, also known as “loss of use,” reimburses you for extra expenses like lodging, meals and laundry if you cannot live in your house because of earthquake damage covered by the policy.
## What’s Not Covered by Earthquake Insurance?
The following items are commonly excluded on earthquake insurance policies:
* Water supply systems, such as wells, irrigation systems, sprinkler systems and water reclamation systems
* Underground structures or equipment outside the foundation wall of the dwelling, such as underground pipes, cables, flues and drains
* Bulkheads, piers, wharves and retaining walls
* Exterior masonry veneer, walls and fences
* Satellite dishes and antennas
* Personal property located outside of the dwelling
* Awnings or other patio coverings
* Landscaping, trees, shrubs, lawns or plants
* Data (stored electronically or on physical records, like paper or accounting books)
* Trailers designed for use with a motor vehicle
* Animals, birds or fish
* Decorative items or works of art, such as murals, sculptures, fountains, aquariums, stained or leaded glass, mirrors, and chandeliers
* Swimming pools, spas and hot tubs
* Motor vehicles
* Aircraft
* Watercraft
* Property of tenants, roomers or boarders not related to you
* Any business property or property rented to others
* Personal property in any other dwelling owned, rented or occupied by you
In addition, a California Earthquake Authority policy will cover structures such as bulkheads, piers, retaining walls and masonry fences. However, these types of structures are only covered when they are integral to the stability of your dwelling.
Keep in mind, you may be able to purchase a policy that covers commonly excluded items. For example, we reviewed an American Modern Home Insurance earthquake insurance policy that included awnings, plaster, masonry chimneys, exterior water supply systems and underground structures outside the dwelling foundation.
If these types of items are important to you, it’s a good idea to compare a few different policies to get the coverage you want.
## Problems Not Covered by Earthquake Insurance
Some earthquake insurance policies will not cover certain types of problems that occur right before, during or after an earthquake. This might include:
* Fire (however, fire damage may be covered by your homeowners insurance)
* Earth movement from a non-seismic event, such as sinking, rising, expanding or contracting of earth because of the increase or decrease in the moisture content of the soil
* Water damage such as flood water, tidal water or an overflow of a body of water
* Water damage which backs up through sewers or drains
* Water below the surface of the ground, including seepage or flows from any part of a building or other structure, sidewalk, driveway or swimming pool
* Neglect (meaning you didn’t take reasonable steps to protect your property)
* Nuclear action, including radiation or discharge of a nuclear weapon, even if accidental
* War (declared or undeclared), civil war, insurrection, rebellion or revolution
* Wear and tear
* Smog, rust, corrosion, mold, wet or dry rot, settling and animals
* Defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault or unsoundness, including planning, zoning, development, design, workmanship, construction, materials and maintenance
* Enforcement to repair or demolish a building or structure to comply with local building codes
* Intentional acts
* Explosion
* Discharge, release or escape of pollutants
* Theft, burglary, looting, vandalism and malicious mischief
* Damage caused by motorized vehicles
* Falling objects
## Do I Need Earthquake Insurance?
Damage caused by an earthquake isn’t covered by a standard homeowners, renters or [condo insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/condo-insurance/) policy. While earthquake insurance typically isn’t required by a mortgage lender or HOA association, it’s worth considering if you live in an earthquake-prone area.
The [Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/modified-mercalli-intensity-scale?qt-science_center_objects=0) is used to determine the severity of an earthquake. These 10 states have the “strongest shaking potential,” according to the United States Geological Survey:
1. California
2. Washington
3. Utah
4. Tennessee
5. Oregon
6. South Carolina
7. Nevada
8. Arkansas
9. Missouri
10. Illinois
Even if you don’t live in one of these states, you shouldn’t write off the possibility of an earthquake. They can happen in all 50 states.
Here are some helpful tips on [how to prepare for an earthquake](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/california-earthquake-risk/personal-preparedness) from the California Earthquake Authority.
## How Much Earthquake Insurance Do I Need?
You need enough earthquake insurance coverage to rebuild your house if it’s destroyed, similar to needing enough homeowners insurance if your home is destroyed in a fire or other problem.
Your earthquake insurance company will set limits on your dwelling (house) coverage, similar to what you have on a homeowners insurance policy.
The dwelling portion provides funding to repair or rebuild your house if it’s damaged or destroyed, so you want to make sure you have enough coverage. Your insurance company will help you figure out how much dwelling coverage you need.
You also want to make sure your earthquake insurance policy has enough personal property coverage and additional living expenses coverage.

## Buying Earthquake Insurance
You typically don’t have earthquake coverage on a standard home insurance policy unless you specifically ask and pay for it as a separate policy or “rider” to your current policy. If you already have homeowners insurance, contact your agent and you may be able to add earthquake insurance as an endorsement. If earthquake insurance is not available as an endorsement, you may be able to buy it from another company as a stand-alone policy.
You can also contact your state insurance department and ask about “surplus lines.” These are companies that have permission to sell insurance to cover risks such as earthquakes when other insurance companies will not.
Most insurers won’t sell earthquake insurance if there has been an earthquake in the last 30 to 60 days.
Other things to keep in mind when buying earthquake insurance:
* **Brick houses:** Earthquake insurance for a solid brick house will cost more than a wooden one because a wood frame will withstand ground stress better.
* **Older houses:** These may cost more to insure because building codes have gotten tougher, pushing repair costs up, particularly in states like California.
* **Masonry veneer:** Many earthquake policies don’t cover “masonry veneer,” which is the brick or stonework that sides a house. If that’s the case with your house, the veneer’s value will usually be subtracted from the total cost of your claim before the deductible is applied, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That means the cost to repair the home would be based on using siding materials, which cost less than brick or stone. To avoid getting less money than you need to rebuild with brick or stone, be sure to ask your insurer if masonry veneer is covered or not.
## California Earthquake Insurance
If you live in California, [state law requires insurance companies](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=10081.&lawCode=INS) to offer earthquake insurance when you purchase homeowners insurance. Your insurance company must offer you earthquake insurance every other year.
The offer must be in writing and it must tell you the policy limits, deductible and premium. You have 30 days to accept the offer. You are not required to take the policy. If you do not reply, you are rejecting the offer.
The [California Earthquake Authority](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/) (CEA) provides most residential earthquake insurance policies in California. You can’t buy a policy directly from the CEA, but you can buy it from insurance companies that are members of the CEA.
You must have a residential property insurance policy in order to buy a CEA policy. Also, you must purchase your CEA policy from the same insurance company that has your home insurance policy.
Even if you don’t purchase an earthquake policy in California, renters and [homeowners insurance is required](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/is-homeowners-insurance-required/) by law to cover fire damage that follows an earthquake.
Here is a [California Earthquake Authority insurance premium calculator](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/earthquake-insurance-premium-calculator).
## How Much Does Earthquake Insurance Cost?
**The average cost of earthquake insurance is about $850 per year**, according to AAA. Insurer Lemonade estimates a slightly lower average cost at $800 per year.
Rates for earthquake insurance depend on several factors, including:
* **The home’s location.** If your home is an earthquake-prone area, you can expect to pay more. Homeowners in a low-risk area might pay $300 per year, while those with an older home in a high-risk area may pay as much as $2,000 per year, according to the insurer Hippo.
* **Age of the home.** Older homes can result in higher earthquake insurance costs.
* **Cost to rebuild the home.** This includes the replacement [cost to rebuild the house](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost-estimator/) using materials of similar kind and quality.
* **Your deductible.** A deductible is what you’ll pay out-of-pocket if you file a claim. Earthquake insurance deductibles can range from 10% to 25% of the dwelling policy limit. If you choose a higher deductible, you’ll pay less premium. But keep in mind, 25% of a $100,000 policy limit means you’ll be paying the first $25,000 if you file a claim.
## How Much is Earthquake Insurance in California?
**The average earthquake insurance cost in California is $738 annually**, according to the California Department of Insurance. The exact cost depends on the amount of coverage, deductible, home’s risk and other factors.
The California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which provides most of the earthquake policies in the Golden State, offers earthquake insurance discounts for homes retrofitted for earthquakes. The discounts range from 10% to 25% based on the age of the home and type of foundation.
A seismic retrofit is a way to strengthen your home against earthquakes even if you don’t have an earthquake insurance policy. The CEA added that retrofitting a home can take a few weeks and makes homes safer. A retrofit doesn’t guarantee your home won’t get damaged in an earthquake, but makes it more resilient, according to the CEA.
## Questions To Ask Before Buying Earthquake Insurance
### What Are the Earthquake Insurance Policy Limits?
The maximum amount of coverage you can buy will depend on your insurance company, but keep an eye on the coverage limits. For example, if you buy an earthquake policy with only $100,000 of dwelling coverage, that might not be enough to rebuild your home if it were destroyed.
### How Much Is an Earthquake Insurance Deductible?
Earthquake insurance policies can have high deductibles (the amount of money you’ll pay out-of-pocket toward repairs if you make a claim). The deductible could range from 10% to 25% of the dwelling’s policy limit. If you have a $100,000 dwelling policy limit, you could be responsible for paying $10,000 to $25,000 if you file a claim.
### What Are the “Special Limits” of Earthquake Insurance?
Earthquake insurance policies are often filled with special limits for how much the insurer will pay to replace certain items or repair structures. For example, we found a policy that only allowed for $500 to replace a computer and another policy that pays only up to $1,000 for felled tree removal (and no more than $500 to remove any one tree) regardless of how many trees fell. Some policies won’t cover damage to a swimming pool or the deck surrounding it.
## Safety Tips During an Earthquake
The right insurance can provide financial resources after a quake. Here are a few tips for the quake itself.
* **Don’t run outside if you feel the ground shaking.** There’s a chance you could be injured by falling debris. Move anything away from the doors that could block your exit.
* **Find a safe place inside your home.** Drop to your hands and knees, crawl under a desk or table and hold onto one of the legs for support. If you have to be in the open, cover your face and neck.
* **Avoid certain areas of your home.** Stay away from windows, outer walls, fireplaces, hanging objects and doorways. Steer clear of large furniture that could fall on you, such as a bookshelf or mirror.
* **Stay safe if you’re outside.** If you’re driving, pull over and set the parking brake. Stay away from trees, buildings, poles and wires. Move into the open until the shaking stops.
* **Avoid elevators** during and right after a quake.
* **Prepare an emergency kit in advance** with supplies that can be used if you’ve lost power or water service.
## What Should I Do After an Earthquake?
If there’s been an earthquake in your area, here are several steps you can take:
* Get emergency instructions from a trusted source (radio, television, internet).
* Expect aftershocks, which can happen in the hours, weeks, days and even months following an earthquake.
* Check utility lines and appliances for damages. If you smell gas, open the windows and turn off the main gas valve. If your electric power goes on and off, turn off your home’s circuit breaker to prevent a power surge.
* Check your chimney for cracks or other damage.
* If your home was damaged, take steps to prevent further damage (such as boarding windows to prevent theft).
* Call your insurance agent to ask about coverage and file a claim.
* Find your home inventory (if you have one).
* If you need to live elsewhere because of damage, keep receipts for living expenses such as lodging and restaurant meals.
* Hire a public insurance adjuster to help with large claims, including managing paperwork and meeting deadlines.

##  Earthquake Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### How do I get earthquake insurance in California?
In California, you can buy CEA earthquake insurance through home and renters insurance companies.
By California law, your homeowners insurance company is required to offer you earthquake insurance when you purchase your policy and then once every other year. You’ll have 30 days to respond to their written notice. If you missed the notice, you can contact your homeowners insurance agent and ask to add earthquake insurance.
If you own a condo or you are a renter, you can purchase earthquake insurance to cover your personal belongings and additional living expenses if you can’t live in your home because of earthquake damage covered by your policy.
### How does an earthquake insurance deductible work?
A deductible is what you’ll pay out-of-pocket if you need to file an insurance claim. Generally, earthquake insurance deductibles are between 10% and 25% of the dwelling coverage policy limit. For example, if you have $250,000 of dwelling coverage and a 10% deductible, you would have to pay $25,000 for repairs before the insurance would start paying.
The California Earthquake Authority offers these deductible choices: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or 25%.
### Is earthquake insurance worth it?
If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, you should at least consider the pros and cons of earthquake insurance. Start by asking yourself if you could afford to rebuild your home and replace your personal belongings after an earthquake without insurance. Keep in mind that home insurance won’t cover earthquake damage.
The federal government’s disaster assistance is limited. Grants for home repairs are meant to cover essential repairs only, to get your house to be safe and clean, not to restore it back to its original condition. Additional federal financial help is often in the form of loans that have to be paid back.
Many people find earthquake insurance to be pricey, especially considering the high deductibles that they’d have to cover anyway. If your quake damage amount is less than your deductible, insurance won’t pay out. But only you can do the math on whether earthquake insurance is a smart buy in relation to the potential payout.
### Does regular homeowners insurance cover earthquakes?
No, standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) doesn’t cover earthquakes. You’ll need to buy an endorsement to your home insurance policy or a standalone earthquake insurance policy.
