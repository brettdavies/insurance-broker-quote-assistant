The cost of homeowners insurance is increasing in most states — largely due to inflation and the [**rising number of natural disasters**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/news/ri-flood-payouts-spike/). But Illinois has seen the cost of homeowners insurance rise faster than the national average, and insurance premiums are up 28% statewide.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/illinois/#cite-4)

For example, anyone living in an area with a high risk of [**flooding**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) or [**earthquakes**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/) will have to pay more for these additional coverages. In addition, the square footage of your home, the types of materials used, special features, and local construction costs also affect your insurance premiums.
Dwelling coverage covers the physical structure of your home. It pays to repair or rebuild your home if a [**fire**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/fire-insurance/), storm, or other covered loss damages it, up to your dwelling coverage amount.

Your [**deductible**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-insurance-deductible/) is the portion you’ll pay before your insurance coverage kicks in. A lower deductible means you’ll pay less money out of pocket if you have to file an insurance claim, but insurers will often charge you a higher premium because the company is assuming more of the risk.

If you take out a mortgage on your home, your mortgage lender will require you to purchase [**homeowners insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/). Home insurance provides financial protection if a fire or natural disaster damages your home.
Liability coverage is another important aspect of homeowners insurance. [**Personal liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) protects you if someone injures themselves on your property and will cover their medical expenses. Make sure you purchase enough liability insurance to cover your personal assets.
* **Flooding:** Illinois has a large inland system of rivers, lakes, and streams, and 15% of the total land area is at risk for flooding. Not surprisingly, floods account for over 90% of the declared disasters in Illinois.[[5]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/illinois/#cite-5) Flooding isn’t covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy, but you can find an insurer offering flood insurance through the [**National Flood Insurance Program**](https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-provider)**.**
* **Severe weather:** Illinois ranks fourth in the U.S. in total thunderstorm catastrophes occurring from 1948–1998.[[6]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/illinois/#cite-6) The state is also located in the so-called tornado alley. Dwelling coverage will pay to repair or replace your home due to storm damage, so you should talk to your insurance agent to ensure you have sufficient coverage.

Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis.
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include:
