## Securing Paperless and Auto-Billing Discounts on Auto Insurance

The eligibility for earning car insurance discounts for being paperless and on auto-billing does vary between different insurers. Most often, the setting up of AutoPay and opting for paperless billings qualify you for most of these discounts. Some companies give a discount for one of the options, while others give you a discount for having both.

> You may need to ask about paperless billing and AutoPay insurance discounts, but they are often automatically applied when you pay your car insurance with a checking account.

If you sign up for car insurance, they offer three ways to set up paperless and auto-billing. Select paperless and autopay options if available at the start. If not, use your insurer’s website contact info to enable these features, as some companies require a phone call for billing changes. Certain settings must be activated to receive any auto insurance discount related to your policy.

This makes the process more efficient while reducing administrative expenses and paperwork, often resulting in savings that your insurer might pass on to you. Your insurance company would be able to send the billing statements directly to your phone or an e-mail address with paperless billing, so that you could access all of your insurance information online, including proof of insurance.

![Best Paperless and Auto-Billing Car Insurance Discounts: Progressive Screenshot](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201363%20650'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Best Paperless and Auto-Billing Car Insurance Discounts: Progressive Screenshot")![Best Paperless and Auto-Billing Car Insurance Discounts: Progressive Screenshot](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/progressive_com_1366_768-2.png "Best Paperless and Auto-Billing Car Insurance Discounts: Progressive Screenshot")

You can also display your proof of insurance through your insurer’s mobile app if available. While you benefit from digital access to your documents, you still have the option to print your insurance cards if needed. Overall, establishing AutoPay and electronic billing streamlines your monthly insurance management and can contribute to lowering the [average auto insurance cost](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/average-auto-insurance-cost/) by reducing administrative expenses.

## Key Auto Insurance Discounts to Consider

Take every discount your auto insurance company is offering: multi-policy, multi-car, passive restraint discounts. In addition to these, many insurers give paperless and auto-billing car insurance discounts, so you can add up even more.

However, auto insurance discounts are not the only ways to lower your auto insurance rates. Here’s how you can save, based on your auto insurance payment options:

* **Buy Early Insurance:** You stand to have about 29 days to pay on your auto insurance before renewal, which is the best time. The rate will increase inevitably as you draw closer to your insurance renewal date.
* **Pay In Full:** Ask about a pay-in-full discount. You can get a 5-10% discount for paying just the premium. With monthly payments, paying interest anyway is what you’re doing.
* **Pay On Time:** Apart from bad credit and getting it canceled, there’s extra savings you may also miss out on due to late payments. You can avoid this with auto-billing, and your car insurance company will reward you courtesy of the same.

In return, the car insurance provider can reward you for your loyalty through frequent flyer miles, offering other product discounts, or a huge discount on your premium. If you [delay paying your auto insurance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/is-it-a-bad-idea-to-delay-payments-for-auto-insurance/), you might fail to enjoy this kind of rewards. All these benefits add to massive overall savings that include paperless and auto-billing car insurance discounts.
