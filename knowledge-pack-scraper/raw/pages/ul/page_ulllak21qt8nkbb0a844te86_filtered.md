## Cost of homeowners insurance in Illinois

The average cost of home insurance in Illinois is $2,232 annually, or $186 per month, but various factors can affect the exact costs.

For example, anyone living in an area with a high risk of [**flooding**](/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) or [**earthquakes**](/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/) will have to pay more for these additional coverages. In addition, the square footage of your home, the types of materials used, special features, and local construction costs also affect your insurance premiums.

### Cost of homeowners insurance by dwelling coverage amount

### Cost of homeowners insurance by deductible

Your [**deductible**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-insurance-deductible/) is the portion you’ll pay before your insurance coverage kicks in. A lower deductible means you’ll pay less money out of pocket if you have to file an insurance claim, but insurers will often charge you a higher premium because the company is assuming more of the risk.

Raising your deductible can be a good way to cut down on your home insurance costs. The following table outlines the average cost of $300,000 of homeowners insurance based on your deductible amount.

  #### Invest in home safety features

  Most insurance companies will give you a discount if you’ve installed specific home safety features, like deadbolts, sprinkler systems, or security systems.

  #### Take advantage of discounts

  Most insurance companies offer a variety of discounts to help you save money on your premiums. For example, you could earn a discount for staying with the same insurer for a long time or for belonging to a certain professional group.

  #### Bundle your policies

  Another way to save is by purchasing multiple policies through the same insurer. For example, you could earn a discount for bundling your home, auto, and life insurance policies.

  #### Increase your deductible

  Increasing your deductible makes you less risky to the insurance company since you’re sharing more of the risk. Just make sure to never set a deductible so high you can’t afford to pay it should you need to file a claim.

  #### Shop around

  Shopping around and comparing quotes from different insurance companies is one of the best ways to save. Get quotes from at least three different companies to see which one offers the best price and overall value.

## How much homeowners insurance do you need in Illinois?

If you take out a mortgage on your home, your mortgage lender will require you to purchase [**homeowners insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/). Home insurance provides financial protection if a fire or natural disaster damages your home.

Calculating the replacement cost of your home and the value of your personal belongings can help you determine how much coverage you need. For example, if you live in an area where the cost of materials and labor is high, you may want to purchase more dwelling coverage.

Liability coverage is another important aspect of homeowners insurance. [**Personal liability coverage**](/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) protects you if someone injures themselves on your property and will cover their medical expenses. Make sure you purchase enough liability insurance to cover your personal assets.

You should also make sure you understand exactly what your home insurance policy covers to ensure the coverage meets your needs.

### What are some of the biggest risks when owning a home in Illinois?

Living in Illinois means you have to consider risks associated with:

* **Flooding:** Illinois has a large inland system of rivers, lakes, and streams, and 15% of the total land area is at risk for flooding. Not surprisingly, floods account for over 90% of the declared disasters in Illinois.[[5]](#cite-5) Flooding isn’t covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy, but you can find an insurer offering flood insurance through the [**National Flood Insurance Program**](https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-provider)**.**
* **Aging infrastructure:** The American Society of Civil Engineers gives Illinois a [**C- rating**](https://infrastructurereportcard.org) for its infrastructure. Decaying pipes pose a safety risk to Illinois homeowners and can result in flooding, storm-sewer structural failure, and ravine erosion. Purchasing flood insurance and making sure you have adequate sewer and water line insurance can protect against unexpected costs.
* **Severe weather:** Illinois ranks fourth in the U.S. in total thunderstorm catastrophes occurring from 1948–1998.[[6]](#cite-6) The state is also located in the so-called tornado alley. Dwelling coverage will pay to repair or replace your home due to storm damage, so you should talk to your insurance agent to ensure you have sufficient coverage.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include:

Default Coverage Assumptions

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

The average cost of home insurance in Illinois is $2,232 annually, or $186 per month, but various factors can affect the exact costs. Illinois’ average rates are very close to the national average.

Allstate routinely offers some of the cheapest rates in Illinois, averaging $81 per month for $300,000 in dwelling coverage.

Not legally. Illinois state law doesn’t require you to carry homeowners insurance. But if you have a mortgage, your lender will require you to carry coverage.

But homeowners insurance can make sense even if you’ve paid off your home, as it provides financial protection in the event of a covered peril or a guest injuring themselves in your home.

Inflation and an increase in natural disasters across the country are among the reasons rates are rising in Illinois.
