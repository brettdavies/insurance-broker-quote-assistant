As you begin your search for a new insurer, you’ll come across several companies worth considering, including GEICO and Esurance.

GEICO is one of the largest companies in the industry.[[1]](#cite-1) Esurance, which Allstate bought in 2011, no longer writes insurance policies. Instead, Allstate writes any policies you can purchase under the Esurance brand.

Both companies offer advantages and disadvantages. For example, GEICO tends to offer lower average rates than Esurance. But GEICO earned a customer satisfaction rating below the industry average — and below Allstate’s — in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.[[2]](#cite-2)

If you’ve narrowed down your choices to these two companies, it’s critical to look at the details carefully. [**Comparing rates**](/car-insurance/), customer service, coverage options, and discounts can help you find the best option for your situation.

Quick Facts

* On average, GEICO offers lower liability-only quotes.
* GEICO offers policies in all 50 states. Esurance offers policies in 43 states.
* GEICO offers more insurance options than Esurance, including boat insurance and pet insurance.

## Esurance vs. GEICO: The verdict

GEICO offers lower average rates than Allstate, which writes the policies for Esurance. This is true for both [**liability-only**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) and [**full-coverage policies**](/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/). However, both Esurance and GEICO tend to offer rates below the national average.

If you’re looking for helpful add-ons, like [**gap insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/) and [**rideshare insurance**](/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/rideshare-drivers/), you might prefer working with Esurance.

The table below illustrates how Esurance and GEICO stack up against each other.

| **Factor**  sort ascsort desc | **Esurance**  sort ascsort desc | **GEICO**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IQ Score | 8.9 (Allstate) | 9.2 |
| J.D. Power customer satisfaction score | 814 out of 1,000 (Allstate) | 833 out of 1,000 |
| Average quote: liability only | $62 | $53 |
| Number of discounts | 5 | 16 |

Won't use All-State for home insurance anymore.

Reviewed in Alabama on November 2025

I found out from a previous employee about their directive that they are not supposed to cover roof damage. Unfortunately, it was after my roof was damaged. They said it was not wind damage even though two trees were blown down and my son's trampoline was blown over 30 feet.

Why we picked this company

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs

## Esurance vs. GEICO FAQs

If you have questions about carrying car insurance through GEICO and Esurance, you can find answers here.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Allstate, which owns Esurance, has an AM Best rating of A+, which means its financial strength is high and the company is able to pay out claims reliably.[[4]](#cite-4) Also, 69% of Esurance customers who file a photo claim see their claim approved for payment in just one day, according to the company.

GEICO offers more insurance products and is typically more affordable for drivers than Esurance. Esurance, which is owned by Allstate, offers a seamless online customer experience.

You can save money on car insurance by shopping around. When you compare quotes from multiple car insurance companies, you can lock in the lowest rates for your unique situation. Also, don’t forget to ask for more information if you think you qualify for a discount.

Esurance and GEICO each offer a variety of discounts for bundling your auto insurance with other insurance types. Other discounts are available for good students, homeowners, signing up for a telematics program, and anti-theft devices.
