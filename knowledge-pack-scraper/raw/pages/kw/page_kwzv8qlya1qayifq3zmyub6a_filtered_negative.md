GEICO is one of the largest companies in the industry.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#cite-1) Esurance, which Allstate bought in 2011, no longer writes insurance policies. Instead, Allstate writes any policies you can purchase under the Esurance brand.
Both companies offer advantages and disadvantages. For example, GEICO tends to offer lower average rates than Esurance. But GEICO earned a customer satisfaction rating below the industry average — and below Allstate’s — in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#cite-2)
If you’ve narrowed down your choices to these two companies, it’s critical to look at the details carefully. [**Comparing rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), customer service, coverage options, and discounts can help you find the best option for your situation.
GEICO offers lower average rates than Allstate, which writes the policies for Esurance. This is true for both [**liability-only**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) and [**full-coverage policies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/). However, both Esurance and GEICO tend to offer rates below the national average.
If you’re looking for helpful add-ons, like [**gap insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/) and [**rideshare insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/rideshare-drivers/), you might prefer working with Esurance.

* **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

IQ ScoreThe [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) uses more than 15 criteria to objectively rate insurance companies on a one-to-ten scale. The Insurify editorial team researches insurer data to determine the final scores. |  8.9 /10
Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $74/mo
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $139/mo

On average, GEICO offers cheaper rates than Esurance. But the reality is that your unique situation can affect your car insurance rates dramatically. Car insurance companies [**look at a wide range of factors to determine your premiums**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), including your age, gender, marital status, driving record, and more. This is why it’s important to compare quotes from several insurers to find the best policy for you.
Drivers without any incidents, like [**speeding tickets**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/) or [**at-fault accidents**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), typically pay lower rates with GEICO. Below, you can see how liability-only rates compare for drivers with a clean record.
---|---|---
---|---|---
[**Young drivers pay more for car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) than drivers with more experience behind the wheel. GEICO offers lower average car insurance premiums than Esurance for teen drivers.
---|---|---
Drivers with bad credit can find cheaper car insurance premiums with GEICO than Esurance. But in general, [**drivers with poor credit**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/) face higher rates than drivers with good credit.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#cite-3)
---|---|---
GEICO offers [**senior drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) lower average premiums than Esurance. But shopping around can help senior drivers find the better choice for their situation.
---|---|---
Both GEICO and Esurance offer standard coverage options, like [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage liability, [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/), [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/), [**collision**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/), and [**comprehensive coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/).
**Coverage**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Esurance**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **GEICO**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
---|---|---
However, GEICO drivers have access to more discounts than Esurance drivers. While both insurance companies offer a bundling discount, GEICO offers many more policy types than Esurance. For example, GEICO goes beyond [**renters insurance**](https://insurify.com/renters-insurance/), [**homeowners insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/cheap-home-insurance/), and motorcycle insurance to offer boat insurance, business insurance, ATV insurance, [**pet insurance**](https://insurify.com/pet-insurance/), [**flood insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/), life insurance, and more.
**Discount**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Esurance**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **GEICO**![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)

* ### Is Esurance good at paying claims?
