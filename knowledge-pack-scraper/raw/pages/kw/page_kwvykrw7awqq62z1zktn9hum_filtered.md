## What are Florida's auto insurance requirements?

If you’re a Florida resident, you must meet these minimum auto insurance requirements to drive:

* $10,000 in property damage liability insurance.
* $10,000 in personal injury protection, or PIP, insurance.

Let’s break down what each of these mean.

### Florida’s property damage liability insurance

Property damage liability insurance pays to repair or replace other people's property in a car accident you cause, whether that’s another person’s car, a guardrail or your neighbor’s prized mango tree.

In Florida, the minimum [property damage liability](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/property-damage-liability) coverage needed to drive is $10,000. This means that your insurance company may pay up to $10,000 for property damage you cause in a single accident, even if multiple cars or properties are involved.

If you stick with Florida’s minimum auto insurance requirements, any repair or replacement cost beyond $10,000 may be your responsibility to pay. Most auto insurance companies allow drivers to increase their property damage liability coverage (or “limit”) up to $100,000 or more.

### Florida’s PIP insurance

Florida is considered a “no-fault” state. If you, your passengers or family members living with you are injured in a car accident — regardless of who caused it — you must turn to your insurance company first to help pay costs. This is where [personal injury protection](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-injury-protection), or PIP, insurance comes in.

PIP insurance, sometimes called “[no-fault insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-injury-protection),” pays up to $10,000 for expenses related to your injuries from a crash. These include things like doctor visits, lost wages if you can’t work and funeral costs for anyone that dies. PIP insurance typically comes with a deductible, the amount you’re on the hook for before insurance pays out.

You can’t increase your $10,000 PIP limit. If you or your passengers’ medical costs exceed $10,000, you may have to pay the rest out of pocket or rely on other types of insurance, like [medical payments](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments) coverage or health insurance.

## Should you get more than the bare minimum car insurance in Florida?

Florida’s auto insurance requirements are quite low, leaving many minimally insured drivers financially vulnerable.

Consider this: The average cost of a new car in the U.S. topped $49,000 in January 2023, according to Kelley Blue Book

. If you cause an accident that results in one or more cars being totaled, $10,000 in property damage liability coverage won’t cut it. Given that Florida has one of the highest concentrations of luxury cars and electric vehicles in the nation, it’s often a good idea to bump up your property damage liability limit, if you can afford it.

You may also want to add [bodily injury liability](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/bodily-injury-liability) insurance. This pays others for injuries you cause in an accident if those costs exceed the $10,000 PIP coverage limit. Without this coverage type, you’ll likely be responsible for any expenses that exceed the PIP limit, plus legal fees if you’re sued.

Here’s a list of other types of car insurance you may want to consider if you live in Florida.

| Coverage type | Pays for |
| --- | --- |
| [Uninsured](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage) and [underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/underinsured-motorist-coverage) | Medical costs for you, passengers and resident family members when injured by an uninsured or minimally insured driver. Because Florida doesn’t require bodily injury liability insurance, this coverage type may help if your medical bills exceed the $10,000 PIP limit. It also covers hit-and-runs. |
| [Collision insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/collision-insurance)\* | Your own car repairs from traffic-related accidents, regardless of fault. It also covers hit-and-runs. |
| [Comprehensive insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance)\* | Your own car repair costs from nontraffic-related events, such as hurricanes, floods or theft. In Florida, comprehensive insurance deductibles are waived for repairs to a damaged windshield. |
| [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments) | Medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, regardless of fault. This can help pay for some of the costs not covered by your PIP insurance, as well as a high health insurance deductible. |
| [Roadside assistance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/roadside-assistance) | A battery jump or tow if your car breaks down. |
| \*If you finance or lease your car, your lender will likely require you to have comprehensive and collision insurance. | |

Take note: You’ll likely have to buy more than Florida’s minimum auto insurance requirements if you finance or lease your car, or if you are deemed a “high-risk” driver and need [FR-44 or SR-22 insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/fr44-insurance).
