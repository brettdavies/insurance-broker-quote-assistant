A standout mobile app, but above-average rates and below-average customer service.

[Esurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-esurance-vs-progressive-car-insurance "Esurance vs. Progressive Car Insurance: Compare Reviews and Quotes") charged higher rates than major national competitors like Geico and Progressive. You'll likely get more affordable coverage elsewhere.

Esurance's annual rates for a 42-year-old married male driver with a clean record were 9% cheaper than average but 50% more expensive than Geico, the cheapest insurer. Our analysis compared rates for a [full-coverage policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest \(and Best\) Full Coverage Car Insurance") at each insurer.
---|---
[Geico](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review "Geico insurance review") | $1,618
[Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive insurance review") | $1,787

[Esurance DriveSense](https://www.valuepenguin.com/esurance-drivesense-insurance-review "/esurance-drivesense-insurance-review") is a telematics app that monitors and rewards safe drivers. Drivers share their driving data with Esurance through the app and get discounts for avoiding unsafe behaviors such as hard braking, speeding and late-night driving.
While you can purchase liability-only coverage from Esurance, all the standard additional coverages — such as comprehensive, collision, uninsured and underinsured motorist — are all available. The standout add-on coverage is its [rideshare insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance"), known as ShareSmart. ShareSmart helps ensure you're fully covered at all points during the ridesharing process, where neither your own car insurance nor the coverage offered by Uber and Lyft suffices.

Esurance is not going out of business in the sense that it is failing. [Allstate](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-auto-insurance-review "/allstate-auto-insurance-review"), the company Esurance is owned by, is gradually closing the company and redirecting its business to the Allstate brand.
