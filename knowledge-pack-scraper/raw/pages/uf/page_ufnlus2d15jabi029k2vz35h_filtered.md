Editor's Rating 4.5

**Update:** As of March 2023, Esurance is no longer selling insurance policies to new customers. Instead, it's directing potential customers to its parent company, Allstate, to get quotes or buy a policy.

Esurance isn't canceling its existing policies, so current customers aren't affected by the change at this time.

Esurance — a brand owned by Allstate — stands out for its well-reviewed mobile app, which allows you to share photos of damage and repairs after an accident. However, the company doesn't deliver on two of the factors customers usually value most: cheap rates and reliable service.

## Is Esurance a good car insurance company? Our thoughts

Esurance's strength lies in its mobile experience rather than its pricing and customer service.

The Esurance app is one of the most highly rated mobile apps in the auto insurance industry, offering helpful claims functionalities other insurers do not.

However, that smooth mobile experience breaks down when it comes to actually making a claim: Esurance has below-average auto claims satisfaction, with many policyholders complaining of delays.

Rates are also well above average, with other national insurers offering the same coverage for hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars less.

## Esurance auto insurance quote comparison

[Esurance](/compare-esurance-vs-progressive-car-insurance "Esurance vs. Progressive Car Insurance: Compare Reviews and Quotes") charged higher rates than major national competitors like Geico and Progressive. You'll likely get more affordable coverage elsewhere.

Esurance's annual rates for a 42-year-old married male driver with a clean record were 9% cheaper than average but 50% more expensive than Geico, the cheapest insurer. Our analysis compared rates for a [full-coverage policy](/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest (and Best) Full Coverage Car Insurance") at each insurer.

### Annual premiums from Esurance vs. competitors

| Insurer | Cost for 42-year-old married driver |
| --- | --- |
| Esurance | $2,432 |
| [Geico](/geico-insurance-review "Geico insurance review") | $1,618 |
| [Progressive](/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive insurance review") | $1,787 |
| [State Farm](/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm insurance review") | $4,847 |

Drivers at other ages will also find that Esurance's rates are cheaper than average but far more expensive than what competitors offer. Esurance's annual rates for an 81-year-old female driver were 6% cheaper than average but 21% higher than Progressive's. Similarly, Esurance quoted our 18-year-old female driver rates that were 3% cheaper than average but 72% higher than Geico's.

## Esurance discounts

Esurance offers different discounts in different states.

Featured discount: Esurance DriveSense

[Esurance DriveSense](/esurance-drivesense-insurance-review "/esurance-drivesense-insurance-review") is a telematics app that monitors and rewards safe drivers. Drivers share their driving data with Esurance through the app and get discounts for avoiding unsafe behaviors such as hard braking, speeding and late-night driving.

One of the more driver-friendly telematics apps, DriveSense allows drivers to temporarily turn off monitoring and retroactively delete trips that they don't want to count against them. However, it's unlikely to offset the comparatively high costs of Esurance premiums.

Core discount

Pay entire policy up-front, own a home or insure more than one car with Esurance

Multi-policy

Have more than one policy with Esurance

On-time payment

Pay bills on time

Affinity group

Members of various affinity groups, such as professional groups, alumni associations or other Esurance partners

Expense savings

Start the sign-up process for a policy online (also known as the Fast 5 Discount)

Renters plus

Add renters insurance

Claim-free

No at-fault accidents in the past five years

Defensive driver

No claims in the past three years and take a defensive driving course

Good student

Have good grades if you're less than 25 years old

Esurance also advertises a **switch and save discount**, which gives new customers a discount when they switch from another insurance company. The discount amount will vary from driver to driver but averages at $462.

## What does Esurance cover?

While you can purchase liability-only coverage from Esurance, all the standard additional coverages — such as comprehensive, collision, uninsured and underinsured motorist — are all available. The standout add-on coverage is its [rideshare insurance](/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance"), known as ShareSmart. ShareSmart helps ensure you're fully covered at all points during the ridesharing process, where neither your own car insurance nor the coverage offered by Uber and Lyft suffices.

Personal auto insurance policies don't usually cover you during the time when your rideshare app is on and you're looking for passengers or driving to meet one; ridesharing insurance usually doesn't cover you until a passenger is in your car. Esurance's ShareSmart covers you from the beginning of the process to the end.

Drivers must have collision and comprehensive insurance in place to be eligible for ShareSmart. Be aware that **ShareSmart is only available in a few select states: California, Illinois and New Jersey**.

Other useful add-on coverages from Esurance include:

Emergency roadside assistance

Esurance pays up to $75 per incident for common roadside mishaps, such as towing, tire changes and fuel delivery.

Loan/lease gap

Esurance offers a payout of 25% more than the actual cash value of your car in the event that it is a total loss and you still owe payments to your lienholder.

Rental car

Esurance will cover the cost of a rental car for policyholders who have full coverage while their own car receives repairs. In some states, Esurance policyholders can get a rental car of a similar size and body type to their own car through its CarMatch rental coverage.

**Esurance does not have specific glass coverage**; instead, glass coverage is rolled into comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive coverage from Esurance pays for off-road incidents, such as a stolen car or damage done by animals or falling objects.

## Ratings and reviews of Esurance auto insurance

Esurance offers a top-tier mobile experience, making it a solid choice for those who want to deal with their insurer via app.

In addition to managing their policy details, customers can post pictures of damage and repairs, as well as contact their claims representative. Both Android and iPhone users like the app, rating it 4.6 out of 5 and 4.8 out of 5 in their respective app stores.

However, **Esurance has a far more mixed customer service reputation for auto insurance when it comes to claims**. It receives about 20% more complaints than is standard for an insurer of its size. Most of the complaints focused on delays and unsatisfactory settlements, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

| Rating system | Average score | Esurance score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NAIC Complaint Index | 1.0 | 1.21 |
| J.D. Power Auto Claims Satisfaction | 872 | 871 |
| A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating | A++ (maximum score) | A+ |
| GooglePlay | 5.0 (maximum score) | 4.6 |
| Apple App Store | 5.0 (maximum score) | 4.8 |

Similarly, you'll likely have a smoother claims experience if you choose another insurer. Esurance scored average on J.D. Power’s Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, indicating that policyholders weren't consistently pleased with how the company handled claims. You'll likely have a smoother, speedier claims experience with another insurer.

Fortunately, Esurance has a firm financial footing, and customers can be confident that the company will pay out their claims. A.M. Best awarded Esurance an A+ Financial Strength Rating, which means that it has a "superior" ability to pay out claims.

## Does Esurance offer home homeowners insurance?

Esurance does offer homeowners insurance, as well as renters insurance. However, **Esurance homeowners and renters insurance are not available in all 50 states**.

**To cancel your Esurance car insurance policy**, you'll need to call the company; you cannot cancel your coverage online.
