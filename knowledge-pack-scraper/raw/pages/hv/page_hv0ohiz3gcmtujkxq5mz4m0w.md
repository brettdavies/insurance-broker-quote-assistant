Editor's picks: Best car insurance companies (MoMo Productions via Getty Images)
Most drivers stick with the same car insurance company for years, even when they're not particularly happy with the service. That's changing fast.
A record 57% of auto insurance customers actively shopped for new policies in the past year, [according to J.D. Power](https://www.aol.com/finance/best-car-insurance-companies-183303735.html#sources). With 38% of customers falling into the bottom segment of satisfaction scores, competition for customers has never been fiercer.
That's good news if you're shopping around — you have more leverage than ever to find an insurer that treats you right and charges a fair price.
We've identified which insurers actually deliver on their advertising. [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/z096d98170d3/?s1=c:bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%7Cmanual%7Cus-aol) continues pushing innovation with money-saving tools, while [Erie Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/k61a2d74ba1e/?s1=c:bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%7Cmanual%7Cus-aol) leads in shopping experience.

We explore what makes each company worth considering — and where they fall short.
## 1. Progressive: Best for innovation

The company pioneered [use-based insurance](https://www.aol.com/car-insurance-telematics-pros-cons-131147073.html) and continues evolving tools that help customers understand and manage their coverage. Founded in 1937 as a specialty insurer for high-risk drivers, Progressive now serves a wide range of customers across all 50 states with a focus on technology and competitive pricing.
Pros
  * Innovative Name Your Price tool
  * Second-largest market share
  * Comprehensive digital platform and mobile app
  * Gap insurance and unique coverage options


Cons
  * Below-average claims satisfaction
  * Customer service can feel automated
  * Snapshot program can increase rates
  * Rates may increase following claims

### How Progressive stands out from the crowd
Progressive's Name Your Price tool is a unique way to shop for insurance by allowing you to set a budget and see what coverage fits. The company's Snapshot program rewards safe drivers with genuine discounts, though some drivers may see rate increases based on driving data.
Progressive also offers [gap insurance](https://www.aol.com/finance/is-gap-insurance-worth-the-cost-153400907.html) that covers the difference between what you owe on your car loan and its actual value if totaled. And you'll also find coverage for [custom equipment](https://www.aol.com/finance/how-to-insure-classic-car-173937030.html), rideshare driving and pet injury protection that many competitors don't offer.
The digital experience consistently ranks among the industry's best. Progressive's website and mobile app make it simple to get quotes, manage your policy, [file claims](https://www.aol.com/finance/how-to-file-car-insurance-claim-183853702.html) and track repair progress. After using Progressive for three years, I found the digital tools genuinely convenient — everything from checking coverage details to making policy changes worked smoothly online. For customers who prefer handling most tasks online, Progressive delivers convenience that's hard to beat.
### Where Progressive falls short
While Progressive makes it relatively easy to reach a human when needed, Progressive’s customer service can feel automated rather than personal. The company's efficiency-focused approach sometimes prioritizes speed over personal attention during complex situations.
While Progressive markets Snapshot as a discount program, it actually adjusts rates based on your driving data. Hard braking, rapid acceleration or driving during high-risk hours can result in rate increases, not just smaller discounts. The company also tends to raise rates more aggressively than some competitors after at-fault accidents — many customers report that even minor claims can result in significant premium increases.
Overall, the company scored below average in recent claims satisfaction studies, showing that when things go wrong, your experience may not always match the convenience of the digital tools.
## 2. Erie Insurance: Best for experience and regional service

Founded in 1925 in Erie, Pennsylvania, the regional insurer has grown to serve more than 6 million policyholders. The company mostly operates in the Eastern and Midwestern United States with a focus on community connections and customer relationships over aggressive national expansion.
Pros
  * Highest shopping experience scores two years running
  * Third-highest claims satisfaction score nationally
  * Rate Lock feature keeps premiums stable
  * Strong local agent network and community focus


Cons
  * Service limited to 12 states plus Washington, D.C.
  * No mobile claims filing or online policy purchases available
  * Basic mobile app functionality compared to major competitors

### How Erie stands out from the crowd
Erie has topped J.D. Power's insurance shopping study for two consecutive years thanks to its straightforward insurance shopping experience. The company maintains a network of over 2,200 independent agencies with more than 13,000 licensed agents, providing local expertise and face-to-face service that many national carriers can't match.
Erie's Rate Lock feature sets it apart from competition by keeping your premiums stable, protecting you from surprise rate hikes that have become all too common with other insurers. But keep in mind this feature won't protect you if you add or remove vehicles or drivers or change where you park your car.
Erie typically delivers when it matters most. The company's claims performance ranks third nationally, which means you're likely to experience a smooth process when dealing with accidents or damage compared to most other insurers.
### Where Erie falls short
Erie's biggest limitation comes down to its coverage area: 12 states plus Washington, D.C. If you live anywhere else, you're out of luck. Even if you're in Erie's coverage area now, this regional focus can create problems if you move frequently, since you might have to [find a new insurer when you relocate](https://www.aol.com/finance/car-insurance-moving-states-210642310.html).
The company's digital experience lags behind major competitors in important ways. While you can get a quote online, you’ll need to complete the policy purchase process with an agent. More frustrating, you can't file claims through Erie's mobile app, which feels outdated when most insurers offer this basic functionality.

Founded in 1922 by military officers, [USAA](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=editorial-text-link&linkText=USAA&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvY2E3ZGIyODQwYzQ4Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvY2E3ZGIyODQwYzQ4Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAAVJxR2t3Sd5fQBfEA958i7lsf47Tf0QMzWgxwzqkeu6O&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Fca7db2840c48%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=2OpBZvBk8UjiEhjv12986) focuses on the unique needs of the military community, building its entire business model around serving current and former members and their families. The member-owned USAA has earned the highest customer satisfaction scores for 23 consecutive years, making it the clear quality leader among auto insurers. But you must be a military member, a veteran or family to qualify for its policies.
Pros
  * Highest customer and claims satisfaction for several consecutive years
  * Military-focused benefits like deployment storage discounts
  * Competitive insurance premiums
  * Excellent mobile app and digital tools for managing policies


Cons
  * Limited to military members and their families
  * Fewer physical locations and smaller agent network than major competitors
  * No live chat or customer support by email

### How USAA stands out from the crowd
USAA consistently outperforms competitors in customer satisfaction by providing service levels that other insurers struggle to match, and it remains one of the top insurers for auto claims satisfaction year after year.
What really sets USAA apart is how well it understands military life. You can save up to 60% off your premium when storing your vehicle during deployment. If you park your car on base, you might save up to 15% on comprehensive coverage. The company even offers special coverage for military-specific situations that civilian insurers often exclude.
USAA's mobile app and digital tools are impressive — you can handle everything from filing claims to getting roadside assistance without calling anyone. For military families who move frequently or deploy overseas, this digital-first approach makes managing insurance much easier than speaking over the phone with an agent.
### Where USAA falls short
If you're not a military member or connected to the military through family, you can't qualify for USAA coverage. This excludes the vast majority of drivers from accessing what's arguably the nation’s best auto insurer.
Even if you qualify, USAA operates differently from traditional insurers. The company has a much smaller agent network than giants like [State Farm](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d47a431b-c0e0-4632-9aec-1f2ae72c1c1e&siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&merchantName=State+Farm&linkText=State+Farm&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZWZhcm0uY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZWZhcm0uY29tLyJ9&signature=AQAAAe_GtzxGvTXW_UburXiCdq3gAqO3NSmkl-JwwjBj-dXp&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statefarm.com%2F&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=yPzxd1r5APjDVIq114986) or [Allstate](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&linkText=Allstate&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIveGE1NzAwMjQ2YTc5Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIveGE1NzAwMjQ2YTc5Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAAUXadqKa6XzUf87aPknyy7GCVgyz3J9VKfLsozJvu0SZ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Fxa5700246a79%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=cIVBWTPBq6JP2hWP15986), which means you won't find local USAA offices in most communities.
USAA's customer service options are also more limited than you might expect from a premium insurer. The company doesn't offer email support, and its chat feature doesn’t connect you with a live agent. However, you can call for help Monday through Saturday, with the roadside assistance service running 24/7.

Founded as a mutual company in 1907, the company has spent over a century prioritizing lasting relationships with policyholders. As the oldest mutual auto insurer in the U.S., Amica operates differently from typical insurance companies — it's owned by its policyholders, allowing it to focus on member satisfaction instead of maximizing investor returns.
Pros
  * Fast claims payments within 2 business days of documentation
  * Dividend-paying policies can return money to you annually
  * Comprehensive coverage including gap insurance and new car replacement
  * Available all states but Hawaii, plus Washington, D.C.


Cons
  * Higher average premiums than most competitors
  * Limited local office presence nationwide

### How Amica stands out from the crowd
Amica consistently ranks among the top insurers for claims satisfaction. What really sets the company apart is how quickly it pays claims — Amica promises to send payments within two business days of receiving all necessary documentation, which beats most competitors by a wide gap.
The company offers comprehensive coverage options that go beyond basic protection. This includes [gap insurance](https://www.aol.com/finance/is-gap-insurance-worth-the-cost-153400907.html) that covers the difference between what you owe on your car and its actual value if totaled, and new car replacement coverage for vehicles under a certain age. Amica operates in 49 states plus Washington D.C., making it accessible to drivers across most of the country.
Like GEICO, Amica is owned by its policyholders rather than shareholders. This means when the company does well financially, it can share profits with customers through dividend payments. You can choose dividend-paying policies that cost more up front but can return 5% to 20% of your annual premium back to you at year's end (though dividends aren't guaranteed).
### Where Amica falls short
Amica’s premium services come with a trade-off. You'll typically pay more with Amica than with budget-focused competitors. If you're shopping purely based on price, Amica probably isn't your best bet. And while Amica's service area is wide-ranging, if you live in Hawaii, you're out of luck.
Amica also operates differently from the big national carriers. You won't find local Amica offices scattered around town. If you're someone who likes walking into an office to get answers to complex insurance questions face to face, this limited physical presence might feel frustrating. Most of your interactions will happen online, over the phone or through its mobile app.

Originally founded to serve government employees, GEICO has expanded to serve all drivers while maintaining a business model that focuses on keeping costs low.
Pros
  * Competitive rates with more than 15 discounts available
  * 24/7 customer service available online and by phone
  * Mechanical breakdown coverage for newer vehicles


Cons
  * Below-average claims satisfaction in customer surveys

### How GEICO stands out from the crowd
GEICO operates as a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, using a direct-to-consumer approach that eliminates agent commissions and passes those savings to customers. The company offers more than 15 discounts, providing multiple [ways to reduce your auto premium](https://www.aol.com/finance/ways-seniors-save-car-insurance-182922257.html) — from military and federal employee savings to good student and safe driver reductions.
The digital experience works well for straightforward insurance needs. GEICO's website and mobile app handle most common tasks efficiently, from getting quotes to filing claims. Unlike with many competitors, you can reach GEICO customer service agents 24/7, whether you prefer calling, chatting online or managing everything through an app. When my car died on the highway at 5 a.m., I was able to quickly reach a live representative to arrange a tow — something you can't count on with many other insurers during odd hours.
GEICO also offers mechanical breakdown coverage for vehicles that are less than 15 months old and under 15,000 miles. This protection covers repair costs for mechanical failures that aren't typically covered by standard auto insurance.
### Where GEICO falls short
GEICO consistently scores below average in claims satisfaction surveys. The company's efficiency-focused approach can feel impersonal when you need genuine help navigating complicated insurance matters.
On top of that, the company doesn't offer some coverage options that competitors provide, including [gap insurance](https://www.aol.com/finance/is-gap-insurance-worth-the-cost-153400907.html) for financed vehicles. If you need this protection, you'll have to look elsewhere.
GEICO also has a much smaller network of local agents compared to traditional insurers. While its digital tools work great for routine tasks, some customers still value having a local office they can visit when making coverage decisions.

### How Nationwide stands out from the crowd
Nationwide's SmartRide program can deliver savings of up to 40% off for safe driving habits like smooth braking and avoiding high-risk driving times, while promising no rate hikes based on the collected data. For low-mileage drivers, SmartMiles offers pay-per-mile pricing that can slash your premium costs if you drive under 10,000 miles annually.
The Vanishing Deductible program is another unique offering that reduces your deductible $100 each year you drive safely, up to $500 total. Combined with accident forgiveness on your first at-fault claim, these programs create long-term value for careful drivers who stick around.
Nationwide also offers add-ons like pet injury protection and gap coverage. The company consistently ranks among the most affordable major insurers, with average premiums typically running below the national average.
### Where Nationwide falls short
Customer satisfaction scores vary widely depending on what you're measuring. While Nationwide excels in digital tools and usage-based programs, overall service ratings lag behind top performers like [USAA](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&linkText=USAA&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvY2E3ZGIyODQwYzQ4Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvY2E3ZGIyODQwYzQ4Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAAVJxR2t3Sd5fQBfEA958i7lsf47Tf0QMzWgxwzqkeu6O&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Fca7db2840c48%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=GLhUhKGHjIEmMOws27986) and [Amica](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&linkText=Amica&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvczI4MmFmZjBjMjI3Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvczI4MmFmZjBjMjI3Lz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAAUZFoNNaFRBlUBPB4xC-0ERq_JD8mCIM2ZWQZ9NkdTcp&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Fs282aff0c227%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=rcIqH9BYFhFrFnJp28986).

Founded in 1931, the company serves all 50 states with an approach that insurance should come with a human touch, though this full-service approach definitely comes with higher price tags.
Pros
  * Large agent network with over 7,500 locations
  * Comprehensive bundling and coverage options
  * Drivewise offers up to 40% discounts for safe drivers
  * Accident forgiveness and claim satisfaction guarantee


Cons
  * Consistently one of the most expensive major insurers
  * Complaint rates above industry average
  * Drivewise can increase rates in some states

### How Allstate stands out from the crowd
If you're someone who likes having a real person to call when things get complicated, Allstate's approach might work well for you. The company's network of over 7,500 exclusive agents means you'll likely find a local office nearby, and you get an assigned agent who sticks with you throughout your policy life. This personal touch makes a real difference when you're trying to figure out coverage options or navigate a claim.
The company offers some of the most comprehensive protection available, including new car replacement for newer vehicles and extensive [opportunities to bundle auto](https://www.aol.com/finance/benefits-of-bundling-insurance-183125656.html) with home, renters and other insurance products. Its Drivewise program can deliver savings of up to 40% off for safe drivers — while the Deductible Rewards program chips away at your deductible each year you stay accident-free.
Allstate offers accident forgiveness to prevent rate increases after your first at-fault incident, and it even provides a claim satisfaction guarantee in select states. If you're not satisfied with how your claim gets resolved, Allstate will review your case again and may provide additional compensation to address your concern
### Where Allstate falls short
Allstate consistently ranks as one of the priciest major insurers. Even with all its available discounts, most drivers end up paying considerably more than they would with competitors. If budget is your top priority, this probably isn't your best bet.
While Allstate's extensive agent network provides personal service, the company receives significantly more complaints than you'd expect for its size. Response times and unsatisfying outcomes don't always match the premium you're paying.
In some states, the Drivewise program comes with a catch — poor driving habits can actually increase your rates rather than just reducing your discount.
## How to choose your next car insurance company
Finding the right car insurance company doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Sure, there are a lot of options out there, but breaking it down into a few key factors can ease the process.
  * **Figure out what matters most to you.** Some people care about getting the lowest price, while others want someone who'll actually pick up the phone when they call. Think about what you value — affordable rates, great customer service or maybe just a company that makes everything simple online. There's no wrong answer, but knowing your priorities helps narrow down your choices.
  * **Consider your comfort with technology.** If you're happy managing everything online and rarely need to talk to anyone, companies like [GEICO](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&linkText=GEICO&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvdGM3MDk5MDI3YTJlLz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvdGM3MDk5MDI3YTJlLz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAAVOS_WsnWiKKvrBAF8TLxbhvuFa6m-J7GJbqQ7FjfiIP&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Ftc7099027a2e%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=FL1ZldeU76NjpY1v33987) or [Progressive](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=bca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79&featureId=text-link&linkText=Progressive&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvejA5NmQ5ODE3MGQzLz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmNhMjk0ZjktOWQwMS00ZmQwLThjYjEtZDJhMzAxMGEwZjc5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3NlY3VyZS5tb25leS5jb20vcHIvejA5NmQ5ODE3MGQzLz9zMT1jOmJjYTI5NGY5LTlkMDEtNGZkMC04Y2IxLWQyYTMwMTBhMGY3OSU3Q21hbnVhbCU3Q3VzLWFvbCJ9&signature=AQAAASM7pgtUyJT0hOFEpUmGzqeKfYTXJ_BXwEA8ITLT_v-W&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.money.com%2Fpr%2Fz096d98170d3%2F%3Fs1%3Dc%3Abca294f9-9d01-4fd0-8cb1-d2a3010a0f79%257Cmanual%257Cus-aol&spaceId=1197803369&uuid=Olzb6SmkF9DzJDuS34987) offer slick digital experiences and competitive prices.

  * **Consider your driving record.** Got a spotless driving record? You'll probably get great rates from just about anywhere. But if you've had some bumps along the way — such as accidents or tickets — you might benefit from working with an agent who can help explain your options and find coverage that works.
  * **Test drive the customer service.** Before you commit, call a few companies with questions about their coverage or claims process. How long are you on hold? Do the representatives actually help, or do they sound as if they're reading from a script? This quick test often tells you exactly what to expect if you need help later.
  * **Compare apples to apples.** When you're getting quotes, make sure you're comparing the same coverage limits and deductibles. It's tempting to look at the bottom-line prices, but a cheaper quote with one company might come with fewer protections.

## How to switch your car insurance
Once you choose a new insurer, switching companies is straightforward. Here's how to make the change without any headaches or gaps in coverage.
  * **Start shopping early.** Give yourself about three to four weeks before your current policy expires. This gives you plenty of time to compare options without feeling rushed, and some companies even offer discounts for shopping early.
  * **Don't cancel until you're covered.** This is crucial — never cancel your old policy until your new one is ready to start. Set your new policy to begin the day your current one expires so you're always protected.
  * **Get your paperwork together.** You'll need your current policy info, personal information and driver's license numbers for everyone on your policy, vehicle identification numbers and details about any recent tickets or accidents. Having everything ready makes the whole process much smoother.
  * **Inform your lender.** If you're still paying off your car, let your lender know about the insurance change to confirm that you're maintaining the required coverage. Also call your old insurer to cancel your old policy and ask about any refund for prepaid premiums.
  * **Keep good records.** Save copies of both your old and new policy documents, and write down exactly when each policy starts and ends. If any questions come up later, you'll have everything you need to sort things out.

Since pricing varies dramatically between insurers for drivers in your situation, make sure to get quotes from at least five companies.
Several strategies can help lower your costs:
  * **Raise your deductible.** Moving from $500 to $1,000 typically cuts your premium by hundreds of dollars per year.
  * **Complete a defensive driving course.** Most insurers offer discounts lasting three years [for finishing approved courses](https://www.aol.com/finance/how-to-get-defensive-driving-discount-201507850.html) that cost under $50.
  * **Consider usage-based programs.** These [telematics programs](https://www.aol.com/car-insurance-telematics-pros-cons-131147073.html) track your current driving habits instead of relying solely on past data to provide potential discounts of up to 40%. However, they can also increase your rates, so make sure you understand their terms.
  * **Bundle strategically.** Combining auto and renters insurance[ often saves money](https://www.aol.com/finance/benefits-of-bundling-insurance-183125656.html), though you should compare bundled rates against separate policies and make sure you get a similar level of protection.
  * **Improve your credit score.** Paying bills on time and keeping credit card balances low helps since most insurers [factor credit into pricing](https://www.aol.com/finance/car-insurance-credit-score-191734528.html).


Most violations stop affecting your rates after three to five years of maintaining clean driving habits. That's why you should focus on avoiding new tickets or accidents, and shop around regularly as your record improves. Your rates should gradually decrease as violations age off your record and you demonstrate responsible driving.

### Can someone drive my car if they are not on my insurance policy?

However, anyone who drives your car regularly should be added to your policy. Keep in mind that if someone else gets into an accident while driving your car, it will typically affect your insurance rates and claims history.
### Am I required to carry car insurance?
Yes, almost every state requires you to carry at least minimum liability insurance to legally drive. New Hampshire is the only state that doesn't mandate insurance, but you must prove you can cover damages if you're at fault for an accident. Even in New Hampshire, most drivers choose to carry insurance since accident costs can easily reach tens of thousands of dollars.
### How often should I shop around for better rates?
Every six to 12 months is a good rule of thumb. Life changes like moving, getting married, buying a new car or even [improving your credit score](https://www.aol.com/finance/car-insurance-credit-score-191734528.html) can all affect your rates. Even if you're happy with your current company, checking what else is out there helps make sure you're still getting a good deal.
## Methodology: How we choose the best car insurance companies
We evaluate a range of popular car insurance companies based on several criteria important to choosing a solid auto insurer, including:
  * **Customer satisfaction.** We analyze J.D. Power's auto insurance, claims satisfaction and insurance shopping studies to identify companies with strong track records for customer service and claims handling. We also review complaint index ratings from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and consumer feedback. This helps ensure you'll get good service when you need help most.
  * **Pricing competitiveness.** We compare average premium data from industry research firms and rate analysis studies to determine how each company's costs stack up across different driver profiles, coverage levels and geographic markets.
  * **Coverage availability.** We include companies offering coverage nationwide as well as select regional insurers with exceptional service records. This ensures our recommendations serve drivers across the country while highlighting standout companies, even if they have limited geographic reach.
  * **Digital capabilities and ease of use.** We evaluate how easy it is to get quotes, manage policies and file claims through each company's website and mobile app. This ensures you can handle your insurance needs conveniently when and how you prefer.
  * **Real-world experience.** We prioritize factors that directly affect your daily experience with insurance companies, from shopping for quotes to resolving your claims. This focuses our recommendations on companies that consistently deliver practical value rather than flashy marketing.


## Insurance providers that didn't make our list
Several major auto insurance companies with significant market share didn't earn a spot on our top picks. While these insurers serve millions of customers, each has specific weaknesses that kept them from our recommendations.
  * **State Farm.** Despite being the largest auto insurer in the US, State Farm struggles with complaint volumes relative to its size. The company has a complaint index well above the industry baseline, with customer on platforms like the Better Business Bureau (BBB) frequently citing issues with claims handling, delayed responses and unsatisfactory claim resolutions.
  * **Liberty Mutual.** This major insurer consistently underperforms in customer satisfaction measures across multiple studies. Liberty Mutual ranked near the bottom in J.D. Power's auto insurance study and receives significantly more complaints than expected for its size according to NAIC data.
  * **Farmers Insurance.** While Farmers offers extensive coverage options, the company's pricing makes it difficult to recommend for most drivers. Farmers consistently charges well above the national average for both full and minimum coverage. The company also scored below average in most J.D. Power regional studies and insurance shopping studies.
  * **Travelers Insurance.** Despite competitive rates, Travelers has notable customer service challenges that impact the overall experience. The company receives nearly four times more complaints than expected for personal auto policies and scored well below average in J.D. Power's auto claims satisfaction Study. Travelers also ranked near or at the bottom for overall customer satisfaction in several regions.
