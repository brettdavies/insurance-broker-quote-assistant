* Premium Payment Assistance: Our agents are ready to provide premium payment extensions for those facing financial strain**.**

For more information, see [ _Help Protect Yourself From Contractor Fraud_](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/protect-yourself-from-contractor-fraud) and [_Common Rental Scams and Landlord Frauds_](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/common-rental-and-landlord-scams)
Our focus continues to be on supporting our customers in their recovery from the devastating 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles. Effective April 14, State Farm General Insurance Company increased advance contents payments to customers with total losses from 50% of their contents limit to 65%  _without requiring an inventory_. We’ll continue to work with state and federal officials in support of our customers and appreciate their engagement.
Previously, we offered advances up to 50% of the policy’s contents limit to customers who suffered a total loss from the January wildfires without requiring a detailed personal property inventory. This already went substantially beyond what California law requires. State Farm General typically advances more dollars in contents coverage than other companies because of the policy benefits offered.

##  All things California:
[ California Home ](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/california/) [ Wildfire Response ](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-is-here-to-help-california-customers-impacted-by-wildfires/) [ Understanding the Issues ](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-in-california-understanding-the-issues/) [ Updates ](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-general-insurance-company-update-on-california-2-2025/)
[State Farm Newsroom](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/)
## Understanding California
State Farm serves more customers in California than any other insurer, and we’ve been doing this for nearly 100 years. In LA County, we insure 250,000 homes and 880,000 automobiles. We continue to insure over 1 million homes and more than 4 million autos representing billions in risk across the state.
**Non-Renewal Update, 1/16/25**
Following the recent wildfires, homeowners non-renewals in Los Angeles County were paused. Any of these homeowners' policies which had pended non-renewals in LA County that were on the books on January 7th will have an option to renew with State Farm General.
This decision reflects our commitment to supporting our customers and goes beyond the Department of Insurance's request. Our focus is on continuing to meet our customers’ needs and working closely with the State of California to create a sustainable insurance market. This is an evolving situation, and our focus remains on our customers.
LA County customers will have an option to renew with State Farm for another policy term. Policyholders in the fire zones with total losses would have the option to renew with State Farm for two policy term renewals, as required by law.
