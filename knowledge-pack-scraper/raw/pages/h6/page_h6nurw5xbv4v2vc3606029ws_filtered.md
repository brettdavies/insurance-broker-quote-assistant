An SR-22 form — also called a certificate of financial responsibility — proves that your auto insurance policy meets the [**state’s minimum liability coverage requirements**](/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/).

[**High-risk drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/) with serious motor vehicle violations often need to obtain an SR-22 form to restore their license. Since this document serves as proof of financial responsibility, your state can confirm your insurer will pay property damage and injury claims if you cause an accident.

If you need to file an SR-22, you’ll likely pay higher insurance premiums, though you can [**compare quotes from multiple insurers**](/car-insurance/) to find more affordable coverage.

Here’s what you need to know about SR-22 forms.

Quick Facts

* Your insurance company will have to file the SR-22 form with your state DMV on your behalf.
* Drivers may need to file an SR-22 certificate for driving without insurance or driving under the influence.
* States have different timelines for how long drivers need to carry an SR-22. It can also vary depending on your violation.

## What is SR-22 insurance?

Not technically a type of insurance, SR-22 forms or certificates serve as proof of financial responsibility. If you commit a serious driving offense, like a DUI or reckless driving, you may need to file an SR-22 form following your license suspension before getting back on the road.

You’ll need to work with your insurance company to complete the filing with your state DMV office.

## Who needs an SR-22?

Most drivers don’t need to obtain an SR-22 to get on the road.

“Generally speaking, a driver only needs an SR-22 in cases where they represent a [**higher risk as a driver**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/),” says Ben Michael, founder of Michael & Associates in Austin, Texas.

If you need an SR-22 form, the issuing court or your state motor vehicle department will likely notify you. But in general, you should expect to need an SR-22 after committing any of these driving violations:

* **Driving without insurance:** In most states, it’s illegal to drive without a minimum-coverage car insurance policy. If law enforcement catches you driving without the appropriate insurance, you could face serious consequences.
* **DUI or DWI conviction:** [**Driving under the influence**](/car-insurance/knowledge/what-does-dui-mean/)endangers you and other drivers. As part of a sentence after a conviction, the state may require you to submit an SR-22 form.
* **Suspended or revoked driver’s license:** Some states may require you to file an SR-22 form to get back behind the wheel after a [**suspended or revoked license**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/suspended-license/). And you should prepare to pay additional fines after a license suspension.
* **Reckless driving:** If you endanger yourself or others through reckless driving, this violation could lead to an SR-22 requirement.
* **Repeated traffic offenses:** Even relatively minor violations, like speeding tickets, could lead to an SR-22 requirement if you get too many within a short period of time.

## How to get an SR-22

The first step for getting an SR-22 form is to check whether your insurance company offers SR-22s. Not all [**auto insurance companies**](/car-insurance/companies/compare/) file SR-22s. If your current auto insurance company offers SR-22 coverage, contact a customer service representative to handle the filing for you.

The insurance company will file the form at your state’s department of motor vehicles or the appropriate court. If you have questions about the process in your state, speak to a customer service agent to guide you through the details of your situation.

If your current insurance company doesn’t offer coverage for SR-22s, then you’ll need to find a new insurer. When getting a new policy, it’s critical to shop around. Otherwise, you could end up paying more than you need to for coverage.

### The 10 Best Car Insurance Companies](/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/)

## How much an SR-22 costs

The cost of filing an SR-22 varies depending on your location and insurance company. For some people, the cost to file will be around $25. But the filing costs can be higher for others.

Insurance companies can set their own rates for filing fees. When filing an SR-22, get a clear estimate from the insurance company up front.

### Is car insurance more expensive with an SR-22?

In general, drivers with an SR-22 pay more for car insurance than drivers without an SR-22. Drivers without an SR-22 pay an average of $239 per month for car insurance, based on Insurify data. In contrast, drivers with an SR-22 pay an average of $256 per month.

“It’s usually the driving offenses that triggered the SR-22 requirement that increase the insurance rates,” says Jesse Cunningham, a licensed insurance agent at Bauple. “The insurance company feels like, based on your record, you are a larger risk to insure. A larger risk means higher premiums to offset the risk.”

For example, if you’re required to get an SR-22 [**after a DUI**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/), the serious violation usually leads to higher rates for insurance.[[1]](#cite-1)

### Cheapest Car Insurance Companies with Affordable Rates](/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/)

## Cheapest insurance companies that file SR-22s

Not all insurers offer SR-22 filing. You’ll need to check whether your current insurer offers SR-22 forms or if you need to look elsewhere for that coverage.

A few top insurance companies that provide coverage for SR-22s include State Farm, GEICO, Progressive, and Allstate. Some regional insurers offer to file state-ordered SR-22 forms if you purchase the minimum amount of liability insurance. As long as it meets your state laws, you can purchase an auto insurance policy through any reputable company.

See how the average cost of liability car insurance from different insurers compares for drivers with a clean record and people with an SR-22 below.

## What’s the difference between an FR-44 and an SR-22?

In Florida and Virginia, drivers may need to file an FR-44 form instead of an SR-22. Although the filing process is very similar, an FR-44 includes liability insurance coverage requirements higher than the state minimums.

In Virginia, drivers must file an FR-44 form to confirm their insurance policy offers double the minimum coverage requirements for the state.[[2]](#cite-2)

## How long an SR-22 remains valid

States set their own timelines for how long you need to carry an SR-22. But for many states, the requirement is three years.

If you experience a lapse in coverage, you might need to re-file an SR-22. But keep in mind that coverage gaps could increase the time you have to carry it.

## SR-22 insurance FAQs

The following information can help answer your remaining questions about filing and maintaining an SR-22 form.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

State Farm, GEICO, Progressive, and Allstate are top insurers that offer SR-22 claims filing. The cheapest insurance company with SR-22 coverage will depend on the state and ZIP code you live in, the details of your violation, and your full driving record and claims history.

Most drivers don’t need to file an SR-22 form. The best way to avoid having to file an SR-22 is to not commit a violation that can result in license suspension, such as driving without insurance or under the influence. If you don’t plan to ever drive again, you can simply stop driving and start relying on rides from others and public transportation.

You can purchase a [**non-owner SR-22 policy**](/car-insurance/coverage/non-owners/) from an insurance company. This coverage provides liability coverage for drivers who don’t own a vehicle.

The main purpose of an SR-22 form is to provide proof that you have the minimum liability insurance your state requires. The form may include the driver’s date of birth, Social Security number, license number, state, license suspension date, expiration or relief data, and the reason for SR-22 filing and conviction information.[[3]](#cite-3)

Yes, but you need to make sure you avoid a lapse in coverage. If your coverage lapses when you’re carrying an SR-22, you’ll likely have to start the process over again. Make sure you talk with your new insurance company about filing the SR-22 form for you, and never cancel your old policy until your new one is active.
