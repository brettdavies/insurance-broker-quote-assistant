# State Farm Auto codes on ID card?

I was hit by a State Farm insured driver and these codes are on front, anyone know specifics?

TIA

codes a p10 c d500 g500 u3

Location: Florida Police report states that driver at fault

I was stopped at a red light when a vehicle crashed into me at high speed. So hard that my suv is totaled from a rear end crash. I’ve got 4 broken ribs and some mucus plugging left lower lung due to aspirations. The pain is like nothing I’ve ever felt in my life.

I asked about them providing a rental as my car is totaled and they balked. So now I had to get a lawyer to help me with all of this nightmare.
