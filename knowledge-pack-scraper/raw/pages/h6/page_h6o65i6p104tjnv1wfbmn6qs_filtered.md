# Why are all other car insurance quoting me so much compare to my GEICO?

I guess I’ve been with GEICO for about 10years now and I’m paying 260$ for a 24 Toyota and 18 Subaru. And recently started doing rideshare and need to change to a different company because GEICO does not cover rideshare at all.

As I’m getting quote from State Farm,AAA and Allstate I’m being quote 1400, 1600 and 800! Which is such a crazy increase that makes not not know what to do. I need to work to have money for life but if I have to pay so much more for insurance I’m almost working for free 😣 At this point rideshare doesn’t seem that ideal of a job option for me because it’s unfortunately not very profiting

I just compared the Allstate with my current policy and I’m basically quoted 800 for half of whatever cover I have for current one 🥲
