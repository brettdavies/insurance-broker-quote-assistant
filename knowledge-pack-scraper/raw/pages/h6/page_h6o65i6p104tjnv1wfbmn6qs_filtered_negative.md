Commercial coverage require, commercial rates. There are additional carriers that have ride share endorsements, I encourage you to use an [independent agent](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=independent+insurance+agent&cId=55955c30-2cc2-454d-8422-1b0e563a8623&iId=f32d21b5-c2d8-415e-9d05-ebb0c2fdd347) so you can explore additional options.

With gaps. If the app is on, you don’t have coverage from your personal lines carrier. But if you haven’t accepted a job yet, you don’t have coverage from Uber.

Yes, but only when you're on an active ride. If you have the app open waiting for a passenger to request a ride, you're not covered by the commercial insurance OR your personal insurance. This is where the [Rideshare coverage endorsement](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=rideshare+coverage+endorsement&cId=3cdc0383-255a-4868-9ec4-1fbda43f2595&iId=09dc80b6-364a-4698-8e5d-79eaf93a1812) on your personal policy is needed. It covers the "gap" where you're waiting with the app open to find a passenger.

There's also typically a very high deductible even if you are actively on a ride/delivery. $2000 is typical. If you have Collision, they will confirm and typically your deductible to what you have on your policy.

You're seeing the reality of how rideshare companies take advantage of drivers. Between gas, vehicle wear and tear, and the cost of being correctly insured, you're losing money. Most people do it uninsured and then end up screwed when they have an accident. Do something else to make money.

I can see that driving under pressure, looking at your phone, deadlines, etc can really increase chances for an accident. Even pleasure driving is risky.

Yup, not to mention driving in unfamiliar areas, with unpredictable strangers in your car, late and long hours, etc. There are a lot of reasons why driving a taxi is a very high-risk exposure and all of that liability being pushed to individuals is a big con.

You are working for free. Ride-share does not actually turn a profit. It is a convoluted way to turn your vehicle depreciation into cash. When you factor in commercial insurance and vehicle depreciation your profit is nothing

Yes, there are ETFs that pay a 120% interest rate on paper. Lots of people throw money in. Put in $100, it may return 120! at the end of the year! The problem is the dollars you put in are used to pay some of that interest or just erode away, but it don't seem that way when you first buy it. The $100 may become $30.
In the end, they are lucky to see 5% maybe. And there are brutal taxes too on the dividends. That is rideshare.
And yeah, the owners of the fund skim 1-2%, they make a fortune off it.

Lol that must be why Uber attracts drivers like flies to shit. I know buddies who drive part time and net 500 a week driving 30hr, on top of their job. When off they make 1500 weekly AFTER all expenses.

Ride sharing is high risk to your very expensive vehicles. I don't know how people do it, tbh, unless they don't tell their insurance companies (which can lead to a denial of coverage). Like others have suggested, reach out to a [broker](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+broker&cId=78f897ec-a7af-43ae-9a61-ae51edf6a5ed&iId=5cd92950-7245-4c91-9b05-240c72a8c410)

As a rideshare you have increased liability, you can't compare their policies to your GEICO policy it's comparing apples to oranges.
Also, GEICO focuses on basic auto insurance, those other companies also do home owners, [umbrella](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+insurance&cId=ba9e368f-afd6-4459-9756-5b6e08d5b6b1&iId=86447692-42a4-4e25-97b5-992ad0fd0857) etc. so they generally bundle them, making the overall cost for insurance lower.

Find an independent agent in your area to shop this around. Theyll probably find you a much better price.

insurance costs are generally based on the risks involved.
So more risk with doing rideshare as you will be driving like 8 hours a day, where normally you only drive to and from work at a usual job. And rideshare is gonna take you throuh more unknonw areas for you so more risk, and also maybe a random drunk pasanger causes damage to your car, so more risk.
All these things mean the insurer needs more money to cover the risk
