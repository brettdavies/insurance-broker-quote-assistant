A - Liability Coverage (this is their coverage for other drivers if they're at fault)
P - Florida No Fault Personal Injury Protection (covers medical related expenses for occupants of the SF insured car)
C - Medical Payments coverage (covers their own medical expenses as a result of a loss)
D - Comprehensive Coverage (covers damage to their auto as a result of damage not caused by a collision)
G - Collision Coverage (covers damage to their auto as a result of a collision)
S - Death, Loss of Sight and Dismemberment coverage (covers occupants in the SF insured vehicle for, you guessed it, death, loss of sight and dismemberment)
U3 - Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury coverage (covers medical expenses for the occupants of their vehicle if C is exhausted and the at-fault party is uninsured)
So, the important part here for you is A.
They have liability, so continue with State Farm. If SF accepted, they'll handle your damages subject to the SF Insured's limits, or until your repairs are complete/your car is totaled.
You are likely going to have to file a claim with your own insurer for initial medical expenses, and once your limits are exhausted, then the SF Liability for Bodily Injury will kick in, if I recall.
As for the rental expenses, if SF is providing the rental, they'll provide a rental through either Enterprise or Hertz and will provide adequate transportation, which basically means 4 wheels, 4 doors, and it goes vroom. Realistically, there should be no need to get you anything larger.
If you are renting out of pocket, then SF will reimburse your rental subject to Enterprise or Hertz's per day cost for an Intermediate class vehicle, unless you can justify you need a larger car. And the justification needs to be good, not "I want a bigger car because I had a bigger car".
The Attorney you hired is going to do their part for you, likely fighting for a limits settlement, but understand that they're going to eat a chunk of that settlement as their payment for services rendered to you, so if it doesn't make you whole, now that's on you.

I didn’t want to hire a lawyer. I’d been trying to just get them to help me with transportation and then compensate for my loss/medical. They dismissed my concerns and I started panicking. I’m not looking for a payday. I simply need a car so when able to go back to work, I can. Once I get the word on total loss, I’ll need the value paid so I can get something else. That’s all. Now I’m stuck w a lawyer and may not end up getting anything replaced due to fees. 🤦‍♀️
