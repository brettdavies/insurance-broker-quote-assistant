# Geico Good Driver Discount withheld

I helped my uncle sign up for car insurance online with Geico as he's not tech savvy. I noticed his policy included a 5 year good driver discount which substantially lowered his rate.

I've had no accidents and my last moving violation was in 2015 which i confirmd with a DMV abstract. So I called and inquired with Geico as to why I wasn't getting the discount. I'm due to renew this month

1. at first they said it wasn't offered in NY. I informed that my uncle has it in NY.
2. Then they said it was only for Geico customers of 3 years or more. I said my uncle just signed up a few months ago from another ins co.
3. Then they said my policy must be apart of a different company within Geico and that different policies are structured differently depending.

Then they said if I sign up again I might be able to get the discount but couldn't be positive unless I renew. I said I wouldn't renew if they can't confirm whether I would get the discount.

I was fed up and am looking for another car insurance company. Has anyone ever had an issue like this before. It seems like they are withholding a discount for a long term policy holder but offering to new customers.
