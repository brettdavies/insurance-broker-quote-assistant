State Farm vs Amica comparison Is State Farm cheaper than Amica? State Farm vs. Amica: discounts State Farm vs. Amica: customer experience comparison Frequently asked questions Methodology
Both State Farm and Amica offer a robust selection of insurance products with opportunities to bundle for discounts. While State Farm generally provides more competitive rates for younger drivers and has a vast network of agents across the country, Amica tends to offer better rates for drivers with at-fault accidents and showcases strong customer satisfaction ratings, especially in claims handling. Choosing between the two could depend on specific personal factors like age, driving history and the importance of local agent support versus potentially lower premiums and higher customer satisfaction in handling claims.

It is important to mention that our comparison table usually includes rates for drivers with a DUI on their record. State Farm typically does not write [auto insurance policies for drivers with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/), so rates have not been included. If you have had a DUI conviction, you might consider getting a quote from an insurer that offers [high-risk auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/).

### Customer complaints
When choosing an insurance provider, it's important to consider how companies handle customer complaints, as this can be a significant indicator of service quality. The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) complaint index measures an insurance company's customer complaints relative to its size. This index is calculated by dividing the company's market share of complaints by its market share of premiums. An index of 1.00 suggests the company has an average number of complaints, while a number lower than that indicates fewer complaints than average and a higher number suggests more than average. This metric can be useful in the comparison of Amica vs. State Farm, helping to gauge overall customer satisfaction and reliability.
#### State Farm auto insurance customer complaints
[State Farm's NAIC complaint index](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=25178&:refresh) scores over the past few years indicate a consistently lower-than-average number of customer complaints compared to other insurers of a similar size. This trend suggests that State Farm generally maintains a satisfactory level of customer service.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ######  Is State Farm or Amica better?
Caret Down Icon
Answering if State Farm is better than Amica depends on several factors that might influence which insurer is more suitable for your specific needs.
State Farm could be a better choice if you appreciate having access to a local agent who can provide personalized — and even face-to-face — service.

Amica also offers a loyalty discount, which might provide better value if you qualify and are looking for ways to reduce your premiums over time.

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.

Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.

The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
