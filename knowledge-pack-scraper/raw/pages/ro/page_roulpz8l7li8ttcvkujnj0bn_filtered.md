Bankrate's take

It is important to mention that our comparison table usually includes rates for drivers with a DUI on their record. State Farm typically does not write [auto insurance policies for drivers with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/), so rates have not been included.

### Customer complaints

When choosing an insurance provider, it's important to consider how companies handle customer complaints, as this can be a significant indicator of service quality. The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) complaint index measures an insurance company's customer complaints relative to its size. This index is calculated by dividing the company's market share of complaints by its market share of premiums. An index of 1.00 suggests the company has an average number of complaints, while a number lower than that indicates fewer complaints than average and a higher number suggests more than average. This metric can be useful in the comparison of Amica vs. State Farm, helping to gauge overall customer satisfaction and reliability.

#### State Farm auto insurance customer complaints

[State Farm's NAIC complaint index](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=25178&:refresh) scores over the past few years indicate a consistently lower-than-average number of customer complaints compared to other insurers of a similar size.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
