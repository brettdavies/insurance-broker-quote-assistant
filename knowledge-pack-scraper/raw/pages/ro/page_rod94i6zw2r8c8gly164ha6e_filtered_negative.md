# What minimum car coverage does Texas require?
![What minimum car coverage does Texas require?](https://ontiverosins.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/What-minimum-car-coverage-does-Texas-require-1.jpg)
Texas law mandates that all drivers carry a minimum amount of liability insurance to operate a vehicle legally. Known as the 30/60/25 rule, the state requires at least $30,000 in coverage for injuries or death per person, up to $60,000 per accident for all injuries or deaths, and $25,000 for property damage.
This coverage, often referred to as 30/60/25, ensures financial responsibility in the event of an at-fault collision. While this is the legal minimum, many drivers opt for higher limits to better protect their assets. Failure to maintain the required coverage can result in fines, license suspension, or vehicle impoundment.

In Texas, drivers are legally required to carry a minimum amount of car insurance to operate a vehicle on public roads. This **minimum liability coverage** helps protect both you and others in the event of an accident. At Ontiveros Insurance, we understand that navigating state-mandated requirements can be overwhelming, which is why our experienced team is here to help you secure a policy that meets the legal standards while providing real peace of mind.
Texas law mandates at least **$30,000 in bodily injury coverage per person**, **$60,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident**, and **$25,000 in property damage coverage** commonly known as a 30/60/25 policy. While this is the bare minimum, it may not be enough to cover serious accidents or long-term damages.
Choosing a reliable insurance provider like Ontiveros Insurance ensures you’re not just meeting legal requirements, but also protecting your financial future. If you’re unsure whether your current coverage is sufficient, one tap on our **WhatsApp contact button** connects you directly to a trusted advisor who can guide you through your options.
Texas operates under a fault-based insurance system, meaning the driver responsible for an accident is also financially liable for the damages. To ensure drivers can cover these costs, the state enforces minimum **liability insurance requirements**: $30,000 for injuries per person, up to $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage.
This 30/60/25 rule is the baseline, and driving without it can result in fines, license suspension, or even vehicle impoundment. While some drivers opt for only the minimum, it’s important to consider that medical expenses and vehicle repairs can quickly exceed these limits, leaving you personally responsible for the difference. At Ontiveros Insurance, we help you evaluate your risks and build a policy that goes beyond the basics.
Driving without valid auto insurance in Texas comes with significant penalties. If caught, you could face fines of up to **$1,000 for a first offense**, increased registration fees, and even the suspension of your driver’s license or vehicle registration. In some cases, your car may be impounded.
Additionally, if you’re involved in an at-fault accident without insurance, you could be held personally liable for all medical and repair costs which can amount to tens of thousands of dollars. The state may also require you to file an **SR-22**, a certificate proving future financial responsibility, which often leads to higher premiums.
Protecting yourself with a reliable policy from a trusted provider like Ontiveros Insurance not only keeps you compliant but also shields you from unexpected financial hardship.
While meeting the minimum insurance requirements in Texas keeps you legal on the road, it may leave you underprotected in serious accidents. For instance, a single hospital visit after a collision can exceed **$30,000**, quickly exhausting your bodily injury limit. If damages go beyond your coverage, you could be sued for the remaining costs, putting your personal assets at risk.
Furthermore, minimum policies don’t cover your own vehicle repairs or medical bills if you’re at fault that’s where **optional coverages** like collision, comprehensive, and personal injury protection come into play.
At Ontiveros Insurance, we help you understand the gaps in basic coverage and offer affordable upgrades that provide stronger protection. Speak with one of our experts today via WhatsApp to design a plan tailored to your needs.
**Aspect** | **Minimum Coverage (30/60/25)** | **Recommended Enhanced Coverage**
---|---|---
**Protection Level** | Meets legal minimum; low protection in major accidents |  **Higher limits** (e.g. 100/300/100) offer stronger financial safety
**Bodily Injury Coverage** | $30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident |  **Up to $100,000+ per person** helps cover rising medical costs
**Property Damage Coverage** | $25,000 (may not cover newer vehicles) |  **$50,000 to $100,000+** ensures better protection for high-value vehicles
**Additional Benefits** | Liability only doesn’t cover your car or medical bills | Includes **collision, comprehensive, PIP, or uninsured motorist** coverage
**Peace of Mind** | Limited; risk of personal liability remains high |  **Greater confidence** knowing you’re fully protected on Texas roads
While Texas law requires a minimum liability coverage of $30,000 per injured person, up to $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage (30/60/25), these limits are often insufficient to cover the full costs of serious accidents.
Medical expenses, vehicle repairs, legal fees, and other damages can quickly exceed the minimum thresholds, leaving drivers personally liable for the remaining costs. Many financial and insurance experts recommend higher limits such as 100/300/100 to ensure better protection.
Given the rising costs of healthcare and vehicle repairs in Texas, increasing coverage helps reduce the risk of substantial out-of-pocket expenses after an at-fault accident. For guidance on selecting appropriate coverage levels, Ontiveros Insurance offers personalized consultations through our WhatsApp button for convenient expert advice.
1. Texas minimums may not cover serious accident costs, exposing drivers to personal financial risk.
2. Medical bills and car repair expenses continue to rise across the state.
3. Higher liability limits provide stronger financial protection and peace of mind.
Many insurance professionals in Texas suggest liability limits of at least 100/300/100, which provides $100,000 per person for injuries, $300,000 per accident for injuries, and $100,000 for property damage.
Some drivers, especially those with significant assets or higher risk factors, may consider even higher limits such as 250/500/250 or adding an umbrella policy for extra liability protection. These elevated levels help safeguard savings, homes, and future earnings in the event of a lawsuit.
Coverage recommendations may vary depending on driving habits, vehicle type, and personal financial situation. Ontiveros Insurance can assist in evaluating your individual needs through personalized guidance available via our WhatsApp button.
1. Recommended standard upgrade: 100/300/100 liability limits for balanced protection.
2. High-asset individuals may benefit from 250/500/250 or umbrella policies.
3. Customized plans consider driving frequency, vehicle value, and financial exposure.
Determining the right liability coverage beyond the minimum depends on multiple personal and situational factors. Drivers with newer vehicles, long commutes, or who frequently drive in high-traffic urban areas like Houston or Dallas may face greater accident risks.
Household income, net worth, and the number of drivers in a household also influence how much protection is necessary. Additionally, Texas’s modified comparative negligence rule means you could be held partially liable even in shared-fault crashes, making stronger coverage more important.
To receive a tailored recommendation based on your lifestyle and risks, Ontiveros Insurance provides one-on-one support through our WhatsApp button for seamless, expert assistance.
1. Urban driving and longer commutes increase exposure to potential accidents.
2. Higher income or assets may require greater liability protection.
3. Texas’s fault-based system can impact your financial responsibility in accidents.
Texas law requires drivers to carry at least 30/60/25 liability coverage: $30,000 for bodily injury per person, up to $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage. This is the legal minimum, but it may not provide enough protection in serious accidents.
For better security, many drivers choose higher limits. Want to explore options? You can get more information or easily quote by tapping the WhatsApp button to contact an Ontiveros Insurance advisor.

However, this coverage only pays for injuries and damage you cause to others it doesn’t cover your own vehicle or injuries.

If you cause a serious accident, the minimum 30/60/25 coverage may not be enough to cover all medical and repair costs. You could be personally liable for amounts exceeding your policy limits, risking lawsuits and asset loss. While the minimum meets legal requirements, it offers limited protection.
Considering higher coverage could save you from major financial risk. To discuss enhanced options, tap the WhatsApp button to contact an Ontiveros Insurance advisor.
