For one reason or another your policy just doesn't qualify for that discount. They don't withhold stuff like that it's almost 100% automated nowadays and the system will apply every discount it can to your policy, so it's more a game of "what makes this policy ineligible"

Thanks for your reply. Those were the 3 reasons they gave me. But the first two were disproven. The only thing must be I was put in a different company within the company of Geico.
What's peculiar is that we are in the same zip code, he drives more than me, has a worse driving record and worse credit score. I've been with Gieco nearly 10 years and he just got Geico a few months ago and got a better rate. It would be funny if it wasn't infuriating lol

10 years!? Shop around! You’ll probably find something better.

No - it's the third reason. Geico has four primary underwriting entities they operate under and depending upon your other risk qualifications you will be "tiered" into one of those 4. Some discounts are not offered through some of the rate programs. Occupation, Credit, age, prior insurance history, loss and violation history all play a part of determining which underwriting entity you are placed through and what discounts are available to you.

Thanks for replying!
I've been with Geico for over 10 years and I had a worse driving record and credit score when I first applied. But since then I haven't had an accident or moving violation since 2016 and my credit score is now close to excellent.
So while my uncle and I share the same zip code and same basic coverage, his commute is 3x longer, he has a worse credit score and his driving record was so bad he was denied twice by Geico in the past. So I found it so weird he could get a better rate as a new customer.

A lot changes over the years. I’d bet willing to bet you got placed in their Geico casualty tier. Try requiring yourself on the website.

You’re more than likely in a different underwriting program than your uncle. When most insurers launch an updated underwriting model/product, they write new business in it but leave current business in their current program. You can look at your declarations page and check the bullets after your coverages. There may be one that says something like, “there’s a new underwriting program available…” with an 800 number. If you have that, call and ask about it. They’ll quote you in the updated program and move you to it if it’s cheaper. If it’s not, then they won’t make any changes so there’s no risk.

You can also ask them to repull your credit if you think it’s improved.

I would assume you and your uncle are in a different age group, ZIP, occupation, married status. All these can separate rates even further. And additional discount can be given for certain age group as well.

Thanks for your reply. I understand that those factor in considerably but with the Good Dirver Discount I would seem to qualify my driving aspect from DMV is clear l. I haven't had a moving violation since 2016 and no accidents ever. When I asked what made me ineligible they only listed those 3 items with the first 2 disproven.
It looks like for whatever reason he was put in a better company within Geico.

This is SOP for many industries. Cable company comes to mind, but there are a hundred others pulling this crap. Next time you talk to them ask them how long it takes you to be considered a new customer, once you cancel.

False. This would be an ineligible rate filing in every state. If you create a program with a transfer discount, you must extend that discount to anyone transferring into the rate program. After which every risk is treated equally by the math for base rate an modification factor UNLESS it is to discount the premium further.
As a carrier you cannot file a rate plan that would "tier out" a discount over time, you can only "tier in" - no regulator out there would approve the inverse.
What DOES happen is that rates increase over time, everywhere. Carriers will also release new rate plans, with different segmentation, but they are open to everyone. "Cable companies" aren't subject to the same regulations insurance companies are.

Good driving discounts are available exclusively for new customers. To be eligible, individuals are required to have maintained continuous coverage with the same insurance provider for a minimum of 5 years, carry bodily injury limits of 100/300, or higher and accident-free. While not all insurance carriers include this discount in their rating factors, I personally know Allstate, Travelers, and Geico, offer this benefit. That's why it's good to shop around every 5 years.

For one, it sounds like you're talking to a call center. Different states have different rules, rates, discounts, etc. NY especially is notorious for doing just about everything differently. While it would be nice if they were better educated on each state, that's just kinda how it goes. One of the perks of having a local agent.
Also, as rates, regulations, etc. evolve, most insurance carriers will close the existing company to new business and open a new subsidiary company. This is often easier than trying to get changes to the existing contracts approved by state regulators, and it isolates a typically lower risk population (older, established customers) from the new, higher risk population. So it's not uncommon for discounts to be available for some, but not others.
That said, if a rep can't articulate or explain it, that's on them. Get a local someone who can help.
