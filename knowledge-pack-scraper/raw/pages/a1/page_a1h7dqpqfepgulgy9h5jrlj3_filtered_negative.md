##  Will insurance cover my losses from an auto accident?
The front page of your policy—called the **declarations page** —shows the name of your insurance company, your policy number, and the amount of your coverages and deductible. Read your policy carefully because coverages vary. Pay attention to whom and what is covered. Also, note the exclusions, which are the things your policy doesn't cover. The following are some common exclusions:
##  Liability Coverage
##  Collision and Comprehensive
##  Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) Coverage
##  Medical Payments Coverage and Personal Injury Protection
##  If someone got into an accident when driving my car, am I liable?
##  How long do I have to file a lawsuit against the driver at fault?
