## Cheapest car insurance in New Jersey for November 2025

NerdWallet analyzed rates for 14 insurers to find the cheapest auto insurance in New Jersey. We reviewed rates for drivers of different ages, with different driving histories and coverage types to find the companies offering the best deals for a variety of driver profiles.

Be aware that your rates will probably be different because of personal characteristics like your age, driving record, car and ZIP code. We recommend [comparing quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance) from several of the companies below to find out which insurer will actually be the cheapest for you.

FullLiabilityBy Driving History

[Full coverage insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/full-coverage-insurance) will help pay for repairs to your own vehicle after an at-fault accident, as well as damage and injuries you cause to others.

If you have a car loan or lease, your lender will likely require you to carry full coverage, which includes [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/comprehensive-and-collision-insurance). These coverage types pay you if your car is stolen or damaged in an accident you cause, among other scenarios.

These rates are based on a 35-year-old driver with good credit and a clean driving history.

| Company | Median annual rate | Median monthly rate |
| --- | --- | --- |

[Liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) pays only for damage you cause to others, so you’ll have to pay for your own repairs yourself if you don’t have full coverage.

The rates below are based on a 35-year-old driver with good credit and a clean driving history.

| Company | Median annual rate | Median monthly rate |

| [NJM](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/njm-auto-insurance-review) | $905 | $75 |

Having a DUI or at-fault accident on your record will cause your rates to go up — or even double. But each car insurer prices these incidents a little differently, so it’s worth shopping around for the best rates.

The rates below are for 35-year-old drivers with full coverage.

| Category | Cheapest company | Median annual rate |

| Clean driving history | GEICO | $1,578 |

#### Risks of liability car insurance

Liability coverage is typically the cheapest car insurance available, and that usually means getting the barest coverage required by law in your state. But state requirements can be quite low and leave you financially vulnerable if you’re in a serious accident.

Getting the cheapest car insurance possible might also mean missing out on optional coverage types that can help cover your own injuries or property damage — for example, when you’re injured in an accident or if your car is banged up after a bad storm or a hit-and-run. To find cheap car insurance with more coverage, check out NerdWallet’s list of [cheap full coverage insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/cheap-full-coverage-insurance).

If you're an active member of the military or a veteran — or you have an immediate family member who is — chances are you'll get a relatively cheap rate with USAA, a company that isn't available to the general public. Because of that restriction, USAA isn't ranked with the others, but it's often one of the cheapest insurance providers available.

## Minimum auto insurance limits in New Jersey

New Jersey is a no-fault state, requiring drivers to carry personal injury protection, or PIP, in addition to liability insurance. New Jersey is unique in that it offers a choice between two sets of requirements for minimum insurance coverage, in the form of a Basic Policy and a Standard Policy. The state says most drivers opt for Standard, but the Basic Policy is cheaper and has the lowest possible limits you can buy in the state.

Basic Policy:

* $5,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $15,000 personal injury protection.

Bodily injury liability isn’t required for the Basic Policy, but should you choose to buy it, the minimum is $10,000 per accident.

Standard Policy:

* $15,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $30,000 bodily injury liability total per accident.
* $5,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $15,000 personal injury protection.

[Liability car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) covers the cost of any damage, injuries or deaths you cause in a car accident, up to your policy’s predefined limits.

[Personal injury protection](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-injury-protection) will cover your medical bills and expenses if you’re injured in a car crash, up to your policy limits, no matter whose fault it was. Depending on your state, PIP may also pay for:

* Lost wages if you’re unable to work due to injuries from an accident.
* Services you can no longer perform, like house cleaning or child care, because of your injuries.
* Funeral costs if an accident-related injury leads to death.
* A small death benefit as a cash payout.

Even though these minimums will allow you to drive legally, you may want to buy more liability coverage to better guard your savings and assets against lawsuits. For example, if you total another person’s car, the damage could easily exceed a $5,000 property damage liability limit on your policy. The difference would have to come out of your pocket.

It’s also wise to consider common optional coverages such as collision and comprehensive, which keep you from paying out of pocket if, say, you skid on ice and hit a tree, or your vehicle is stolen.

Learn more about your required and optional New Jersey coverages with our guide to [state car insurance requirements](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/minimum-car-insurance-requirements).

* ### See characteristics for other driver profiles

  For all other driver profiles, we used the same assumptions, with the following exceptions:

  + We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for drivers with poor credit. These rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.
  + For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
  + For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.
  + For drivers with a ticket, we added a single speeding violation for driving 16 mph over the speed limit.
  + For young drivers, we considered 20-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For millennial drivers, we considered 40-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For senior drivers, we considered 70-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.

These are median rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider. Sample drivers had the minimum required coverage by law in each state. Some policies include additional coverage at the insurer’s discretion.

Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.
