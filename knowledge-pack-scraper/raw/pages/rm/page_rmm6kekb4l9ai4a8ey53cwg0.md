# Dwelling Basic
Storm after storm, year after year®, we are here for you. We have options for every homeowner.
## Dwelling Fire Basic Insurance
Our Dwelling Fire Basic (DF1) program is referred to as à la carte because it offers you flexibility. It includes coverage for your home and allows you to customize the rest of your policy. All other coverages are optional, so you’re only paying for what you need. Our Dwelling Fire Basic program is for Florida homes with characteristics that may be ineligible for our other policy types.
If your home is vacant or unoccupied, purchased through foreclosure or short sale, or has certain prior losses, it may be eligible for this program. Contact your Security First Insurance agent for more information or to find out if you’re eligible.

## Dwelling Fire Basic Insurance Coverage Includes
Dwelling Fire Basic is one of many insurance options available to insure your home, including Homeowners, Dwelling Fire Owners, and Dwelling Fire Landlord.
![Structure of Your Home](https://www.securityfirstflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-horizontal-accordion-01.svg)
DF1 Coverage for the
### Structure of Your Home
A Dwelling Fire Basic policy provides coverage for damage to the structure—your home—in the event of a covered loss. Coverage A provides coverage for the structure of your home and is settled on an actual cash value (ACV) basis. ACV is calculated using the cost to repair or replace the property covered by the policy minus the depreciated value. The depreciated value is calculated using several factors including the age of the property and condition. Actual cash value is usually less than the cost to repurchase something brand new. If you would like to cover your property for the full cost to replace it, Security First offers the option for you to purchase Replacement Cost Loss Coverage (RCE) that can be added to the policy for an additional premium.   
  
**Dwelling (Coverage A) Limits:** $50,000 – $1,000,000
![Other Structures](https://www.securityfirstflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-horizontal-accordion-02.svg)
DF1 Coverage for
### Other Structures
Our Dwelling Fire Basic policy offers coverage for “other structures” located on the residence premises. For example: a detached garage or a shed may be considered an “other structure.”   
  
**Other Structures (Coverage B) Limits:** 0% to 20% of Coverage A
![Your Contents](https://www.securityfirstflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-horizontal-accordion-03.svg)
DF1 Coverage for
### Your Contents
If chosen, your personal belongings are covered on an actual cash value basis if the dwelling suffers a covered loss. Some examples of the contents you may elect to cover are furniture and appliances.   
  
**Personal Property (Coverage C) Limits:** 0% to 70% of Coverage A

DF1 Coverage if
### Loss of Use
Loss of Use is an optional coverage that covers you if your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss. If a named insured is occupying the home at the time of loss, Coverage D pays for the additional living expenses you incur while the home is uninhabitable. This includes costs for a place to stay, food, and clothing.   
  
If a tenant is occupying the home at the time of loss, Coverage D pays for the loss of rental income you incur while the home is uninhabitable.   
  
**Coverage Limits:** 0% to 10% of Coverage A

DF1 Coverage for
### Personal Liability on Your Property
This coverage provides protection if someone were to file a lawsuit against you, claiming you caused them bodily injury or damaged their property. Liability can protect you in situations that may be unforeseen, such as a friend twisting their ankle on a loose step. Liability coverage also covers certain defense costs—even if the lawsuit filed against you is false, groundless or fraudulent.   
  
**Personal Liability (Coverage L) Limits:** $0, $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000   
  
Note: When the property on the policy isn’t your primary residence, or the title of the property is in the name of a Partnership, Corporation, LLC, Trust, or Estate, the Liability Coverage is restricted to incidents that occur at the insured property. This is known as Premises Liability.
![Icon - Coverage M - White](https://www.securityfirstflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-coverage-m-white-112524.svg)
DF1 Coverage for
### Medical Payments
This coverage is paired with Personal Liability coverage to provide medical expense coverage to others (not living at your residence) who are injured on your property, or who incur injuries resulting from your personal activities.   
  
**Medical Payments (Coverage M) Limits:** $0, $1,000, $2,500, or $5,000

## Kudos From Our Customers
“Security First rocks! From the moment my claim was initiated, I was treated respectfully and fairly. Communication was always clear, complete, and prompt. Within a few days, my claim was approved and assigned to a Customer Advocate. It was like they were working for my family—they made sure my wife and I were always 100% informed and satisfied, which we are.”
_— Jeff, Windermere, FL_
