* #### Overview

  Caret Down Icon

  **Why USAA made our list:** Of the Illinois homeowners insurance companies on our list, USAA offers the cheapest coverage on average, but the company only sells policies to active military members, veterans and their qualifying family members. Because of this, USAA is not eligible for official ranking with J.D. Power, but the company consistently receives some of the highest scores. However, there are not as many ways to personalize a USAA homeowners policy, and most add-on options are specific to military life. But if you home share a room or the entire house, you may be able to include home-sharing coverage on your USAA home insurance.

  **Who USAA may be good for:** If you are stationed at Scott AFB or any of Illinois’s other military bases, you may want to consider USAA for its low average rates and superior customer service. Its coverage options feature military-focused benefits, such as coverage for your uniforms.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

  + Military-focused coverage
  + Consistently low average premiums

  Close X IconCons

  + Strict eligibility requirements
  + Standard coverage add-on options are limited
* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  For most other insurers, insuring your items at [replacement cost value versus actual cash value](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rcv-vs-acv/) must be added to your policy for an extra cost. But, with USAA’s home insurance policies, it is already included. USAA’s policies also come with up to $5,000 of identity theft coverage and no-deductible coverage on military uniforms or equipment if you are on active or reserve duty.

  Its standard policies are already pretty robust, but USAA only has a few optional [endorsements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/policy-endorsements/):

  + **Home Protector:** This endorsement raises your dwelling and other structures coverage by 25 percent in some scenarios, but only if your home is insured for at least 95 percent of its estimated rebuild cost.
  + **Water backup:** Different from flood insurance, water backup adds financial protection for plumbing and sump pump-related damage.
  + **Personal injury:** Personal injury coverage helps with the legal costs related to slander, libel or a defamation of character lawsuit.
  + **Flood:** USAA partners with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and other private insurance companies to help customers purchase flood insurance.
  + **Electronics:** Raises your policy limits for your high-ticket tech items.

  **Why Allstate made our list:** For more specialized homeowners insurance, Illinois property owners may want to consider Allstate. Allstate could be a good choice if you’re looking for more unique insurance options, like electronic data recovery or coverage for your yard and garden, musical instruments or sports equipment. And although the average premium is already lower than the state’s average, there are numerous discounts that may help you save even more. Additionally, customers who value strong digital tools may find Allstate an appealing option as it ranks above average in the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). However, it scored below the segment average in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study.

  **Who Allstate may be good for:** Drivers interested in a robust lineup of valuable discounts and want a unique lineup of insurance coverage options may find Allstate to be a good fit.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

  + Offers unique coverage options that may not be available with other companies
  + Numerous potential discounts available

  Close X IconCons

  + Scored lower than segment average for overall customer satisfaction per J.D. Power
  + Endorsement availability varies by location
* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  In addition to the coverage types mentioned above, Allstate also offers the following endorsements to modify your Illinois home insurance policy:

  + **Identity theft restoration:** Helps with costs related to restoring a stolen identity, like legal fees and lost wages, up to a certain coverage limit.
  + **Water backup:**Water damage can be expensive, and this endorsement can help if your home is damaged due to sump pump, drain or appliance failure.
  + **Scheduled personal property:**Insurance with higher coverage limits for appraised [valuables](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/insuring-expensive-possessions/) like art, jewelry, antiques and furs.
  + **Business property:**Higher coverage limits for inventory and other business-related items you keep in your home.
  + **Green improvement reimbursement:**With this endorsement, if you opt to repair or replace covered items following a claim with more eco-friendly versions, Allstate will cover the added cost.
  + **Flood:** Allstate offers customers two ways to purchase flood insurance: through National General (which is owned by Allstate) and through a partnership with the NFIP.
  + **HostAdvantage:** Available to Illinois residents, Allstate’s HostAdvantage provides specialized coverage to homeowners who rent out their homes on [Airbnb](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/airbnb-insurance/), VRBO or other hosting platforms.

  **Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm might be a good choice if you like to consolidate your policies with one company. In addition to homeowners insurance, the provider offers many other insurance products, such as auto insurance, [life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/), disability insurance, small business insurance, farm and ranch insurance, umbrella insurance policies and pet and boat insurance, creating ample opportunity to bundle and save. However, State Farm does not offer as many [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) as some competitors. Although the company’s average premium is below the Illinois average, if you’re looking for extensive discounts, State Farm may not be the best choice. State Farm also does not partner with the NFIP. State Farm customers who want flood insurance will need to purchase a policy directly through the NFIP or through a different private insurer.

  **Who State Farm may be good for:** If you have more than one insurance policy — such as home and auto or home and life — it could be worth getting a quote from State Farm.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

  + Many lines of insurance available
  + Highly-rated mobile app and online policy portal

  Close X IconCons

  + Not as many discount opportunities as some competitors
  + Fewer advertised endorsements than competitors
* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  Although it is a national insurer, State Farm’s home insurance policies do not offer much wiggle room in terms of customization. Here’s what they advertise in terms of additional coverage:

  + **Personal articles coverage**: State Farm’s personal articles coverage for high-value items includes replacement cost coverage and worldwide coverage. Typically, you can insure your items without a deductible.
  + **Cyber Event, Identity Restoration and Fraud Loss coverage (CEIDR)**: This is similar to the identity theft coverage we’ve seen with other carriers, but State Farm takes it a step further to include credit card monitoring.

  **Why American Family made our list:** American Family offers the ability to add several endorsements to your policy. Options include equipment breakdown, sump pump and water backup coverage, service line coverage, matching siding protection and [credit theft protection and monitoring](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/credit/credit-monitoring-when-is-it-worth-paying-for/). If you would like help determining exactly what you need, American Family has a personalized coverage assistant tool on its website that can help advise on standard and optional coverage for your Illinois home insurance policy. American Family’s digital tools are ranked above average in the service category of the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study, so homeowners looking for online or mobile tools are likely to be satisfied.

  **Who American Family may be good for:** AmFam has several opportunities for homeowners to customize their policies. For example, it offers a diminishing deductible option, which could lower the amount you’d pay before coverage kicks in by $100 every year you're claim-free. That endorsement alone may make it worth consideration by homeowners on a tight budget.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  American Family has one of the broadest selections of endorsements of the five insurers on our list of best home insurance in Illinois. Here are a few standout coverages you can add to your policy:

  + **Inland flood coverage****:** This is a unique type of flood insurance that provides coverage for inland water overflow, flash floods, rain accumulation and mudflows. Keep in mind that if you have a mortgage or home loan, this endorsement may not satisfy your financial lender’s flood insurance requirements.
  + **Hidden water damage:**Covers leaks that occur in hard-to-spot places like inside your walls or beneath floorboards.
  + **Home renovation damage:**Coverage kicks in if construction materials are damaged or stolen during a renovation project. Also helps if your home’s foundation collapses during renovation.
  + **Roof damage:** Insures your roof at either its replacement cost value or actual cash value, depending on your roof and policy coverage.
  + **Senior living coverage:**Adds liability and personal property protection for family members in an assisted living facility.
  + **Vacation home coverage:**This is a great add-on for Illinois homeowners with a summer home along the shores of Lake Michigan. Vacation home coverage is specifically designed for secondary homes.

  **Why Farmers made our list:** Farmers makes shopping for home insurance easy by offering Illinois homeowners insurance in three packages: Standard, Enhanced and Premier. While these packages serve as starting points, each can be personalized with optional coverage types, like [scheduled personal property](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/scheduled-personal-property/), earthquake, water backup coverage and cosmetic damage coverage. Farmers also offers claim forgiveness, a claims-free discount (if you qualify) and declining deductibles at no extra cost. However, Farmers scored well below average in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study for overall customer satisfaction.

  **Who Farmers may be good for:** If you're making your first-ever Illinois homeowners insurance purchase, or if you're not entirely sure what you want from your policy, Farmers' package options can help you zero in on the right coverage for your needs.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  If one of Farmers’ pre-selected coverage tiers lacks what you need, you may add the following endorsements to your policy:

  + **Extended replacement cost:**Boost your home’s rebuild cost coverage by up to 25 percent.
  + **Guaranteed replacement cost:** Guarantees that your home is insured for the entire cost of repairs, even if those repairs are above your policy limits.
  + **Building ordinance or law coverage:** If your local Illinois building codes have been updated since your home was built, this covers the added cost of getting your home up to code following a covered loss.
  + **Identity shield:** Farmers’ identity shield will connect you with a fraud specialist and can reimburse you for lost wages and legal expenses.

With an average rate of $2,838 per year for $300,000 worth of dwelling coverage, Chubb may not work for frugal homeowners. Chubb’s policies are primarily tailored toward high-value homes and offer robust coverage. For instance, Chubb’s Masterpiece policy includes extended replacement coverage, electronic data recovery, lock replacement and post-storm tree removal. Chubb was named Best for High-Value Homes in the [2025 Bankrate Awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-home-insurance-companies/), as well as Best for High-Risk Locations.

We evaluated factors including policy features, available coverage, discounts, financial strength ratings from [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) and Standard & Poor’s ([S&P)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/), complaint records from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ([NAIC](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/)) and customer satisfaction scores from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/). We combined these metrics into a Bankrate Score between 0.0 to 5.0. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the company excels in all areas of comparison.

## How to get cheap Illinois home insurance

One way to save on Illinois home insurance is to cut some of your coverage. But that’s not the only way. You may be able to keep comprehensive coverage while still shaving a few dollars off your premium. There are several strategies that routinely allow Illinois homeowners to get the best price on home insurance.

Consider the following tactics:

1. **Bundle your policies**: You may be able to instantly earn a lower rate if you purchase more than one policy from a single insurer. The most common bundles are [home and auto](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/), but you may earn a discount if you bundle your home with some other type of insurance, too.
2. **Maintain your roof**: When you ask for a quote, your potential insurer is likely to ask about the age of your roof. That's because an older or poorly maintained roof is more likely to result in costly claims, especially considering Illinois's weather patterns. A newer roof — and one made of storm-resistant materials — may earn you a more favorable rate.
3. **Disaster proof your dwelling**: If you live in an area of Illinois prone to floods or other natural disasters, insurers may reward you for taking preparedness measures. These could include storm shutters or shatterproof glass.
4. **Increase your deductible**: Your deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance kicks in after a claim. Raising it from $500 to $1,000 is likely to save you money on your premium. Be sure, however, that you don't raise it so high that you'd have difficulty paying it after a claim.
5. **Shop around:** It's a good idea to compare rates from multiple insurers when you are shopping for insurance. Each company uses its own proprietary method for determining premiums, so the exact same coverage levels will be priced differently from insurer to insurer. Once you've gathered three or four [quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/), you can make a decision based on which one offers you the lowest rate.

## Best home insurance discounts in Illinois

[Discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) can help lower homeowners insurance rates in Illinois. As mentioned, bundling policies is one way to earn a discount.

Here are some other discounts that are commonly offered by Illinois insurance companies:

Claims-free
Caret Down Icon

Many insurers will reward homeowners who don’t make a claim for a certain number of years, usually three to five. If you can avoid submitting costly claims, you will likely save money on your premium.

Alarm system
Caret Down Icon

If your home is equipped with systems that alert you in the event of a fire or burglary attempt, you can usually save money on your policy. This may include automatic sprinklers, smoke detectors and security cameras.

Quote in advance
Caret Down Icon

Some insurers offer a discount if you ask for your quote a certain number of days before the policy needs to be activated. Generally, this is between a week and 10 days.

New purchase
Caret Down Icon

If you've recently purchased a new home — usually within the last year — you may be eligible for a discount. Some insurers also offer a discount if your home is newly built.

### How to save on home insurance policy renewals in Illinois

Home insurance policy terms are typically one year long. In that time, you can take a few steps that can help lower your home insurance rate when your policy comes up for renewal. Consider the following strategies:

* **Improve your credit:** Boosting your [credit](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/what-is-a-credit-score/) is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time to raise your credit score even a few points, but doing so is worthwhile when it comes to saving on insurance. Insurers generally give better rates to customers with better credit-based insurance scores, so taking the steps in the short term to improve your credit history can help you save in the long run.
* **Fortify your roof:** Illinois is [no stranger to tornadoes](https://www.weather.gov/ilx/tor-climo), and your roof can take the brunt of the damage when a storm blows into town. Installing hurricane clips on your roof can help it better weather the storm, and may earn you a discount from your insurer.
* **Be deliberate with your claims:** Some occasions absolutely necessitate filing an insurance claim, but in some cases, it may be cheaper to pay out of pocket. Filing a home insurance claim usually increases the cost of your policy, so to avoid this surcharge, it may be best to get an estimate of the damage before filing a claim. If the repair costs are close to your deductible — what you’re responsible for paying if you filed a claim — you might avoid a rate raise by paying for repairs out of pocket.

## How much is home insurance in Illinois?

The average cost of homeowners insurance in Illinois is $2,225 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. This is just slightly above the national average of $2,408 per year. Illinois experiences a wide range of extreme weather, from intense summer storms to gale-force winds to golf ball-sized hail. Additionally, homeowners insurance premiums in Chicago are much higher than in the rest of the state, which could be a driving force behind Illinois’ overall homeowners insurance average.

### Illinois homeowners insurance rates by city

Illinois may face unique insurance challenges, but like all [other states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/states/), home insurance rates change on a city by city basis. The interactive map below shows home insurance premiums for different ZIP codes across the state.

## What does home insurance cover in Illinois?

Before you commit to a home insurance policy, you need to make sure you understand exactly which disasters you’re covered for. Most Illinois insurance policies will include some amount of coverage for the following [disasters](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-disasters-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/), but it can be helpful to go over your policy with a licensed agent to make sure you’ve got your bases covered:

* **Tornadoes:** A typical Illinois home insurance policy will include some amount of coverage for wind damage. However, depending on where you live, you may need to pay a separate wind deductible for your courage to kick in. Typically, the deductible is between 1 and 5 percent of your dwelling coverage limit.
* **Fires:** Only intentionally set fires and, in some states, [wildfires](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/wildfires/), are not covered or face lower coverage limits. In Illinois, if your home catches fire, your insurance should cover the damage up to your policy limits.
* **Lightning:** Lightning strikes can fry your home’s power system or spark a fire.
* **Extreme cold:** This is especially helpful for those brutally cold Illinois winters. If a pipe bursts in your home, the resulting damage is usually covered by your insurance policy.

## **Additional home insurance coverage types in Illinois**

Outside of standard [home insurance coverage types](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) like dwelling, liability and personal property, there are some additional protections that Illinois homeowners may want to consider:

* [**Flood insurance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/): Many Illinois counties have a [higher-than-average number](https://www.fema.gov/data-visualization/historical-flood-risk-and-costs) of flooding events. Damage caused by floods is not covered by a standard home insurance policy. Typically, you will need to [purchase a separate flood insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-buy-flood-insurance/) policy from the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer, although a few companies do offer flood insurance as an endorsement.
* [**Water backup coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/sewer-backup-insurance/)**:** It is relatively common in this area of the country for water to back up into sewer and drain lines during heavy rains. This can be of particular concern if your home has a basement or crawl space. Many companies offer a water backup endorsement to provide coverage for this type of damage, since it may not be covered in a basic policy.
* [**Earthquake insurance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/is-earthquake-insurance-worth-it/)**:** The southern part of Illinois is near the New Madrid fault, putting it at a higher risk for earthquakes. Earthquake damage is not usually covered by your home insurance automatically, but you may be able to add an endorsement. If you are in a particularly high-risk area, you may need an earthquake insurance policy.
* [**Identity theft coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/identity-theft-insurance/)**:** As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital technology, identity theft is becoming more common. This common endorsement helps cover costs associated with restoring your stolen identity.
* [**Mine subsidence coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/mine-subsidence-insurance/)**:** Per Illinois law, mine subsidence insurance must be offered by all home insurers in certain “mandatory counties,” but coverage can be declined in writing. Mine subsidence refers to the collapsing of underground mine shafts that causes the home above the surface to collapse.

Working with a licensed agent when choosing coverage options can be helpful. Agents can guide you through the insurance process and help you select coverage that is appropriate for your situation.

### Common Illinois home insurance problems

Shopping for home insurance in Illinois is not without its pain points. Although average home insurance rates sit close to the national benchmark, that does not mean that finding the right policy is always a breeze. Here are some unique considerations Illinois homeowners should keep in mind:

* **Mines:** The Illinois Mine Subsidence Insurance Funds estimates that nearly 330,000 homes are exposed to mine subsidence across the state. Mine subsidence damage is different from flood or fire damage, where the damage can occur in a matter of hours (or even minutes). Rather, mine subsidence damage can be slow-growing and hard to spot. While it may feel like an invisible threat, mine subsidence can render your home a total loss.
* **Floods:** The [National Severe Storms Laboratory](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/floods/) reports that floods are the most “common and widespread of all the weather-related disasters.” In fact, the [Illinois Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.illinois.gov/waterresources/nfip.html) states that floods account for more than 90 percent of the state’s declared disasters. However, floods are almost never included in a standard [HO-3 or HO-5](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/ho3-vs-ho5/) home insurance policy. Floods are among the most damaging disasters, so it’s extra important to ensure that you are fully protected.
* **Tornadoes:** In 2022, nearly [41 percent](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance) of all home insurance claims pertained to wind and hail damage, with claims averaging around $13,511. The western border of Illinois brushes up against what’s historically been known as [Tornado Alley](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tornado-Alley), so it’s vital that Illinois homeowners read their policies carefully and understand what they’re covered for. Depending on your policy, you may have a separate wind deductible.

Recent updates in the Illinois homeowners insurance market

* **Extreme weather contributes to local rate increases in early 2025:** Allstate has stated plans to [increase premiums](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/climate-change-extreme-weather-homeowners-insurance-chicago/) for many homeowners in the Chicago area starting in February 2025.
* **Last year saw great news for dog lovers:** As of January 2024, Illinois home and renters insurance companies are no longer able to raise rates or cancel policies for owners of [specific dog breeds](https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/illinois-law-ends-insurance-restrictions-certain-18172933.php), such as wolf hybrids, pit bulls and rottweilers. Although it certainly benefits dog parents across the state, the law was originally designed to help lower the number of dogs that wind up in shelters.

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility.

* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
