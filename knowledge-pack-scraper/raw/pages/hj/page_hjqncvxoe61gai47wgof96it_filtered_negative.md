###  Best for military-focused coverage

* ####  Overview
**Why USAA made our list:** Of the Illinois homeowners insurance companies on our list, USAA offers the cheapest coverage on average, but the company only sells policies to active military members, veterans and their qualifying family members. Because of this, USAA is not eligible for official ranking with J.D. Power, but the company consistently receives some of the highest scores. However, there are not as many ways to personalize a USAA homeowners policy, and most add-on options are specific to military life. But if you home share a room or the entire house, you may be able to include home-sharing coverage on your USAA home insurance.
**Who USAA may be good for:** If you are stationed at Scott AFB or any of Illinois’s other military bases, you may want to consider USAA for its low average rates and superior customer service. Its coverage options feature military-focused benefits, such as coverage for your uniforms.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Military-focused coverage
* Consistently low average premiums
* Strict eligibility requirements
* Standard coverage add-on options are limited
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Home Protector:** This endorsement raises your dwelling and other structures coverage by 25 percent in some scenarios, but only if your home is insured for at least 95 percent of its estimated rebuild cost.
* **Water backup:** Different from flood insurance, water backup adds financial protection for plumbing and sump pump-related damage.
* **Personal injury:** Personal injury coverage helps with the legal costs related to slander, libel or a defamation of character lawsuit.
* **Flood:** USAA partners with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and other private insurance companies to help customers purchase flood insurance.
* **Electronics:** Raises your policy limits for your high-ticket tech items.

* ####  Overview
* ####  Pros and cons
* Offers unique coverage options that may not be available with other companies
* Numerous potential discounts available
* Scored lower than segment average for overall customer satisfaction per J.D. Power
* Endorsement availability varies by location
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Identity theft restoration:** Helps with costs related to restoring a stolen identity, like legal fees and lost wages, up to a certain coverage limit.
* **Water backup:** Water damage can be expensive, and this endorsement can help if your home is damaged due to sump pump, drain or appliance failure.
* **Scheduled personal property:** Insurance with higher coverage limits for appraised [valuables](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/insuring-expensive-possessions/) like art, jewelry, antiques and furs.
* **Business property:** Higher coverage limits for inventory and other business-related items you keep in your home.
* **Green improvement reimbursement:** With this endorsement, if you opt to repair or replace covered items following a claim with more eco-friendly versions, Allstate will cover the added cost.
* **Flood:** Allstate offers customers two ways to purchase flood insurance: through National General (which is owned by Allstate) and through a partnership with the NFIP.
* **HostAdvantage:** Available to Illinois residents, Allstate’s HostAdvantage provides specialized coverage to homeowners who rent out their homes on [Airbnb](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/airbnb-insurance/), VRBO or other hosting platforms.

* ####  Overview
**Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm might be a good choice if you like to consolidate your policies with one company. In addition to homeowners insurance, the provider offers many other insurance products, such as auto insurance, [life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/), disability insurance, small business insurance, farm and ranch insurance, umbrella insurance policies and pet and boat insurance, creating ample opportunity to bundle and save. However, State Farm does not offer as many [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) as some competitors. Although the company’s average premium is below the Illinois average, if you’re looking for extensive discounts, State Farm may not be the best choice. State Farm also does not partner with the NFIP. State Farm customers who want flood insurance will need to purchase a policy directly through the NFIP or through a different private insurer.
**Who State Farm may be good for:** If you have more than one insurance policy — such as home and auto or home and life — it could be worth getting a quote from State Farm.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Many lines of insurance available
* Highly-rated mobile app and online policy portal
* Not as many discount opportunities as some competitors
* Fewer advertised endorsements than competitors
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Personal articles coverage**: State Farm’s personal articles coverage for high-value items includes replacement cost coverage and worldwide coverage. Typically, you can insure your items without a deductible.
* **Cyber Event, Identity Restoration and Fraud Loss coverage (CEIDR)**: This is similar to the identity theft coverage we’ve seen with other carriers, but State Farm takes it a step further to include credit card monitoring.

* ####  Overview
**Who American Family may be good for:** AmFam has several opportunities for homeowners to customize their policies. For example, it offers a diminishing deductible option, which could lower the amount you’d pay before coverage kicks in by $100 every year you're claim-free. That endorsement alone may make it worth consideration by homeowners on a tight budget.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Ample endorsement options
* Rates are below the Illinois state average
* Mobile accessibility may be lacking
* Quotes are available online, but you must speak to an agent to purchase a policy
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Inland flood coverage****:** This is a unique type of flood insurance that provides coverage for inland water overflow, flash floods, rain accumulation and mudflows. Keep in mind that if you have a mortgage or home loan, this endorsement may not satisfy your financial lender’s flood insurance requirements.
* **Hidden water damage:** Covers leaks that occur in hard-to-spot places like inside your walls or beneath floorboards.
* **Home renovation damage:** Coverage kicks in if construction materials are damaged or stolen during a renovation project. Also helps if your home’s foundation collapses during renovation.
* **Roof damage:** Insures your roof at either its replacement cost value or actual cash value, depending on your roof and policy coverage.
* **Senior living coverage:** Adds liability and personal property protection for family members in an assisted living facility.
* **Vacation home coverage:** This is a great add-on for Illinois homeowners with a summer home along the shores of Lake Michigan. Vacation home coverage is specifically designed for secondary homes.

* ####  Overview
* ####  Pros and cons
* Coverage packages streamline the shopping process
* Declining deductible perk is free
* Low customer satisfaction per J.D. Power
* Lower-than-average digital satisfaction score in the shopping category, per J.D. Power
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Extended replacement cost:** Boost your home’s rebuild cost coverage by up to 25 percent.
* **Guaranteed replacement cost:** Guarantees that your home is insured for the entire cost of repairs, even if those repairs are above your policy limits.
* **Building ordinance or law coverage:** If your local Illinois building codes have been updated since your home was built, this covers the added cost of getting your home up to code following a covered loss.
* **Identity shield:** Farmers’ identity shield will connect you with a fraud specialist and can reimburse you for lost wages and legal expenses.

* **Improve your credit:** Boosting your [credit ](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/what-is-a-credit-score/)is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time to raise your credit score even a few points, but doing so is worthwhile when it comes to saving on insurance. Insurers generally give better rates to customers with better credit-based insurance scores, so taking the steps in the short term to improve your credit history can help you save in the long run.
