Receiving a speeding ticket can be a frustrating experience, but its implications extend far beyond the immediate fines and penalties. In California, traffic violations can significantly impact your auto insurance rates, often leading to increased premiums and changes in coverage.

With 9 years of experience as a licensed insurance agent, I’ve helped many drivers find auto insurance that can lessen the impact of a speeding ticket. If you’ve received a ticket, there are ways to still get affordable auto insurance. Let me explain how a speeding ticket can affect your [car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance) in California and how you can manage it.

## Key Takeaways

* A speeding ticket can lead to higher insurance rates. Insurers view speeding as a sign of risky behavior, which can result in a premium increase.
* The effects of a speeding ticket on your insurance can last for several years. Typically, tickets may stay on your driving record for three to five years, influencing your rates during that time.
* In California, a speeding ticket adds points to your driving record. Accumulating too many points can lead to further penalties, including license suspension and even steeper insurance costs.
* California has specific limits on the fines and duration of license suspensions for driving 100 miles per hour (mph) or more on highways.

## Do Speeding Tickets Affect Insurance In California?

As a driver in California, every action you take behind the wheel can influence your insurance costs. While it’s clear that an accident will typically result in a premium increase, it’s important to note that even a single speeding ticket can have a significant impact. In California, a speeding ticket can raise your insurance rates by an average of about 20%. Staying safe and adhering to traffic laws can help keep your premiums manageable.

## **How A Speeding Ticket Impacts Your Insurance In California**

Maintaining a clean driving record is beneficial for keeping [car insurance rates](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance) low. However, even one minor violation can raise your insurance costs, and the increase can vary significantly depending on the insurer. In California, you can see a 37% increase in your insurance premiums with just one speeding ticket on your record.

Here are some examples of how a single speeding ticket can affect your insurance rates. You’ll see how much the impact differs among different companies.

| Provider | Clean Record | Speeding Ticket | Increase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 21st Century | $1,845 | $2,112 | 16% |
| Farmers | $2,442 | $3,295 | 34% |
| GEICO | $1,071 | $2,074 | 94% |
| Mercury | $1,785 | $1,912 | 8% |
| State Farm | $1,305 | $2,809 | 113% |

Insurance rates can change based on several factors, including your driving record, where you live, your gender, and your claims history. When you file a claim for a speeding ticket, it can affect these factors differently, especially depending on how serious the ticket is. If the speeding ticket includes additional violations, the increase in your insurance cost can be more significant.

**TIME INFRACTIONS**: If you get 4 or more violations in a 12 month period your license will be suspended, 7 or more in a 24 month period.

## **Does A First-Time Speeding Ticket Affect Insurance?**

How your first speeding ticket impacts your insurance premium depends on the insurance company. Some insurers may view you as a high risk, leading to a significant rate increase. However, others might understand that mistakes happen and may not raise your rates much at all, especially companies that offer accident forgiveness.

**CONSEQUENCES**: Speeds below 10 MPH are classified as Class C Misdemeanors; Speeds up to and exceeding 25, or reckless driving, are Class B and A Misdemeanors.

## How To Find Affordable Insurance After A Speeding Ticket

In California, finding the right insurance after a speeding ticket can take some effort, as different insurance companies assess situations and drivers in unique ways.

### Switching To Liability-Only Coverage

Having full coverage can get costly after a speeding ticket. If you’re not leasing your car and don’t have a requirement to keep full coverage, consider switching to liability-only coverage to lower your costs. While this means you won’t have protection for your own vehicle in case of an accident or theft, it will make your monthly payments more affordable.

1

### Taking A Defensive Driving Course

Insurance companies appreciate drivers who take steps to learn from their mistakes, especially after getting a speeding ticket. Completing a defensive driving course shows that you’re committed to improving your driving skills and can potentially lower your insurance rates.

2

### Shop Around

Car insurance varies from company to company, and so do the consequences of a speeding ticket. As mentioned earlier, each insurer raises rates differently. If you get a speeding ticket and see a big increase at your renewal, consider looking for other options. Another company might be more flexible regarding your ticket.

Remember, keeping a clean driving record is important for your future rates. If you get another ticket within three years, it will reset the clock, and your insurance rates could go up even more because you’ll be seen as a higher risk.

3

### Bundle Your Policy

55% of California residents own a home. Check with your insurance company for any discounts you might qualify for. If you also have homeowners or renters insurance, bundling those policies can save you money. Other discounts may be available for completing a defensive driving course, being part of specific organizations, or driving less than a certain number of miles each year.

4

### Attend A Traffic School

You can go to traffic school to have a one-point violation taken off your record. You’ll need to check your eligibility. You can only do this once every 18 months. California has a list of state-approved traffic schools. You can check the ones in your [area](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/olsis-traffic-schools/).

5

### Join The California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan

If you have a speeding ticket on you, it makes you a high risk driver. Insurance companies usually avoid having high risk drivers as their customers. Learn about the [California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan.](https://www.aipso.com/Plan-Sites/California-ARP)

6

### Reduce Your Coverage Levels

If you’re leasing a car, you usually have to keep full coverage, but if you own an older vehicle, you might [consider lowering your coverage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/do-i-need-collision-and-comprehensive-insurance-on-an-old-car). Increasing your deductible can also lower your premium, but keep in mind that you’ll pay more out of pocket if you need to file a claim. If you drop Comprehensive and Collision, remember that your insurance will only cover damages to the other party in an accident, not your own vehicle.

## Let AI Review Your Policy for Hidden Savings

## **What To Do After Getting A Speeding Ticket**

When you get a speeding ticket, you have two options: you can either pay the ticket and accept the consequences, or you can challenge it.

### Paying The Ticket

This process is quite simple. When you go to court, you’ll receive instructions on how to [pay the ticket](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/traffic/pay). Make sure to pay it on time to avoid additional fees. If you wait too long, you could even face an arrest warrant.

### Contesting The Ticket

Another option is to request a trial before the deadline on your court notice. During this trial, you can bring witnesses and provide evidence to support your case. If the judge finds you guilty, they will determine the fine.

The trial can happen in two ways:

**Written Declaration:** With this option, you don’t have to go to court in person. Instead, you can write a statement explaining what happened and ask for a trial based on that [written declaration.](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr205.pdf)

**Court Trial:** You can also ask for a [court trial](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc031.pdf), which can be held in person or remotely via phone or video. If you choose this option, a lawyer can represent you.

### Deferred Disposition

Another option is deferred disposition. In this case, you plead no contest and pay the fine. You’ll then be placed on probation, and if you don’t get another speeding ticket during the agreed time, the original ticket won’t appear on your record.

## **How Long Does A Speeding Ticket Stay On My Record?**

In California, a speeding ticket typically stays on your driving record for 3 years from the date of the violation. However, more serious offenses, such as reckless driving, can remain on your record for up to 10 years. Points from speeding tickets can affect your insurance rates and lead to penalties if you accumulate too many within a specific timeframe.

## **How Much Is A Ticket In California?**

If you’re driving in California and find yourself pulled over for speeding or another traffic violation, you might be wondering, “How much is a ticket?” The cost of a ticket can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of violation, your driving record, and even the county where the ticket was issued. In California, speeding tickets can range from around $35 for minor infractions to several hundred dollars for more serious offenses.

But what happens when you are fined when other factors are in play such as school and construction zones?

## FAQs

### What is the cheapest car insurance after a speeding ticket?

The cheapest car insurance after a speeding ticket can vary based on where you live and your driving history. Insurers like Geico, State Farm, and Progressive often offer good rates, even for those with tickets. It’s important to get quotes from different companies, as some may be more forgiving. Taking a defensive driving course can also help lower your premium. Be sure to look for discounts, like bundling policies or keeping a clean record after your ticket.

### How do I get a speeding ticket off my insurance?

To get a speeding ticket off your insurance, you can start by checking if you qualify for traffic school. Completing a traffic school course can sometimes prevent the ticket from affecting your insurance rates. You should also avoid getting any more tickets for a while, as this can help keep your record clean. Additionally, after some time, the ticket will naturally fall off your record, usually after three years in California. Finally, consider shopping around for insurance quotes; some companies may offer better rates for drivers with a ticket on their record.

### Will my insurance company find out about my speeding ticket immediately?

Your insurance company may not find out about your speeding ticket right away. Typically, they learn about it when your driving record is updated, which can take a few weeks to a couple of months after you receive the ticket. However, if you report the ticket yourself when renewing your policy, they will definitely know. It’s always a good idea to be honest with your insurer, as failing to report it could lead to issues later on.
