## Best car insurance companies in Colorado

To find the best auto insurance Colorado has to offer, Bankrate’s editorial team reviewed an array of metrics for dozens of carriers, including quoted premiums provided by Quadrant Information Services, coverage offerings and available discounts. We also examined third-party reviews from multiple sources, including overall customer satisfaction from the [J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study) and financial strength ratings from AM Best. Then, we assigned each a Bankrate Score on a five-point scale, indicating the provider’s overall competitiveness relative to other top insurers.

If you are looking for the best auto insurance in Colorado, you may want to consider the following [auto insurance carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/). Some of them even offer [average rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) below the Colorado average, which is $267 per month for full coverage and $48 for minimum coverage.

**Why Progressive made our list**: Progressive could be an excellent choice for drivers new to car insurance because of its Name Your Price tool. The Name Your Price tool makes tailoring an affordable coverage package easy — shoppers simply enter their budget and coverage needs, and the Name Your Price tool provides coverage packages based on this information. The company also offers an assortment of product lines in addition to auto insurance, including [home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), business insurance and even Segway insurance. However, Progressive received below-industry-average scores from J.D. Power for customer and [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study). This indicates previous customers may have felt the service they received from Progressive was lacking.

**Why Geico made our list:** Geico is known for [offering low premiums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/), and the company’s average rates in Colorado are no exception. However, it may be worth noting that Geico offers fewer add-on coverage options compared to other major carriers, meaning its policies may be better suited for Colorado drivers seeking basic coverage. Geico offers a generous list of discounts to help you save additional money on your policy, which could make up for its limited add-ons. Geico did earn a [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for being the Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers, so if you have marks on your license, it may be worth asking for a quote.

## How to find the best car insurance in Colorado

Finding a car insurance provider in Colorado that offers the best coverage for a price that isn’t Rocky Mountain high can feel like a challenge. To help you out, we have put together a few tips to guide your search for the best car insurance in Colorado.

* Number 1 Icon

  ### Consider your individual needs

  Caret Down Icon 

  On the surface, it may seem like all car insurance companies basically offer the same product. But when you look closer, you’ll see many insurers try to cater their coverage to certain individual needs and driving profiles. For example, while some providers charge inflated premiums to high-risk profiles, like teenagers and drivers with DUIs, others specialize in these areas and offer more fair premiums.

  At the very least, you’ll need a 25/50/15 liability insurance policy to satisfy [Colorado’s minimum car insurance laws](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/mandatory-automobile-insurance-colorado). After that, based on your specific vehicle and overall accident risk, you’ll want to discuss with an agent if you want additional coverage or higher liability limits. If you finance or lease a vehicle, you will almost certainly need to maintain a full coverage policy to satisfy your lender's requirements.

If you finance or lease a vehicle, you will almost certainly need to maintain a full coverage policy to satisfy your lender's requirements.
* Number 2 Icon

  ### Consider reviews and ratings

  Caret Down Icon 

  Price is a key detail for many insurance shoppers, but it's not the only factor to consider. When the price difference between quotes is negligible, it can be smart to check out reviews and ratings to see how providers perform in certain areas of insurance that you prioritize. Third-party agencies like J.D. Power, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and AM Best put out annual ratings that give insight into how well car insurance providers are performing in customer service, claim satisfaction and digital experience. Doing a little research into reviews and ratings can save you the headache of going through a poor claims experience down the road.

* Number 3 Icon

  ### Consider smaller companies

  Caret Down Icon 

  Whether it be a neighborhood farmer’s market or a ski club, Colorado residents know the value of community. Insuring your vehicle with a small insurance provider isn't just about supporting a local business. Smaller companies often have in-house insurance agents who are uniquely knowledgeable about the local risks you may face on the road. They often have strong relationships with policyholders and excellent customer service. Small insurers can still have competitive pricing, but you'll generally get fewer digital tools than with a brand name carrier.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What is the cheapest car insurance company in Colorado?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The [cheapest car insurance company in Colorado](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-colorado/) for you will depend on several factors specific to you and your vehicle. Carriers consider your age, gender, ZIP code, driving record and more when pricing policies and weigh these rating factors differently, so you may discover rates vary widely from company to company. For that reason, it pays to gather quotes from several companies for the same coverage types and policy limits to compare. Experts recommend inquiring about [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) you may qualify for from each company, as well.

* ### What is considered full coverage in Colorado?

  Caret Down Icon 

  "[Full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/)" doesn't have a set definition in the insurance industry, but it generally refers to liability insurance, plus collision and comprehensive coverage. Some carriers automatically increase liability limits with a full coverage policy, while others may add in other coverage types, like rental car reimbursement. Car insurance policies are generally customizable, so it's a good idea to ask for clarification about coverage types and limits to ensure you're getting a policy with adequate financial protection — and not paying for any coverage you don't need.

* ###### What do you need to get car insurance in Colorado?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Getting car insurance in Colorado is typically a pretty straightforward process. You can [request quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) and purchase a policy by sharing some basic information with an insurer, such as age, gender, location and the type of vehicle you drive. If you have several accidents on your driving record or have a history of DUIs, you may have to put in a little more research effort, as not all providers will offer quotes or policies to drivers with these [high-risk](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) profiles. While most large carriers offer online quoting, some smaller carriers may require you to speak to an agent over the phone to finalize your policy.

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
