## **What You Can Expect to Pay for State Farm Home Insurance**
Home insurance premiums can vary from one company to the next. Factors like coverage types and amounts, deductibles, discounts, claims history, and [where you live](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-home-insurance) affect how much you’ll pay.
State Farm’s home insurance policies average $226 per month for $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
Now, let’s look at how coverage amounts and your location affect homeowners insurance rates.
### **Average rates by coverage amount**
The dwelling coverage amount is the part of your home insurance that covers the cost to repair or rebuild your house if a fire or storm damages it. It also covers attached structures like a garage.
The more risk the insurance company takes on, the more you’ll end up paying for coverage. So, higher coverage amounts usually mean higher premiums. But keep in mind that dwelling coverage amounts are usually less than your home’s overall value, since they don’t account for the value of the land your home sits on.
The table below shows State Farm’s average rates for different coverage amounts, according to Compare.com data.

Insurers consider regional and statewide factors, such as weather patterns, crime rates, real estate values, and construction costs, when determining local premiums.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/reviews/state-farm#cite-2) That’s why home insurance rates can vary widely by state and even ZIP code.

## **State Farm Home Insurance Reviews**
Researching customer feedback and industry expert ratings can give you a well-rounded view of a home insurance company’s reliability, service quality, and financial stability. Doing your research can help you evaluate which company may be right for you.
Let’s take a look at how State Farm performs in the eyes of customers and industry experts.
### **Customer reviews**
Checking what current and former customers say about a company is vital because real user experiences provide valuable insights beyond marketing claims. Reviews can reveal how a company handles customer service, claims, and overall satisfaction — factors that directly affect your experience.
Here’s how customers rank State Farm on three major review platforms.
**Review Platform** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Rating** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---  
Trustpilot | 1.5 out of 5 stars  
Better Business Bureau (BBB) | F  
ConsumerAffairs | 1.9 out of 5 stars  
State Farm receives common home insurance complaints for claim denials, policy cancellations following claims, and poor customer service responsiveness.
Keep in mind that dissatisfied customers are often more vocal than satisfied ones, so it’s essential to carefully weigh your options and review policy details and the claims process before choosing an insurer.
### **Industry ratings**
Third-party ratings from industry experts like J.D. Power and AM Best can provide an impartial assessment of an insurance company’s financial strength, customer satisfaction, and service quality. These ratings can help you assess an insurer’s reliability and stability and its performance compared to other companies.
Unlike customer reviews, industry agencies use comprehensive data analysis, rigorous standards, and expert evaluations to give a more objective assessment of a company’s standing.
Check out the table below to see how some of the most respected third-party agencies in the insurance industry rate State Farm.
**Rating Service** | **Rating**  
---|---  
J.D. Power customer satisfaction* | 643/1,000  
J.D. Power claims satisfaction** | 661/1,000  
AM Best | A++  
NAIC complaint index*** | 1.22  
*Industry average: 640 
**Industry average: 682 
***A score of 1.0 indicates the expected number of complaints. 2.0 indicates twice the number of expected complaints.
State Farm holds the highest AM Best rating, demonstrating its ability to fulfill its policy obligations and pay claims on time and in full.

You can also contact a local State Farm agent by phone or in person at a local office.
