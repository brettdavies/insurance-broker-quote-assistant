Did You Know?
With over 1.2 million registered electric vehicles, California has more electric vehicle owners than any other state.[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/best-car-insurance/#citation-5) If you’re thinking of buying an EV, Travelers is a great place to start with a quote.

## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we evaluate auto insurance providers based on four key factors:
* **Price (40%):** We analyze average premiums for full and minimum coverage for good drivers in California. We also consider available discounts. Full coverage averages use the following limits:
* Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
* Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
* Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
* **Claims Handling (25%):** A good claims handling process from an auto insurer is prompt, transparent, and efficient, with clear communication throughout, fair evaluation of damages, and timely payment or resolution. We assess claims practices through sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings. Real-life customer experiences are included when available.
* **Customer Experience (25%):** We evaluate the ease of the customer journey, from getting a quote and purchasing a policy to making changes or accessing documents. We consider the availability of agents in California, quality of online interactions, and the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include J.D. Power studies (with preference for regional, California-specific studies), the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
* **Coverage Options (10%):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and value providers with options beyond the state required minimums, like accident forgiveness, gap coverage, rideshare coverage, and more.
