Despite its population and number of drivers, California is home to some of the country’s lowest minimum auto insurance requirements. Since 1967, California’s minimum limits have remained unchanged, even with increased medical care and vehicle repair costs. However, California has recently introduced [legislation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1107) that will increase minimum liability requirements for the first time in over 50 years. Before we discuss upcoming changes, let’s first review California’s current auto insurance limits.
* California [currently ](https://blog.aisinsurance.com/2023/08/30/california-auto-insurance-limits-2025/#current)requires all motorists in the state to carry liability insurance with minimum limits of 15/30/5.
* With the passing of [Senate Bill 1107](https://blog.aisinsurance.com/2023/08/30/california-auto-insurance-limits-2025/#bill), California motorists will be required to carry liability insurance with minimum limits of 30/60/15 in 2025.
* In [2035](https://blog.aisinsurance.com/2023/08/30/california-auto-insurance-limits-2025/#2035), minimum liability insurance limits will increase again to 50/100/25.
Under current [California law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=16056.&nodeTreePath=12.1.3&lawCode=VEH), all motorists in the state must carry liability insurance with the minimum limits of:
California’s current auto insurance limits were set in 1967 and have yet to change since. Unfortunately, a driver who only carries the minimum requirements may find themselves lacking coverage if they’re responsible for an accident in 2023. And state officials seem to agree. According to [Ricardo Lara](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/bulletin-2023-1-re-sb-1107-final-003.pdf), California’s Insurance Commissioner, the state’s “current minimum coverage levels often [leave] California drivers at risk of being one accident away from financial ruin.”
In an effort to increase minimum coverage limits that better reflect today’s medical care and repair costs, California signed [Senate Bill 1107](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1107) into law in September of 2022.
[Ricardo Lara](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/bulletin-2023-1-re-sb-1107-final-003.pdf) says this new law will “ensure auto insurance keeps up with the change in times and that California’s drivers are more adequately protected.” However, opponents of the bill cite the current economic strain as an argument against increasing limits.
Although you must purchase insurance that meets your [state’s minimum requirements](https://www.aisinsurance.com/state-pages/auto-insurance-by-state), it’s important to know that liability insurance does not cover your vehicle. Liability insurance protects you financially from any damage or injuries you cause to another person due to a car accident. To repair damage caused to your vehicle, you’ll need collision and comprehensive coverage.
Collision and comprehensive coverage covers repair or replacement costs (up to your policy’s limits) if your vehicle is damaged in a covered incident. [Collision](https://blog.aisinsurance.com/2022/12/12/what-is-collision-insurance/) insurance applies when you’re involved in an accident with another car or stationary object. [Comprehensive](https://blog.aisinsurance.com/2023/09/07/comprehensive-car-insurance/) insurance applies when your vehicle is damaged in a non-collision event, such as theft, vandalism, or weather accidents. These coverage types are optional but may be required by your lender if you are financing or leasing a car.
