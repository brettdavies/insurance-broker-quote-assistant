_Los Angeles, CA_ – Today the Consumer Federation of America reports that Proposition 103, the insurance reform law passed by California voters on November 8, 1988, has saved drivers $154  _billion_ on their auto insurance. The report also finds that the law has  _lowered_ auto liability premiums in California by 5.7% since 1989, even as liability premiums increased 58.5% across the rest of the country.
“Three decades ago, California voters joined together with tens of thousands of small donations to put Proposition 103 on the ballot and pass it, despite an unprecedented $63 million campaign of lies and deception by the insurance industry,” said Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103 and the founder of Consumer Watchdog. “$154 billion is a 30th birthday gift from Prop 103 to the people of California, rewarding a battle against insurance company overcharges and abuses that has been waged every day for the last three decades.”
* Auto insurance liability premiums, excluding comprehensive and collision coverage, went  _down_ 7% in California since 1989; during the same period, liability premiums went up 58.5% nationwide.
* California has the 2nd most competitive auto insurance market in the nation.
By giving members of the public the ability to monitor the insurance industry’s compliance with the law and challenge unlawful insurance premiums or abusive practices before the California Department of Insurance and in the courts, Proposition 103 has enabled California consumers to protect themselves against insurance overcharges and unfair rates. Since 2003, Consumer Watchdog alone has invoked these procedures to stop $3.3 billion in unnecessary rate increases on auto, home, renter, small business and even the professional insurance that doctors have to pay.

Proposition 103 was passed by California voters on November 8, 1988. Insurance companies filed over 100 lawsuits to block Proposition 103 from taking effect. In May, 1989, the California Supreme Court unanimously upheld all major provisions of the law. 103 forced insurance companies to pay over  _$2 billion in refunds_ for overcharges between 1987 and 1988.
