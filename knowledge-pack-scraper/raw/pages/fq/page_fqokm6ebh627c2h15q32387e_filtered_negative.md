Progressive Snapshot is a free [usage-based insurance program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/telematics "Telematics Insurance: Is It Right for You?") that tracks your driving to give you a discount.

After your driving habits are monitored for a  set time period, you get your Progressive Snapshot discount.
The app and plug-in device versions of Snapshot [have a few differences Progressive Snapshot app vs. plug-in device ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review#app-vs-device "Progressive Snapshot app vs. plug-in device") but both follow the same five steps.
2. Download the Snapshot mobile app or  install the plug-in device.
** In most states, Snapshot is also available as a trial for drivers who don't have insurance with Progressive.** The program, called Snapshot Road Test, is 30 days long and allows you to see what kind of discount you would earn from Progressive. Road Test is only available in the mobile app version and not via the plug-in device.

* **Better options:** Most other usage-based programs won't increase your rates. Try [State Farm Drive Safe & Save](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save-insurance-review "State Farm Drive Safe & Save Review"), [Liberty Mutual RightTrack](https://www.valuepenguin.com/right-track-liberty-mutual-insurance-review "Liberty Mutual RightTrack Review") or [Nationwide SmartRide](https://www.valuepenguin.com/nationwide-smartride-insurance-review "Is Nationwide SmartRide Worth It?").
* **Most usage-based programs look at how often you drive.** If you drive a lot or drive late in the night, these types of discounts probably aren't right for you. Look into other ways to [save on car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tips-save-car-insurance "Tips to Save Money on Car Insurance"), like shopping around or using different discounts.
If Progressive Snapshot isn't a good fit for you, you may be able to [find a better usage-based program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") to help you save money on car insurance. For example, Nationwide's SmartRide program can earn you a discount of up to 40%, it doesn't track your phone usage, and your rate won't go up if you have bad driving habits.
