## About Geico Homeowners Insurance
Geico is one of the largest auto insurance companies in the nation. Its agency also sells [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/), but it is important to note that Geico does not underwrite home insurance. It partners with third-party insurance companies that sell homeowners coverage.
The Geico Insurance Agency can help you find a homeowners insurance company that will serve your needs through its online quote tool. You can also call to speak to one of the agency’s licensed insurance agents.
If you purchase homeowners insurance through Geico, you will manage your policy, bills and claims directly with the insurance company that issues your policy.
The Geico Insurance Agency also sells condo, mobile home and renters insurance from partner companies.
* * *
## Geico Home Insurance Coverage Available
If you purchase homeowners insurance through the Geico Insurance Agency, regardless of which company writes your policy, you will get standard homeowners insurance coverage such as:
* Dwelling
* Personal property
* Liability
* Medical payments
* Additional living expenses
**Related:** [What does homeowners insurance cover?](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/)
### Dwelling coverage
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage/) pays to repair or replace your house if it is damaged or destroyed by a problem listed in your policy, such as a fire or tornado. It also provides coverage for structures attached to your house, such as a garage, deck or porch.
Your insurance agent can help provide a rebuilding cost estimate.
### Other structures coverage
This coverage pays for damage to structures on your property that are not attached to your house, like a fence or shed.
### Personal property coverage
[Personal property coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-coverage/) pays to repair or replace personal belongings, like furniture and clothing, that have been stolen or damaged by a problem listed in your policy.
Certain categories of items, such as jewelry, furs and cash, will have a limit on how much your insurance company will pay to replace them if they are stolen. For example, your policy might limit the theft of jewelry and watches to $1,500. If you want more coverage, you can [“schedule” valuable items](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/scheduled-personal-property/).
### Liability insurance
[Liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) pays for injuries and property damage you accidentally cause to others. It also pays for your legal defense if you are sued after an accident.
For example, if a guest falls down your stairs or your dog bites someone, liability insurance can pay for their medical care and your legal bills in a lawsuit.
When deciding how much liability insurance you need, consider how much you could lose in a lawsuit.
### Additional living expenses coverage
[Additional living expenses](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use/) coverage kicks in if your home is temporarily uninhabitable due to a problem covered by your policy.
You are covered for costs above and beyond what you normally would spend, such as the added expense of hotel rooms, eating out, laundry service and pet boarding.
* * *
## How Much Does Geico Home Insurance Cost?
Because a Geico home insurance policy can come from one of many partners, it’s impossible to estimate an average cost.
If you’re buying home insurance through Geico Insurance Agency, you will have the option to select your coverage levels and the amount of your deductible. These choices will impact how much you pay for homeowners insurance from a Geico partner.
The average [cost of homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-homeowners-insurance/) in the U.S. is $1,854 per year, according to a Forbes Advisor analysis. This is for a home insurance policy with $300,000 of dwelling coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage.
### Actual cash value vs. replacement cost
As part of your homeowners insurance policy, you can choose between [actual cash value or replacement cost for your belongings.](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost-vs-actual-cash-value/)
* **Actual cash value coverage** pays for damage to your personal property at its depreciated value. This can make the amount you pay in insurance premiums less but will result in a smaller payout if you file a claim.
* **Replacement cost coverage** reimburses you for the current cost of replacing your possessions, regardless of how old they are. Your payout after a loss will probably be larger, but your home insurance premiums will be higher.
### The size of your deductible
Your deductible is the amount your insurance company deducts from a claim check. The larger your deductible, the lower your homeowners insurance premiums.
