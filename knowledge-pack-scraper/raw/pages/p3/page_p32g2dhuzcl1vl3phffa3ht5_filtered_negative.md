## Methodology
Insure.com in the fall of 2024 surveyed more than 1,750 insurance consumers (1,011 people with home insurance). The survey was conducted by online market research company Slice MR.
Respondents were asked to name their home insurer and then grade it in the following categories:
* Customer satisfaction
* Ease of service
* Policy offerings
* Claims satisfaction
* Digital experience (website/app)
* Insurance shopping and buying process
* Billing process
* Discounts offered
* Fair rate increases over time
* Older home coverage
* Extra coverage included as standard
* Home and auto bundling
The percentage of respondents who said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their insurer is presented in the results.
We then asked respondents to provide a yes or no response to indicate their agreement with the following statements:
1. I plan to renew with my current home insurance company
2. I would recommend my home insurance company to others
3. I trust my home insurance company
The percentage of respondents who said yes is presented in the results.
The editors compiled the survey results and then selected – based on the number of survey responses – the top companies for further evaluation.
They then collected AM Best data, which measure financial strength, and National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ complaint data, which ranks a company by the number of customer complaints it receives. The Insure.com team identified the NAIC codes of each underwriting company for each carrier and calculated a weighted average complaint index, weighted by the annual written premium. The associated NAIC complaint index score was used in the calculations.
They also collected insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services.
With the help of Prof. David Marlett, Ph.D., Managing Director of the Brantley Risk and Insurance Center at Appalachian State University, the editors created a rating system to determine which insurance companies were best in each sector. For home insurers, we took the following and gave each a weight.
* Survey: 40% of the total score (10% customer satisfaction, 10% recommended, 10% renewal rate and 10% claims handling)
* AM Best: 25% of total score
* Annual premium: 20% of total score
* NAIC: 15% of total score
