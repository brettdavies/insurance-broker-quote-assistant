**Example case:** Popular yogurt brand Dannon was found guilty of false advertising in 2010. The company claimed their _Activia_ brand yogurt was “scientifically” and “clinically” proven to boost your immune system. In reality, no scientific evidence supported the claim, so a federal court ordered Dannon to pay out $45 million in a class action lawsuit.
####  **The Colorado Consumer Protection Act**
The list in _C.R.S. 6-1-105_ is more comprehensive, but, generally, Colorado businesses may not:
* mislabel and sell _used_ products as _new_.
* _three times_ the amount of actual damages incurred if the defendant acted in bad faith as established by clear and convincing evidence.
See [**_Colo. Rev. Statutes. § 6-1-113(2)_**](https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=33d433d7-6a63-463f-9162-a2048888c607&config=014FJAAyNGJkY2Y4Zi1mNjgyLTRkN2YtYmE4OS03NTYzNzYzOTg0OGEKAFBvZENhdGFsb2d592qv2Kywlf8caKqYROP5&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes-legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A652P-D1M3-CH1B-T27R-00008-00&pdcontentcomponentid=234176&pdteaserkey=sr0&pditab=allpods&ecomp=8s65kkk&earg=sr0&prid=47a7dc62-4786-447d-8d07-516dc39c62de)**_._**
If your actual damages were less than $500, you’ll receive a minimum of $500. If your actual damages were _more than_ $500, you’ll be awarded the actual damages amount. Finally, you receive what’s called treble damages if the advertiser knew they were putting out a false ad. Treble damages is three times the actual damages.
You can also be entitled to **costs and attorneys’ fees** in litigating the action as determined by the court. See _C.R.S. § 6-1-113(2)(b)_.
Many plaintiffs bringing claims under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act push for _treble damages._ Obtaining treble damages under the CCPA defendant will be liable for actual damages or three times actual damages if the defendant’s conduct was done in bad faith; that is, the conduct was fraudulent, willful, knowing, or intentional. See also _Vista Resorts, Inc. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co._ 117 P.3d 60 (Colo. App. 2004).
