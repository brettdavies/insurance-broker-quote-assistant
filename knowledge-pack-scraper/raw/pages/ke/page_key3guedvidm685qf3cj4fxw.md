### Safeco vs. Nationwide: home insurance rate comparison
Both Nationwide and Safeco offer homeowners policies at competitive rates: **both companies average annual homeowners insurance rates** **are** **$1,236**. The carriers' products and pricing strategies differ depending on your situation, so it's important to consider your quotes may not match these exactly when looking for coverage. 
Much like auto insurance rates, homeowners insurance prices can vary based on certain factors. Companies use your insurance history — along with your location — when establishing your rate.
Cheapest average rates
Since both of these insurers offer the same average monthly rate for homeowners, this is a tie. 
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
