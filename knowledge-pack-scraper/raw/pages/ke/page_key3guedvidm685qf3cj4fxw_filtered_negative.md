Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
If you have a violation such as a DUI, reckless driving conviction, at-fault crash or speeding ticket on your résumé, **your rates could be more affordable with Nationwide than with Safeco**. Each car insurance company evaluates rates differently after a driving violation, so don't hesitate to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.
---|---|---
Auto insurance companies use a driver's age to gauge risk, setting their rates accordingly. Insurance is usually expensive for [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) and relatively affordable for middle-aged drivers. Because every car insurance company establishes its prices in a different manner, it's usually worthwhile to compare quotes.
---|---|---
Costs aside, Safeco and Nationwide each have pros and cons: ranging from their customer satisfaction ratings to their discount programs and various policy extras. To ensure you're making an informed insurance decision, [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) and compare rates before buying a policy.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/nationwide-vs-safeco/)
Safeco [homeowners insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) is a good option for many customers. In general, homeowners can expect good coverage at competitive rates. While Safeco doesn't offer a vast number of endorsements, those that they do are very reasonably priced. One thing that potential customers will want to consider is the overall satisfaction of Safeco customers. The company's homeowners coverage receives fewer complaints than their auto coverage, though customer satisfaction is still well below average. To find out more about the different types of coverage offered — as well as average rates — have a look at our guide below.
