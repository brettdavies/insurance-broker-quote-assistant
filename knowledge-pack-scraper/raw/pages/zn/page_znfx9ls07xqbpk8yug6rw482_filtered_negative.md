# How Much Auto Insurance Do I Need in Florida?
If you’re a Florida resident, you might wonder about the specific auto insurance requirements and recommendations in the Sunshine State. Your agent can help you evaluate your needs and get a policy that complies with Florida’s auto insurance regulations and provides appropriate auto insurance coverage.
## Florida’s Auto Insurance Requirements[![Man Inside Vehicle](https://www.floridainsurancepro.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/11/13861.jpg)](https://www.floir.com/)
Florida, like many other states, has minimum [auto insurance](https://www.floridainsurancepro.com/coverage/auto-insurance/) requirements that drivers must meet, including the following:
* **Personal injury protection (PIP)** —Florida is a no-fault insurance state, which means that regardless of who is at fault in an accident, each driver’s PIP coverage pays for their medical expenses and lost wages. The minimum required amount of PIP may not be sufficient to meet your needs. Your agent can help you get the right PIP insurance amount.
* **Property damage liability (PDL)** — This coverage helps pay for damages to someone else’s property, such as their vehicle or a building, if you’re at fault in an accident.
These minimum requirements provide some protection but may not be sufficient in all circumstances. That’s why it’s essential to consider your specific needs and assess whether additional coverage is warranted.
## Factors to Consider for Adequate Coverage
Consider your financial assets and what you stand to lose in the event of an accident. If your assets exceed the minimum insurance coverage, increasing your liability coverage is wise to protect yourself from potential lawsuits.
While not required by law, adding comprehensive and collision coverage to your policy can help protect your vehicle in case of damage or theft. This is particularly important if you have a valuable car.
Florida has a relatively high rate of uninsured drivers. To protect yourself in case you’re in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver, consider adding this coverage to your policy.
## Balancing Costs and Coverage
It’s important to note that while increasing your coverage limits and adding additional protections can provide more comprehensive insurance, it will also result in higher premiums. Balancing your budget with adequate coverage is a crucial consideration.
