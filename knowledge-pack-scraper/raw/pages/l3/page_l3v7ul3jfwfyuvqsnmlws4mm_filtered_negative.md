Bodily injury refers to physical harm sustained by an individual, such as broken bones, bruises, or other physical damages. In the context of insurance, bodily injury liability coverage is designed to compensate third parties for their physical injuries if you are found at fault in a [car accident](https://abrahamwatkins.com/houston-car-accident-lawyer/). For example, in Texas, drivers are required to carry a minimum of 30,000inbodilyinjurycoverageperperson,upto30,000inbodilyinjurycoverageperperson,upto60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for damages. However, these amounts may not always cover the full extent of damages in severe accidents, potentially leaving the at-fault party exposed to additional financial liability.
1. **Choosing Legal Representation**: Selecting an experienced [Houston personal injury attorney](https://abrahamwatkins.com/) is critical. During a free consultation, you can evaluate whether the attorney is the right fit for your case by asking about their experience, trial history, and fee structure.
4. **Assessing Injuries**: Your attorney will work with medical experts to evaluate the extent of your injuries, their impact on your life, and [future recovery costs.](https://abrahamwatkins.com/how-much-compensation-can-i-receive-for-my-car-accident-injuries/)
* **What is the difference between bodily injury and personal injury?** Bodily injury refers to physical harm, while personal injury includes both physical and psychological damages and is a legal term used in civil lawsuits.
* **What is the minimum bodily injury coverage in Texas?** Texas requires 30,000 per person and up to 60,000 per accident in bodily injury liability coverage. However, higher limits are recommended for better protection.
* **Can I pursue a personal injury claim without an attorney?** While it is possible to file a claim without legal representation, personal injury cases are complex, and having an attorney significantly increases your chances of securing fair compensation.
