Electronic automatic billing allows insurance companies to bill you digitally and automatically withdraw premium payments on a monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual basis. This setup often qualifies you for a discount of 5% to 10%, which can lead to significant savings.

If your current insurance company does not offer an automatic payment discount, it might be worth looking into another company for a quote. Consider looking for the same coverage from a company that offers an automatic payment discount as it might net out to be less premium per month, but make sure you [evaluate your auto insurance quotes](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-to-evaluate-auto-insurance-quotes/) to ensure the coverage is the same.

Another great way to save is to bundle your auto insurance with other insurance products such as homeowners, renters, or even other vehicle insurance. By purchasing multiple policies from one insurance carrier, you are able to realize savings that could be worth hundreds of dollars a year. It is worth looking into a company that can quote all your insurance needs and offers discounts for bundling.

Lastly, there is always the option of increasing [auto insurance deductibles](https://www.autoinsurance.org/auto-insurance-deductibles/) to lower your overall insurance cost. Your deductible is the dollar amount taken out of an insurance claim and can range from nothing to thousands of dollars. Insurance companies like their insureds to have higher deductibles as it insulates them from smaller claims and makes the payout in the event of a large claim smaller.

If you take a higher deductible, you take more risk, but an insurance company will reward you for taking that risk in the form of a lower premium. You should consider your own financial situation, risk tolerance, and reduction in premium when looking at higher deductibles.
