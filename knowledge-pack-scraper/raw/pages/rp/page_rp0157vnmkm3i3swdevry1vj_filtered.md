The deductible amount can typically be selected by the insured within a reasonable limit. For example, you may be able to choose between a $250 to $1,000 deductible.

Since your deductible is the amount you pay before insurance kicks in, it’s one of the many [factors that affect auto insurance rates](https://www.autoinsurance.org/factors-that-affect-auto-insurance-rates/). Check out the table below to compare average rates for car insurance based on deductible amount:
