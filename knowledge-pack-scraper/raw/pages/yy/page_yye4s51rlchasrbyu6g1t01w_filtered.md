## Progressive Insurance: A solid choice for most shoppers

A broad list of discounts, extra coverage options and below-average prices among similarly-sized carriers earn Progressive a **solid** rating from experts at The Zebra.

Our customers generally agree, according to the respondents to our survey. Progressive customer service has garnered mixed reviews, but affordable premiums and widespread availability make up for this.

What customers like:

* **Snapshot discount:** Progressive's telematic device is well-liked by customers for its ability to lower premiums
* **Affordable liability coverage:** Progressive's average rate for a liability-only policy ($344) is one of the most affordable in the country.

What customers don't like:

* **Rate hikes after claims:** Customers report significant increases post-claim.
* **Difficult or poor app experience:** Progressive's app scores in the bottom percentile of insurance companies.

### How The Zebra evaluates insurance companies

#### Methodology — how The Zebra reviews insurance companies

The team of insurance experts at The Zebra evaluates companies by focusing on **customer experience first**, with an emphasis on service quality, reliability, and ease of interaction. Unlike previous models, **pricing is not scored** but is instead presented separately as context for comparison.

Each category has been scored using a combination of our internal customer satisfaction survey results and published scores from reputable organizations such as AM Best and J.D. Power.

* **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%):** This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
* **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
* **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%):** This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
* **Trust & Reliability (25%):** This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.

**Price context:** *Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided.*

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
