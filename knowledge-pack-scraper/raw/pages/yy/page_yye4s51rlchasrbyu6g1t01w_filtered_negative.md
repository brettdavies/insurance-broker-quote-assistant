Progressive stands out with its extensive list of available [discounts](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/). Along with the common options you'll find elsewhere— such as[ multi-policy](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/), continuous insurance, and homeowner discounts— Progressive also offers unique opportunities to help customers lower their premiums.
The Snapshot program uses [telematics](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) to personalize your rate based on your actual driving habits. The safer you drive, the more you can save — Progressive advertises an average savings of $231 per year. [Read more about Snapshot.](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/progressive-snapshot-review/)
Progressive offers [Accident Forgiveness](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/accident-forgiveness-auto-insurance/) to help prevent rate increases after certain claims. Small accident forgiveness ensures your rate won't go up for your first claim under $500, starting with your first policy term. Large accident forgiveness protects your rate if you've been claim- and violation-free for five years, while additional benefits can be purchased to forgive one accident per policy period.
