## How to get cheap car insurance as a 22-year-old driver

There are four main ways for 22-year-olds to find cheap car insurance: sharing a policy with a family member, comparing quotes, qualifying for discounts and adjusting your coverage.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/icons/family)

**[Sharing a car insurance policy with your parents](/family-car-insurance "Cheapest Family Car Insurance") is usually the cheapest option if you're a 22-year-old.**

A family policy may be more expensive for your parents, but the total cost tends to be much cheaper than buying two different policies. You're only able to stay on your parent's auto insurance if you live in the same house or go to school full time.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/icons/compare-2)

**[Comparing quotes from multiple companies](/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") is important when shopping for the cheapest rates.**

The most expensive car insurance company for 22-year-olds, Farmers, charges twice as much for full coverage insurance as the cheapest company, State Farm. That could add up to a savings of over $2,700 per year.

Insurance companies use many factors to determine car insurance rates, like your age, driving record, claims history, where you live and the type of car you drive. That's why the cheapest insurance company for you may differ from the cheapest one for your family members or friends.

**Car insurance companies typically offer lots of [discounts](/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to help 22-year-old drivers lower their rates.**
Common car insurance discounts for 22-year-old drivers include:

* **[Good student discount](/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "How to Get Good Student Discount")** if you're a full-time student with a B average or better
* **[Defensive driving course](/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount")** for completing driver training classes
* **Safe driver discount** for avoiding accidents and tickets
* **Online purchase discount** for buying your policy online
* **Automatic payment discount** for automatically sending payments from your bank account
* **Paperless discount** for getting statements and bills via email

The type and amount of a discount you get can vary across companies and locations, which is another reason to shop around for multiple quotes.

**As a 22-year-old, you can save money by adjusting your car insurance coverage.** When you're comparing quotes, make sure that you're only paying for the [coverage options you actually want and need](/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?").

For example, it may not make sense to pay extra for [comprehensive and collision coverage](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") if you drive a car that's more than eight years old or worth less than $5,000.

**You can also [raise your deductible](/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?").** A higher deductible typically means lower car insurance rates because the insurance company will pay you less if you're in an accident. However, make sure you choose a deductible you can afford if you're in a crash.
