“I am 61 yrs old, wish I would have taken this when I turned 55 not only for the discount, but the information. Amazing how many new things I learned about driving and proper techniques due to changes in car technology. The website worked well for me, easy to purchase, register, but mostly easy to digest. Topic information went the whole spectrum from boring to interesting. The page layout was fantastic by putting things in boxes of different sizes rather than a regular paragraph, seeing progress meter, and what sub-topics were included in the section (off to the right). Thank you for making it easy and low cost.”

**Alan B.**

“Recently my husband and I attended a Seniors for Safe Driving course with instructor Bob Wehrle. We enjoyed it very much and definitely learned some new things.”

**Rhonda C. – Cranberry, Twp**

“Thank you! This course is very straightforward and informative.”

**Tamara J.**

“My wife,and I took the Seniors for Safe Driving course in Huntingdon, Pa. Our instructor Lisa Holsinger did a very good job. The course was very informative, especially the information on changes in new motor vehicle laws.”

**Charles H. – Huntingdon, PA**

“My husband and I recently attended a Seniors For Safe Driving course in Hermitage, PA. Richard D’Archangelo was our instructor and he is to be complimented on the fine job he did. He is, by far, the best we have had in the four times we have attend these classes.”

**Bob & Barb Meyer – Hermitage, PA**

“Well designed on-line course that was effective for learning. Thank you for offering this course.”

**Lisa P.**

“I like the insurance discount, but as someone getting older who wants to remain a good driver, I find the information very helpful in terms of reminding me about laws, new information, and techniques to stay safe on the road.”

**Arlene S.**

“Very comprehensive review of the essential elements of safe driving. The online course was very easy to navigate – the ability to pause and resume when necessary was greatly appreciated. I wish I would have taken the course to learn about all the available safety enhancing options before recently purchasing a car.”

**James F.**

“This course was very well done. More comprehensive than I initially anticipated.”

**David P.**

“Honestly, even though I was motivated to take the Mature Driver Improvement Course only to get a discount on my auto insurance, I was very happy to have taken it because I learned (or re-learned) stuff that I had forgotten. For instance, I was driving in rain the other day with my windshield wipers on, and I didn’t have my lights on. The next time I use my windshield wipers, I’ll make sure that I put my lights on! This is one example of many….ah hah…moments that occurred as I took the course. Thank you!”

**Susan C.**
