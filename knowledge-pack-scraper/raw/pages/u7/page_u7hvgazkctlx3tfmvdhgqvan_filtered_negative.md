**You can also[raise your deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?").** A higher deductible typically means lower car insurance rates because the insurance company will pay you less if you're in an accident. However, make sure you choose a deductible you can afford if you're in a crash.
