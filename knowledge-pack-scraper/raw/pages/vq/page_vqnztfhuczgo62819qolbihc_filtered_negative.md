**Multi-car insurance discounts are a great way to cut costs if you own more than one vehicle or have a lot of drivers living under your roof.** With Geico’s multi-car discount, for example, you can save up to 25% on your car insurance when you cover more than one auto.
##  Who has the best multi-car insurance discount?
**Geico has the best multi-car discount we found, offering up to 25% off of your car insurance premium.** State Farm is close behind at 20%.
###  Multi-car discount by company
---|---
This is one of the reasons why it’s a good idea to [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from several companies before you buy or renew a policy.
##  How does a multi-car insurance discount work?
##  What is a multi-car insurance policy?
**A multi-car insurance policy covers more than one car in your household.** It differs in some ways from a car insurance policy for a single car.
For example, you can have different coverage types for different cars. [Liability car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/what-is-liability-coverage/) will be covered for all cars on the policy, but you can pick and choose which cars you may want to be covered by [full coverage car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/).
##  Is multi-car insurance worth it?
###  Single-claim deductible
###  Stackable coverage limits
###  Convenient bill pay
##  Downsides of multi-car insurance policies
There are some downsides to multi-car insurance, too. **If you add a high-risk driver to your multi-car policy**, such as a [teen driver](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-teens/) or one with accidents in their car insurance history, you may pay higher rates for all the cars on the policy, even if your driving record is spotless.
##  How do I get a multi-car insurance policy?
If you already have a car covered by an insurance company, **getting a multi-car policy can be as easy as going to your policy on the company’s website or contacting an agent** and adding the new car or cars to it.
This can take a bit of time, depending on how many cars you’re looking to insure, but the savings should be worth it. Make sure to find out what other [car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) each company you compare has to save even more money.
