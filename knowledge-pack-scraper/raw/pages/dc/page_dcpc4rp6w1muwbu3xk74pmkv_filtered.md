Editor's Rating 4.5

State Auto will no longer offer new car and home insurance policies directly as of January 2023. [Liberty Mutual](/liberty-mutual-insurance-review "/liberty-mutual-insurance-review") acquired State Auto in March 2022, and most State Auto policies have transitioned to [Safeco](/safeco-insurance-review "/safeco-insurance-review"). State Auto will continue to offer commercial policies to businesses and farms.

State Auto is part of Liberty Mutual, and it is fairly expensive compared to other companies. But if you want to add certain protections, such as pet and cell phone coverage, it's a good option.

We recommend [comparing quotes](/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies before you purchase car insurance from State Auto.

### State Auto car insurance discounts

State Auto's car insurance discounts are mostly in line with what is typically offered by other insurers. These include [discounts](/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") for being a good student, insuring multiple cars and paying in full at the start of your policy.

Highlighted discount: State Auto Start-Up

One of the more unique discounts that State Auto offers is its **Start-Up discount**. This incentivizes prospective customers — who are currently insured — to switch to State Auto before their existing auto insurance policy expires. The size of this discount depends on your previous insurer and how long you were with the company.

Accident-prevention course

Drivers who are over 21 years old and have taken an accident-prevention course within the last three years.

Anti-theft devices

Those with vehicles that are equipped with anti-theft devices such as passive disabling devices.

Driver training (driver’s education)

Drivers under the age of 21 who have taken a driver’s education course.

Good student

Full-time students who have at least a 3.0 GPA.

Multipolicy

Those who have at least two lines of insurance with State Auto, such as homeowners or [umbrella](/umbrella-insurance "Umbrella Insurance").

Multicar

Drivers who insure multiple vehicles with State Auto.

Paid in full

Those who pay the full amount owed for their policy at the start of its term.

State Auto also offers discounts through State Auto Safety 360, its [usage-based telematics program](/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"). Policyholders install a tag device and a mobile app, which monitors and scores their driving behavior based on factors like mileage, acceleration, braking, cornering and speed. The better your performance, the higher your discount. You also get a 10% discount just for participating.

**However, we do not recommend State Auto Safety 360.** While the maximum discount of 50% is higher than what most other insurers offer, policyholders run the risk of surcharges, as State Auto may raise rates for poor driving performance. Policyholders also rate the State Auto Safety 360 app as just mediocre, with Apple users giving it a 2.8 out of 5 and Android users giving it a slightly lower score of 2.7 out of 5. Other telematics programs offer a better user experience.

## State Auto's car insurance policies

Though the available options may vary by state, State Auto typically offers three levels of auto insurance coverage to its customers: Standard, Protection Plus and Premier. All coverage levels include the standard auto insurance coverages, such as liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist liability, and [comprehensive and collision insurance](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Comprehensive and Collision Insurance").

Drivers who are interested in more than just the typical coverages should consider State Auto's Protection Plus and Premier offerings. Choosing one of these levels of coverage will give you the choice to add optional coverages that aren't available to those who purchase the Standard car insurance package.

| Coverages | Description | Standard | Protection Plus | Premier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roadside assistance | Covers towing, fuel delivery, tire changes, battery jumps and lockout services (up to $100). |  |  |  |
| Full safety glass | Deductible is waived on repairs for vehicle glass and lights. |  |  |  |
| OEM parts | Having this coverage will insure that only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts — as opposed to potentially lower-quality aftermarket parts — will be used when your car is repaired as a result of a covered loss. |  |  |  |

**The Protection Plus and Premier insurance packages both automatically include the minor violation forgiveness benefit and the accident forgiveness benefit.** With these coverages, State Auto customers who qualify — by not having any violations or at-fault accidents within a certain amount of time — will not see their rates rise after their first traffic violation or at-fault accident. This benefit can potentially save you a lot on your auto insurance, as being convicted of a minor traffic violation can cause a [14% increase](/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record#affect "Best Cheap Car Insurance for a Bad Driving Record") in auto insurance costs.

You can also add auto replacement cost coverage, which will pay to replace a car two model years or newer from the start date of the policy, or [rideshare gap coverage](/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "Rideshare Insurance: Why You Need It and What It Costs").

#### Highlighted coverage: AutoXtended Endorsement package

The AutoXtended Endorsement — a benefit that is included for State Auto customers who purchase Protection Plus or Premier coverage — includes a number of additional coverages that can be complementary additions to the standard car insurance offerings. Standout features include injury-related coverage like emergency travel and total disability coverage, as well as protections for your pet and personal property stored in your car.

There are two AutoXtended Endorsement packages: AutoXtended Plus and AutoXtended Premier.

| Benefit | AutoXtended Plus | AutoXtended Premier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bail bonds | $350 | $500 |
| Cellphone | Actual cash value, $500 maximum | Replacement cost, $1,000 maximum |
| Death indemnity | $20,000/$40,000 | $50,000/$100,000 |

## State Auto Insurance customer service reviews and ratings

State Auto has a mixed customer service reputation. It receives more complaints than average for car insurance, mostly for claim handling issues and delays. It does, however, have a lower-than-average rate of complaints for home coverage.

| Rating agency | Rating |

| Auto NAIC complaint index | 1.61 (1.00 is average) |
| Home NAIC complaint index | 0.58 (1.00 is average) |
| AM Best financial strength rating | A (excellent) |

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index ratings are for State Auto Property & Casualty Association, the company's largest subsidiary, and lower is better.

State Auto customers do not have to worry about their insurer's ability to pay out for insurance claims, as it has received excellent ratings from AM Best for its financial strength.
