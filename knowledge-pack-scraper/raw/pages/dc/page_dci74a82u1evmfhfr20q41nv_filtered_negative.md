Call customer service. It can be added. We add the discount along with adding a defensive driver violation we manually put in. Sorry your agent confused you.

You were correct. I called again and the agent was able to apply the discount for me this time. Thanks for the info!

Are you calling customer service or dealing with some third party agent like a person in a shopping plaza who just happens to sell insurance

During the quote setup in the system for New York, the question about the course's completion seems to have been removed from the sales platform for most customers. It was such a common request to include it as a discount that agents would check the box upon being told that the customer had completed one, only to find out later that the record wasn't available and the system would either remove it prior to the sale or the underwriting department would have to remove the discount after the sale.
Other states still have a question about the status of a defensive drivers course is still in each driver's profile (GA) or tacked on as a follow up question depending on the driver's age. Underwriting may reach out after the sale to verify the validity of the course.
If a valid copy of the class completion is on file with the state of NY, the discount is then automatically applied to the quote when the motor vehicle reports are generated, it will appear as a detail that some consultants could confuse as a violation and be attributed as such. If the course doesn't appear at the time of sale, customers are asked to allow the services department to assist them in applying the discount manually.
