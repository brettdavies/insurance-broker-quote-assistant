State Auto is a good insurance company if you want to add to your coverage, but it's expensive and its customer service is below par.

State Auto will no longer offer new car and home insurance policies directly as of January 2023. [Liberty Mutual](https://www.valuepenguin.com/liberty-mutual-insurance-review "/liberty-mutual-insurance-review") acquired State Auto in March 2022, and most State Auto policies have transitioned to [Safeco](https://www.valuepenguin.com/safeco-insurance-review "/safeco-insurance-review"). State Auto will continue to offer commercial policies to businesses and farms.

We recommend [comparing quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies before you purchase car insurance from State Auto.
State Auto's car insurance discounts are mostly in line with what is typically offered by other insurers. These include [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") for being a good student, insuring multiple cars and paying in full at the start of your policy.
Those who have at least two lines of insurance with State Auto, such as homeowners or [umbrella](https://www.valuepenguin.com/umbrella-insurance "Umbrella Insurance").
State Auto also offers discounts through State Auto Safety 360, its [usage-based telematics program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"). Policyholders install a tag device and a mobile app, which monitors and scores their driving behavior based on factors like mileage, acceleration, braking, cornering and speed. The better your performance, the higher your discount. You also get a 10% discount just for participating.
Though the available options may vary by state, State Auto typically offers three levels of auto insurance coverage to its customers: Standard, Protection Plus and Premier. All coverage levels include the standard auto insurance coverages, such as liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist liability, and [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Comprehensive and Collision Insurance").
---|---|---|---|---
Roadside assistance | Covers towing, fuel delivery, tire changes, battery jumps and lockout services (up to $100). |  |
Full safety glass | Deductible is waived on repairs for vehicle glass and lights. |  |
OEM parts | Having this coverage will insure that only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts — as opposed to potentially lower-quality aftermarket parts — will be used when your car is repaired as a result of a covered loss. |  |
**The Protection Plus and Premier insurance packages both automatically include the minor violation forgiveness benefit and the accident forgiveness benefit.** With these coverages, State Auto customers who qualify — by not having any violations or at-fault accidents within a certain amount of time — will not see their rates rise after their first traffic violation or at-fault accident. This benefit can potentially save you a lot on your auto insurance, as being convicted of a minor traffic violation can cause a [14% increase](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record#affect "Best Cheap Car Insurance for a Bad Driving Record") in auto insurance costs.
You can also add auto replacement cost coverage, which will pay to replace a car two model years or newer from the start date of the policy, or [rideshare gap coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "Rideshare Insurance: Why You Need It and What It Costs").
