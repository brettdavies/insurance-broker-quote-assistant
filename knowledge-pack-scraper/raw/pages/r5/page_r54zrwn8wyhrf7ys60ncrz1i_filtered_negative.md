He'll probably get a base hourly rate that will equate to roughly $25-35k annually. Everything else will be contingent on the amount he sells and that specific office's commission structure.
He'll be paid to answer phones & do clerical work until he gets licensed (if the agent is cool, he'll be able to do licensing classes on the clock as long as he keeps up with these light receptionist-like duties that are assigned to him). Once he's licensed, hellooooo cold calling!!!
The SF office i worked at I mostly spent my day servicing current accounts and cold calling. 2 days a week we got live leads - 2 per service rep. The rest of the time we worked cold leads or former SF client lists. We got a comish % of the premium sold with different levels of commission based on amount of lines sold. I THINK mine was something like 3% after 10 lines sold, 5% after 20, 7% after 30. It's been a while.
Good place to start and learn the industry, lot of training available but only if you put in the time take advantage of it. If he wants to go into insurance, it's a good place to start. Just don't stay too long. Learn the ins and outs and move to an independent agency.

Have him ask what the hourly wage is and what the commission schedule is.
Do they buy leads and run an outbound call center or do they do a shit ton of community events and work the crowd for leads?
If it's community events, kiss the weekend and evenings good bye. If it's a call center, it's a grind to sell policies.

Income depends on how much insurance he sells, it could be a lot more or less.

Indeed is always way off. When I worked for a statefarm office, the sales guys only had a base of 16/ hour. As a customer service rep I was 13/ hour

There are many variables to statebfor certain. State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, etc, are known as captive agents, which is basically a franchise. The agency owner can pay the staff whatever they want. Have your husband look up large independent insurance agencies/brokerages near you. There will be more opportunities with them, especially if your husband has some sales experience. If not, that is ok because service people can be paid a decent salary while learning.
