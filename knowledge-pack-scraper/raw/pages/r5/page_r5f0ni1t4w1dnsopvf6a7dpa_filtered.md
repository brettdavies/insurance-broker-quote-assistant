# Op-ed Highlights Progress in Florida

**Update 10/29/2025**

There are more positive developments in the works for our Florida customers.

State Farm is once again rolling out lower auto rates, overall taking them down more than 20% on average since Oct. 2024. It’s welcome news for our customers as we return value with significant savings. The latest rate cut filed this week means customers will see their premiums drop an average of 10 percent. Our overall reductions since Oct. 2024 amount to more than $1 billion in lower annual premiums for private passenger cars averaging more than $400.00 in savings per vehicle.

State Farm is solidly committed to our Florida customers and has long worked for improved market conditions. We agree with recent comments by the Florida Governor and the Office of Insurance Regulation that the insurance market is stabilizing because of this work, and that reduced litigation has contributed to our repeated opportunity to offer lower rates. State Farm hopes to build on this momentum and will continue to work towards further improvements in the marketplace on behalf of all our Florida customers.

See broader context below.

### **Florida’s Litigation Reform is Delivering Rate Relief to Insurance Consumers**

According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the state’s major insurers have reduced rates by an average of 6.5% this year. State Farm has implemented two rate decreases so far this year. Together, they represent more than 10% in reductions in private passenger auto insurance rates for our Florida customers this year - tangible proof that thoughtful policy reform and industry collaboration can deliver real results for consumers.

This isn’t happening by accident. It’s the direct result of Florida’s legislators and insurance regulators recognizing the impact of rising insurance costs - caused by over-litigation - and being willing to hear industry concerns and  tackle the real problems behind the rising costs.

#### **When Reform Works, Consumers Win**

In 2023, the Legislature passed HB 837, a monumental litigation reform package addressing lawsuit abuse. Rather than accept the status quo of ever-increasing litigation, lawmakers enacted reforms that changed the litigation landscape, reducing litigation and lowering  litigation costs which in turn lowered the cost of auto insurance for many Florida families. 

#### **The Path Forward**

While we celebrate this progress, Florida still faces unique challenges that demand ongoing attention and collaboration. Severe weather events, from hurricanes to hailstorms to tornadoes, continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Supply chain disruptions and inflation impact the cost of vehicle parts and repairs. These realities mean maintaining affordable insurance requires constant vigilance and adjustments.

State Farm remains committed to working with public policymakers to advance legislative solutions that continue to improve the insurance marketplace. The success of HB 837 shows what’s possible when thoughtful policymaking and balanced regulatory oversight combine with industry expertise to benefit Floridians.

#### **A Model for Sustainable Solutions**

Florida’s litigation reform effort offers valuable lessons for other states grappling with similar challenges. By focusing on meaningful solutions rather than short-term fixes, policymakers created a framework to benefit and protect consumers while maintaining market stability. This approach recognizes that a healthy insurance market requires balance – a focus on consumers alongside conditions that allow insurers to operate sustainably and competitively.

The progress we’ve achieved together is significant. State Farm is committed to working with Florida’s leaders to put consumers first while working toward long-term market stability. State Farm has been serving Florida customers for seven decades. Together, we can continue building an insurance market that serves all Floridians effectively and affordably.
