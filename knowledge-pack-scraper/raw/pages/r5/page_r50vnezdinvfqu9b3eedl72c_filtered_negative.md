Drivers who take [defensive driving lessons](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses") from a certified or registered school may be able to get a **10% to 15% discount on their coverage.** Classes teach drivers how to handle road, traffic and weather conditions to avoid accidents.
Companies like [Allstate, Geico, State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-vs-geico-vs-allstate-vs-progressive-vs-farmers-car-insurance "Compare Allstate, Geico and State Farm") and most others offer good-driver discounts if you have been accident-free for **three to five years.** This discount is usually applied automatically. If you do not qualify at sign-up, your insurance company can adjust your rate at the time of your next renewal if you have been accident-free for the required time.
You may also see insurance companies call this discount a [good-driver discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-driver-car-insurance-discount "How to Get a Good-Driver Discount"). However, Geico and Allstate treat safe-driver discounts and good-driver discounts as separate things.
Some insurance companies, like **Allstate, Progressive and Nationwide**, let you download a tracking app or use a device that plugs into your car. These apps and devices track your driving habits and send your insurance company information about how often you speed, start or stop suddenly, or swerve. You could save **up to 40%** by signing up for [usage-based insurance (UBI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies").

If you're a young driver, your car insurance rates will be [very high until you turn 25](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Rates"). But if you're a student who has a B average, you can qualify for savings as high as 25% with a [good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Student Car Insurance Discounts"). You just need to be a full-time student and provide proof of your grades to your insurance company.
As a parent, you can save on your policy if your student child leaves their car at home when they're at college and the school is located more than 100 miles away. Ask your agent about this discount right away or during your [next renewal](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-renewal "How to Renew Your Car Insurance and Stay Covered"). If you qualify, the discount should help you save as much as **25% on your liability coverage.**
Many car insurance companies offer discounts based on the groups you belong to, your employer or other similar factors. For example, some companies offer [auto insurance discounts to active duty military members](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-save-auto-insurance-while-active-duty "Tips to Save on Auto Insurance While on Active Duty"). Each company's discounts will differ, and you might not get a discount at one company that you could from another.

Other companies, such as USAA, exclusively provide [auto insurance to military members](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-and-military-members "Best Car Insurance for Military Members"), their families and defense personnel. They also extend that benefit to up to  two generations of family members.
You can get a [multicar discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/multi-car-insurance-discounts-quotes "How Much You Can Save on Multicar Policies") when you cover several cars with the same company under the same insurance policy.

While the discounts may not apply equally to all of your policies with your insurance company, companies can give a range of **5% to 25% off auto insurance** for [bundling policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundling-can-save-you-money-car-insurance "Bundling Car Insurance Policies").

If your car has features like an **anti-theft device or antilock brakes**, you may get discounts for them. Insurance companies like to see these features because they can prevent expensive damage and reduce your risk of accidents or theft. That can mean major savings for the insurance company since it's less likely that you'll [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "Guide to Filing Car Insurance Claims").

You could see a 5% to 10% discount on your collision coverage. Depending on your [car type](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/car-make-model "How Make and Model Impact Insurance") and your deductible, that could translate to savings of **$20 to $100 per year.**
