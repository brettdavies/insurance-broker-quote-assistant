UPDATED(!): This subreddit is for Insurance Professionals (Agents/brokers, owners) to discuss our work and current events and goings on in the industry, in addition to asking and answering questions about the business amongst each other and sharing relevant content. Consumers, please use the proper flair for your topic.
Vendors and uplines (FMO, IMO) are welcome to share useful insurance industry content as long it's not promotional in nature and adds value (no landing pages).
