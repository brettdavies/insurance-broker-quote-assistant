For most homeowners, going without insurance isn’t an option — especially if you have a mortgage. But if you live in an area with significant weather or wildfire risks, it may be difficult to find a standard home insurance policy. That’s because insurance companies generally try to avoid the chance of having to pay out big claims in high-risk areas.

Some states, like [**California**](/homeowners-insurance/california/) and Texas, have state-sponsored programs to provide basic insurance to homeowners who haven’t been able to buy a policy in the standard insurance marketplace. But these plans tend to offer basic coverage at a higher price, so they’re not for everyone.

Here’s what you need to know about FAIR Plans, including which states have them, how they work, how they differ from traditional [**homeowners insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/), and what to expect if you need to buy FAIR Plan coverage.

Quick Facts

* You’ll often see FAIR Plans referred to as “insurers of last resort” because they’re meant to help homeowners who’ve run out of other options for buying insurance.
* FAIR Plan policies tend to be more expensive than standard insurance due to increased risks from severe weather, wildfire, home age, and more.[[1]](#cite-1)
* Colorado is the most recent state to establish a FAIR Plan. It began accepting homeowner applications in April.[[2]](#cite-2)

## What is FAIR Plan insurance?

A Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, Plan is a state-managed program that provides property insurance to homeowners who haven’t been able to get coverage in the standard insurance marketplace. State governments create and manage FAIR programs, and taxpayers often subsidize them.

But FAIR Plans don’t directly sell or underwrite policies. Instead, every company that sells home insurance in the state must participate in the FAIR Plan pool — and provide coverage to homeowners who get approval for FAIR Plan coverage.

Participating insurers share responsibility to issue policies to [**high-risk homeowners**](/homeowners-insurance/high-risk-home-insurance/) and pay out subsequent claims. They also split any profits from that consumer pool.

FAIR Plans tend to offer more limited coverages. And they’re often more expensive than traditional homeowners insurance policies.

### Who needs FAIR Plan insurance?

If you’re a homeowner — or in some states, a business owner — who’s been denied coverage in the standard insurance market, you may qualify for FAIR Plan coverage.

Generally, homeowners may end up with a FAIR Plan if their property is in an area with a high risk of disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, or wildfires. Some might not be able to buy standard insurance because they have an older or outdated home with certain high-risk qualities, like old plumbing or electrical wiring. And some may need FAIR coverage because they’ve had a history of multiple claims.

### How to buy FAIR Plan insurance

To buy homeowners insurance through your state’s FAIR Plan, you’ll need to follow some basic steps:

* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/1daf58783c/contact-us-96x96-orange_023-customer-support.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/1daf58783c/contact-us-96x96-orange_023-customer-support.svg)

  #### 1. Try to get coverage in the standard marketplace

  Generally, multiple insurers (at least two) must have turned you down before you can apply for FAIR Plan coverage. You may also qualify if you haven’t been able to find adequate coverage at an affordable price.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/68bc2aa99e/jobs-and-professions-96x96-yellow_022-real-estate-agent.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/68bc2aa99e/jobs-and-professions-96x96-yellow_022-real-estate-agent.svg)

  #### 2. Contact a licensed agent or broker

  An agent can help confirm that you can’t get standard insurance. And they’ll help you with the application process for FAIR Plan coverage if your state has one.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d2a2cefe8c/insurify-icons-auto-green-96x96_024-home.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/d2a2cefe8c/insurify-icons-auto-green-96x96_024-home.svg)

  #### 3. Understand ongoing eligibility requirements

  You have to renew your home insurance coverage every year, whether it’s through the FAIR Plan or a standard insurer. Be sure you know what can affect your eligibility. For example, if you don’t keep your home in good shape, you may lose eligibility.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/1d8803fded/credit-and-loan-96x96-blue_019-calendar.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/1d8803fded/credit-and-loan-96x96-blue_019-calendar.svg)

  #### 4. Pay your premium on time

  As with any insurance policy, you’ll have to pay the premium on your FAIR Plan on time every month. Not paying, or paying late, could lead to cancellation.

## What does FAIR Plan insurance cover?

Standard homeowners insurance policies usually cover damage from:

* [**Fire**](/homeowners-insurance/fire-insurance/) (including wildfire)
* [**Wind**](/homeowners-insurance/windstorm-insurance/)
* Hail
* Lightning
* Electrical surges
* Riots or civil unrest
* Vandalism
* [**Burglary**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/does-home-insurance-cover-theft/)
* Leaks or broken water pipes

A [**standard homeowners insurance policy**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) will cover your home, any other structures on your property (like a shed or gazebo), your personal belongings, and any additional living expenses you face while your home is undergoing repair for a covered claim.

But FAIR Plan policies are more limited, and each state’s program varies in what it will cover.

For example, the [**Pennsylvania**](/homeowners-insurance/pennsylvania/) FAIR Plan has basic property insurance coverage that only protects your dwelling against fire- or lightning-related loss. If you want protection against other perils, you’ll need to purchase additional coverage.[[3]](#cite-3)

In [**Indiana**](/homeowners-insurance/indiana/), the FAIR Plan caps residential coverage at $250,000, which includes both the dwelling and your personal belongings.[[4]](#cite-4) In [**West Virginia**](/homeowners-insurance/west-virginia/), a standard FAIR Plan only covers damage from fire, lightning, or internal explosion.[[5]](#cite-5) And in [**Texas**](/homeowners-insurance/texas/), FAIR Plan policies don’t cover falling objects, like tree limbs, or damage due to freezing.[[6]](#cite-6)

Depending on what your state’s FAIR Plan covers, you may need to buy additional policies to ensure your home has full protection.

## How much does FAIR Plan insurance cost?

For most homeowners, FAIR Plan policies are more expensive than a standard homeowners insurance policy.

For example, based on the number of policies in force in March 2025 and total written premiums, the average annual cost of a California FAIR Plan policy is approximately $2,800. For comparison, in 2024, the overall average cost of home insurance in the state was $2,424, [**according to Insurify data**](/homeowners-insurance/report/home-insurance-price-projections/).

Here’s a look at the 10 states with the highest average cost for a FAIR Plan homeowners policy in 2023:

## How to qualify for a FAIR Plan policy

Not everyone can qualify to buy a FAIR Plan policy. And you should apply for one only as a last resort if you can’t find coverage in the open market.

Every state has its own eligibility requirements for its FAIR Plan program. Generally, though, multiple insurers must refuse to cover your home. For example, in Indiana, you’ll only qualify if three or more unrelated insurers have denied you coverage, while in Texas, you need to be denied by just two.

And you may need to show evidence of the rejections.

Some states limit plans to certain property types, like single-family homes. Others may offer coverage only to residential properties, not commercial ones. And in some states, you may have to make improvements or repairs to your home to qualify, especially if it has old wiring or plumbing that could lead to a claim.

Lastly, to qualify for a FAIR Plan policy, you usually can’t have any outstanding tax liens or open insurance claims on the property.

## FAIR Plan insurance pros and cons

While buying homeowners insurance through a FAIR Plan may feel like a last resort, you should keep in mind these advantages and disadvantages.

Pros 

* It can connect you with a pool of insurers willing to offer you coverage, even if you’ve been previously denied.
* You’ll be able to purchase coverage for a home even if it’s older, outdated, in need of repair, or located in a high-risk area.

Cons

* Coverage isn’t intended to be competitive, so premiums can be (and usually are) notably higher than traditional policies.
* You may be subject to much lower coverage limits than with traditional homeowners insurance.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include:

Default Coverage Assumptions

* **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
* **Deductible:** $1,000
* **Personal property limit:** $25,000
* **Liability limit:** $300,000

Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.

Insurance purchased with the help of a FAIR Plan is generally much more expensive than a comparable, traditional insurance policy. The actual premiums will depend on the property’s location, age, condition, and the coverage options chosen.

Based on Insurify’s analysis of FAIR Plan data published by Triple-I, the average annual cost of a FAIR Plan policy ranges from $3,358 in Louisiana to just $464 in Delaware. But your actual cost may be higher based on individual factors like your credit and claims history.

California FAIR Plan coverage is a fire insurance pool helping Californians get access to basic fire coverage. If you need to purchase earthquake or flood coverage, you’ll need to work with a broker to find the right policy for you.

Yes, you can pay your California FAIR Plan premium monthly in 11 installments. Your first payment will be for 16.67% of the total annual premium. The remaining 10 payments will divide the remaining balance into equal installments. You can also pay your premium in full at the start of your policy or in three installments of 40%, 30%, and 30% of the total premium.

FAIR Plan coverage limits differ by state. For example, in Florida, the maximum coverage amount for a Citizens Property Insurance Corp. policy is $1 million. In Kentucky, the maximum dwelling coverage limit is $200,000.
