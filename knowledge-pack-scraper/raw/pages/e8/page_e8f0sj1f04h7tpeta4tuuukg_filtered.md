### Is Florida a no-fault state?

Yes. Florida has been a no-fault state since 1972, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance). As a no-fault state, Florida requires drivers to carry PIP coverage so that their own insurance covers some or all of their medical expenses after a car accident, even if this other driver was at fault. No-fault car insurance also restricts the right to sue to only lawsuits that involve severe injuries.

## How much is car insurance in Florida?

## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Florida's state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car, regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, gets stolen, or is otherwise damaged as the result of a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you are not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after an accident.
