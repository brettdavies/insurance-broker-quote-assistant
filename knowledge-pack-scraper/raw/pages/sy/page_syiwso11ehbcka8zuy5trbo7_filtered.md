## Cheapest car insurance in Iowa for minimum coverage

When considering the cheapest car insurance in Iowa, many drivers opt for a liability-only or minimum coverage policy to save on premiums. This option covers the state-required basics, ensuring you're legally protected when driving. However, while it may be more affordable upfront, it's worth noting that minimum coverage may not provide comprehensive protection in all accident scenarios. Among the available options, Pekin stands out as offering the most competitive rates. For those seeking the cheapest minimum coverage in the state, here are several more options to consider:

### Minimum coverage requirements for Iowa drivers

Iowa, like [most states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/), has minimum car insurance limits. All vehicle owners in the state of Iowa must have car insurance with [minimum liability limits](https://iid.iowa.gov/consumers/insurance/auto) of:

* $20,000 bodily injury per person
* $40,000 bodily injury per accident
* $15,000 property damage per accident

Insurers are required to offer uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage at $20,000 and $40,000, respectively, but individuals can reject this coverage in writing if they prefer.

Keep in mind that the minimum required coverage only pays for injuries and damages you cause to others. If you need coverage for damages to your own vehicle, you will need to upgrade your car insurance by adding collision and comprehensive insurance. This is referred to as “full coverage.” While minimum coverage insurance can be less expensive than full coverage, most insurance professionals encourage drivers to purchase higher liability limits if they are able to do so. If the damages from an at-fault loss exceed the amount of liability coverage you carry, you will be responsible for paying the difference out of pocket.

## Cheapest car insurance in Iowa for full coverage

If you’re looking for peace of mind that comes from having a robust insurance policy, you will likely have to pay more than you would for a minimum coverage policy, but you’ll typically get collision and comprehensive coverage. These additional insurance products provide coverage for a wider range of claims. Of the insurance companies we reviewed, several stood out for their full coverage policies being affordable:

Driving history plays a significant role in determining car insurance premiums. In Iowa, like in many states, drivers with prior incidents such as accidents, speeding tickets or DUIs can expect to see their rates rise.

However, even with a blemished record, there are insurance providers in the state that offer competitive rates. It's crucial for such drivers to shop around, understand their options and find the best balance between coverage and affordability.

[Being deemed a high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) typically has the biggest impact on rates, as it tends to result from several infractions.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Securing car insurance after a DUI can be challenging in Iowa. Not every insurer will offer coverage to those with DUI convictions due to the elevated risk they represent. A DUI indicates to insurers that a driver might be more prone to future incidents, resulting in possible substantial claims. If you're navigating this situation, you might encounter the requirement for an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) — a certificate your insurer files with the state proving you have the minimum coverage. It's essential for drivers with DUIs in Iowa to ensure they adhere to state car insurance criteria, including obtaining an SR-22 if mandated, to avoid further legal issues. Being informed about these stipulations will aid in maintaining proper insurance coverage and regaining driving privileges.

## Cheapest car insurance for young drivers in Iowa

In Iowa, [young adult drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-adults/) often face steeper car insurance premiums compared to their older counterparts. Their limited driving experience combined with statistical data showing a higher likelihood of being involved in accidents means insurance companies often deem them a higher risk. This age group, particularly those in their late teens to early 20s, may encounter rates that reflect these concerns. It's essential for young drivers in Iowa to be aware of this trend, but also to know that with time and a clean driving record, their rates can decrease as they age and gain more driving experience.

### Cheapest Iowa car insurance for insuring a teen driver: Geico

[Adding a teen driver to your policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) can increase your rates quite a bit, although the specifics vary between companies, drivers and policies. Teens and young drivers are generally seen as more inexperienced drivers who represent a higher risk to insurers. To balance this, companies charge higher rates for teens. However, many insurance companies offer student and [teen discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/) for those who maintain [good grades](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/student-discounts/) or complete driver education programs. These discounts can be a financial relief for parents and guardians, providing an incentive for young drivers to excel academically and prioritize safe driving habits.

Still, it’s often cheaper to insure a teen on their parents’ policy than to rate them on their own. Below are the five cheapest car insurance companies in Iowa for adding a teen driver to your policy.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Insurers use various methodologies when calculating rates for teen drivers, often centered around perceived risks associated with inexperience on the road. Teenagers, by virtue of their limited driving history, lack the track record that demonstrates safe driving habits. This unknown often translates to them being seen as potential liabilities, hence the elevated premiums. Insurers use past data and risk models to determine that younger drivers, on average, are more likely to be involved in accidents or make claims. This perception of higher risk is why insurance costs tend to be higher for teens, even if they are added to an established policy.

### Cheapest Iowa car insurance for teens with a ticket: Hastings Mutual

In Iowa, a speeding ticket on a teen driver's record can drastically affect insurance premiums. Insurers perceive these infractions as a sign of recklessness, particularly in younger drivers. Yet, for those searching for budget-friendly options, Hastings Mutual stands out as the most economical choice.

### Cheapest Iowa car insurance for teens with an at-fault accident: Hastings Mutual

A teen's at-fault accident can significantly impact car insurance rates. Such incidents underscore the vulnerabilities of young, less experienced drivers, making them a heightened risk in the eyes of insurers. As a result, premiums often rise sharply after such incidents. Despite this, Hastings Mutual emerges again as a beacon of affordability, offering some of the most competitive rates for teens with at-fault accidents in the state.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Iowa operates under a tort system, which means that the state determines fault in the event of an accident. The party deemed at-fault is responsible for covering the damages caused to the other party. This is why having appropriate liability coverage is crucial for drivers in the state. Additionally, while accident forgiveness isn't a state-mandated offering, many insurers in Iowa do offer it as a feature. This can be beneficial for drivers, as it may prevent their premiums from increasing after their first at-fault accident, though conditions often apply.

### Cheapest Iowa car insurance for young drivers with a DUI: Progressive

Young drivers caught with a DUI face severe penalties, both legally and in terms of their insurance premiums. As they are already perceived as high-risk due to their age and inexperience, a DUI amplifies this risk perception for insurers. However, Progressive emerges again, offering some of the most affordable rates for young drivers who have been convicted of a DUI.

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
