![scale icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/scale_dhas7a.svg)

Even if you weren't at fault, medical payments coverage pays for emergency medical expenses for anyone hurt within your property. Small medical expenses, including doctor visits, prescription drugs and first aid are covered by this insurance.
![hotel icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/hotel_tab8pv.svg)

### Optional Home Insurance Coverages from GEICO
The [best home insurance providers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/best-homeowners-insurance/) offer endorsements to supplement your policy — GEICO provides three, but coverage availability depends on your state. An endorsement is a policy addition that extends protection beyond standard coverage for specific risks or valuable items.
Review the table below to see which endorsements fit your needs.
Coverage | Description  
---|---  
Flood Insurance | Covers severe water damage from heavy rain, melting snow, coastal storms and other flooding events not included in standard policies  
Umbrella Insurance | Extends liability protection beyond your standard homeowners policy limits to provide additional coverage for accidents and lawsuits  
Earthquake Insurance | Covers damage to your home and belongings caused by seismic activities and ground movement from earthquakes  
### What Does GEICO's Home Insurance Not Cover?
GEICO's standard home insurance policy excludes specific perils and situations from coverage. You can purchase some excluded coverages, such as flood and earthquake protection, as add-on endorsements for extra premium.
![flood icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/flood_kua1hg.svg)
**Certain Natural Disasters**
Standard policies exclude flood damage and earthquake damage from coverage. GEICO offers both flood insurance and earthquake insurance as optional endorsements you can add to your policy for additional protection.
![injury icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/injury_ykcx1b.svg)
**Intentional or Preventable Damage**
Your policy won't cover damage you cause on purpose or damage that results from neglecting your home's maintenance. This includes wear and tear, deterioration and damage from pests like termites or rodents.
![necklace icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/necklace_hwr4fb.svg)
**High Value Items**
Standard coverage limits may not fully cover expensive jewelry, art, collectibles or other valuable possessions. You'll need to purchase additional coverage to fully protect these items since GEICO doesn't offer scheduled personal property endorsements.
