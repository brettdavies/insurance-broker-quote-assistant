At Insure.com, we are committed to providing the timely, accurate and expert information consumers need to make smart insurance decisions. All our content is written and reviewed by [industry professionals](https://www.insure.com/expert-advisors/) and insurance experts. [Our team ](https://www.insure.com/about-us/)carefully vets our rate data to ensure we only provide reliable and up-to-date insurance pricing. We follow the highest [editorial standards](https://www.insure.com/editorial-policy/). Our content is based solely on objective research and data gathering. We maintain strict editorial independence to ensure unbiased coverage of the insurance industry.
State Farm is the top insurer for high-risk drivers looking for the best, cheap car insurance policy, according to an Insure.com study, followed by Nationwide and Progressive.
Getting insurance as a high-risk driver can feel a bit daunting, especially with the reluctance of some companies to insure drivers in this category. A high-risk driver is someone an insurance company deems more likely to file a claim. Some of the events that might assign a driver to a high-risk pool: multiple speeding tickets, a DUI conviction and an at-fault accident.
“You might find it difficult to get a policy through traditional private insurance companies if you are a high risk,” according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/what-if-i-cant-find-auto-coverage), an industry trade group.
But there are options.
We analyzed data on the top auto insurance companies to see which was best for high-risk drivers and ranked each with an Insure Score of 1 to 5, with 5 being the top score. We examined rates offered to high-risk drivers, a survey of insurance consumers and data from respected third parties AM Best, which measures financial strength, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which tracks customer complaints.
Overall, we gave State Farm a score of 4.43 out of a possible 5 for drivers designated as high-risk.
While State Farm is rated the top company in this category, that doesn’t mean it’s the right company for everyone. Drivers often have different wants and needs when it comes to insurance. Some might be willing to pay for extra protection while others may only be interested in the lowest price.
## The top auto insurance companies for high-risk drivers
To select the best car insurance companies for high-risk drivers, we analyzed insurance rates, surveyed insurance consumers, and data from highly respected third parties that track insurance companies: [NAIC’s Complaint Ratio](https://content.naic.org/consumer) (1.00 is the norm) and [AM Best ratings](https://www.ambest.com/ratings/guide.pdf?_gl=1*13ubqgb*_ga*Mjk3NzEzODMyLjE3MDQ4MzMwMDY.*_ga_VNWYD5N5NL*MTcxMjk1OTIxNS4xMS4xLjE3MTI5NTkzNDkuMC4wLjA.) (A++ is superior).
State Farm has a relatively low complaint score of 0.52 from the NAIC and AM Best rating of A++, indicating a high level of financial stability.
On top of that, State Farm had relatively low car insurance rates for high-risk drivers – $3,113 a year for full coverage.
For the rates, we reviewed data from more than 100 insurance companies and analyzed more than 5 million quotes. We looked at rates for a 2022 Honda Accord LX driver aged 40 with various infractions on their driving records, from a speeding ticket to a DUI. We considered coverage of 100/300/100 – meaning $100,000 for bodily injury per person, $300,000 for bodily injury per incident and $100,000 for property damage per incident – with a $500 collision/comprehensive deductible. We assume a 12-mile commute and 10,000 miles driven annually.
We also tapped the results from a [survey](https://www.insure.com/best-car-insurance-companies/) Insure.com conducted in the fall of 2023 that asked 1,500 insurance customers to grade their company’s customer experience, claims expertise, policy offerings and other products and services.
It should be noted that USAA had a higher score than many of the insurers and is listed on the table below. However, it’s excluded from the overall ranking because it only provides services to military community members.
Company | NAIC Complaint Ratio | AM Best | Annual premium for high-risk drivers | Overall rating
---|---|---|---|---
State Farm | 0.52 | A++ | $3,113 | 4.43
Nationwide | 0.66 | A+ | $2,589 | 4.32
Progressive | 0.73 | A+ | $2,850 | 4.23
GEICO | 0.77 | A++ | $3,197 | 4.13
Travelers | 1.03 | A++ | $2,531 | 4.01
Farmers | 0.77 | A | $4,146 | 3.70
Allstate | 0.95 | A+ | $3,817 | 3.64

_*USAA scored well, but is excluded from the overall rankings since it’s only available to military families._
But just because an insurance company tops a list doesn’t mean that particular carrier is right for everyone. Other insurers might offer coverages, rates and options that better match your particular needs.
In addition, some drivers might have just a speeding ticket on their record, while another might have an at-fault accident.
When Insure.com crunched all its numbers, the following companies offered the cheapest, average rates for drivers in these categories.
Risk factor | Company | Rate
---|---|---
Speeding ticket | **State Farm** | $2,322
DUI | **Progressive** | $2,706
At-fault accident | **State Farm** | $2,438

## How can high-risk drivers save on car insurance?
There are a number of ways high-risk drivers can lower their premiums, including:
* **Comparing rates**: Shop around, getting at least three to five quotes to compare rates on insurance for high-risk drivers. Some comparison sites can help you identify the companies that offer the best high-risk car insurance. We also have a table (below) that shows, of the companies we ranked, which has the cheapest annual rates for high-risk drivers
* **Choosing a higher deductible**: This isn’t always advisable, but, if you can afford a higher deductible, you can get a lower rate by agreeing to pay more out of pocket when you file a claim.
* **Adjusting your driving behaviors**: Consider taking a defensive or safe driving course. Make an effort to avoid violations so that you don’t receive any more violations. Over time, as your driving record improves, you’ll be able to qualify for lower rates.
Randy Humphreys, personal lines director at insurance agency Reliable Risk Management, says his list for how high-risk can save also includes employing usage-based insurance/telematics, exploring different payment options, improving your credit score and double-checking with your agent or insurance company for discounts you may qualify for.
Our agents make it hassle-free to get the right quote.

## How much insurance goes up after accidents, specific traffic violations
The type of ticket you receive also makes a big difference in the increase you could see in your auto insurance premiums. The biggest increase in rates comes from DUI violations. However, an at-fault accident can also have a big impact.
Type of violation | Average rates without violations | Average rates with violations | Percent increase | Dollar increase
---|---|---|---|---
At-fault accident | $1,895 | $2,995 | 58% | $1,100
DUI | $1,895 | $3,853 | 103% | $1,958
Speeding | $1,895 | $2,578 | 36% | $683
Powered by:
## How age plays a role in rate increases after a traffic violation
Age can also impact the way your insurance rate rises depending on the type of violation. Interestingly, for many violations, a younger driver may see a smaller percent increase than an older driver. Part of that is related to the fact that younger drivers, considered a higher risk due to their inexperience, already pay more.
Type of violation | 18-year-old driver | 25-year-old driver | 40-year-old driver | 65-year-old driver
---|---|---|---|---
At-fault accident | 40% | 56% | 58% | 63%
DUI | 69% | 101% | 103% | 108%
Speeding | 27% | 35% | 36% | 39%

There are common factors that affect all car insurance premiums, including age, gender, location and, in some states, your credit score. For high-risk drivers, some additional factors influence your rates:
* **Type of violation**: Some violations are considered riskier than others. For example, DUIs and at-fault accidents might add to your insurance rate more than a speeding ticket.
* **How often you receive a violation**: For those who commit multiple violations, especially in a relatively short amount of time, insurance rates can rise quickly.
* **Whether you have to enter a state high-risk pool**: In some cases, you might be denied coverage as a high-risk driver. In that case, you might pay a high rate for being covered as part of your state’s high-risk pool.
## Why car insurance rates for high-risk driver is so high
High-risk drivers are those who have violations or at-fault accidents on their records. Drivers who regularly get caught speeding, for instance, are seen by insurers as likely to cause an accident in the future. Insurance companies adjust their premiums accordingly.
## Frequently asked questions
### What if I’m denied coverage as a high-risk driver?
If you are denied coverage by an insurance company, you’ll need to look into alternatives, such as your state’s high-risk pool. You might have a higher rate, but until your driving record improves, it might be your only option.
### What coverage type is best for high-risk drivers?
Experts recommend full coverage car insurance.
### How long will I be considered a high-risk driver?
The amount of time certain violations remain on your driving record depends on the state you’re in. In many cases, you’ll have a speeding ticket removed after a few years, while an at-fault accident caused by a DUI might remain on your record for decades.
