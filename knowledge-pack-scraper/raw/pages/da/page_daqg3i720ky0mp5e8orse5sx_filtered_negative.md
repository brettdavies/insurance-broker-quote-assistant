_*These rates are for a 40-year-old with good credit, a clean driving record and a 2012 Toyota Camry across all ZIP codes in the state._
_New York's minimum requirements are actually pretty solid compared to other states, especially with that mandatory uninsured motorist coverage—and trust me, you need it when dealing with the mix of tourists, delivery drivers, and locals all competing for the same piece of asphalt._
_But here's the thing: whether you're dealing with Buffalo snowstorms or NYC street parking, your car faces unique risks that minimum coverage won't touch. Ever seen what road salt does to a car over a few winters? Or what happens when someone "lightly taps" your bumper in Manhattan traffic?_
_The mandatory coverage gives you a decent foundation, but consider whether it's enough for your specific New York driving reality._
_Remember, the cheapest insurer isn't necessarily the best car insurance for your specific situation. If you're considering full coverage, scroll down to see the cheapest options for full coverage in New York._

_(National baseline data for context: In 2023, the average U.S. auto liability claim was**$6,551 for property damage** and **$26,501 for bodily injury**, according to the Insurance Information Institute. New York drivers face even higher potential costs due to denser traffic and higher repair bills.)_
