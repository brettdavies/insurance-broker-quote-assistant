GEEK SPEAK: MARK'S THOUGHTS ON LIABILITY-ONLY INSURANCE

*New York's minimum requirements are actually pretty solid compared to other states, especially with that mandatory uninsured motorist coverage—and trust me, you need it when dealing with the mix of tourists, delivery drivers, and locals all competing for the same piece of asphalt.*

*But here's the thing: whether you're dealing with Buffalo snowstorms or NYC street parking, your car faces unique risks that minimum coverage won't touch. Ever seen what road salt does to a car over a few winters? Or what happens when someone "lightly taps" your bumper in Manhattan traffic?*

*The mandatory coverage gives you a decent foundation, but consider whether it's enough for your specific New York driving reality.*

*Remember, the cheapest insurer isn't necessarily the best car insurance for your specific situation. If you're considering full coverage, scroll down to see the cheapest options for full coverage in New York.*

## How to Get the Cheapest Car Insurance in New York

Finding the cheapest provider is just one piece of the puzzle when looking for coverage in New York. Here are proven ways to [save the most on auto insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-lower-your-car-insurance-rate/):

1. 1

   Shop widely across insurers

   Rates vary sharply between New York City, Long Island, and upstate areas. Get quotes from national providers, regional carriers, and local brokers.
2. 2

   Know the minimum coverage requirements

   New York mandates 25/50/10 liability, 50/100 uninsured motorist, and $50,000 PIP (no-fault) coverage. This makes it one of the stricter states in terms of baseline requirements.
3. 3

   Take advantage of PIP options

   New York is a no-fault state. You can enhance or manage costs by adjusting PIP add-ons, such as extended coverage for lost wages or additional medical benefits.
4. 4

   Bundle and stack discounts

   Bundle auto with homeowners or renters insurance, maintain continuous coverage, or use paperless billing. New York insurers also give discounts for completing a state-approved defensive driving course.
5. 5

   Adjust coverage by location

   In dense areas like NYC, comprehensive and collision are smart due to high theft and crash risks. In upstate regions with lower accident frequency, liability-only on older vehicles may suffice.
6. 6

   Improve your driver profile

   Keep a clean record and good credit. New York insurers can factor in your credit history when pricing policies.
7. 7

   Know the New York Automobile Insurance Plan (NYAIP)

   If you’re unable to get insured in the standard market, the NYAIP provides access to minimum required coverage.

## Risks of Getting the Cheapest Car Insurance in New York

New York requires drivers to carry **25/50/10 liability coverage**, which means $25,000 for injuries to one person, $50,000 total per accident, and $10,000 for property damage. Lability insurance has no deductible.

The state also mandates **$50,000 in personal injury protection (PIP)** and **uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident**. While these minimums are higher than in many states, they still leave drivers exposed to significant financial risks.

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

At-fault repairs to your own car aren’t covered

Minimum policies don’t include collision, so you pay out of pocket if you cause an accident. The **$10,000 property damage minimum** only covers other people’s cars or property and can be exhausted quickly in accidents involving newer vehicles that often cost far more.

![hurricane icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/hurricane_oc1qon.svg)

Severe weather damage isn’t covered under minimum insurance

New York regularly faces blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding. NOAA recorded several **billion-dollar weather disasters affecting the state in 2023**. Without comprehensive coverage, damage from floods, fallen trees, or hail is your responsibility.

![injury icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/injury_ykcx1b.svg)

Medical and legal costs can exceed minimums, even with PIP

PIP pays up to **$50,000**, but serious crashes (especially in high-cost areas like NYC) can surpass the **$25,000 per-person bodily injury limit**. Once PIP and liability limits run out, you’re responsible for remaining medical bills and potential lawsuits.

![uninsured icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/uninsured_jck1df.svg)

UM is required, but the limits may be too low

New York mandates **UM bodily injury coverage of 25/50**, but it only applies to accidents within the state unless you add an endorsement. Many drivers upgrade to **Supplementary UM (SUM)** to increase limits and extend protection outside of New York.

![handcuffs2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/handcuffs_2_mug1xe.svg)

Theft and vandalism risks remain high

New York ranked **#7 nationwide for vehicle thefts in 2023, with over 32,000 cases reported**. Without comprehensive insurance, you won’t receive coverage if your car is stolen or vandalized.

*(National baseline data for context: In 2023, the average U.S. auto liability claim was **$6,551 for property damage** and **$26,501 for bodily injury**, according to the Insurance Information Institute. New York drivers face even higher potential costs due to denser traffic and higher repair bills.)*

### Minimum Coverage Requirements in New York

To legally drive in New York, motorists must carry at least the state’s minimum auto insurance. New York operates under a **no-fault system**, meaning your own insurer helps cover medical expenses after an accident, regardless of who caused it. The law requires liability coverage to pay for injuries and property damage you may cause to others, but the state also mandates Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Uninsured Motorist coverage. While these limits satisfy legal requirements, many drivers choose higher coverage for stronger financial protection.

| Coverage Type | Minimum Required Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Bodily Injury Liability (Per Person) | $25,000 per person ($50,000 for death) |
| Bodily Injury Liability (Per Accident) | $50,000 per accident ($100,000 for death) |
| Property Damage Liability | $10,000 per accident |
| Personal Injury Protection (PIP) | $50,000 per person |
| Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury | $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident |
