##  How much does car insurance cost?
The average cost of [full coverage car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) in 2025 is about $2,638 a year (or $219 a month).
Rates vary significantly by state, though, and are typically higher in ones with no-fault insurance, such as New York and Michigan.
##  Why is car insurance so expensive?
Premiums have increased for several reasons, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/why-did-my-auto-insurance-costs-go-up-even-when-i-didnt-file-a-claim).
  * **Economic factors:** The cost of repairing and replacing vehicles has risen faster than inflation, as have medical and legal bills. Tariffs on automobiles, parts and raw materials also impact insurance premiums.
  * **Cars are more expensive to repair:** As car technology has advanced, it’s made repairing or replacing parts more costly.
  * **Accidents are on the rise:** The number and severity of collisions, including fatal crashes, have gone up, according to [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot). That means larger payouts from insurers, who then charge customers higher premiums.


##  How car insurance rates are calculated
[Many different factors](https://www.cnbc.com/select/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates/) play a role in your premiums:
  * **Your age:** Young drivers (under 25) pay some of the highest premiums. Rates decrease after that until age 70, when they begin to rise again.
  * **Your gender:** In all but six states, insurance companies can consider your gender when calculating your rates. Because women are considered more conservative drivers, men tend to pay higher rates.
  * **Your credit history:** In [most states](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/), insurance providers consider your credit when deciding rates. For that reason, [improving your credit score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/easy-tips-to-help-raise-your-credit-score/) can lower your car insurance.
  * **Where you live:** Insurance companies factor in crime rates, population density and other geographical factors when determining premiums. Some states have higher coverage minimums or require extras, like [personal injury protection](https://www.cnbc.com/select/types-of-car-insurance/), that can add up.
  * **Your driving record:** Speeding, accidents and other [high-risk driving](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) will lead to higher rates, as will filing a lot of claims or lapses in coverage.
  * **Your vehicle:** Some models are more expensive to insure. Even the color of your car can impact the price you pay for insurance.


##  How to lower your car insurance
There are several ways to [cut down on the cost of car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/):
### **Step 1: Shop around**
Insurance companies calculate rates differently. If you think your provider is too expensive, get rate quotes from at least three other insurers — including some on this list.
###  **Step 2:** **Raise your deductible**
Typically, the higher your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/), the lower your premium will be. Make sure you can afford to pay out of pocket if you’re in an accident.
### **Step 3: Lower your coverage amount**
Full coverage is usually the smart choice, but if your car is worth less than 10 times your premium, you might be better off with just [liability-only insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/).
### **Step 4: Look for discounts**
Most insurance companies have discounts for good students, safe driving and for[bundling auto insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) with homeowners insurance, among other rate reductions.
### **Step 5: Improve your credit score**
In most states, insurers are permitted to consider your credit history when pricing your policy. Generally, the higher your score, the lower your premiums — so paying your bills on time (and in full), not spending up to your credit limit and checking your credit report for errors can save you money

The average premiums listed are based on a 40-year-old male driver with a 2023 Toyota Camry, a clean driving record, good credit and the following limits on his policy:
  * $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $50,000 property damage liability per accident
  * $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
  * $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
  * $500 collision deductible
  * $500 [comprehensive](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-comprehensive-car-insurance-/) deductible
