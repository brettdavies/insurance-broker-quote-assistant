## How much does car insurance cost?

The average cost of [full coverage car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) in 2025 is about $2,638 a year (or $219 a month).

Rates vary significantly by state, though, and are typically higher in ones with no-fault insurance, such as New York and Michigan.

## Why is car insurance so expensive?

Premiums have increased for several reasons, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/why-did-my-auto-insurance-costs-go-up-even-when-i-didnt-file-a-claim).

* **Economic factors:** The cost of repairing and replacing vehicles has risen faster than inflation, as have medical and legal bills. Tariffs on automobiles, parts and raw materials also impact insurance premiums.
* **Cars are more expensive to repair:** As car technology has advanced, it’s made repairing or replacing parts more costly.
* **Accidents are on the rise:** The number and severity of collisions, including fatal crashes, have gone up, according to [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot). That means larger payouts from insurers, who then charge customers higher premiums.

## How car insurance rates are calculated

[Many different factors](https://www.cnbc.com/select/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates/) play a role in your premiums:

* **Your age:** Young drivers (under 25) pay some of the highest premiums. Rates decrease after that until age 70, when they begin to rise again.
* **Your gender:** In all but six states, insurance companies can consider your gender when calculating your rates. Because women are considered more conservative drivers, men tend to pay higher rates.
* **Your credit history:** In [most states](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/), insurance providers consider your credit when deciding rates. For that reason, [improving your credit score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/easy-tips-to-help-raise-your-credit-score/) can lower your car insurance.
* **Where you live:** Insurance companies factor in crime rates, population density and other geographical factors when determining premiums. Some states have higher coverage minimums or require extras, like [personal injury protection](https://www.cnbc.com/select/types-of-car-insurance/), that can add up.
* **Your driving record:** Speeding, accidents and other [high-risk driving](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) will lead to higher rates, as will filing a lot of claims or lapses in coverage.
* **Your vehicle:** Some models are more expensive to insure. Even the color of your car can impact the price you pay for insurance.

## How to lower your car insurance

There are several ways to [cut down on the cost of car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/):

### **Step 1: Shop around**

Insurance companies calculate rates differently. If you think your provider is too expensive, get rate quotes from at least three other insurers — including some on this list.

### **Step 2:** **Raise your deductible**

Typically, the higher your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/), the lower your premium will be. Make sure you can afford to pay out of pocket if you’re in an accident.

### **Step 3: Lower your coverage amount**

Full coverage is usually the smart choice, but if your car is worth less than 10 times your premium, you might be better off with just [liability-only insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/).

### **Step 4: Look for discounts**

Most insurance companies have discounts for good students, safe driving and for[bundling auto insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) with homeowners insurance, among other rate reductions.

### **Step 5: Improve your credit score**

In most states, insurers are permitted to consider your credit history when pricing your policy. Generally, the higher your score, the lower your premiums — so paying your bills on time (and in full), not spending up to your credit limit and checking your credit report for errors can save you money

## Our methodology

[CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) reviewed more than two dozen top car insurance companies, focusing on the average cost of both full- and minimum-coverage policies.

We also considered coverage types, nationwide availability, discounts, online experience and customer service, using data from [J.D. Power’s Auto Insurance Satisfaction Study](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-j-d-power/) and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ complaint index.

The average premiums listed are based on a 40-year-old male driver with a 2023 Toyota Camry, a clean driving record, good credit and the following limits on his policy:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 [comprehensive](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-comprehensive-car-insurance-/) deductible

We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.
