## Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage Necessary in California?

Although California law requires drivers to carry car insurance, many motorists still lack proper coverage. Some only purchase policies with minimal limits, leaving them vulnerable to financial losses after an accident. To protect yourself, uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is essential if you drive in California.
At [Tulekyan Law](http://www.tulekyanlaw.com), our expert [automobile accident attorney](https://tulekyanlaw.com/los-angeles-car-accident-lawyer/) explains why uninsured motorist insurance is crucial and how it safeguards your financial future.

A staggering [14% of California drivers are uninsured](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), according to the Insurance Information Institute. With car accidents costing Americans [$340 billion in 2019](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crashes-cost-america-billions-2019), the absence of uninsured motorist coverage poses a significant risk.
If you're involved in an accident with an uninsured driver, the financial consequences can be severe. Medical bills, which contribute to about[ 40% of bankruptcies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1127305/), and the rising costs of vehicle repairs or replacements, can quickly lead to economic hardship.
Uninsured motorist coverage is a vital resource to protect your financial stability.
California law does not mandate uninsured motorist (UM) coverage, but insurance policies must include it unless explicitly waived in writing. If both the policyholder and the insurer agree, UM coverage can be reduced or excluded entirely.
[California Insurance Code § 11580.2(a)(1)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=INS&sectionNum=11580.2.#:~:text=\(a\)%20\(1\)%20No,issued%20or%20delivered%20in%20this) requires auto insurance policies to include UM coverage unless both parties opt out in writing.
UM coverage comes into play when the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough insurance to cover your damages.
  * **Example 1:** The at-fault driver has $50,000 liability coverage, and your damages are $100,000. Their insurance covers $50,000, and your UM coverage pays the remaining $50,000.
  * **Example 2:** You have $100,000 in damages, and the at-fault driver has no insurance. Your UM policy covers the full amount up to your policy limits.
  * **Example 3:** You don’t have UM coverage. In the same scenario, you must pay the remaining $50,000 out of pocket.


Uninsured motorist coverage provides several essential benefits:
  * Offers peace of mind knowing you’re protected against uninsured motorists.


  * Covers medical expenses when health insurance falls short.


  * Compensates for lost wages if you’re unable to work.


  * Provides pain and suffering compensation for injuries caused by uninsured drivers.


  * Pays for vehicle repairs or replacement.


  * Protects your assets from being depleted due to accident-related expenses.


  * Covers hit-and-run accidents involving personal injury.


By law, California insurers must offer UM coverage in the same amounts as your bodily injury liability limits. The minimum coverage available is:
  * $30,000 for bodily injury per person.
  * $60,000 for total injury per accident.
  * $3,500 for property damage.


These are only minimums. Higher limits are available and recommended based on your financial needs. Note: California’s minimum liability limits will increase in 2025.
To ensure adequate protection, aim for the highest UM coverage you can afford. Experts recommend at least **$100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident** to cover medical bills, lost income, and car repairs. Your ideal coverage depends on your financial situation, health insurance, and tolerance for risk.
Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage steps in when the at-fault driver’s insurance isn’t enough. For example, if their policy pays $50,000 but your damages total $100,000, your UM policy can cover the remaining $50,000.
Maintaining robust UM coverage ensures you’re fully compensated, even in worst-case scenarios.
