Your Progressive car insurance policy will only cover you out of state if you are traveling, but not if you move. Progressive car insurance does not follow you if you move to a different state, but if you’re moving somewhere within the same state you currently live in, you can keep your insurance policy (just notify Progressive).

## Progressive Coverage When Moving Out of State

Despite Progressive auto insurance being available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., you will need to get a new policy if you move to a different state permanently, and your old policy will be cancelled. This is because the state in which you keep your vehicle is one of the most important factors for determining your auto insurance rate, and every state has different laws and coverage requirements for auto insurance. Data specific to your new ZIP code will help determine the change in your premium.

Progressive asks that customers who plan to move to a new state get an updated insurance quote as soon as possible by logging into their account online or calling customer service at [(866) 749-7436](tel:+18667497436) to speak with a representative. Progressive may ask you to verify your address to confirm your ZIP code with a copy of your new license, W-2 or utility bill, but you’ll keep your Progressive loyalty rewards regardless of where you move.

## Progressive Coverage When Traveling Out of State

Your Progressive auto policy will cover you in all [50 states](https://www.progressive.com/answers/multi-state-car-insurance/) (and Canada) if you’re traveling short term, but if you have another home in a different state and you keep a vehicle there, you’ll have to maintain a separate auto insurance policy for that out-of-state address if you want to use that car. Keep in mind that if you cancel an insurance policy for a car you won’t be using for a while, it won’t be protected from damage caused by natural events, vandalism or theft.

If you are a “snowbird” (someone who spends their time in one place during fall and winter months and another for spring and summer) or you travel often, Progressive offers a “[snowbird exception](https://www.progressive.com/answers/multi-state-car-insurance/).” This exception lets those who travel with their vehicle maintain just one auto insurance policy – for the state they are currently staying in. As long as the vehicle stays with you, you can get a new policy every time you spend significant time in a different state, and your old one will be cancelled.
