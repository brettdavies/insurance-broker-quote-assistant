I talked to my State Farm agent this morning to complain about the 32% increase in the 2025 premium. He told me to expect another 50% increase in 2026.

I thanked him for the warning and told him I’ll let the policy lapse. Why throw good money after bad? There’s been no change in my risk profile. I’m paying for the bad choices of others in the risk pool.

Since I have a low risk of getting sued, and there’s always the chance of the insurance company screwing you out of the coverage you paid for, it makes more sense to retain the risk, and invest the premium.

I pointed out that I can more than buy a new car on the strength of the collision & comp coverage I’ve declined over the past 25 years, while investing the savings in the stock market.

Self insuring is fine as long as you can handle the potential loss – most umbrella policies are for $1 million.
