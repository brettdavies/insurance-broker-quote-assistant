## Geico car insurance review

Jerry rates Geico [car insurance](/car-insurance/) 5 stars out of 5. This score is the highest among insurers that Jerry rates and takes into account the insurer’s pricing, industry and consumer ratings, financial strength, and national complaint data.

Geico stands out for ample rate discount opportunities, a superior financial strength rating and wide availability both geographically and in its customer base — this insurer may provide coverage to both good drivers and those considered “high-risk.”

Geico earns average ratings in industry reports and with Jerry customers, notably scoring below average in two J.D. Power surveys. Geico’s policy customization options also aren’t as robust as some of the company’s competitors.

Geico has been in the car insurance business for more than 80 years. The insurer provides coverage in all 50 states and drivers can buy a policy online, over the phone or with a local agent.

## Is Geico a good insurance company?

Geico may be a good choice for those who qualify for one or more of the insurer’s many discounts. The company’s high financial strength rating also makes it ideal for drivers seeking a stable insurer. However, drivers seeking a tailored policy that includes coverages such as [rideshare](/car-insurance/rideshare-insurance/), pet injury or [gap insurance](/car-insurance/gap-insurance/) may be better served by another insurer.

It’s best to compare Geico with other insurers to find the coverage you want at the lowest price.
