### Arizona
Arizona drivers typically pay around 2 percent less per year for full coverage auto insurance than the national average, at $2,644 annually. Arizona’s roadways rank middle-of-the-road, and the state’s cost of living is average. Together, these factors likely contribute to [Arizona’s car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-arizona/) being slightly [cheaper than the national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-arizona/).

### Arkansas
[Average annual Arkansas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-arkansas/) full coverage car insurance rates are 10 percent less than the national average. While the state does experience natural disasters like severe storms and flooding, it also has a relatively low [population density](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/apportionment/population-density-data-table.pdf), which may help even out average auto insurance premiums.

### California
Average full coverage car insurance in California costs 16 percent more [per year than the national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/). High insurance costs in the Golden State could be due to California’s sky-high cost of living and the state’s low-ranking infrastructure, which can make finding [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) a challenge. Additionally, according to a [Texas A&M report](https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/mobility-report-2021.pdf), California is home to two of the top five most congested large urban areas, with average commuters near Los Angeles and San Francisco spending more than 100 extra hours in traffic in 2019.
California's legislative and regulatory environment may also influences insurance costs. The state's restrictions on using credit scores in determining insurance rates means that insurers may rely more heavily on other factors such as driving history and the type of vehicle insured, which can lead to higher premiums for certain drivers​.

### Colorado
Colorado’s full coverage [car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-colorado/) are, on average, 19 percent more per year than the rest of the country. High insurance costs in the state could be related to the state’s poor road conditions and relatively high rate of [uninsured motorists](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists).

### Connecticut
[Car insurance in Connecticut](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-connecticut/) costs 2 percent more per year for full coverage than the rest of the country, on average. Connecticut has a low crime rate, including [vehicle thefts](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-theft), which may contribute to lower rates in the state. Interestingly enough, [Connecticut law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/connecticut-car-insurance-laws/) requires drivers to have higher liability limits and to carry uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, which should theoretically result in higher insurance costs. Based on our findings, Connecticut car insurance rates are typically [cheap](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-connecticut/).

### Delaware
Delaware’s average annual full coverage car insurance rates are 10 percent more than the national average.

### Florida
Florida’s [average car insurance costs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-florida/) are some of the highest in the country. This is partially due to the high number of uninsured drivers, elevated population density, [high fatal accident rate](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state) and extremely costly hurricane damage. On top of these issues, Florida is also rife with insurance-related problems, like abundant insurance fraud and high costs of [reinsurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/what-is-reinsurance/). All of these things combined make Florida’s insurance market one of the most challenging — and expensive — for [auto insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida/) to work in, which in turn makes finding an [affordable policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-florida/) an uphill battle.

### Georgia
Average full coverage [car insurance rates in Georgia](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-georgia/) are about on par with the national average at $2,895 per year. Georgia experiences natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes and has a high [fatal accident rate](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state), but it also has a highly-rated highway infrastructure system and fairly low population density.

### Hawaii
Despite Hawaii’s high cost of living, car insurance in the state is relatively cheap. Full coverage [car insurance in the Aloha State costs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-hawaii/) 38 percent less than the national average per year. Honolulu, Hawaii is also known for its efficient public transit system, which allows residents to travel without using their cars. Hawaii also has fewer [licensed drivers](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/dl1c.cfm) than most other states, according to the Federal Highway Administration, which could contribute to lower car insurance rates.
Hawaii’s insurance laws are some of the most robust in the country. Hawaii law strictly limits which [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) insurers are allowed to use when calculating your car insurance rate. Insurers are prohibited from considering credit-based insurance score, marital status, age and gender when setting your premium.

### Idaho
[Idaho’s average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-idaho/) annual full coverage car insurance rates are some of the [cheapest](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-idaho/) in the country, coming in 45 percent less than the national average. Car insurance rates in Idaho may remain low due to the state’s low population density, low number of licensed drivers and highly-ranked infrastructure. Of any state in the U.S., Idaho drivers also spend one of the fewest hours in urbanized traffic congestion, which could also contribute to low car insurance rates.

Illinois sits in the middle of the pack when it comes to the cost of living and highway infrastructure quality, but [average rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-illinois/) may be lower due to the state’s low fatal accident rate and relatively low population density outside of the Chicago metropolitan area.

### New York
With the highest [average cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-new-york/) for minimum coverage car insurance in the nation, New York drivers typically pay significantly more for car insurance than the average U.S. driver. And New York minimum car insurance could get even more expensive, due to [new state requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/new-york-car-insurance-laws/). Beginning August 2023, New York auto insurance providers are [required to include spousal liability coverage](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/property_insurers/supp_spousal_liability_insurance) in all policies unless the policyholder declines it in writing.
The state’s average full coverage premium of $4,090 may be largely due to the high number of [fraudulent insurance claims](https://www.iii.org/article/no-fault-insurance-fraud-new-york-state-ramping-premiums) made each year, in addition to its over 12 million registered vehicles and high population density.

In the capital city of Raleigh, car insurance is even [cheaper](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-north-carolina/) at $1,800 for full coverage. North Carolina’s high-ranking highway system, mild weather and fairly low cost of living could contribute to these lower-than-average rates.

### Ohio
Ohio is one of the [cheapest states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-ohio/) for full coverage car insurance on average, with drivers paying $1,842 per year. The [lower average cost of coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-ohio/) may in part be due to Ohio’s mix of rural and suburban roads, helping to break up what may otherwise be a heavy concentration of traffic.

### Oklahoma
Oklahoma drivers pay an [average full coverage insurance rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-oklahoma/) very close to the national average. This rate is in line with the state’s low population density and low cost of living, but poor rural road conditions and a high accident fatality rate may keep average rates from being [lower](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-oklahoma/).

On average, full coverage here costs $2,121 per year and minimum coverage costs $841. Relatively [affordable insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-oregon/) in the Beaver State could be due to its low population density, mild weather and well-kept rural and urban roads.

[Pennsylvania drivers pay an average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-pennsylvania/) of 8 percent less per year for full coverage car insurance than the average U.S. driver. Pennsylvania’s high population density drive average rates up, but its low rate of accident fatalities and uninsured drivers balance it out.

[Rhode Island residents pay an average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-rhode-island/) of $2,991 per year for full coverage car insurance. This below-average rate is likely due to the state’s low traffic fatality rate and low crime rates. However, the state has a poorly-rated highway infrastructure system and high rate of [uninsured drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/), which may prevent rates from being [even lower](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-rhode-island/).

### Texas
Texas drivers pay [average full coverage rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-texas/) 2 percent more than the national average.

## No-fault states
Another factor that impacts auto insurance rates by state is how insurance payouts are handled after an accident. Some states are considered [no-fault states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/no-fault-coverage/), while others are at-fault states, or tort states. Contrary to what some believe, living in a no-fault state does not mean that no one is considered at fault in an accident. No-fault refers to how your or the other driver’s car insurance kicks in when there is an accident, specifically related to medical expenses.
Below is a list of the 12 no-fault states:
  * Florida
  * Hawaii
  * Kansas
  * Kentucky (optional — drivers can reject no-fault provision)
  * Massachusetts
  * Michigan
  * Minnesota
  * New Jersey (optional — drivers can choose full tort or limited tort option)
  * New York
  * North Dakota
  * Pennsylvania (optional—drivers can choose full tort or limited tort option)
  * Utah


In a no-fault state, each party must typically first file a claim with their own car insurance to help cover any medical expenses after an accident, regardless of who caused the crash. Drivers in a no-fault state are typically required to carry a certain amount of [personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) to help cover these medical costs.
No-fault states can still determine liability after an accident and the responsible party could be liable for property damage and medical expenses that exceed a certain threshold, depending on the state. In at-fault, or tort, states, the driver responsible for the crash (or their car insurance company) compensates the other driver for their losses, including bodily injury and property damage, and the not-at-fault driver is not required to file a claim for their medical expenses with their own auto insurer.
PIP coverage does not include coverage for property damage. While no-fault states typically require that drivers carry a certain level of PIP coverage to help pay for their medical expenses, the same does not usually apply for property damage. Instead, property damage from a car accident in most no-fault states is handled similarly to property damage in at-fault states, where the at-fault driver’s insurance is responsible for covering any property damage. Michigan is the exception, as its Department of Insurance requires drivers to carry property protection insurance with a coverage limit of $1 million to cover any property damaged by a driver in a car accident.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What other factors are considered in my car insurance rate?
Caret Down Icon
Every insurer has its own method of determining premiums, but generally, each will look at several [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/). These factors can vary from state to state — for example, a few states prohibit insurers from considering drivers' age, gender or credit history. Driving record is typically a key consideration, along with your ZIP code and your vehicle's age, make and model. To help keep premiums down, you may be eligible for [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). If you enroll in your insurer's telematics program, for example, and prove to be a safe and careful driver, you could save up to 40 percent from some companies. Other discounts are easier to earn, like savings for bundling multiple insurance products (such as auto plus home or renters coverage), savings for setting up autopay or savings for agreeing to receive bills and insurance documents electronically.
  * ###  What is a tort state?
Caret Down Icon
A tort state is a state that follows “at-fault” insurance laws. In a tort state, the driver considered at fault for a crash is responsible for paying for the damages and medical expenses they caused and the not-at-fault driver does not have to file a claim with their insurer (although they could choose to do so). Some no-fault states, like Kentucky, also have tort options that limit or allow parties to file lawsuits for their medical expenses.
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in my state?
Caret Down Icon
The [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) may vary for every driver based on their personal rating factors and insurance preferences. For example, a driver with a few incidents on their record may be looking for the best company for [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), while a parent of a newly licensed teen may be looking for a company with a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) geared toward new drivers. To find the best company for your needs, many insurance professionals recommend researching companies to find a few good options, then comparing quotes from these insurers to find the one that could offer you the best rate.
  * ###  Is car insurance required in my state?
Caret Down Icon
Most states require drivers to carry some form of car insurance or meet another type of requirement. In terms of insurance, drivers are typically required to carry at least a minimum amount of bodily injury and property damage liability coverage, though some states may also require personal injury protection, medical payments and other coverage types. To protect your finances, it’s generally recommended by insurance experts to have car insurance and to buy higher limits than what’s required to offer sufficient coverage.

### Rates 
Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates for our base profile are based on the following characteristics and full coverage limits with bundling and paperless billing discounts applied:

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.
If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
