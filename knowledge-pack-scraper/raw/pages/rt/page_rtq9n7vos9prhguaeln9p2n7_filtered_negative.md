The Bankrate Promise
At Bankrate, we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. To help readers understand how insurance affects their finances, we have 9 licensed insurance agents on staff who have spent a combined 78 years in the insurance industry. While we adhere to strict  editorial integrity, this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here’s an explanation of how we make money. Our content is backed by [Coverage.com](https://www.coverage.com/) LLC, a licensed entity (NPN: 19966249). For more information, please see our Insurance Disclosure.
Among the many factors that impact your auto insurance rates, where you live might be one of the most important. Even in states where ZIP codes cannot be used as a factor in determining premiums, you may find that your state’s average cost of car insurance is significantly different compared to a neighboring state. Car insurance rates by state can vary widely, often by hundreds of dollars.

The Bankrate Promise
At Bankrate, we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. To help readers understand how insurance affects their finances, we have 9 licensed insurance agents on staff who have spent a combined 78 years in the insurance industry. While we adhere to strict  editorial integrity, this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here’s an explanation of how we make money. Our content is backed by [Coverage.com](https://www.coverage.com/) LLC, a licensed entity (NPN: 19966249). For more information, please see our Insurance Disclosure.
Among the many factors that impact your auto insurance rates, where you live might be one of the most important. Even in states where ZIP codes cannot be used as a factor in determining premiums, you may find that your state’s average cost of car insurance is significantly different compared to a neighboring state. Car insurance rates by state can vary widely, often by hundreds of dollars.
