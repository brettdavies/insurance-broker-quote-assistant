# When does car insurance go down?

Age is one of the most important factors in determining your car insurance rate. This may seem unfair because there are good drivers in every age group, but younger drivers are more likely to have accidents or take risks on the road. Experienced drivers are less likely to have accident claims, which means they cost less to insure. At Progressive, the average premium per driver tends to decrease significantly from 19-34 and then stabilize or decrease slightly from 34-75. At age 75, the average premium begins trending upward.

## What affects car insurance rates?

Age is just one factor that can impact your car insurance rate. Your personal driving record, claims history, your selected coverages, the make and model of your car, and many other factors can affect your price. Typically, age is more of a significant factor when you're young and inexperienced behind the wheel. But as you get older and develop your driving skills, rates tend to drop and stay level until you enter your mid-70s.

## At what age does car insurance get cheaper?

At Progressive, rates drop by 8% on average at age 25 and may drop even sooner than that. As young drivers gain more experience behind the wheel, they tend to have fewer claims, which makes them less of an insurance risk. But there are other cost factors impacting your car insurance , such as your claims history. For example, if you're in an accident right before you turn 25, your rate may not drop.

Other reasons your rate may go down include:

* **Discounts**: You may be eligible for more discounts as you get older, such as a bundle discount for insuring your home and car with the same insurer.
* **Improved driving record**: If you had a few speeding tickets or other violations when you were younger, you may see a rate decrease after they fall off your record.
* **Family changes**: If you have a teenage driver on your insurance, your rate tends to go up. But once they move out and buy their own policy, you can end up with a cheaper rate.

## Average car insurance rates by age

| Age | Rate & change |
| --- | --- |
| 17 and under | Rate & change$247.28 |
| 18 | Rate & change$271.92 (+10%) |
| 19-20 | Rate & change$242.40 (-11%) |
| 21-22 | Rate & change$215.04 (-11%) |
| 23-24 | Rate & change$189.78 (-12%) |
| 25-29 | Rate & change$168.86 (-11%) |
| 30-34 | Rate & change$159.72 (-5%) |
| 35-39 | Rate & change$156.13 (-2%) |
| 40-44 | Rate & change$151.81 (-3%) |

| 55-64 | Rate & change$128.60 (-9%) |
| 65-74 | Rate & change$122.26 (-5%) |
| 75+ | Rate & change$127.96 (+5%) |

## How to get affordable auto insurance for young adults & teens

We know that young and inexperienced drivers may be a cause for concern on the road and to their parents' wallets. But adding a teenage driver to your existing policy is usually more affordable than having them get their own policy. Plus, Progressive offers a few [auto insurance discounts](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/) that can help lower your bill:\*Read the associated disclosure for this claim.

* **Teen driver discount**: Get an automatic discount when you add a teen driver (age 18 or younger) to your policy.
* **Good student discount**: We offer a discount for full-time students under the age of 23 with a B average or better.
* **Distant student discount**: If your child is 22 years old or younger, goes to a school that is 100 miles or more from your home, and doesn't have a car at school, you'll earn a distant student discount.

## How to get affordable auto insurance for seniors

Insurance rates are typically the lowest for middle-aged drivers, but car insurance costs for seniors may increase, even for those with a great driving record. Despite years of experience behind the wheel, older drivers can be more [prone to car accidents](https://www.iihs.org/topics/older-drivers#age-and-driving-ability) due to physical, cognitive, or visual impairments, which may translate to higher rates.

The good news is that seniors typically spend less time on the road which — along with driving safely — could mean savings through [Progressive's Snapshot program](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/snapshot/). Some states also mandate mature driver discounts for seniors who enroll in and complete state-approved driving courses.
