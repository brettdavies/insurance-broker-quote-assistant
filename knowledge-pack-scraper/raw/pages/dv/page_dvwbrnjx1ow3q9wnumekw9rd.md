Combining home and auto insurance is a good way to get cheaper insurance rates on both policies. If you buy home and car insurance from the same company, you may be eligible for a multi-policy discount. This will reduce both your home and auto insurance rates.
When bundling, insurance carriers offer a discount to policyholders who buy multiple lines of coverage with them, says Clayton Fischer, an agent with Blue Marlin Insurance in Coral Gables, Florida. For instance, he says, insurance companies may offer exclusive options like 12-month auto policies–as opposed to six-month auto policies—when bundled with homeowners insurance.
"Biggest perk of the 12-month auto policy is preventing rate increases every six months," he says. "It’s also a feature to help policyholders have a single point of contact regarding insurance coverage."
Many insurance companies in Virginia provide discounts for bundling, but the discounts and rates can vary considerably, sometimes by hundreds of dollars. So, it's critical to analyze the overall savings and individual policy rates to find the best bundling discount for auto and home insurance in Virginia.

## How does bundling home and car insurance work?
The concept of bundling is pretty basic. You buy more than one type of insurance from the same company and, in exchange for the increased business, the insurance company gives you a discount. And there’s an additional benefit for the insurer for offering bundles: Customers who bundle are more likely to renew their policies.
You typically get discounts on both [car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance.aspx) and [home insurance](https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance.aspx) when you bundle coverage. The discount isn’t equal for both policies. Each provider has its own discount formulas. Companies may offer a more substantial discount on one than the other.
## The pros and cons of home and auto insurance bundles
The biggest benefit of bundling your home and auto insurance is a decreased premium.
But keep in mind that [you won't always save money bundling](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/is-bundling-home-and-auto-really-the-best-deal). You could find an insurer with a low price on one of the two policies, which could result in better savings than a bundle. Here’s how that works:
  * If you currently pay $1,000 for car insurance from one insurer and $1,200 for home insurance from another, that's a total of $2,200.
  * But let's say you decide to buy your home insurance from your auto insurer. The cost for the new home insurance policy is $1,500, or $300 more than your current cost.
  * Your total rate under the bundle would be $2,500, a $300 increase.
  * That means you'd need a bundle discount of at least $400 or so to lower the total bundle rate enough to save money compared to the price you currently pay for separate policies.


That's why you should compare home and auto insurance bundle quotes to what you're paying for separate policies. Rates on bundles aren't always lower.
## Should you bundle home and auto insurance in Virginia?
Prior to signing up for an auto and home bundle, it’s important to shop around. Bundling your car and homeowners insurance has many advantages; you only have to deal with a single company and with a single bill, and you typically get a discount on both policies. Yet bundling isn’t always the best deal.
Some companies have [cheap car insurance rates](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-rates-by-state) but less competitive [home insurance rates](https://www.insurance.com/average-home-insurance-rates), and vice versa. You might pay less overall by choosing two different companies for your insurance.
Shop around and evaluate Virginia car insurance rates on an individual basis and with a bundling discount to make sure you’re getting the best deal before you buy.

## FAQ: Home and auto insurance bundling
### What information do you need to bundle your policies?
To bundle your policies you will need all of the details for both the cars and the home you want to insure. That includes VINs, driver information and details about the home. Your current home and auto policies will list this information for easy reference.
### Is there a limit on how many policies can be bundled?
Typically, you can purchase as many insurance policies as you want from the same company. However, that doesn’t mean you can take advantage of a bundling discount with every policy you buy. There may be a limit on the number of policies you can bundle with one company. For instance, you might only qualify for a bundling discount on the three most expensive policies. You should speak with an agent from your insurance company to learn more about the possible restrictions.
### What type of insurance policies can I bundle?
Multi-policy discounts can also apply to other types of insurance policies that you buy from the same insurance company. Depending upon the insurer, you may also be able to bundle these [types of insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/types-of-car-insurance.html) policies:
  * Condo
  * Renters
  * Motorcycle
  * RV
  * Life


Some [auto insurance companies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers.aspx) don't write homeowners insurance, but some may align themselves with a home insurer to offer a discount. Ask your agent or customer service representative to see if you can bundle [multiple insurance policies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/multi-car-policies.html).
