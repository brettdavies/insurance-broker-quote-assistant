# Do You Need Windstorm Insurance in Texas?
April 25, 2025

# Windstorm Insurance
![Windstorm Insurance in Texas](https://www.dicklawfirm.com/images/blog/delete-blog-pic-2.2501072112125.png)
## Coastal Requirements
For homeowners in Texas coastal counties, separate [windstorm insurance ](https://www.dicklawfirm.com/blog/2022/december/what-is-windstorm-insurance-/)is typically required rather than optional. Fourteen coastal counties and parts of Harris County (including Galveston, Brazoria, and Chambers) comprise the state's designated catastrophe area, where most standard homeowners insurance policies exclude wind and hail damage. In these regions, mortgage lenders universally require wind coverage, typically [obtained through the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/texas-windstorm-insurance/#windstorm-insurance-for-texas-homeowners) (TWIA) or specialty insurers. This requirement exists because standard insurers largely withdrew from covering hurricane wind damage in these vulnerable areas following devastating storms like Hurricane Ike and Harvey.
### Inland Considerations
Most inland Texas homeowners don't need separate windstorm insurance since standard homeowners policies typically include wind and hail coverage. However, some insurance companies have begun implementing [separate wind/hail deductibles](https://www.dicklawfirm.com/blog/2023/august/what-is-a-windstorm-deductible-/) or exclusions even in inland areas, particularly in regions with high tornado or hailstorm frequency. Review your policy declarations page carefully to confirm whether your standard coverage includes wind damage. If you discover wind/hail exclusions on your inland property, you'll need to purchase supplemental coverage, though this is much less common than in coastal regions.
### Coverage Assessment Factors
Several factors should guide your windstorm insurance decision beyond simple location requirements. Property value and construction type significantly impact vulnerability—high-value homes or those with older construction may warrant additional protection even when not strictly required. Local windstorm history, particularly recent severe events in your specific neighborhood, provides an important risk context. Financial considerations, including your ability to self-insure smaller wind damage through savings, influence whether optional coverage makes sense. Finally, risk tolerance—your personal comfort with potential uninsured losses—should factor into voluntary windstorm insurance decisions.
### Policy Details and Requirements
Windstorm insurance in Texas covers damage from hurricane-force winds, tropical storms, tornadoes, and other wind events. To qualify for coverage through TWIA in coastal areas, properties must meet specific building code requirements and pass windstorm inspections. Premiums vary significantly based on proximity to the coast, construction features, and coverage limits. Most policies implement percentage-based deductibles (typically 1-5% of dwelling coverage) rather than flat-dollar amounts. Unlike standard homeowners insurance, windstorm policies typically exclude non-wind water damage, creating potential coverage gaps during hurricane events that require separate flood insurance.
### Alternative Market Options
Beyond TWIA, Texas homeowners have increasing access to private market windstorm coverage. Surplus line carriers like Lloyd's of London offer windstorm policies, sometimes with more flexible terms or competitive pricing than TWIA. Some specialized regional insurers focus specifically on coastal property coverage with windstorm protection. Finally, the Texas FAIR Plan provides last-resort coverage, including wind protection for properties that are unable to secure insurance through standard markets, though typically at higher premium rates.
