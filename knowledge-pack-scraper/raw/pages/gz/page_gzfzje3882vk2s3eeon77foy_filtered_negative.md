Insurance costs aren't just about the dangers; they're also about the safeguards. Both Geico and Progressive provide discounts for safety features, like alarm systems, and for bundling with auto or [life insurance](https://comptonfinance.co.uk/discovering-the-most-reliable-life-insurance-companies-in). Higher deductibles can lower your annual premium, though it's vital to ensure you can meet this amount out-of-pocket if necessary.
