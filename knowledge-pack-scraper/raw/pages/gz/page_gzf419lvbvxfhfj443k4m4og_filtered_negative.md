# Illinois Statute of Limitations: Time Limits for Lawsuits
![Illinois statute of limitations](https://www.enjuris.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/statute-of-limitations-unsplash-jqxB3C0YNG0.webp)
The “[statute of limitations](https://www.enjuris.com/personal-injury-law/statute-of-limitations/)” is the legal term for—in simple words—a deadline. The statute of limitations is the time you have to file a lawsuit. It’s that simple. However, what’s _not_ simple is that each state has its own laws for statutes of limitations, and statutes of limitations vary based on the type of lawsuit.
The other intent of statutes of limitations is to protect a potential defendant from the perpetual threat of civil claims. The law allows a plaintiff ample time to [file a lawsuit](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/court-system-how-to-file-a-lawsuit/), but also provides closure for a defendant by giving a finite period in which to do so.
**Personal injury**: Two years from the date of the injury. This is also the statute of limitations for a [wrongful death lawsuit](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/wrongful-death-lawsuits/).
[**Product liability claims**](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/product-liability-laws/): These are generally two years from the date of the injury, but they could be 10 years from the date of the first sale, lease, or delivery of the product to the _initial user_. There are several exceptions in this instance, so you should consult an Illinois attorney if you’re considering a product liability lawsuit involving a product that’s more than two years old.
[**Premises liability claims**](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/premises-liability-laws/): The statute of limitations on a premises liability claim is generally two years. This includes [dog bites](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/premises-liability-laws/dog-bite-laws/), slip-and-fall accidents, injuries caused by inadequate maintenance or security, or any other claim related to a hazardous property condition.
[**Medical malpractice**](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/medical-malpractice-lawsuit-guide/): Two years from the date the patient became _aware_ of the injury, but no more than four years from the date the malpractice occurred.
The Illinois _[Discovery Rule](https://www.enjuris.com/blog/questions/what-is-the-discovery-rule/)_ allows an exception to the statute of limitations so the plaintiff may file a lawsuit within a certain time after they discover the injury (or reasonably should have discovered it), but not the date of the injury itself. This can happen in medical malpractice claims because of illnesses or conditions that don’t immediately have symptoms, surgical mistakes, etc. This can apply in lawsuits other than medical malpractice, as well.
[**Defamation**](https://www.enjuris.com/personal-injury-law/libel-slander-defamation/): One year.
[**Collection of rent**](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/landlord-tenant-laws/): Four years.
Illinois will allow a statute of limitations to “toll” if [the injured person is a minor](https://www.enjuris.com/illinois/child-accident-injury-laws/). That means the clock doesn’t begin to run until they turn 18; the injured person has two years from their 18th birthday in which to file a personal injury lawsuit.
Another exception to a statute of limitations is if the defendant is out of state or can’t be located. The statute of limitations could be paused until they’re found or return to the state. The purpose of this law is to prevent a defendant from avoiding a lawsuit by intentionally hiding or leaving the state. This is a _pause_ from the original date of the injury; the clock begins to run again when they’re found or return.
Therefore, if you suspect you might need to file a civil lawsuit in Illinois, you should [consult a personal injury attorney](https://www.enjuris.com/personal-injury-law/free-lawyer-consultation/) as soon as you can following your injury. Although statutes of limitations seem like a long time, the time goes fast—the legal process can be slow, attorneys are busy, and people can be hard to reach. Begin the process by consulting an [Illinois attorney](https://www.enjuris.com/directory/illinois/) right away for the highest likelihood of a successful outcome.
