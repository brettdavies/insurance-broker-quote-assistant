* ### Why doesn't this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  We make every effort to rate each company we review. However, we’re sometimes unable to provide a NerdWallet star rating for insurers that work with multiple third parties to underwrite their policies. That’s because the quality of the policy you get may vary depending on the coverage options, financial strength and other factors of each separate underwriting company.

## Progressive pet insurance plans and coverage

The plans available to you from Progressive depend on which third party insures your pet.

### Accident and illness coverage

The accident and illness plan from Pets Best typically covers the basics, including:

* Treatment for accidental injuries and for illnesses, including cancer.
* Emergency care.
* Hospitalization.
* Surgery.
* Diagnostic testing.
* Behavioral conditions.
* Prosthetic devices and wheelchairs.
* Euthanasia.

Prescription medication coverage is also included by default in most plans, but you may be able to opt out by contacting Pets Best.

You can upgrade a Pets Best accident and illness plan to include:

* Exam fees.
* Acupuncture and chiropractic care.
* Physical therapy and hydrotherapy.

Companion Protect also offers an accident and illness plan, which is similar but includes a few different types of coverage. It can pay for:

* Diagnostic testing.
* Medication.
* Euthanasia and cremation or burial.

### Accident-only coverage

Progressive's accident-only plan is available from Pets Best. It helps pay for issues like broken bones, bite wounds or injuries that occur if your pet swallows a foreign object. Though it covers accidental injuries, it won’t pay for treatment if your pet gets sick.

### Wellness plans

Progressive offers wellness coverage through both Pets Best and Companion Protect.

Pets Best offers two tiers of wellness coverage that you can add to an accident and illness policy. The EssentialWellness plan helps you pay for:

* Wellness exams.
* Microchipping.

* Heartworm, flea and tick preventive medication.
* Deworming.

The BestWellness plan covers everything the EssentialWellness plan does, though it pays more. It can also pay for:

* Vaccinations.
* Flea, tick and heartworm preventives.
* Vitamin supplements.
* Routine tests and bloodwork.

## Progressive plan options

Options may vary based on your pet, where you live and which company underwrites your policy.

### Deductibles

A [pet insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/pet-insurance-deductible) is the amount you have to pay before your plan reimburses you for vet expenses. Progressive and Pets Best accident-only plans generally have a $250 deductible. Accident and illness plan deductibles from Pets Best range from $50 to $1,000. Companion Protect accident and illness plans have deductible options of $250, $500 or $1,000.

Like most pet insurers, both companies apply the deductible on an annual basis, rather than per claim.

### Reimbursement amounts

The Pets Best accident-only plan will typically reimburse 90% of your vet bills once you’ve met your deductible. Pets Best can pay 70%, 80% or 90% of vet bills with its accident and illness plan. Companion Protect offers reimbursement rates between 50% and 90%.

### Coverage limits

## Restrictions and waiting periods

**Age restrictions:** Pets under 7 weeks old aren’t eligible for Pets Best coverage, but the company has no upper age limit.  For Companion Protect accident and illness policies, the minimum age is 8 weeks for both dogs and cats. Dogs are eligible up to 10 years old and cats up to 12 years old. There are no age restrictions for Companion Protect wellness plans.

**Waiting periods:** A [pet insurance waiting period](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/pet-insurance-waiting-periods) is the time between when you buy your policy and when your coverage starts. Waiting periods may vary by state.

## Where Progressive pet insurance is available

Between Pets Best and Companion Protect, Progressive can find you a pet insurance plan in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Availability may change at any time. Coverage may not be available to all pets in a given state.

## Online tools

**Progressive:** Progressive’s website gives you basic information about the types of pet insurance plans available. If you want to get a quote or buy a policy, it will take you to either Pets Best or Companion Protect. (There’s no way to choose which company you get online.)

**Pets Best:** The Pets Best mobile app is available in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The app lets you submit claims and see information about your pet’s benefits. You can also file claims and make policy changes by logging into the Pets Best website.

**Companion Protect:** If you get a Companion Protect policy through Progressive, you’ll manage your policy through an online portal. Companion Protect doesn’t have a mobile app.

## Claims

If you have a Pets Best policy, you can submit claims on the company’s mobile app or website, or by email, fax or mail. Pets Best will need to see your paid invoice when you submit a claim. You can easily snap a photo and submit it using the app. Pet parents also have the option of requesting that Pets Best pay their vet directly.

If you have a Companion Protect plan, you’ll file claims through an online portal.

Pets Best and Companion Protect calculate your reimbursement slightly differently. Pets Best applies your reimbursement percentage to your vet bill before the deductible. That results in a slightly lower claim payout than you’d get from Companion Protect, which applies the deductible first.

Say your cat needed a $2,500 surgery and you have an 80% reimbursement level and a $500 deductible. Here’s how each company would reimburse you.

**How Pets Best calculates claim payouts: Reimbursement rate first**

* $2,500 vet bill x 0.8 (80% reimbursement rate) = $2,000.
* $2,000 - $500 deductible = $1,500 reimbursement.

**How much you pay:** $1,000.

**How Companion Protect calculate claim payouts: Deductible first**

* $2,500 vet bill - $500 deductible = $2,000.
* $2,000 x 0.8 (80% reimbursement rate) = $1,600 reimbursement.

**How much you pay:** $900.

## How to contact customer service

**Pets Best:** Customer service representatives are available at 877-738-7237 Monday through Saturday. There’s also a live chat service for customer support. For questions about your pet, you can access the 24/7 emergency vet helpline through the app or your online account.

**Companion Protect:** You can reach Companion Protect at ProgressivePet-service@petscovered.com or 888-546-8945. Representatives are available Monday through Saturday. You can also reach out via live chat through your customer portal.
