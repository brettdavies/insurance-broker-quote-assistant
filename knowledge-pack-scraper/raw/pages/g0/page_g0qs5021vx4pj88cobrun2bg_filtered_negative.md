1. [![Step 1 How building class is determined:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/07/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
* Exterior bearing walls
* Interior bearing walls
* Exterior nonbearing walls and partitions
* Interior non-bearing walls and partitions
* Floor construction, including supporting beams and joists
* Roof construction, including supporting beams and joists, are comprised of
* **“Minimum” rule**: It is important to remember when selecting the construction class that the building is only as strong as its weakest element. For example, a masonry building may have an unprotected wood roof. The wood roof is the weakest member such that it has **no** fire-resistance. Thus, the construction class would be Joisted Masonry (see below). Now imagine this same building with a metal deck roof. So long as the supporting members of the building do not contain wood then this building would be Masonry Noncombustible (see below).

[![Step 2 What to ask:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
3. [![Step 3 Building classes:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f2/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
4. [![Step 4 International Building Code \(IBC\) versus Insurance Services Office \(ISO\):](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
These are two major sources identifying construction types, both of which will be addressed in the construction types outlined below. ISO is traditionally what insurance companies use to denote type, whereas IBC is what architects and builders use.[[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#_note-1) X Research source [](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type) While one company may use ISO classifications, many submission documents may reference IBC classifications and it is important to be able to convert this to an ISO classification. (There have been situations where a frame building has been incorrectly classified as fire resistive because the submittal was read incorrectly!) The following explains what is expected under both:
* **A is protected**, meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have an additional fire rated coating or cover by means of sheetrock, spray on, or other approved method. The additional fire rated coating or cover extends the fire resistance of the structural members by at least 1 hour.
* **B is unprotected**, meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have no additional fire rated coating or cover. Exposed members are only fire resistant according to their natural ability, characteristics, and fire rating.

* Masonry veneer (brick veneer)- Masonry veneer is thin layers of brick, stone, or stucco, used for appearance purposes rather than structural support.
* Metal clad - A building with a metal exterior wall may not look like frame construction, but when the metal skin is attached to wood studs and joists, ISO classifies the building as frame.
* Metal walls or floors sheathed with combustible materials
* Metal floors or roofs with combustible insulation or ceiling material attached to the underside or within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of horizontal supports
* Composite assemblies of noncombustible materials with combustible materials

* gypsum wallboard

* **Ceilings protecting steel beams or joists**: What happens when there is no fire-protection material applied to steel beams or joists that support floors or roofs? ISO still considers a building modified fire resistive if it has a _suitable ceiling_. Ceilings can be plaster or gypsum wallboard or suspended mineral tile. The entire floor-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting a floor) or roof-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting roof supports) should conform to construction details in a UL-listed or Factory Mutual (FM)-approved design. ISO individually evaluates each approved design.
