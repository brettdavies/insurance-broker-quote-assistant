## How To Bundle Home & Auto Insurance In Florida

Here are five steps to bundling your auto and home insurance easily and efficiently:

### Determine Your Coverage Needs

The first step in bundling your home and auto insurance is understanding your coverage needs. You’ll need to assess the value of your home and car, the level of protection you require, and any specific [coverage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/definition/51/coverage) needs based on your location or personal circumstances. This initial evaluation is crucial to ensure you get a bundle that provides adequate protection.

1

### Gather Information About Your Home And Vehicle

Once you’ve determined your coverage needs, gather all the necessary information about your home and vehicle. This includes details like the age and condition of your home, security features installed, the make and model of your car, your driving history, among other relevant details. Insurance companies will use this information to provide accurate quotes.

2

### Compare Quotes From Different Insurers

After gathering all the necessary information, start shopping for quotes from different insurers. You can do this either online or by contacting an insurance agent. It’s important to get quotes from multiple companies to ensure you’re getting the best deal. When comparing, pay attention not only to the price but also to the coverage details and any exclusions.

3

### Review Each Offer Thoroughly

Once you have several quotes, take the time to review each offer thoroughly. Look at the coverage details, deductibles, policy limits, and any additional benefits offered as part of the bundle. Also, consider the company’s reputation, customer service record, and claim handling process.

4

### Make Your Purchase

After reviewing all offers and deciding which bundle best suits your needs, it’s time to make the purchase. Be sure to read the policy documents carefully before signing anything. After purchasing, keep all your insurance documents in a safe place, and remember to review your policies annually to ensure they still meet your needs.

## When To Consider Bundling Your Florida Insurance

There are a few times to consider bundling your Florida insurance.

### To Get Savings

The biggest benefit obviously comes from the savings including:

1. The discount for bundling
2. The savings from one deductible in an event that affects home and auto
3. The savings from 12-month car insurance policies instead of 6-month policies

It’s important to compare not just the percentage you get in terms of your discounts but what your premiums are for the coverage you get.

For example:

Travelers charges $1,100 for homeowners insurance and $2,600 for car insurance equaling $3,700 each year in separate policy premiums. With the 11% discount, you might pay around $3,300 each year instead.

By comparison, Allstate which has the highest discounts might charge $2,700 on average for your homeowners insurance premium and $5,500 on average for your car insurance premium equaling $8,200 per year. With a 25% discount that still brings the annual costs to around $6,150.

So while Florida residents can get the biggest discount from Allstate, the biggest savings comes from Travelers.

### To Get Support

Another time to consider bundling your Florida insurance is when you want to get better support. It can be much easier to manage multiple insurance products like boat insurance, homeowners insurance, and car insurance from a single location, through a single agent, and with a single insurance portal.

## When Not To Consider Bundling Your Insurance In Florida

There are two key drawbacks to bundling your insurance in Florida: you may not find the specialized coverage you need and you might not get savings as high as you would with separate policies.

### Specialized Coverage

One of the biggest drawbacks to bundling your insurance in Florida is that you may not find the type of plan you need. Not all of the same coverage is available under bundled packages and if you find a worthwhile discount from one company, they may not provide the specialized coverage you need for your home.

In Florida, in particular, there is a need for specialized coverage extending to flood damage and other hurricane related incidents. Not all providers who offer bundling discounts will offer that coverage.

### Separate Savings

For some people, the savings that are provided by bundling may not be as high as the average across the state. For example, one customer might only save 2% on their current car insurance policy and 12% on their homeowners insurance, but that amounts to a total of 14% in savings whereas keeping separate policies gives them a total of 17% in savings.

There are plenty of ways to get discounts on home or car insurance and shopping around for separate policies might give you a better combination of discounts depending on your circumstances.

## FAQs

### Does auto insurance affect home insurance?

If you have a history of claims on one policy it can affect the premiums for another but the right type of bundling can offer substantial discounts to overcome this.

### Can I bundle something other than home and auto insurance?

Yes. Home and auto insurance are the most commonly bundled Insurance products but you can get a multi policy discount when you combine things like homeowners insurance with motorcycle insurance, RV or boat insurance with car insurance, or any other option in between depending on providers.

### Is it a good idea for me to bundle home and auto insurance in Florida?

It makes sense to do so if it reduces your premiums and gives you the coverage you need. Always take the time to compare prices from different providers, what you would get for a bundled policy versus separate policies, and the type of coverage that you need.
