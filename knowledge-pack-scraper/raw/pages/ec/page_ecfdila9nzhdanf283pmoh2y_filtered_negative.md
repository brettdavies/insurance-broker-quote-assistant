**An unfair act or practice cannot be reasonably avoided by consumers if it interferes with their ability to make decisions** or take action to avoid injury. An example here would be when a seller modifies the price of a product or withholds the price until after the consumer commits to the purchase. In this case, the consumer cannot reasonably avoid the injury.
_All three prongs of the definition must be met. The statute also notes that public policy, as established by statute, regulation, or judicial decisions, can be considered along with the evidence and used to determine whether an act or practice is unfair._
**The 4 “P’s” of the FTC: How to Identify Something That “Misleads”
**The FTC applies a four-part test to determine whether an act or practice can be considered misleading under the law.
* **Prominence:** Is the statement prominent enough for consumers to notice?
* **Presentation:** Is the information easy to understand and presented in a way that doesn’t contradict other information, and when the consumer is not distracted?
Essentially, whether an act or practice is deceptive depends on **how a** **reasonable target audience member would interpret the representation in question.** It may still be considered deceptive if the majority of the target audience doesn’t share the plaintiff’s interpretation. The act or practice can still be regarded as deceptive if a significant minority of such consumers is misled.
Additionally, if a seller’s representation conveys more than one meaning (to reasonable consumers), and one of those meanings is false, the seller may be liable for the misleading interpretation. Exaggerated claims or “puffery” are _not_ deceptive if a reasonable consumer would not take the claims seriously. Saying “This car flies like a jet,” for example, would not be misleading, as it is a fantastic or unrealistic claim.

_Note: If the unfair or deceptive action more closely resembles a breach of contract, courts have found that the statute of limitations typically runs from the date of the breach._
