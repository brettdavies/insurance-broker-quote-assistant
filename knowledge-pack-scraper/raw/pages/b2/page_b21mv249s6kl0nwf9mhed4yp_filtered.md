Progressive — the [second-largest U.S. auto insurer](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-insurance-company-rankings) by market share — stands out as a potentially favorable option for Phoenix drivers with infractions on their records, specifically those who may be considered high-risk drivers. The company's telematics program, [Snapshot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/), monitors driving habits and may reward safe drivers with discounted premiums. However, Snapshot could generate higher rates if it detects poor driving habits. With a variety of endorsements available, including [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/) and accident forgiveness, Progressive provides a range of options to tailor your policy to your needs. The "Name Your Price" tool might also simplify the process of shopping for a new policy by allowing drivers to compare rates easily. It's worth noting, though, that Progressive's customer and claims satisfaction scores are below average per J.D. Power.

Geico offers competitive premiums to many Phoenix drivers, potentially positioning itself as a leading choice for drivers seeking affordability. The insurer's broad array of discounts caters to safe drivers, federal employees, military personnel and those with vehicles equipped with certain safety features, which could lead to significant savings on premiums. Furthermore, Geico's [DriveEasy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/geico-driveeasy/) telematics program might be appealing, as it can reward safe driving behaviors (but can lead to higher rates for poor driving). For tech-savvy customers, the convenience of managing policies through a highly rated mobile app and online portal may add to Geico's appeal. While Geico does not offer gap insurance, its competitive rates and extensive discounts could make it an attractive option for those prioritizing cost-effective, basic coverage.

State Farm distinguishes itself in Phoenix through its emphasis on personalized service, facilitated by its extensive network of local agents. As the [largest car insurance provider](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the U.S. by market share, State Farm's reputation for exceptional customer service is reflected in its above-average customer satisfaction ranking in the Southwest region in the latest J.D. Power auto insurance study. This acclaim extends to its [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) and [digital tools](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), highlighting the insurer's commitment to a seamless customer experience. While State Farm's premiums may be on the higher side, the value it offers through personalized service and the convenience of local agencies could be particularly appealing for those who prioritize direct interactions and support. However, the absence of accident forgiveness as an option for customers without long-standing relationships with the insurer (less than nine years) and its above-average rates in Phoenix suggest that State Farm's offerings might be more suited to those who value service quality over the lowest possible rates.

Travelers stands out in Phoenix for its comprehensive coverage options, including new car replacement, [accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/) and gap insurance, making it a compelling choice for drivers seeking to craft a well-rounded policy. The availability of [non-owner policies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/non-owner/) is an added benefit, catering to those who frequently rent or borrow vehicles but don't own one themselves. Despite offering lower-than-average rates in Phoenix and having numerous offices across the state for convenience, potential customers might want to consider the company's tech capabilities before committing. Android users who prefer managing their insurance through a mobile app may be wary of reported technical issues on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.travelers.digitalservice&gl=US). Although Travelers has the lowest third-party customer satisfaction ranking in the 2024 J.D. Power Study, its extensive coverage offerings could make it an ideal match for those prioritizing coverage options over service scores.

Nationwide has earned a spot on the list of preferred car insurance providers in Phoenix due to its innovative approach to savings and policy customization. The insurer's telematics programs, SmartMiles and SmartRide, offer unique opportunities for savings, catering respectively to [drivers with lower-than-average mileage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/pay-per-mile-insurance/) and those with safe driving habits. Additionally, the [On Your Side Review](https://www.nationwide.com/personal/insurance/policy-reviews/) offers a valuable opportunity for policyholders to engage with Nationwide agents in a comprehensive policy review at no extra cost, potentially uncovering additional savings avenues. Nationwide's broad portfolio of options, including accident forgiveness and vanishing deductible, might add to its appeal. However, the limited availability of its customer service contact center and below-average scores in the digital experience shopping category may be considerations for those who prioritize around-the-clock support and a seamless virtual experience.

Minimum coverage requirements in Phoenix

In Phoenix, as in the rest of Arizona, drivers are required to carry a [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/). These minimum coverage requirements include:

* $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person in an accident
* $50,000 for bodily injury or death of two or more persons in an accident
* $15,000 for damage to others’ property

This is often referred to as [25/50/15 coverage limits](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/arizona-car-insurance-laws/). While minimum-required coverage provides a fundamental level of financial protection against bodily injuries and property damage that a driver might cause in an accident, it may not fully cover all expenses. For instance, the costs associated with severe accidents can quickly exceed these limits, leaving the driver responsible for any additional expenses.

Furthermore, minimum coverage does not help pay to repair or replace the driver’s own vehicle in the case of damage or theft, nor does it cover medical expenses for the driver or passengers. Drivers in Phoenix might consider opting for higher coverage limits or additional coverage types like [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/) to protect their finances.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
