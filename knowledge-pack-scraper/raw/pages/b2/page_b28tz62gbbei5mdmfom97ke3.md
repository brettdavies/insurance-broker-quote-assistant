Have you or a loved one been [involved in a car accident](https://www.levinperconti.com/car-accidents/)? If so, you may wonder how auto insurance comes into play. In brief, Illinois is defined as a fault car insurance state. What this means is that the person who is found to be at fault for causing the car accident has to compensate people who were injured, or property damage, arising out of the car accident. Normally, in Illinois, the car insurance carrier of the at-fault driver will pay for these costs. There are various car insurance requirements in Illinois.
**Illinois’ Car Insurance Requirements**
If you live in Illinois and have a registered motor vehicle in Illinois, the following laws/requirements apply to you. First of all, you, as a driver, must carry at least $20,000 in insurance coverage to cover for injury or death of a person involved in an auto accident (this includes yourself as well as others.)
Second, you, as a driver, must carry at least $40,000 in insurance coverage to cover for injury or death of more than one person involved in an auto accident. Third, you, as a driver, must carry $15,000 in insurance coverage for property damage incurred in an auto accident.
Please note that these required amounts are the bare _minimums_. It is highly recommended that you purchase additional coverage. Why is this? Well, if you are found to be the at-fault driver in a car accident, and if the amount of damages exceeds your amount of coverage, you will most likely be held personally liable for the excess amount.
**Uninsured Motorist Coverage**
In Illinois, your car insurance policy _must_ have uninsured motorist coverage (UIM). In short, your UIM coverage helps you when you are in an accident with an uninsured motorist. In other words, if the at fault driver does not have car insurance, instead of seeking compensation from his or her insurance carrier, you will seek compensation from your UIM coverage. It works similar to a backup plan or a safety net for coverage.
Illinois law requires that your UIM coverage have limits equal to your Bodily Injury Liability Coverage. Nevertheless, you may select a lower limit. If you do select a lower limit, this selection must be expressed in writing. In addition, per Illinois law, the lowest UIM coverage allowed is $20,000 per person or $40,000 per accident.
When you seek compensation from your UIM coverage, the coverage includes injuries you incurred, injuries your relative (who lives with you) incurred, injuries of anyone driving your vehicle with your permission, or injuries of anyone riding in a vehicle with you.
**Take Action and hire an Attorney**
If you or your loved one are the victim of an auto accident at the fault of another driver, it is imperative that you contact an experienced personal injury attorney. Such an attorney will not only provide you with an ease of mind, but will help establish your case and will ensure that your case is timely filed pursuant to Illinois’ statute of limitations.

#### Client Testimonials
**I want to send my heartfelt thanks to John Perconti and the Levin & Perconti staff in taking our case.**   
  
Not only were they so professional but also so caring and thoughtful. It was very difficult going over the facts in our mother's case but they were so compassionate and understanding and allowed us to be with them every step of the way. We were able to sit in on the depositions and we were really able to see how hard they worked on our behalf. 
M.R.Z., Nursing Home Client
**Margaret, Daisy and Bryan. This magnificent cohesive team led by Margaret represented us for my mom's nursing home wrongful death case.**   
  
They were most patient and responded timely to many questions throughout the entire process. All demonstrated professionalism and extensive knowledge of case and state laws. Their in-depth investigative work uncovered details which were unknown to us and yet sadly confirmed our suspicions. We would recommend the Levin and Perconti Law firm and especially this team. 
Kathy and Ron
**Mr. Levin, Mr. Perconti and the firm handled a medical malpractice suit for my family.**   
  
During that time, my family and I suffered the loss of my mother. Mr. Levin and Mr. Peconti were more than just our lawyers. Words can’t really express our gratitude. My family and I will always be grateful for the compassion that they showed us. I want to thank you for what you did for my family, and for always being there for us. 
W.R., Medical Malpractice Client
**Our deepest appreciation to the law firm of Levin & Perconti, and in particular to Margaret Battersby Black, in the handling of the lawsuit we field n behalf of our sister who sustained life-threatening injuries as a nursing home resident.**   
  
Margaret’s representation, guidance, and professionalism gave us the sense that we could put our trust in Levin & Perconti and the final outcome proved that to be true. 
D.G., Nursing Home Client
**I want to send my heartfelt thanks to John Perconti and the Levin & Perconti staff in taking our case.**   
  
Not only were they so professional but also so caring and thoughtful. It was very difficult going over the facts in our mother's case but they were so compassionate and understanding and allowed us to be with them every step of the way. We were able to sit in on the depositions and we were really able to see how hard they worked on our behalf. 
M.R.Z., Nursing Home Client
**Margaret, Daisy and Bryan. This magnificent cohesive team led by Margaret represented us for my mom's nursing home wrongful death case.**   
  
They were most patient and responded timely to many questions throughout the entire process. All demonstrated professionalism and extensive knowledge of case and state laws. Their in-depth investigative work uncovered details which were unknown to us and yet sadly confirmed our suspicions. We would recommend the Levin and Perconti Law firm and especially this team. 
Kathy and Ron
