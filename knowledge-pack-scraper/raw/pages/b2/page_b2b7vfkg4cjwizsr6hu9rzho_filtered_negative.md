Customers may be drawn to Progressive because it makes shopping for coverage easy, offers in-person support from more than 38,000 agents, and has rates on par with its competitors. But imperfect customer service ratings are worth paying attention to before you apply for coverage.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
Keep reading to learn more about Progressive’s pros, cons, and coverage options so you can decide whether this insurer will meet your auto insurance needs. Even if you’re set on Progressive, [**comparing multiple insurers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) is the best way to find the cheapest coverage.

While its customer reviews are better in some markets than others, the insurer generally comes in just below average in terms of customer satisfaction in J.D. Power studies.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1) Progressive does have a fairly positive National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index score of 0.89, which signals a lower-than-average number of complaints for a company of its size.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-2)

* **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent 350 hours developing the [**Insurify Quality (IQ) Score**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. Criteria are weighted by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
The Alameda County District Attorney filed suit against Progressive Corporation and its affiliates, alleging that software improprieties allowed Progressive to make lowball settlement offers.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-3)
Progressive offers [**liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) for an average of $101 per month and [**full coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/) for $173 per month.
No matter the insurer, drivers with [**clean records**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) typically secure the cheapest rates. Drivers with an incident on their record, such as a [**speeding ticket**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/), an [**at-fault accident**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), or a [**DUI**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/), experience higher rates. Insurance companies consider high-risk drivers to be more likely to file a claim and charge higher rates to make up for the possible financial loss.
Similarly, [**teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) pay high rates because they’re more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors and they have less experience behind the wheel. [**Senior drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) pay the lowest rates because they have the most experience.

[**Insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) reduce costs and allow drivers to get lower rates and save on coverage. Comparing discounts is as important as comparing rates. An insurer that offers more discounts may end up providing lower premiums overall than one that charges a lower base rate but offers fewer opportunities to save.

In J.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, Progressive was below the industry average in every region, receiving strong ratings on only usage-based insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
Progressive’s Trustpilot rating is 1.8 of 5 stars, and the insurer has an A rating from the Better Business Bureau but 1.07 out of 5 stars.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-4)[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-5)
Its A+ AM Best Rating — assigned by a leading credit-rating agency operating within the insurance industry — demonstrates Progressive’s financial stability.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-6) But customer service issues are revealed when reviewing ratings from J.D. Power, a consumer intelligence company.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
Progressive has a decent score from the NAIC, which indicates a lower number of complaints than the average.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-2)

Every state sets minimum auto insurance requirements, which typically include bodily injury and property damage liability insurance. Some states also require other coverages, including [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) (PIP) and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/).
With [**collision insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/), any crash-related losses are covered no matter who was to blame.
[**Comprehensive insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) covers any losses not from a crash, such as hitting a tree, bad weather, vandalism, or theft.
Progressive provides [**roadside assistance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-roadside-assistance/) to get up and running after a vehicle breakdown.
When a car is being repaired after a covered loss, Progressive will pay for a [**rental car**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/rental-car-insurance/).
Policyholders can get their medical bills paid or funeral costs covered using [**medical payments coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/).
Motorists using their cars to drive for [**Uber, Lyft, or similar services**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/rideshare-drivers/) need this add-on, as personal car insurance policies won’t usually cover business use of a vehicle.
Small [**accident forgiveness**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/accident-forgiveness/) is available immediately and protects against premium increases for claims under $500. Large accident forgiveness won’t count larger claims against you, but it’s available only if you’ve been an accident-free Progressive customer for five years before any at-fault accidents.
* **Condo insurance:**[**Condo insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/condo-insurance/) covers owners against liability and damage to the unit or property inside.
* **Homeowners insurance:**[**Homeowners policies**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) cover the dwelling, other structures, personal property inside the home, and homeowner liability.
* **Motorcycle insurance:**[**Motorcycle insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/motorcycle-insurance-cost/)
* **Renters insurance:**[**Renters insurance**](https://insurify.com/renters-insurance/) offers liability coverage and damage coverage for personal property inside a rental home.
* ### Is Progressive legitimate?
Yes, Progressive is legitimate. It’s the second-largest auto insurer by market share in the United States, and it has a Superior A+ rating from AM Best, a trusted financial-rating agency.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-6)
* ### What is the average cost of Progressive car insurance?
* ### Is Progressive good at paying claims?
Progressive’s A+ Rating with AM Best demonstrates that the insurer has the money and financial strength to pay claims.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-6) But customers aren’t always satisfied with the claims process. Progressive ranks below average in J.D. Power’s claims satisfaction survey.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
* ### Does Progressive raise rates after six months?
* ### How do you cancel your Progressive insurance policy?
