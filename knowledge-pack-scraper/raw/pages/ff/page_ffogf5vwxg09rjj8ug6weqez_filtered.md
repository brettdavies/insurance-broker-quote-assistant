# Car insurance for teens

Getting car insurance for young drivers can be pricey due to their lack of driving experience. In most cases, it's more affordable to add your licensed or permitted teenage driver to your existing auto insurance policy. Your policy's coverages and limits will extend to your teen driver, and some insurers, including Progressive, offer discounts to help offset the cost of insuring a new driver.

## Do you have to add your teenage driver to your insurance?

A teenage driver must have car insurance in almost every state. You can add them to your policy, or you can put them on a separate policy. Buying a standalone policy for a teenager can be expensive due to their lack of driving experience and a higher likelihood of accidents, so it's usually more affordable to add a young driver to your existing policy.

Adding your teen to your policy could lower costs due to the rate you've earned as a longtime driver with an established driving history. Here are a few more reasons why it's usually best to add a young adult driver to your car insurance policy:

1. Control

   Since you already own the policy, you can easily add and update coverages to make sure your teen driver has the right protection.
2. Flexibility

   If your household has multiple vehicles, your teenager will be insured to drive all of them.
3. Convenience

   You'll only have to manage one policy.

## How much does it cost to add a teenage driver to your insurance?

According to Forbes Advisor analysis, it costs [$2,735 a year](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) to add a 16-year-old to a parent's car insurance, which is about $230 extra per month. [Teenagers are more likely to be involved in an accident](https://www.cdc.gov/teen-drivers/risk-factors/index.html), so their rates are generally more expensive than an experienced driver with a safe driving history. While the extra costs might sound like a lot, it's generally cheaper to add a teen driver to an existing policy than buying a separate policy.

Pro tip:

A separate policy is rarely the cheaper option for a young driver, but there may be a few exceptions. For example, if you drive a luxury vehicle or an [expensive sports car](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insuring-sports-exotic-cars/) and your teen isn't going to drive it, it may be cheaper for them to have a separate policy. Talk to your insurer to fully weigh your options.

## How does coverage work if you add a teen to your insurance?

If you add your teen driver to your car insurance policy, they'll benefit from the same protection that you do. All covered drivers have access to all cars listed on the policy, and the liability limits are the same for all drivers on the policy. Teen drivers pose a greater risk of accidents, so you may want to consider increasing your liability limits on the policy, especially if your current limits aren't covering your entire net worth. Learn more about [liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/).

All extra coverages on the policy will also apply to your teen, including [roadside assistance](https://www.progressive.com/claims/roadside-assistance/), [loan/lease payoff](https://www.progressive.com/answers/gap-insurance/), [rental car reimbursement](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rental-car-reimbursement-coverage/), and [disappearing deductibles](https://www.progressive.com/answers/disappearing-deductible/).

## How much is car insurance for teens and new drivers?

A separate car insurance policy for teen drivers can be expensive because they have a greater tendency to drive distracted, speed, tailgate, and not wear a seatbelt. The average cost of teen car insurance, however, will vary based on the exact age of the driver, their ZIP code, driving history, and vehicle type. You can find [cheap car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/cheap-car-insurance/) for teenagers that covers the essentials and fits your budget. Discover the [factors that impact car insurance rates](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-car-insurance-cost/).

At Progressive, rates drop by an average of 8% when a driver turns 19 and another 6% at 21. As your teenager becomes more experienced and avoids tickets and accidents, the price for teen auto insurance should keep decreasing. Here's a look at how insurance rates may change over time based on a driver's age group (percentages reflect changes in rate from the previous age group).

| Age | Rate & change |
| --- | --- |
| 14-17 | Rate & change$247.28 |
| 18 | Rate & change$271.92 (+10%) |
| 19-20 | Rate & change$242.40 (-11%) |
