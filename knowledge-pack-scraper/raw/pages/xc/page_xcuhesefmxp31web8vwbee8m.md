#  Insurance Brokers still a thing? 
Are Insurance Brokers still a thing? I'm shopping to swap my companies for auto/home and life insurance and everything compare tool online feels like it's selling my info or a paid add. 
Do independent brokers still exist? I'd love to pay someone who doesn't get a kickback for me chosing their preferred carrier.

After exhaustive searching, I went with Piedmont group on the recommendation of the nova subreddit. I haven't had to use it, but I got a much better deal than GEICO

I used Preferred Insurance in Fairfax. I think they do exclusively or possibly majority Erie Insurance. My car insurance dropped by more than half versus Geico and the Home Owners and Umbrella were cheaper than Geico by a significant margin. 
I had shopped for insurance like a year before I went with Erie and Geico beat the others for car insurance by a wide margin and I was shocked by how much cheaper Erie was. My parents have used them for years and loved them and never had an issue with them.

Yes! I am one (but I’m not suggesting you call me, I work in the commercial insurance department). I recommend an internet search for “independent insurance agents near me”.

Awesome! How exactly do y'all get paid? I assume some sort of fee? A commission or kickback seems like it would be counter to the idea of independent? 
What should I expect to spend?

Commission. It’s a percentage of the total premium and the commission percentage varies from one company to another and it varies based on the type of policy (home, auto, umbrella, etc.). Our agency’s practice is to always do what’s best for the customer (considering pricing and coverage needs), not to consider our commission in where we place coverage. I’ve only ever worked at one agency (10+ years), so I can’t compare how other agents handle it, but I imagine most would take the same view—do what’s best for the customer. 
The “independent” part comes from the fact that we represent multiple carriers and are not a captive agent. Captive agents primarily write for one carrier.

The agent will ask for your name, address, drivers license number, possibly social security number, a list of claims from the last 3 years, information on any tickets you’ve received, vehicle information (year, make, model, VIN), desired coverage limits, current coverage limits, information on other drivers in your household (whether or not they drive your car), proof of separate insurance for people in your household that don’t have access to your car.
