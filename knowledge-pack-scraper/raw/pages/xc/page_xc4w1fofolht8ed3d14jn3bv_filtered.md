## Other Ways to Save on Car Insurance

However, discounts aren't the only way to reduce your rates and get affordable auto insurance. Some other great [hacks to save money on your car insurance](https://clearsurance.com/blog/6-hacks-to-save-money-on-your-car-insurance-rates) include:

* **Dropping Unnecessary Coverages:** Review your add-on coverages carefully. You may no longer need some coverage on older vehicles.
* **Raising Deductibles:** If you feel comfortable raising your [insurance deductibles](https://clearsurance.com/blog/what-is-an-insurance-deductible), your insurance company will lower rates as its financial responsibility is reduced.
* **Comparison Shopping:** The company you are with may no longer offer the best deal. Every few years, make sure to get quotes and shop around.

It is also easier to score cheap auto insurance coverage if you are a low-risk driver. Generally, this means that you have a clean driving record, drive a safe car, and live in a low-risk area.
