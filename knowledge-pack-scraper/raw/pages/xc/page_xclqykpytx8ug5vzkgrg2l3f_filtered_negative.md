##  What Is Commercial Insurance?
##  Understanding the Function of Commercial Insurance
Commercial policies are different from [personal lines insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-insurance-lines.asp) because they protect a business, not an individual.
##  Exploring Different Types of Commercial Insurance
###  An Overview of Commercial General Liability Insurance
###  Understanding Professional Liability Insurance
###  Insights Into Commercial Property Insurance
[Property insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property-insurance.asp) is designed for businesses with significant physical property, such as equipment, signage, inventory, and furniture. It protects the business from losses in events such as fire, storm or theft. Property insurance can cover, for example, damage to things like inventory, computers, furniture, or signage.
###  Insurance Considerations for Home-Based Businesses
If you're operating a [home-based business](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120815/licenses-and-permits-you-need-your-homebased-business.asp), you will likely need additional coverage for equipment and inventory. Standard homeowner’s policies don’t typically cover home-based businesses like commercial property insurance covers businesses. You can add home-based business insurance to a homeowner's policy as a rider for a small amount of coverage for equipment and a small amount of liability coverage.
###  The Essentials of Product Liability Insurance
Product liability insurance is designed for businesses that are involved with products, such as manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and retailers. Product liability insurance protects a business from costs associated with damages caused by products, such as a defective product causing bodily injury or harm. Without product liability insurance, a business can be vulnerable to paying for expensive lawsuits.
###  Key Points About Business Vehicle Insurance
###  Navigating Business Interruption Insurance
[Business interruption (or continuation) policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-interruption-insurance.asp) are a type of insurance that is especially applicable to companies that have physical locations, such as retail stores or manufacturing facilities.
Business interruption insurance [compensates a business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-profits-insurance.asp) for its lost income due to events that cause a disruption to the normal course of business. It's typically added as a rider to a property insurance policy or as part of a business owner's policy. Policies may also include a [civil authority provision](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/civil-authority-clause.asp) that details compensation in the event of a government action that closes the business.
