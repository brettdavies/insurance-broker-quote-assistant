Why You Can Trust Forbes Advisor
We analyzed car insurance costs for a wide variety of ages and driver profiles. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate insurance companies so all companies are measured equally. Advertisers do not and cannot influence our ratings. You can read more about our [editorial guidelines](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/about-us/#editorial_policies) and the [methodology](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/average-cost-of-car-insurance/#methodology_section) for the rates below.

* Unbiased editorial teams.
* 108 years of insurance experience on the editorial team.
## How Much Is Car Insurance?
**The national average cost for car insurance is $2,149 per year**, according to our analysis. This rate is for [full coverage car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheapest-full-coverage-car-insurance/), which includes optional coverage for theft and damage to your vehicle from a collision and other non-crash events, such as a fire or flooding.
Drivers with the [minimum amount of liability car insurance required](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/minimum-required-in-state/) by their state pay an average of $631 per year. Liability insurance pays only the damage or injuries you cause to others in an auto accident.
## Average Car Insurance Rates by State
[Car insurance rates by state](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rates-by-state/) vary because where you live factors into costs. For instance, car insurance companies look at the number of claims in your area and how much they cost—including claims from accidents, theft and weather damage.
The [minimum car insurance requirements](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/minimum-required-in-state/) also vary by state. If you move, higher limits or more coverage types may be mandated in your new state.

## How Much Does Car Insurance Cost by Age?
The average cost of car insurance is $6,192 a year for an 18-year-old driver, based on our research. It’s $2,275 a year for a 30-year-old and $1,871 a year for a 60-year-old for full coverage.
[Car insurance for teen drivers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-teens/) is high, but costs decrease as you age and gain more driving experience. As long as your driving record is clear of accidents or tickets, your rates should get cheaper as you age until you approach your 70s. Insurers find [senior drivers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-seniors/) are more likely to get into accidents, so those 70 and older start to see insurance costs rise.
Age  |  Average annual cost per year  |  % difference from 40-year-old cost
---|---|---
[16-year-old](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) |  $8,608 |  309% higher

### Average Car Insurance Rates for a Parents’ Policy With Teen Added
We found that when adding a [16-year-old driver](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) to a parent’s policy, the average car insurance cost jumped from $2,603 per year to $5,011 per year. That’s an average increase of 103%.
Listing a teen driver on a parent’s policy can double your costs but is generally the cheapest route.
While adding a teen to a parent’s policy is expensive, it’s typically much more cost-effective than a 16-year-old getting their own car insurance policy, which costs an average of $8,608 a year.

## Average Cost of Car Insurance by Gender
Car insurance companies find that young males are more likely to engage in unsafe driving behavior, so they pay more than females initially. This rate gap for males tends to close around age 25 and become nearly on par with their female counterparts—but costs creep up again for males in their 70s and 80s.
Some states prohibit the use of gender to determine auto insurance rates.
Gender is not permitted for car insurance cost calculations in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

## How Much Is Auto Insurance by Company?
We found that the average cost of auto insurance ranges from around $1,450 to a bit over $3,000 per year for full coverage.
Each auto insurance company assesses risk differently, which means prices can vary significantly among companies.
Nationwide has the [cheapest full coverage car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheapest-full-coverage-car-insurance/), followed by USAA, Travelers and Geico. USAA—one of the [best military car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-cheap-military-and-veterans-car-insurance/) companies—is the cheapest for state minimum auto policies.

## Average Cost of Car Insurance by Driving History
The cost of car insurance for a clean driving record is $2,149 per year. If you maintain a clean driving history, insurance companies consider you a good driver and offer you their best rates.
If you get a traffic ticket, cause an accident or have a DUI conviction, you’re more of a risk to insurers, so you’ll pay more than someone with a clean driving record.
### How Your Driving Record Impacts Your Car Insurance Rates
Your driving history is a significant [car insurance rating factor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/factors-in-rates/) because it reflects your driving behavior. The riskier your driving habits are, the more you can expect to pay.
Driver type  |  Average annual full coverage insurance cost
---|---
Clean driving record |  $2,149
Driver with a speeding ticket |  $2,669
Driver with a DUI |  $3,593

### Average Cost of Car Insurance Based on Credit Score
Insurers believe drivers with lower credit scores are more likely to file claims, which is why [car insurance rates for drivers with poor credit](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) are typically very high. Our analysis found that drivers with poor credit pay an average of 92% more than those with good credit.
Not all states allow insurers to use credit to price car insurance.
Using a [credit-based auto insurance score](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-insurance-score/) is banned from auto insurance rate calculations in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

## Average Auto Insurance Cost by Usage
How much you drive and how you use your vehicle will affect your car insurance rates. For example, if you drive a convertible mainly on weekends and it’s designated for pleasure use, your auto insurance rates will differ from the car you designated as your daily commuter.
If you use your car for business purposes, such as making deliveries, you normally need [commercial auto insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/best-commercial-auto-insurance-companies/) instead of a personal auto policy.
### Average Car Insurance Cost by Annual Mileage
If you drive your car fewer miles annually because you are retired, work from home or merely don’t drive much, you should see reduced auto insurance rates. You’re on the road less, so you pose less risk of being in an accident and filing claims.
Drivers in the U.S. travel an average of nearly 13,500 miles annually, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration. The FHA data reveals that male motorists drive more miles annually (16,550 miles) than females (10,142 miles). Here’s a look at the average car insurance costs per year based on miles driven.
Average annual mileage  |  Average annual insurance cost
---|---
3,000 miles |  $1,996
6,000 miles |  $2,015

## Car Insurance Rates Are On The Rise
Car insurance rates have been on the rise for the last four years. [Why are car insurance rates so high?](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/why-is-my-car-insurance-so-high/) Various issues have caused auto insurance costs to increase, but inflation is a primary factor. Vehicle repairs are more expensive because parts and labor cost more, so insurers are paying higher amounts for claims.
When car insurance companies pay more for claims, those costs are passed on to you through increases in your insurance rates.
Our data analysis finds the average auto insurance cost per year in 2024 was 33% higher than in 2021.

### Pay in Full
Whether you’re buying a 6-month or 12-month car insurance policy, paying the policy term in full will usually lead to a discount vs. paying monthly.

### Raise Your Deductible
A [car insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-car-insurance-deductible/) is the amount deducted from your insurance check for a comprehensive or collision claim. I find choosing a higher deductible reduces costs because the insurer is responsible for paying a little less on claims I may make.

## Types of Car Insurance Discounts
Discounts help lower the average cost of car insurance. Look for these common discounts and ask your agent if there are any other discounts you’re eligible for to get [cheap car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance/).
* **Advance shopping discount:** Getting quotes before your current policy expires can earn you a discount. It’s best to shop seven to 14 days in advance to receive this savings.
* **Defensive driving class.** If you’re 55 or older, you may earn a discount for sharpening your skills with an approved driving course. Make sure your insurer approves of a specific course for a discount before taking it.
* **Good driver discount:** A driving record free of tickets and accidents can qualify you for a good driver discount. Some insurers refer to it as a safe driver discount.
* **Membership discount:** Ask about a discount based on associations or organizations you’re a member of, such as college alumni associations or a union.
* **Multi-policy discount:** You can reduce your rates by [bundling home and auto policies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/), meaning you bought them from the same company. Discounts vary between 6% and 23%, according to our research.
* **Multi-vehicle discount:** Having more than one vehicle on the same car insurance policy gets you a [multi-car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/multi-car-insurance/) discount.
* **Online quote:** Save with some insurers by getting an online quote and then buying a policy.
* **Paid in full discount:** For paying your car insurance bill upfront instead of monthly.
* **Paperless discount:** Choosing to go paperless with your bills and policy documents may get you a small discount. The discount is usually under 5% but is easy to obtain.
* **Vehicle safety features:** Some auto insurers give discounts if your car has specific safety equipment, such as airbags, anti-lock brakes or daytime running lights.
If you have a teen or young adult on your policy, ask about:
* Receiving a discount if your child completes an approved driver training program.
* A good student discount if your young driver does well in school (high school or college).
* A reduction in rates for a “student away at school” if your child is off to college at least 100 miles away from home and is without a car.
