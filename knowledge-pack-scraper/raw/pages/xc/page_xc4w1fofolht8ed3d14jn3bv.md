## Other Ways to Save on Car Insurance
Discounts are a great way to save on your car insurance policy, and a bundling discount is usually one of the largest discounts you can secure on car and home insurance.
However, discounts aren't the only way to reduce your rates and get affordable auto insurance. Some other great [hacks to save money on your car insurance](https://clearsurance.com/blog/6-hacks-to-save-money-on-your-car-insurance-rates) include:
  * **Dropping Unnecessary Coverages:** Review your add-on coverages carefully. You may no longer need some coverage on older vehicles.
  * **Raising Deductibles:** If you feel comfortable raising your [insurance deductibles](https://clearsurance.com/blog/what-is-an-insurance-deductible), your insurance company will lower rates as its financial responsibility is reduced.
  * **Comparison Shopping:** The company you are with may no longer offer the best deal. Every few years, make sure to get quotes and shop around.


It is also easier to score cheap auto insurance coverage if you are a low-risk driver. Generally, this means that you have a clean driving record, drive a safe car, and live in a low-risk area.
![blog image 22](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-home-and-car-insurance-bundling-discounts)
Some companies also offer telematics driving programs that safe drivers can participate in to earn a lower rate on car insurance. Taking advantage of programs like these can help you maximize savings on your car insurance, leaving more money to spend on your home insurance.
## Securing a Discount for Bundling Home and Car Insurance
When you purchase multiple lines of insurance coverage from a company that offers one of the best home and car insurance bundling discounts, the discount should automatically be applied. If this is not the case, please call the company immediately to determine the reason. You may also be able to reach out online, depending on what customer service avenues are available.
