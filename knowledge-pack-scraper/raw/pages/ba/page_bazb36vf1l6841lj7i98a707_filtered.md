# Progressive Auto added a driver without notification, any recourse?

So, I've been insured through the same insurance broker with the same progressive policy for more than 10 years. I understand that this is partially my fault for not being attentive enough, but progressive added a driver to my policy without notifying me.

My policy was renewed on 12/31/2023. I got a speeding ticket shortly after renewal (important in a minute). Then on 1/31/2024 progressive added a driver to my policy.

This new driver is someone I've never heard of, met, lived with, etc. On top of that they're a relatively young driver (born in 1994).

The only notification I received from Progressive was that my policy premium had increased, which I simply assumed was from the speeding ticket.

I did not receive an email nor phone call with information about a driver being added. The only place which it was noted is on my declarations page, which the Progressive rep says was sufficient because I've signed up for paperless billing.

As I said above, I know I'm somewhat responsible but I can't help but feeling scammed. I've been paying increased rates for more than a year for someone who shouldn't have been on the policy to begin with.

The Progressive rep I talked to is saying there's nothing they can do about past charges and my broker is just jumping in, but doesn't think he'll be able to do much.

Do I have any recourse here? Is there some commission I should report this to? It feels fraudulent.

Thanks for any insight!
