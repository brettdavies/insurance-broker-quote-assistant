No they notify you multiple times that there was a driver that came up during one of their consumer reporting periods. If you don't fill out the forms at the time they discover it they are automatically added to your policy.
You can remove them now but by not disputing it you gave permission for them to be added to the policy and i've never seen them backdate the removal.

That's where my problem is, I never received any notifications. I've checked my emails from that time period and even went as far as pulling phone records. They simply did not contact me aside from updating the declarations page and stating my premium had increased.

Just because you didn't see it doesn't mean they didn't notify you. Ask them to resend the notification. Also, ask them where they got the information. Usually, if you call when they send the first notification (that I'm confident based on processes, they sent), it's pretty easy to get that person off. If you waited, the difficulty depends on how they got the info. It's often someone who used to live at your address who never updated their drivers license or car registration.

I had this exact same issue a year ago. Zero notice unless I looked at the declarations page, just a rate increase.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have any recourse I was able to find. I ended up just switching to a different insurer, since this whole situation with Progressive rubbed me the wrong way.

The chances that they didn't send you multiple notifications, usually via mail, before adding them is virtually nil. The chances that you either didn't get the mail they sent it didn't open it thinking it wasn't anything important is very high.
They pulled info from a database somewhere, likely more than one, that gave them reason to believe that person lived there and you didn't disclose that as your contract requires. When you didn't respond, they added them just as every other insurance company would. Maybe they used to live there, maybe they're using your address on some paperwork somewhere for who knows what reason. As far as them being added, blame parents who conveniently "forget" to add their teen driver due to the rate increase, or the young lady with a live in boyfriend with a horrible driving record, so she doesn't add him as required to save money on rates, etc, etc. Companies are cracking down on undisclosed drivers. Let them know you have never heard of this person and that you're willing to sign an exclusion for them if state and company allows.

Already sent off the exclusion page, but thanks for the feedback.
For what it's worth, the progressive rep I spoke to very plainly told me they did NOT send me any paper mail as I'm on paperless billing. On progressive's site you can look back through your document history including emails they have sent you. None were clearly labeled as an inquiry about an additional driver.
The premium change had an updated deceleration page, but that's it.
I hope that doesn't sound argumentative. I totally agree that they should have sent me multiple notifications (or maybe even called?), I'm just not seeing any evidence that happened.
It's frustrating, but I guess all I can do is take my business elsewhere.

The declarations page sent after the change would have listed exactly what the change was. And every dec page since the change would list all vehicles and drivers listed on the policy, every 6 months.
I also don’t know that I’d consider a 31 year old a young driver but hey, you do you.

From recollection almost nothing is clearly labeled in their documents history but it would have popped up as something like an underwriting notice or memo if I recall and their system for that state is the same as mine.

I find it very hard to believe that they don't have any printed documents on your account about the renewal notice. Documents visible to you through the app and website are going to be your dec-page and your insurance cards. But, even with paperless billing, certain documents are required to be provided via printed and physically mailed. Changes to your policy tends to be one of them, even in states with strict paper reduction requirements for insurance companies. Your agent or a customer service representative can see any documents that were mailed that aren't visible on your end.
If they truly have no record of sending you any kind of notice, you may be able to get them to back date the exclusion and premium reduction. You will likely have to spend a lot of time on the phone talking to supervisors and managers to get it though.

Nah nothing to do at this point other than clear it up. This gets posted very often because it happens a ton, insurers are getting more and more aggressive about combating fraud.
They keep doing it though, which is a sign that despite how many people go and file official complaints they have the receipts to back up their actions, they arn't going to do anything that risks them getting fined or sued. The state/insurance commission agrees.

If you haven’t already, request to speak to a manager if you call in. Just be nice and ask that you’d like to understand the circumstances around how a driver was added, where did the information come from, etc. Can be as simple as being worried someone fraudulently requested policy changes. Most of the time you can get to a Policy team supervisor or above and they provide some info. If you have an agent, they should be able to elevate concerns on their side for you. Agents typically have a company rep they can reach out to as their liaison who can help resolve issues or get you to the right people. Sadly it’s entirely possible an agent requested changes on the wrong policy!
Other posts mentioned bringing in the Dept of Insurance by filing a complaint. This can sometimes help since the insurer typically responds to you and the regulator at the same time and you’ll receive a specific response. Also these type of complaints are often reviewed by a separate department as a regulatory response so another set of eyes can’t hurt. Good luck with this!

That might be a valid option if the company did something illegal. They didn't.

You generally won't get a call or email because insurance is heavily regulated, and regulations specify how notice of policy changes must be delivered by the carrier. The fines for noncompliance are substantial, and any large company has teams of people devoted to making sure they comply and document their compliance.
So, if you go back through your policy paperwork, I expect you'll find the formal written notification of policy changes (if the driver was added during the policy term) or policy renewal declarations if the driver was added at renewal.)
This is extremely common.
Customers routinely fail to disclose drivers, so companies use consumer data services to find people who _might_ be in a customer household. They send notice telling the customer,
"We have reason to think this person might be in your household. If so, we need to either list them or exclude them. To avoid exposing you to the risk of not having coverage for an undisclosed driver, we will list them on your policy unless you get back to us saying they're not in your household, or they're in your household but you want to exclude them from coverage."
This "undisclosed driver discovery" process is common across the industry, and pretty much every company that does it has a well-documented process for giving the customer advanced notice and an opportunity to exclude or remove the driver.

My biggest gripe is the vagueness of the emails for this generally. When progressive did this for me they just sent an email saying a new document was ready to view. IMO they are intentionally vague with the communications so while technically legal, they are hedging on some number of people not flagging it as important. If the email subject was "NEW DRIVER ON POLICY" it'd be clear to go resolve.
Also the app when I was using progressive was not able to open the documents and sent to browser which required to sign in again. On desktop I had issues using any browser other than edge. Again I think the friction and low information is intentional on their part.
A friend recently had a parent added to their policy who lives in another state (they had a package delivered at the child's place while visiting on a roadtrip and started getting letters addressed to said parent soliciting various services afterwards). Progressive decided that was enough to add the parent as a newly licensed driver. Just seems like a scummy dishonest company to me.
