**Process in Submitting Your Certificate for a Discount**

The process for submitting your online defensive driving course certificate for a Texas auto insurance discount is quick and easy. Here is the process you should follow to make sure you get a discount:

**1.** Before you take the course, check to see if your auto insurance company offers a discount to drivers who take a defensive driving course. Please note that if you are taking a defensive driving course to avoid getting points on your license after receiving a ticket, you may not be able to receive a Texas auto insurance discount.

**a.** If you already have a local agent, call their office to find out what your discount would be on your insurance.  
**b.** If you are not able to speak to a local agent, call a national number or check their website to find out the eligibility for the available discount.  
**c.** If you are shopping for new auto insurance, be sure to say that you are taking or plan to take a defensive driving course when you are receiving a quote.

**2.** Enroll in our Texas [online](https://comedydefensivedriving.com/texas/) defensive driving course for an insurance discount!
