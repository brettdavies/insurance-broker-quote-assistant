There are effectively two parts of a homeowners insurance rate: a _premium_ and a _deductible_. A premium is the amount you pay to maintain your coverage level, while a deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket when you file a claim. Generally, a higher premium means a lower deductible, and raising your deductible can be one of the most effective ways to lower your average annual premiums.
In addition to helping Floridians avoid the added costs of homeownership, Truehold’s [Tampa sell and stay](https://www.truehold.com/locations/tampa) transaction creates added flexibility, letting them enjoy beautiful Tampa Bay on their terms.
