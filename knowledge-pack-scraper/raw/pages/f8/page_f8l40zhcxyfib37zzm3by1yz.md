![Average Homeowners Insurance in Tampa, Florida](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a754e04510b40f8830b862/68a754e04510b40f8830c139_Average%20Homeowners%20Insurance%20in%20Tampa%2C%20Florida.jpg)
Tampa, Florida is one of the country’s fastest-growing cities, and for good reason. The Tampa Bay area and its surrounding neighborhoods combine city life with coastal charm. It’s home to world-class dining, champion sports teams, and exciting Florida history. Plus, when it’s time to get away, both Orlando and Miami are just a few hours away by car. 
There are so many great things about Tampa, but these perks can come at a cost: Like many other Florida cities, homeowners insurance premiums in Tampa rank near the highest in the country. But why are the city’s rates so high and what is the average homeowners insurance in Tampa, Florida? Read on as we explore the factors behind these elevated rates as well as some ways to reduce them. 
## Factors Influencing Homeowners Insurance Rates
Before we look at Tampa’s specific rates, let’s examine how homeowners insurance rates are calculated. While [homeowners insurance requirements](https://www.truehold.com/post/do-you-have-to-have-homeowners-insurance/) vary, it can protect you in the event that something happens to your property. No matter where you are, homeowners insurance rates are determined using a handful of key details about your property. These include:
  * The cost of replacing your dwelling home
  * The amount of dwelling coverage needed
  * The value of your assets and personal property 


With this information, insurance providers will crunch the numbers using an underwriting algorithm. This will use specifics about your dwelling as well as your zip code to determine an individual rate.1
Your zip code gives home insurance companies a full history of the area, allowing them to assess the level of risk in a given location. In New Hampshire, where homeowners insurance rates are some of the lowest in the country, the risk of property damage from an extreme storm is fairly low. But in Oklahoma, a part of the country particularly susceptible to tornadoes, these rates are as high as they come.2
As we’ll soon discuss, however, risk isn’t the only motivator behind elevated insurance rates. 
## What Affects Homeowners Insurance in Tampa?
In 2024, Florida’s average homeowners insurance cost was roughly three times the national average, at over $11,000—almost a $1,000 increase over the previous year. Several unique variables influence this elevated cost, with the below being some of the biggest factors affecting the average homeowners insurance in Tampa, Florida. 
### Tampa's Climate and Risk Factors
Tampa is nestled along Florida’s Gulf Coast, making it an ideal destination for those who enjoy being by the water. As with any of Florida’s coastal cities, however, this prime locale also puts it at a greater risk of being impacted by storms. With the increasing prevalence of severe weather, Florida homeowners insurance rates have surged, with Tampa and St. Petersburg experiencing some of the most significant hikes in insurance costs. 
The city’s location along the water also means Tampa residents may opt to carry supplemental insurance, like a flood insurance policy, which can drive annual premiums even higher. With that said, many will agree that the peace of mind this policy provides can make it well worth the cost of a higher insurance premium. 
### Property Age and Condition
The Tampa area is home to some rich Florida history, with many homes in the area dating back to the mid-1800s. But while these older homes bring a high degree of charm, they can also come with high property insurance. Part of this reason is due to the average condition of older homes which may be more likely to need repairs, but even the types of building materials and methods used can help explain higher premiums. 
Electrical codes, for example, have changed quite a bit in the last century. Older homes have fewer safeguards in place, putting them at a higher risk of fire damage than more recent builds. Insurance companies consider these details, raising rates to meet the level of risk.3
### Fewer Options for Insurance
The last major factor affecting homeowners insurance rates in Tampa is perhaps one of the biggest sources of stress for Florida homeowners: the dwindling number of insurance providers left in the state and the tightening eligibility requirements of those remaining. 
In the past five years, more than a dozen home insurance companies have pulled out of the state or liquidated altogether, leaving Floridians with fewer options for homeowners insurance. Of the insurers that stayed, many have made it increasingly challenging for homeowners to attain insurance coverage options by raising annual premiums and imposing more restrictions on who can and can’t access insurance.4
Fortunately, legislation has been put in place to help temper the issue, but securing a new homeowners insurance policy in Tampa (or even renewing an existing one) can still feel a bit like merging onto I-4 at rush hour.

## Tips for Reducing Your Homeowners Insurance Premiums
Now that we’ve examined all the reasons for Tampa’s elevated homeowners insurance rates, let’s explore five ways you can reduce yours using a few common practices and one surprising approach. 
### 1. Compare Rates
One of the easiest ways to reduce your homeowners insurance costs is to compare insurance company rates. Shopping around for the most competitive rate will not only help you find the best deal, but it may even help you secure a better rate with your current provider. There may be fewer insurance companies in Florida, but there are still options out there. 
### 2. Look for Opportunities to Bundle
Many of the country’s best homeowners insurance companies are also auto insurance providers. They may also be boat and jet ski insurers, as is the case with State Farm. If your insurance company (or the provider you’re considering) offers another type of insurance policy that applies to your needs, bundling your policies can be a great way to save even more on your homeowners insurance policy. Just be sure you’re not paying more for a different type of dwelling coverage simply to lower your home insurance rate. 
### 3. Consider Raising Your Deductibles
There are effectively two parts of a homeowners insurance rate: a _premium_ and a _deductible_. A premium is the amount you pay to maintain your coverage level, while a deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket when you file a claim. Generally, a higher premium means a lower deductible, and raising your deductible can be one of the most effective ways to lower your average annual premiums. 
Raising your deductible can be a bit of a gamble, though. You save on premiums, considering you only pay extra when it comes time to file a claim. But in the event that your dwelling does receive damage, you assume a larger financial responsibility and pay more for repairs. Before you adjust your deductible, consider the potential savings (and the potential out-of-pocket costs) that may accompany this shift. 
### 4. Keep an Eye on Your Credit Score
It may come as a surprise to some, but your credit score can have a significant impact on the cost of your homeowners insurance. When insurers vet new policyholders, they use personal information to calculate risk, with credit score being one of the criteria used. Your credit score likely won’t be the biggest factor in determining annual premiums, but it’s still worth it to monitor and improve your score to ensure you’re getting the best homeowners insurance rates possible. 
### 5. Explore Truehold’s Sell and Stay Transaction for Added Savings
The above strategies may help reduce homeowners insurance costs, but what if you want to get rid of this expense altogether? With Truehold, you can.
