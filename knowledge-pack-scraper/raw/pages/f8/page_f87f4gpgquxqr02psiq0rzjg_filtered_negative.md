4. What is travel medical insurance?
According to [_USA Today_](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/travel-insurance/average-travel-insurance-cost), on average, travel medical insurance typically costs about 6% of the cost of the trip. However, age is also a factor in determining travel medical insurance costs. Travelers above age 60 might expect to pay between 11% and 18% for a senior travel medical insurance policy per the USA Today article. Additional factors that may impact insurance costs include the number of travelers in your party, the type of policy you choose, and the policy coverage limits.
