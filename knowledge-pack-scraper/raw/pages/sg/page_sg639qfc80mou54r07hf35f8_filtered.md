## Progressive vs. State Farm: rates for high-risk drivers

If you have an at-fault collision, reckless driving citation, or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) in your recent history, Progressive could be a better option than State Farm. However, State Farm tends to be somewhat cheaper for drivers with speeding violations. Remember that every car insurance company rates driving offenses differently, so compare quotes from a number of insurers to discover which best suits you.

##### RATES BY VIOLATION: PROGRESSIVE VS. STATE FARM

| **Citation** | **Progressive avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,720 | $2,849 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $2,245 | $1,524 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,201 | $3,854 |
| Reckless driving | $2,457 | $2,895 |
| Speeding ticket | $2,091 | $1,983 |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

## Progressive vs. State Farm: rates by age bracket

Car insurance companies rely on age to estimate risk, pricing policies accordingly. Because of their inexperience behind the wheel, auto insurance tends to be a lot more expensive for young drivers, especially when compared to older drivers. Because every insurance company prices age tiers in a different way, it's wise to compare rates and find a suitable policy.

In general, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose State Farm over Progressive, with the potential to save an average of nearly $2,500 per year.

##### COMPARING AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY AGE: PROGRESSIVE VS. STATE FARM

| **Age** | **Progressive avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $8,248 | $5,820 |
| **20s** | $2,287 | $2,379 |
| **30s** | $1,646 | $1,585 |
| **40s** | $1,644 | $1,587 |
| **50s** | $1,542 | $1,558 |
| **60s** | $1,403 | $1,485 |

Affordability aside, both Progressive and State Farm have their pros and cons. These can include discounts, additional coverages, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Make sure to do your comparisons before making your final decision.
