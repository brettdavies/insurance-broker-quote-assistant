## The best car insurance companies in Los Angeles
There are 6.7 million registered drivers in Los Angeles, and if you're one of them, you may be looking for a cheaper insurance rate. Like drivers in many major cities, LA residents see higher-than-average premiums due to the amount of traffic and potential for accidents. Based on Bankrate’s research, Los Angeles drivers pay an average annual premium of $4,246 for full coverage, or $354 per month, and an average of $1,285 annually or $107 monthly for minimum coverage. For drivers looking for the [best car insurance in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california/) to work within their budget, Bankrate evaluated insurers with better-than-average [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) financial strength ratings, high marks in [J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study) and some of the lowest car insurance rates in Los Angeles.

Overview 
**Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive, the second-largest U.S. auto insurer, is another insurance company offering drivers in Los Angeles lower-than-average rates along with national coverage and digital tools. With various discount opportunities and [SR-22 filings](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) available for high-risk drivers, Progressive may be a good choice for policyholders looking to save money.
**Why Progressive may be the best for optional endorsements:** Progressive stands out from the competition with its long list of endorsements. From usage-based insurance plans to [rideshare options](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rideshare-insurance/) that cover both Uber/Lyft driving and app-based delivery services, policyholders can find flexible coverage to meet their needs. Additionally, Progressive automatically includes pet injury coverage with policies that have collision insurance — not something that is available with most carriers.

**Why Travelers made our list:** Travelers provides policyholders with several coverage options and [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) for car insurance.

**Why Travelers may be the best for local agents:** For drivers who prefer working directly with an agent, Travelers has nearly 90 insurance agencies located in Los Angeles. Since Travelers offers additional insurance products, such as life, business and specialty coverage, having an agent to speak to at a brick-and-mortar location could benefit drivers with multiple policies.

## How much is car insurance in Los Angeles, California?
The average cost of full coverage car insurance in Los Angeles is $4,246 per year. Minimum coverage averages $1,285 per year. Auto insurance rates vary amongst drivers due to many factors that can be location-based, such as traffic density and weather. The [average car insurance rates for California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/) are $3,102 per year for full coverage and $915 per year for minimum (also called liability-only) coverage. Aside from location, other rating factors such as age and driving record significantly affect how much you pay for car insurance.
### Los Angeles rates for teens
Age is an insurance rating factor in most states, and [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) are usually rated as high-risk due to their limited driving experience. Adjusting to dangerous driving conditions and avoiding road hazards are skills drivers learn over time. [Teen driving stats](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) also reveal that young drivers tend to speed more and wear seatbelts less regularly, which increases the risk of car crash-related fatalities. However, teens who remain on their parents’ policy instead of getting their own auto insurance right away can usually save a significant amount of money.

### Los Angeles rates for young drivers
[Young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) in Los Angeles typically aren’t stuck paying high insurance rates forever. If they maintain a good driving record, their premium is likely to decline as they gain driving experience. When adult children no longer live with their parents, they must secure their own car insurance policy, however — which can also be pricey. Things like good driving discounts and telematics program enrollment can potentially help make premiums more affordable.

### Los Angeles rates for adults
With a good driving history, drivers over the age of 25 are typically moved into a standard or preferred risk pool where age doesn’t impact premiums as significantly. According to data from the [Insurance Institute of Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot), crash fatality rates among adults usually remain fairly consistent. While California doesn’t allow for the use of gender or credit for insurance rating purposes, other factors such as loss history, coverage limits and location can cause rates to vary significantly between carriers and policyholders.

### Los Angeles rates for senior drivers
Rates start to increase for drivers again around the age of 70. Senior drivers tend to pay slightly more for their car insurance due to an enhanced risk of accidents. Since so many seniors live on a fixed income, they may want to shop for insurance with carriers that offer more [affordable rates to older drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) or offer a senior defensive driving discount.

Minimum coverage requirements in Los Angeles
[California law](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) requires all automobile owners to carry at least minimal car insurance limits of:
  * $30,000 in [bodily injury liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) coverage per person
  * $60,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per accident
  * $15,000 in [property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) coverage per accident


While many drivers need a car for work and personal activities, some cannot afford to pay the high cost of auto insurance. For low-income drivers, the state established the [California Low-Cost Automobile Insurance Program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-low-cost-auto-insurance/). To [qualify for the program](https://www.mylowcostauto.com/get-started/qualifications), automobile owners must meet income guidelines, own a car worth $25,000 or less and be a new driver or an experienced driver with a good driving record.
Most insurance experts agree that carrying liability limits higher than the state minimum can offer more protection for your personal finances. Since Los Angeles is prone to wildfires and vehicle thefts, drivers may want to consider adding [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) to their policies. This coverage helps pay to replace or repair your vehicle up to its actual cash value if it is damaged by events other than collisions, such as fire, wind, hail, vandalism and theft.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Los Angeles?
Caret Down Icon
When looking for cheap car insurance in Los Angeles, there are [several strategies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) you can try that may help save you money. First, consider your priorities, and make sure you are not purchasing more coverage than you need. Many insurance experts recommend that you purchase as much liability coverage as you can afford, but if you are driving an older car that might not be worth repairing, for example, you could consider dropping collision coverage. You may also save money by shopping around, asking for [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/) in Los Angeles from a range of insurers to see which offers you the cheapest rate. Be sure that all quoted premiums take discounts into account. Maintaining a clean driving record will also signal to insurers that you are a low-risk policyholder, helping to keep your rates low over time.
  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in Los Angeles?
Caret Down Icon
Car insurance is more expensive in Los Angeles than in typical cities across the country, but it is aligned with other cities in California. The annual cost of car insurance in Los Angeles is $4,246 for full coverage and $1,285 for minimum coverage. In comparison, drivers in Santa Monica pay a yearly rate of $3,766 for full coverage and $1,181 for minimum coverage. However, Pasadena drivers pay $3,514 and $1,100 per year for full and minimum car insurance, respectively.
  * ###  Why did my Los Angeles car insurance premium increase?
Caret Down Icon
Car insurance costs increased significantly across the country between 2024 and 2025. The average rate went up by [12 percent](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/the-true-cost-of-auto-insurance/) nationwide. As always, some drivers see rate increases because they were involved in an accident or bought a new car. However, many drivers who did not see a change in personal circumstances also experienced a steep premium hike. Some of the causes of these increases include increasingly unpredictable [weather conditions](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rising-cost-extreme-weather/) and an uptick in the expense of car parts. When it is more expensive to repair a vehicle, the cost of claims goes up, and insurers pass this along to drivers.
  * ######  What is the best way to get car insurance quotes in Los Angeles?
Caret Down Icon

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
