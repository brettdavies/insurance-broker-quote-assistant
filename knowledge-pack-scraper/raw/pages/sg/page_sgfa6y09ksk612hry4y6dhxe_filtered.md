Based on Bankrate’s research, Los Angeles drivers pay an average annual premium of $4,246 for full coverage, or $354 per month, and an average of $1,285 annually or $107 monthly for minimum coverage. For drivers looking for the [best car insurance in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california/) to work within their budget, Bankrate evaluated insurers with better-than-average [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) financial strength ratings, high marks in [J.D.

**Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive, the second-largest U.S. auto insurer, is another insurance company offering drivers in Los Angeles lower-than-average rates along with national coverage and digital tools. With various discount opportunities and [SR-22 filings](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) available for high-risk drivers, Progressive may be a good choice for policyholders looking to save money.

**Why Progressive may be the best for optional endorsements:** Progressive stands out from the competition with its long list of endorsements. From usage-based insurance plans to [rideshare options](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rideshare-insurance/) that cover both Uber/Lyft driving and app-based delivery services, policyholders can find flexible coverage to meet their needs. Additionally, Progressive automatically includes pet injury coverage with policies that have collision insurance — not something that is available with most carriers.

**Why Travelers made our list:** Travelers provides policyholders with several coverage options and [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) for car insurance. The cost of car insurance with Travelers is usually much lower than the state average for both full and minimal coverage policies. Drivers in Los Angeles may also be interested in the add-on options available, such as gap insurance and new car replacement.

**Why Travelers may be the best for local agents:** For drivers who prefer working directly with an agent, Travelers has nearly 90 insurance agencies located in Los Angeles. Since Travelers offers additional insurance products, such as life, business and specialty coverage, having an agent to speak to at a brick-and-mortar location could benefit drivers with multiple policies.

**Why Mercury may be the best for cheap coverage:** Mercury's average rates are some of the cheapest in Los Angeles for both minimum and full coverage.

**Why Wawanesa made our list:** Wawanesa offers potential price reductions, including a loyalty discount, a discount for drivers over the age of 55 who take a defensive driving course and a multi-car discount. The types of coverage available through the company are rather basic when compared to other carriers, but it still has extras like roadside assistance and rental car coverage availability.

**Why Wawanesa may be the best for regional coverage:** In the U.S., Wawanesa only offers coverage in California. Drivers can work with local independent agents to ask questions and secure auto insurance.

## How much is car insurance in Los Angeles, California?

The average cost of full coverage car insurance in Los Angeles is $4,246 per year. Minimum coverage averages $1,285 per year. Auto insurance rates vary amongst drivers due to many factors that can be location-based, such as traffic density and weather. The [average car insurance rates for California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/) are $3,102 per year for full coverage and $915 per year for minimum (also called liability-only) coverage. Aside from location, other rating factors such as age and driving record significantly affect how much you pay for car insurance.

### Los Angeles rates for teens

Age is an insurance rating factor in most states, and [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) are usually rated as high-risk due to their limited driving experience. Adjusting to dangerous driving conditions and avoiding road hazards are skills drivers learn over time. [Teen driving stats](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) also reveal that young drivers tend to speed more and wear seatbelts less regularly, which increases the risk of car crash-related fatalities. However, teens who remain on their parents’ policy instead of getting their own auto insurance right away can usually save a significant amount of money.

### Los Angeles rates for young drivers

[Young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) in Los Angeles typically aren’t stuck paying high insurance rates forever. If they maintain a good driving record, their premium is likely to decline as they gain driving experience. When adult children no longer live with their parents, they must secure their own car insurance policy, however — which can also be pricey. Things like good driving discounts and telematics program enrollment can potentially help make premiums more affordable.

### Los Angeles rates for adults

With a good driving history, drivers over the age of 25 are typically moved into a standard or preferred risk pool where age doesn’t impact premiums as significantly. According to data from the [Insurance Institute of Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot), crash fatality rates among adults usually remain fairly consistent. While California doesn’t allow for the use of gender or credit for insurance rating purposes, other factors such as loss history, coverage limits and location can cause rates to vary significantly between carriers and policyholders.

### Los Angeles rates for senior drivers

Rates start to increase for drivers again around the age of 70. Senior drivers tend to pay slightly more for their car insurance due to an enhanced risk of accidents. Since so many seniors live on a fixed income, they may want to shop for insurance with carriers that offer more [affordable rates to older drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) or offer a senior defensive driving discount.

Minimum coverage requirements in Los Angeles

[California law](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) requires all automobile owners to carry at least minimal car insurance limits of:

* $30,000 in [bodily injury liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) coverage per person
* $60,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per accident
* $15,000 in [property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) coverage per accident

While many drivers need a car for work and personal activities, some cannot afford to pay the high cost of auto insurance. For low-income drivers, the state established the [California Low-Cost Automobile Insurance Program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-low-cost-auto-insurance/). To [qualify for the program](https://www.mylowcostauto.com/get-started/qualifications), automobile owners must meet income guidelines, own a car worth $25,000 or less and be a new driver or an experienced driver with a good driving record.

Most insurance experts agree that carrying liability limits higher than the state minimum can offer more protection for your personal finances. Since Los Angeles is prone to wildfires and vehicle thefts, drivers may want to consider adding [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) to their policies. This coverage helps pay to replace or repair your vehicle up to its actual cash value if it is damaged by events other than collisions, such as fire, wind, hail, vandalism and theft.

* ### Why did my Los Angeles car insurance premium increase?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Car insurance costs increased significantly across the country between 2024 and 2025. The average rate went up by [12 percent](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/the-true-cost-of-auto-insurance/) nationwide. As always, some drivers see rate increases because they were involved in an accident or bought a new car. However, many drivers who did not see a change in personal circumstances also experienced a steep premium hike. Some of the causes of these increases include increasingly unpredictable [weather conditions](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rising-cost-extreme-weather/) and an uptick in the expense of car parts. When it is more expensive to repair a vehicle, the cost of claims goes up, and insurers pass this along to drivers.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
