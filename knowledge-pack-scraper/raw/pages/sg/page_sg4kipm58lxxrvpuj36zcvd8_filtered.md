In 2024, State Farm continued to fulfill its mission of helping people manage the risks of everyday life, recover from the unexpected and realize their dreams. We maintained our commitment to helping more customers and, in turn, saw an increase of more than one million policies and accounts. While auto and fire insurance companies within the State Farm group of companies reported underwriting losses, results improved over prior year. The State Farm life insurance companies reported $817 million in dividends to policyholders and issued a record $122 billion in new policy volume bringing the year-end 2024 individual life insurance in force to $1.2 trillion.

“After another year of catastrophe events, State Farm was there to help our customers recover from the unexpected and will continue to do so as we focus on our customers impacted by the devastating wildfires in California. As of February 26, we’ve received more than 11,750 total fire and auto claims related to the fires and have paid nearly $2.2 billion to our customers,” said Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer Mark Schwamberger. “Our customer-centered approach leads us to measure success in the number of promises kept. The financial strength of each affiliate is critical to our ability to keep those promises, and we will continue to take a state-specific approach in the way in which we operate.”

The net worth for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company ended the year at $145.2 billion compared to $134.8 billion at year-end 2023. The change during 2024 includes an increase in the value of the P-C companies’ unaffiliated stock portfolio, driven by increases in the U.S. equities market, partially offset by the P-C group of companies pre-tax operating loss. The State Farm P-C group of companies reported earned premium of $103.0 billion and a combined underwriting loss of $6.1 billion. This result compared to an underwriting loss of $14.1 billion on earned premium of $87.6 billion in 2023. The change over 2023 reflects significant improvement in auto lines underwriting results which was partially offset by an increase in homeowners incurred catastrophe claims. The 2024 underwriting loss, combined with investment and other income of $6.0 billion, resulted in a P-C pre-tax operating loss of $111 million, which compares to the $8.5 billion loss reported in 2023. Total revenue, which includes premium revenue, earned investment income and realized capital gains (losses) was $123.0 billion for 2024 compared to $104.2 billion for 2023. State Farm reported a net income of $5.3 billion in 2024 compared to a net loss of $6.3 billion in 2023. The reported net income for 2024 includes the impact of $3.0 billion of realized capital gains, net of tax.
