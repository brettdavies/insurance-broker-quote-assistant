## Our take

Progressive is the second-largest car insurance provider in the country, falling only behind State Farm for total premiums written. Working with an insurer of Progressive’s size has advantages. For one, it’s an option for drivers in all 50 states, and for another, it has the financial footing to invest in the latest online applications and ways to service customers.

However, working with a big insurer can have its downsides. Progressive scored about average for customer service in our ranking of the [Best Car Insurance Companies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) for 2025, and its premiums are on the more expensive side.

Progressive was fifth overall in our ranking of the top car insurance companies.
