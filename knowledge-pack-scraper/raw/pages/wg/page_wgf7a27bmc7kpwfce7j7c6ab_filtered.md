## How to Choose an Umbrella Limit

Many households start by tallying current net worth and adding a multiple of future earnings potential. Our calculator suggests a range, but we’ll tailor it to your risks—teen drivers, rentals, boats, or frequent hosting may warrant higher limits. We’ll also confirm you meet required underlying limits on auto and home so there are no gaps at claim time.
