## Which car insurance company is best?

When you're looking for a [car insurance policy](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/) that fits your budget, it's important to remember that the [cheapest option](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/how-to-shop/best-cheap-auto-insurance/) may not be the best. That's why we've created a helpful resource to help you determine which car insurance companies are considered the best by customers and independent reviewers.

Our experts at The Zebra have compiled the top-rated car insurance companies based on a rigorous methodology. We looked at a number of factors, including customer satisfaction, price, and our own survey data to help you find the best car insurance carrier for your needs.

![USAA logo]()

### Best car insurance overall

[USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) topped our customer satisfaction survey with an overall score of **8.9 out of 10**, nearly sweeping every category. However, eligibility is limited.[[1]](##footnote-1)

![State Farm logo]()

### Best company for most drivers

Among carriers that offer nationwide coverage, [State Farm](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) scored the highest at **8.3/10**, doing particularly well for claims and customer service.

![]()

### Best regional carrier

While not available nationwide, [Erie](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/erie-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) (**8.8/10**) is a great option for those who live in states where it's offered.

Agent insight: What's most important when choosing a car insurance company?

The most important factors when choosing an auto insurance company are going to be tailored to each person, but price, of course, is going to be on everyone's radar. You definitely want to look at the company as a whole: what is their reputation like? What has word of mouth been like with reviews and customer satisfaction?

#### The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey methodology

## **Methodology:**

These results are based on a survey of 2,722 U.S. insurance policyholders assessing satisfaction with their car and homeowners insurance providers. The survey was conducted using Survey Monkey and designed by our in-house team. It aimed to collect detailed insights from a census-balanced sample reflecting age, gender, and region.

#### **Questionnaire**

The questionnaire included demographic questions about age and gender identification and detailed inquiries into insurance experiences. Key topics:

* Duration with insurance provider and coverage specifics, including teen drivers.
* Claim filing experiences and satisfaction with claims handling.
* Customer service interactions, trust in providers, and likelihood of recommending their insurance.
* Use and satisfaction with digital tools and usage-based insurance programs.

Respondents rated their satisfaction on a Likert scale from 1 to 10 and provided qualitative feedback.

#### **Data Analysis**

Data were analyzed focusing on descriptive and inferential statistics to identify satisfaction trends and demographic impacts. Data cleaning and weighting were applied to ensure accuracy, alongside strict confidentiality protocols to protect data security.

* [Online satisfaction](#online)

![Zebra Survey Icon]()

### Best for claims satisfaction: Erie (8.6)

No one wants to have to use their insurance. Still, you want the process to be as seamless as possible when you must. For this section, we asked respondents about their overall satisfaction with how their [car insurance claims](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/) were handled by their company. Respondents who had not filed a claim with their current insurer did not answer this question.

The company that came out on top was Erie. USAA came in a close second, while Auto Club (AAA) rounded out the top three. Below is a list of the top five best insurance companies with the highest claims satisfaction scores:

![Johnny Hawkins]()

Agent insight: What separates a good company from one that is just so-so?

One of the biggest differentiators for some of the top-rated companies compared to the smaller ones will be their claims process, which really affects a customer’s overall experience with a company.

The way you are treated by customer service can leave a lasting impression. This section focused on how satisfied customers were with the customer service received from their insurance company.

## How to choose the best car insurance company

While our survey can give you a broad idea of what to expect from car insurance companies, your experiences and driver profile may differ from our survey respondents. Because of this, it's hugely important to do your own research on how to find the best car insurance company for your needs.

![computer with quotes on the screen]()

Shop around and compare quotes

[Get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) from several companies to see who offers the best price and coverage.

![coverage]()

Explore coverage options

Not all car insurance companies offer the same coverage options. Going for state-minimum, [liability-only](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) coverage will certainly be cheaper, but will also leave you less protected.

![scale]()

Read reviews

### 

Third-party reviews (including those of [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/)) can give you another lens through which to view a car insurance company. Consult review sites such as the Better Business Bureau, NAIC, and J.D. Power to see how others have rated them.

![agent]()

Talk to a professional

If you're still unsure about what coverage you need, speak to a licensed professional. The Zebra has an [entire agency](https://www.thezebra.com/about/the-zebra-insurance-agency/) full of independent insurance agents who can help you find the right balance of affordability and customer service in a policy specially tailored to your needs.
