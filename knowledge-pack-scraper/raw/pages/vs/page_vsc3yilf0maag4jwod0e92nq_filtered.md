In the United States, every driver must legally have the minimum auto insurance coverage to drive and operate a vehicle on roads and highways. In California, there are different types of car insurance coverage you can opt for when selecting a policy. Generally, the state requires a minimum of bodily injury and property damage coverage.

Many people have questions about auto insurance coverage, especially in the case of a [car accident](https://www.setarehfirm.com/auto-accident/). Suppose you are injured in a collision with a negligent driver. In that case, it’s essential to understand the different types of coverage and how your injuries or damages are compensated in an at-fault state such as California. At Setareh Law Firm, our knowledgeable attorney helps injured accident victims by evaluating available coverage and navigating a lawsuit if the damages exceed the negligent party’s coverage.

## Required Auto Insurance Coverage in California

Every state has different requirements for the minimum liability insurance coverage needed when driving a car. In California, drivers must obtain personal liability coverage, including bodily injury liability coverage and property damage policies.

The minimum required auto insurance coverage in California includes:

* **Bodily injury**: Must have at least $15,000 for injury or death to one person and at least $30,000 for injury or death to more than one person.
* **Property damage**: Must have at least a $5,000 policy.

Proof of insurance is required during traffic stops, when registering or purchasing a car, and after being involved in an accident. Without auto insurance, a driver may face financial and legal penalties, including the risk of a license suspension. With many insurance options available, it’s essential to understand the different coverages and how

## What Are the Different Types of Car Insurance in California?

In California, several types of auto insurance are available to drivers. Depending on the car’s age, how often someone drives, previous accidents, driving records, and other considerations, it can be beneficial to have a whole liability insurance policy at the time of an accident. Additionally, medical payment coverage can help cover medical expenses for the driver and passengers, regardless of fault.

Here are the different types of car insurance options in California:

### Personal Liability Coverage

Personal liability coverage consists of the minimum liability coverage required by the state and other higher coverage policies depending on the company. With this coverage, only the damage and injuries incurred from a collision you cause and proven negligent in are covered, with specific limits per person

### Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist

Insurance companies are required to offer [uninsured motorist](https://www.setarehfirm.com/uninsured-motorist-accidents/) coverage and underinsured motorist policies, but drivers are permitted to waive these policies. Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage pays for injuries to the insured and others in the insured’s car when there is an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver who is at fault. However, this coverage is beneficial in cases where another driver is not insured or does not have enough coverage to compensate for the damage and injuries they cause in a car crash. Once in effect, the injured party may have medical coverage benefits their health insurance may not offer.

### Collision Coverage

A collision coverage policy is beneficial for accidents involving pedestrians, vehicles, and property that leave a driver’s car damaged. Covered drivers may file claims to compensate for the total damage their car endures in a collision, either as a total loss to replace the vehicle or to repair the damage. 

### Comprehensive Coverage

When cars are damaged from natural disasters, falling objects, and other circumstances where the policyholder has no control, comprehensive coverage pays for the damage. At times, comprehensive coverage is required to lease or rent a car.

### No-Fault Medical Coverage

No-fault medical coverage, such as Med Pay, is an optional coverage plan that covers medical expenses or healthcare costs and funeral expenses for the policyholder and passengers. Personal injury protection (PIP) covers medical expenses and lost wages for injured individuals in a car accident, regardless of who was at fault. Regardless of the circumstance surrounding the accident and who is at fault, this policy generally reimburses the policyholder for accident-related medical costs.

### Gap Coverage

With gap coverage, policyholders are covered financially regarding the actual cash value of their vehicle after an accident. If you have gap coverage and you finance or lease a car that is totaled, gap coverage will go into effect to cover the remaining costs of what you

### Self-Insured and DMV Cash Advance Options

California DMV offers drivers the opportunity to present acceptable forms of insurance coverage, such as a standard auto coverage policy or self-insured options. To be self-insured, drivers must present a cash deposit of $35,000 to the DMV, receive a DMV-issued self-insured certificate, or have a surety bond of $35,000 from a company licensed to do business in California. 

### Can I File an Auto Accident Claim After an Accident With an Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist?

If you are injured in a collision with a motorist who does not have insurance or whose policy is not enough to cover injuries and damages, you may still be able to recover compensation through motorist bodily injury coverage. With our skilled attorney on your case, you may find the best option to get the recovery needs you require, either with your insurance coverage, underinsured/uninsured motorists coverage, or through an injury lawsuit.
