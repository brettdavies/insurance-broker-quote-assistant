# What to Know About Texas Hail Season
When hail season is around the corner, it’s time to start getting prepared. This guide breaks down what you, as a homeowner, should know about hail season in Texas.
## When is Texas Hail Season?
![Hail storm residential roofing repairs](https://elevatedroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/Hail-Season-in-Texas-Emergency-Roof-Repair-with-Elevated-Roofing.webp)Texas hail season primarily occurs from March to May. During this time, the state often experiences severe weather, including hailstorms. However, it’s not rare for hailstorms to happen in the summer months, particularly in June and July. These storms can vary in intensity and can cause significant damage, especially to roofs, fences, windows and vehicles. Being aware of this seasonal pattern is crucial for homeowners to prepare and protect their property.
## How Bad is Texas Hail Season?
According to a hail loss study released by the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 2020, Texas led the nation in major hail events and hail loss claims between 2017 and 2019. According to the report, between 2017 and 2019, Texas hail led to 637,977 insurance claims.
## Can I Prevent Hail Damage Before a Storm?
The best way to avoid hail damage is to take preventative measures to ensure your roof is in great shape before hail season begins. Our team can perform a [courtesy roof inspection](https://elevatedroofing.com/request-free-inspection/) and provide you with a detailed photo report if you’re worried that a Texas hail storm damaged your roof. Then, we can make any repairs necessary to make sure your roof is prepared to handle the torrential rain that often comes during hail season. Another way to prevent hail damage is to remove any branches that could fall on your roof. Sometimes debris can cause even more damage than hail.
Unfortunately, there’s no stopping Mother Nature. The best thing you can do to prevent damage to your home during hail season is to have a reliable roofing contractor on standby for when the inevitable happens. When your roof is hit by hail, you can feel confident that your Elevated Roofing contractor will make your home a priority. They will be at your house the next day for an inspection or even within hours for any necessary temporary tarp covers to prevent water intrusion.
Importantly though, while you can ensure your roof is in tip top shape, a [free annual roof inspection](https://elevatedroofing.com/services/residential/roof-inspection/) can also provide you with the important documentation you will need if Texas hail pummels your neighborhood. By documenting the health of your roof before the storm hits, you can demonstrate that your rightfully deserve the insurance payout after the storm.
## What Can I Do if I Suspect Hail Caused My Roof Damage?
If you suspect that a storm damaged your roof, you may need [hail damage roof repair](https://elevatedroofing.com/services/hail-and-storm-roof-damage-repair/). The first thing you should do is have a licensed, insured, trusted and professional roofing expert assess your roof and property for hail and storm damage.
Hailstorm damage to your roof can cause visible damage. A few examples of visible damage include:
  * Patches of missing or damaged shingles
  * Debris on the roof, such as tree limbs
  * New water damage inside the house
  * Loose granules from the hail impacted shingles can get washed down the gutters after it rains, post hailstorm. You can find these typically near the gutter or downspout ends.


**Related: How to assess your roof for hail damage**
Even if you cannot find any visible damage, you don’t want to leave it unchecked. Texas hail has a sneaky way of damaging roofs just enough to go unnoticed until a much later date. Our qualified inspectors know how to assess damage that many will miss.
Roof damage can lead to structural and interior damage to your home. Have one of our professionals perform a [free roof inspection](https://elevatedroofing.com/services/residential/roof-inspection/), with no obligation to you! We can offer you a detailed photo report outlining all damage or issues found during the inspection, giving you more information about your roof’s integrity and whether it needs repairs or replacement.
## Texas Hail Season FAQ
Check out these frequently asked questions about hail season in Texas. If you don’t see your question here, just give us a call — we’ll get you the answers you need.
### Why Should I Call a Roofing Expert After a Hailstorm?
If you think a hailstorm has damaged your roof, the first step is to contact a professional roofing expert. Look for someone who is licensed, insured, and has a good reputation. They will thoroughly inspect your roof and property for any signs of hail or storm damage. A professional assessment is vital in determining the extent of the damage and the necessary repairs.
### How Long Do You Have to Claim Hail Damage on a Roof in Texas?
How long you have to make a claim with your insurance provider for hail damage will depend on your insurance policy. Each policy is different and will outline how long you have to file a claim. Typically, in Texas, it is common to have one year to file a claim. Remember though, a hailstorm can damage your roof in such a way that you may not notice for quite some time — stealing years off the life of your roof.
We recommend that you let your insurance provider know about the damage as soon as our trusted roofing experts have fully inspected your property and confirmed that there is sufficient damage to warrant a roof replacement. Your insurance company will schedule an appointment to send an adjuster to inspect the damage. Let your insurance company know in advance that you have chosen us as your roofing contractor and that you want us there for the meeting. It is important for them to be in agreement with us.
Elevated Roofing works with insurance companies every day — and we excel and helping homeowners after Texas hail damages their roofs. If we sign a contract with you (per your permission), we can speak for hours over the phone with your insurance company so you don’t have to!

### When Should My Roof Be Replaced After Texas Hail Causes Damage?
If there is visible damage after a Texas hailstorm, we recommend that you call a licensed, local and insured roofing contractor right away. Depending on the extent of the damage, your contractor may need to take [emergency roof repair measures](https://elevatedroofing.com/news-tips/emergency-roof-repair-help-arrives/) until your roof can be repaired or replaced.
Even if there is no visible damage, we recommend that you reach out to us after a storm. We provide a [free roof inspection](https://elevatedroofing.com/request-free-inspection/) at no obligation to you. We do this in a variety of ways: visually from the ground, on the roof, in your attic and sometimes even through the use of a drone. Then, we will happily go over our findings with you and provide you with a detailed inspection photo report outlining all damage or issues found during the inspection. We can determine whether your roof needs a total replacement, or if it just needs repairs.

### How Can I Tell if My Roof Has Been Damaged by Hail?
To check if your roof was damaged by Texas hail season, look for clear signs like dents or bruises on shingles or missing pieces in asphalt shingles where the granules have been knocked off. You might also notice shingles that look shiny, as the hail impact can remove their protective layer. Another indicator that Texas hail created an issue for you is seeing dents on your roof’s metal parts, such as vents or flashing.
It’s not always easy to spot hail damage from the ground, so consider getting a professional inspection for an accurate assessment. But if you notice dents on your gutters or marks on your fence, you can almost be certain your roof has hail damage.
### What Happens During a Free Roof Inspection After a Texas Hailstorm?
![Hail Storm Review - Elevated Roofing](https://elevatedroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/Hail-Storm-Review-Elevated-Roofing.jpeg)During a free roof inspection, a roofing expert will examine your roof thoroughly to assess its condition. They will look for signs of damage, wear and tear, and potential vulnerabilities. This includes checking shingles, flashing, gutters, and any roof penetrations like vents. The inspector will also assess the overall structural integrity of the roof. After the inspection, they will provide you with a detailed report on the roof’s condition, highlighting any areas that need repair or attention and an estimate to what it would cost to repair or replace your roof.
### How Long Will It Take to Fix My Roof After Hail Damage?
The time it takes to repair hail damage on your roof can vary depending on the extent of the damage. Minor repairs, like replacing a few shingles, can be completed relatively quickly, possibly within a day. More extensive damage that requires large sections of the roof to be repaired or replaced can take several days to a week.
The exact timeline will depend on factors such as the size of the roof, the availability of materials, and weather conditions. A professional roofing contractor can provide a more accurate timeline after assessing the damage.
### What Size Hail Can Damage My Roof?
While hail with a diameter of just one inch can cause severe damage to a roof that is immediately visible by the homeowner, the size of the hail stone is not the only contributing factor to damage from a Texas hailstorm. Other factors include:
  * The age of your roof
  * The angle at which the hail falls
  * The windspeed of a storm
  * The overall condition and health of your roof


So, while we highly suggest that you contact us when large hail rains down on your property, we encourage you to contact us after any Texas hailstorm involving stones greater than ½ inch.
Please keep in mind, that Texas hail can be monstrous. Texas recorded a hailstone greater than six inches in diameter in 2021 — and this year’s Texas hail hasn’t even been considered yet. _[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/rare-gargantuan-hail-texas-2078196) r_eported that during the 2025 Memorial Day weekend, DVD-sized hail stones battered parts of the state.
Check out this X post from May 26, 2025:
Recent storms have spelled disaster for homeowners in the region, so make sure you know who to turn to if it happens to you.
### Will My Homeowners Insurance Cover Hail Damage to My Roof?
Many homeowners’ insurance policies cover roof damage caused by Texas hail, but the extent of the coverage can vary. Factors such as your policy details, the age and type of your roof, and your insurance deductible can influence the coverage. If your roof is older, your insurance might only cover its depreciated value.
To make a claim, document the damage with photos and notes, and get a professional roof inspection report. Contact your insurance company as soon as possible to file the claim and provide all necessary documentation to facilitate the claims process.
