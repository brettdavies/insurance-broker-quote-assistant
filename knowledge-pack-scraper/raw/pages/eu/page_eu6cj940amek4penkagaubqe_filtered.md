## Why a GEICO Defensive Driving Course Is a Good Idea

In general, GEICO defensive driving courses improve students’ driving skills by teaching them how to react effectively in hazardous situations. Main topics include how to drive in bad weather and on wet or icy roads, how to correct course if you lose control, how to veer off the roadway safely, and how to react if something crosses into your lane suddenly. Courses also cover the dangers of road rage, speeding, aggressive driving and driving under the influence.

GEICO’s defensive-driving course discount is available in most (but not all) states, and rules and qualifications vary. GEICO has a [convenient directory](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/) to help you learn more about the defensive driving requirements in your state.
