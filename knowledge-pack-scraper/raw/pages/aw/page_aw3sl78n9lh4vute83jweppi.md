#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/). 
Methodology Chevron down icon
Zebra tip: Compare policies based on total costs, not discount
40% of customers reported switching carriers specifically to bundle their policies, but this is only a good idea if the math lines up.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-for-renters/#footnote-1) For example, a 10% bundling discount on a $500 premium ($450 total) still costs more than a $425 quote with no discount.
Similarly, one company might be cheaper for renters insurance but more expensive for auto insurance. This is because companies price each line of insurance differently based on their unique risk models.

## The best car insurance companies for renters
The Zebra surveyed customers on online experience, claims satisfaction, ease of use, customer service, trust, and willingness to recommend.[[2]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-for-renters/#footnote-2) Renters rated USAA as the top auto carrier, excelling in every category. State Farm and Nationwide also performed well, ranking in the top five for trust, customer service, ease of use, and online satisfaction.
###  Best for Military 
USAA tied with State Farm at 4.6/5 but is limited to military members and their families.
###  Best for Most Renters 
State Farm tied with USAA with a 4.6/5, making it a great choice for most renters looking to bundle.
###  Runner-Up 
Nationwide came in a close second with a respectable score of 4.4/5.

Zebra tip: Why best might beat cheapest
Sometimes, paying a bit more means better service, smoother claims, and fewer headaches. The “best” bundle isn’t just about cost—it’s about value.
* * *
## How to decide if bundling is right for you
Bundling your auto and renters insurance can save you money and simplify your policies—but not always. Here's how to decide if bundling is right for you:
Compare quotes for bundling AND for buying each policy from different companies
The company that has the best auto insurance rate might not necessarily have the best renters insurance rate, even with a hefty bundling discount.
**Insider tip:** Our Head of Agency, [Katie Gold](https://www.thezebra.com/about/katie-gold/), encourages going line by line when comparing policies: "A lot of people focus only on the cost of insurance without truly comparing coverage apples to apples....Often, you’ll discover that certain coverages were removed, limits were lowered, or deductibles were increased. It’s essential to ensure all coverages are equal first, and then compare the price."
Weigh your coverage needs
Ensure the bundled package doesn’t limit your coverage needs or force compromises. For example, a bundle might offer great auto coverage but limit renters insurance to lower property limits or exclude protections of certain valuables.
Check for additional discounts
Some providers offer other discounts—like good driver or claims-free discounts—that can also affect the final price you pay for coverage.
Review customer service ratings
Make sure the provider offering the bundle has strong customer service and claims satisfaction ratings. [Read our reviews of insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/).
Ask about subsidiaries
Some insurers use subsidiaries for certain lines of insurance, especially renters and homeowners. For example, your auto insurance might be handled by the parent company, while renters insurance is managed by a subsidiary with separate claims processes, customer service teams, or coverage options. 
It's important to understand which company handles each part of your bundle and review their individual coverage terms and service ratings.
### When to bundle auto and renters insurance
Bundle auto and renters if:
  * The total cost bundled is less than the total cost of both policies bought from separate companies.
  * Both policies' coverage options meet your needs.
  * You prioritize convenience and have confirmed bundling won’t result in separate bills or claims processes from a subsidiary.
  * The insurer (and, if relevant, their subsidiary) has good customer service and claims satisfaction ratings.


Do not bundle auto and renters if:
  * Having policies with two different companies has a cheaper total cost
  * The bundled policies don’t fully meet your coverage needs or force compromises.
  * Renters coverage is provided through a subsidiary with a weaker reputation.
  * Convenience is your priority and the company only offers renters insurance through a subsidiary that requires separate bills, claims processes, and service teams.

## FAQs about bundling auto and renters insurance
Is bundling auto and renters insurance always cheaper? Chevron down icon
While you can save an average of 5% bundling auto and renters insurance, bundling isn't always cheaper. For example, a quote with a 10% bundling discount on a $500 premium ($450 total) will cost more than a $425 quote with no discount. Always compare total cost and don't get distracted by large discounts.
Can I still customize my coverage with a bundled policy? Chevron down icon
Most providers allow you to tailor your car and renters insurance coverage to meet your specific needs, even within a bundle. However, if you have high-value belongings or a custom car, you may need separate policies to get the coverage you want.
How can I tell if my renters policy is handled by a subsidiary? Chevron down icon
Ask your insurer directly or check your policy details. If a subsidiary manages your renters insurance, you may face separate billing and claims processes, reducing the convenience of bundling.
Why do renters not receive as high of a bundling discount as homeowners? Chevron down icon
Renters insurance discounts are smaller because renters policies are lower risk and cost less, covering only belongings and liability—not the building structure. With lower premiums, there’s less room for large percentage discounts.
