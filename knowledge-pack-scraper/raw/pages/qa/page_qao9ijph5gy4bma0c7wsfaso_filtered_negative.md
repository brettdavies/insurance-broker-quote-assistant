To legally operate a motor vehicle registered in Florida, you must have personal injury protection (PIP). This type of insurance protects you in the event of a car accident where you and your passengers are injured. In addition to PIP insurance payments, you may be entitled to other damages when another driver is deemed to be at fault and negligent. To find out more about the types of compensation you could be entitled to receive, it is highly recommended you speak with a qualified [Tampa car accident attorney](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/areas-of-practice/tampa-car-accident-lawyer/).
![A Man With A Broken Leg Is Trying To Walk With Crutches After A Personal Injury. ](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Florida-Personal-Injury-Protection-Requirements.jpg)
* * *
* **Emergency medical care:** If you need an emergency room visit to treat your injuries, PIP covers will help cover these costs
* **Some non-emergency medical care:** For less severe injuries, PIP covers up to $2,500 in medical expenses. For example, you may be experiencing lower back pain from the accident and need treatment.
* **Ambulatory services:** PIP covers the costs of an ambulance when you need to be transported to the nearest hospital immediately due to your injuries sustained in a car accident
* **Rehabilitation:** Any occupational or physical therapy treatment you need as part of your recovery from your car crash injuries is covered by PIP
* **60% of lost wages:** PIP will pay you 60% of your wages if you are unable to work due to your injuries
* **Death benefits:** In the unfortunate event a loved one dies due to their injuries, PIP will help cover funeral costs. It can also provide some financial support for the surviving family during this difficult time.
* * *
Florida laws require all drivers to carry PIP insurance and provide proof of this coverage before legally registering a vehicle in the state and obtaining a license plate. The current requirements for PIP insurance are detailed in [Florida statute 627.736](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.736.html). The other required insurance coverages needed to register, plate, and drive a vehicle in Florida are discussed in [Florida statute 324.021](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0324/Sections/0324.021.html).
## About Jack G. Bernstein Esq.
Personal Injury Lawyer
![Car Accident Lawyer Tampa - Jack Bernstein](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20495%20664'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
* * *
Deciding whether [Florida’s minimum coverages](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/florida-car-insurance/state-laws-fl/) are enough is a personal decision. However, the required minimum amounts could be considered relatively low. In the event you are in a car accident and sustain injuries or cause injuries to others, with only the minimum coverage, your insurance will only pay up to $10,000.
* **Bodily injury liability (BIL):** When you are at fault for the accident, BIL pays for the other person’s injuries
* **Collision:** Collision covers the costs of repairing or replacing your damaged vehicle
* **Comprehensive:** Comprehensive coverage pays to repair or replace your vehicle if it is stolen, vandalized, or damaged by weather events, such as storms and floods
* **Medical payments/Med Pay:** Medical payments, also called Med Pay, cover the costs of you and any injured passengers in your vehicle, regardless of who was at fault for the accident
* **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage:**[Uninsured motorist](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/blog/when-to-get-an-attorney-for-a-car-accident/) coverage pays for your injuries when the other driver is at fault and does not have insurance. Underinsurance motorist coverage provides added protection when the other driver is at fault and does not have sufficient coverage.
* * *
Florida has a [14-day rule](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/blog/floridas-14-day-pip-rule/) for filing PIP claims after car accidents. This is because the state wants to ensure any injuries are treated promptly. Failing to file a claim within this time could result in you having to pay for any related medical expenses and losses out of your own pocket.
