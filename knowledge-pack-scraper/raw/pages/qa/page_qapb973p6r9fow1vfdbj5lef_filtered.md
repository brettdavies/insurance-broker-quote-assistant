Having continuous insurance coverage is crucial for protection, so it’s important to pay your State Farm insurance bills on time. State Farm makes it easy to pay online through their website or mobile app. This article will outline the different online payment options State Farm offers and provide tips for managing your policy payments.

## Creating an Online Account

The most convenient way to pay your State Farm insurance bill is by setting up an online account at wwwstatefarmcom. In your account you can

* View billing statements, payment history, and policy documents
* Set up autopay or schedule one-time payments
* Update payment methods and contact information
* Go paperless

With an online account, you can log in anytime to check your balance, make a payment, and manage your policy

## Paying as a Guest

If you don’t want to create an account, you can make one-time payments on State Farm’s website as a guest. You’ll need to enter your phone number, date of birth, or the key code from your bill.

This is good for quick payments, but you won’t have access to your full account without registering for online access.

## Paying Over the Phone

You can also make payments by calling State Farm directly at 1-800-440-0998. Their automated system is available 24/7 and you’ll need to provide your phone number and date of birth.

This is a good option if you prefer speaking to a live agent or don’t want to pay online. Phone payments can be made via credit/debit card or bank account information.

## Automatic Payments Through Your Bank

Many banks allow customers to schedule automatic recurring payments to companies like State Farm. You can set this up through your bank’s online bill pay program.

Provide your bank with:

* State Farm as the payee
* Your 10-digit State Farm policy number
* State Farm’s mailing address:  
  State Farm Insurance  
  PO Box 588002  
  North Metro, GA 30029

Schedule the payments to align with your monthly premium due date. Update the payment amount if your premium changes upon policy renewal each year.

## Paying by Mail

You always have the option to pay via check or money order by mailing your payment to State Farm. Make sure to include your bill stub and write your policy number on the check itself.

Send mailed payments to the address above allowing 5-7 business days for delivery to avoid any lapse in coverage.

## Payment Plan Options

If you’re having trouble paying your premium in full, State Farm may offer payment plan options to help break up the cost into smaller monthly payments.

Contact your local State Farm agent to discuss your policy status and see if you qualify for an installment payment program. This can prevent any gap in coverage.

## Avoiding Lapsed Payments

It’s essential to pay your State Farm insurance bill on time each month. If your payment is late, you’ll receive a cancellation notice with a due date to pay before your policy is cancelled.

Contact your agent right away if you get a late notice so you can arrange payment. A lapse in coverage can lead to higher rates when reapplying.
