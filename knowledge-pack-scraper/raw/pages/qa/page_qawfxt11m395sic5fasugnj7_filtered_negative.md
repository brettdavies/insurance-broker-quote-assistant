* [FAQ: High-risk car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/high-risk-auto-insurance.html#FAQ_Highrisk_car_insurance)
**Drivers with multiple tickets or accidents on their record:** A single ticket or minor fender bender might not make you a high-risk driver, but multiple tickets probably will. You also might be deemed a greater risk if you have a history of multiple at-fault accidents.
**Drivers convicted of a serious violation:** A DUI, reckless driving or other serious violation can immediately land you in the high-risk category. These could also require you to get an SR-22, a state-mandated certificate indicating you carry a policy that meets the [state's minimum insurance coverage requirements](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/understanding-minimum-car-insurance-requirements.html).
**Drivers who have been caught driving uninsured:** If you have been caught [driving uninsured](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/driving-without-insurance-cost.aspx), insurance companies will likely see you as riskier to insure in the future.
**Drivers with bad credit:** Drivers with poor credit-based insurance scores tend to file more frequent claims, which may result in them being categorized as high-risk. A handful of states have outlawed using credit in car insurance pricing.
