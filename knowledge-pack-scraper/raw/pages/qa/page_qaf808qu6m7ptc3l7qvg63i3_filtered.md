## How to Get Cheap Car Insurance Premiums After an Accident

An accident increases your car insurance premiums 24% on average, adding $208 annually. Offset this increase by switching providers, comparing quotes regularly, bundling policies, maximizing discounts and adjusting coverage options like deductibles or accident forgiveness.

![carVsCar icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car-vs-car_j2xwey.svg)

Switch car insurance companies

Your insurer may raise your rates at renewal, but competitors price accidents differently. [Switch car insurance after an accident](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/switching-car-insurance-after-an-accident/) anytime; you don't need to wait for renewal. Work with your previous insurer if you filed a claim to ensure smooth transition.

![find icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/find_nzkmut.svg)

Shop around with multiple providers

Get quotes from at least three providers every six months. Insurance companies use different pricing models, so rates vary widely. Accidents affect your rates less over time, and insurers regularly adjust pricing, so shopping around helps you capture better deals.

![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)

Bundle your home and car insurance policies

[Home and auto bundles](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/) result in lower rates. Insuring multiple vehicles with the same company also qualifies you for discounts. Ask about bundling options for potential savings.

![discount icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/discount_mammcz.svg)

Seek out other discounts

Accidents don't disqualify you from other discounts. Save on premiums by paying your policy in full, installing safety or security devices or participating in telematics programs like Progressive's Snapshot.

![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)

Switch to a less expensive vehicle

Your vehicle type affects insurance costs. Cars with better safety features or lower repair costs cost less to insure. Vehicles like the Toyota Camry, known for safety and affordability, help lower premiums.

![computer icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/computer_njvlhk.svg)

Compare Quotes Regularly

[Compare quotes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/) every six months as rates change frequently. Insurers adjust their pricing models regularly, and you may find better deals by shopping around.

![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)

Consider Higher Deductibles

Increasing your deductible from $500 to $1,000 lowers your premium by 10% to 15%. Deductibles don't apply to liability coverage, which pays for damage you cause to others, only to comprehensive and collision coverage for your vehicle.

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

Ask About Accident Forgiveness

Ask about accident forgiveness before another accident occurs. Adding this coverage now protects you from rate increases if you have a future accident.

![uninsured icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/uninsured_jck1df.svg)

Maintain Continuous Coverage

Avoid gaps in coverage to prevent additional penalties. Coverage gaps result in higher rates when you restart your policy because insurers view lapses as increased risk.

![graduationCap icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/graduation_cap_gnssrr.svg)

Complete Defensive Driving Courses

State-approved defensive driving programs qualify you for 5% to 10% discounts with many insurers. Check with your provider about eligible courses in your state.

## What Makes Car Insurance Cheaper After an Accident?

Insurance companies evaluate multiple factors when setting premiums for drivers with accidents. Understanding these factors helps you target the right insurers and coverage options for the most affordable rates.

### Insurance Company Risk Assessment Policies

Insurers use different algorithms to calculate risk and set rates after accidents. Some companies are more forgiving than others:

* **State Farm:** Often offers the lowest rates for single-accident drivers
* **Travelers:** Includes accident forgiveness in many policies automatically
* **Progressive:** Uses Snapshot technology to focus on current driving behavior rather than past accidents
* **GEICO:** Provides substantial military and federal employee discounts that offset accident penalties
* **Auto-Owners:** Regional focus allows for more personalized risk assessment

### Time Since Accident

Most insurers reduce penalties after three years, with full rate restoration after five years. Insurance companies view recent accidents (within 12 months) as the highest risk, with penalties decreasing gradually. After three years, many insurers treat you like drivers with clean records.

### Accident Severity and Fault Status

Minor fender-benders with no injuries result in smaller rate increases than accidents involving injuries or major property damage. At-fault accidents carry higher penalties than not-at-fault incidents. Total payout amount matters: a $500 fender-bender affects your rates less than a $15,000 accident with medical claims.

### Your Overall Driving Record

Insurers review your driving history over three to five years, including speeding tickets, DUIs and other violations. Drivers with one accident but no other infractions qualify for standard rates, while those with multiple incidents have higher premiums.

### Geographic Location Impact

Urban areas with higher accident frequencies may impose smaller penalties compared to rural areas. Some states limit how much insurers can increase rates after accidents, while others allow more pricing flexibility.

### Credit Score and Financial Stability

In states where allowed, insurers consider your credit score when setting rates after an accident. Drivers with excellent credit receive smaller rate increases than those with poor credit.

## How Much Does Car Insurance Go Up After an Accident?

Full coverage costs increase by 24% on average after an at-fault accident, adding about $208 annually. Premiums rise because insurers view drivers with accidents as higher risks.

### Premium Increase After a Car Accident

**Drivers with an accident pay:**$208 more

### Factors That Raise Insurance Rates After an Accident

Your insurance premium increases depend on several factors beyond just having an accident. Some factors like your address and credit score are within your control, while others such as age and local insurance costs are not.

![money2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/money_c8wtrb.svg)

State Laws

Car insurance rate increases vary by state after an at-fault accident. State laws regulate how much insurers can raise rates to ensure reasonable increases. Understanding these guidelines helps you anticipate changes in costs.

![buyingACar icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/buying-a-car_cdq2ip.svg)

Age

[Age affects rate changes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/average-car-insurance-rates-by-age-and-gender/) after an accident. Rates are lowest from your early 20s through your 60s. Younger drivers face higher rates due to inexperience, while older drivers may see increases because of slower reaction times.

![find icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/find_nzkmut.svg)

Fault Status

At-fault accidents increase your rates more than not-at-fault accidents. Some insurers offer accident forgiveness that waives the first at-fault incident.

![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)

Insurance Provider

Each company has different policies for rate increases after accidents. Some insurers are more forgiving than others when calculating your new premium.

![handcuffs2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/handcuffs_2_mug1xe.svg)

Other Infractions

Multiple violations like speeding tickets or DUIs combined with an accident compound your rate increase.

![injury icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/injury_ykcx1b.svg)

Injuries or Severity of the Accident

Accidents involving injuries or major property damage result in larger insurance payouts and higher rate increases than minor fender-benders.

Consider consulting an attorney when injuries are severe or long-term, fault is disputed between insurance companies, settlement offers seem unreasonably low compared to your damages, or the other driver was [uninsured or underinsured](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-uninsured-motorist-insurance-and-do-you-need-it/). Legal representation becomes valuable if your claim is denied or delayed without a reasonable explanation, you're pressured to settle quickly or multiple parties are involved, requiring a complex liability determination.

## How Long Do Accidents Stay on Your Record?

A car accident stays on your record for three to five years, but this varies depending on where you live, the accident's severity and any other infractions involved. An at-fault accident may be removed from your record if no major charges like [DUI](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-after-a-dui/) or [reckless driving](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/) were added. Most insurers base premiums on your driving history for the past three to five years, which is why accident forgiveness is valuable for drivers seeking insurance after their first accident.

## What Happens if You Get Into a Car Accident Without Insurance?

Getting into a car accident without insurance triggers immediate legal and financial consequences that can affect you for years. Here's what you'll face across different areas:

### Immediate Legal Consequences

Most states immediately suspend your driver's license after a car accident without insurance. Suspension periods range between 30 days and one year, depending on your state's laws and the accident's severity.

**State-Specific Penalties for Car Accidents With No Insurance**

Driving without insurance carries severe penalties in both no-fault and at-fault states, including immediate license suspension and mandatory SR-22 filing requirements. At-fault states impose additional consequences like vehicle impoundment and direct civil lawsuit exposure when drivers cause car accidents. While each state establishes minimum insurance coverage requirements, these state minimums provide inadequate financial protection during serious accidents, leaving uninsured drivers vulnerable to out-of-pocket expenses.

### Financial Responsibility Requirements

After a car accident without insurance, drivers must demonstrate financial responsibility to regain driving privileges. This process requires:

* SR-22 certificate filing costing $25 to $50 annually for three to five years
* Complete payment of outstanding claims and damages
* Proof of future insurance coverage meeting state minimum requirements

Violations carry substantial financial penalties: first offenses range from $500 to $2,500 depending on state laws, repeat offenses escalate to $1,000 to $5,000 plus potential jail time, and additional court costs and administrative fees add $200 to $500 to total expenses.

### Financial Liability When You Have a Car Accident Without Insurance

Without insurance coverage after a car accident, drivers become personally liable for extensive financial damages, including all property damage to other vehicles and property, medical expenses for injured parties that can reach $100,000+ per person, legal fees if sued by other parties, lost wages for injured parties, and pain and suffering damages awarded by courts.

### Future Insurance Consequences

A car accident without insurance creates long-term consequences for future coverage affordability. Drivers become classified as "high-risk" requiring expensive [SR-22 policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-sr-22-insurance/).

An accident on your record makes comparison shopping essential because insurers price violations differently, and finding the most forgiving companies saves you hundreds annually. We built this analysis to show you which insurers offer the best combination of affordable rates and reliable service for drivers with at-fault accidents on their records.

We gathered rate data from hundreds of insurance companies and evaluated which ones treat drivers with accidents most fairly. Our analysis reveals both what you'll pay and which companies actually deliver quality service when you file claims.

We evaluated rates from major national and regional insurers using standardized driver profiles with one at-fault accident. Our analysis included both minimum coverage and full coverage quotes to show the complete cost picture across different coverage levels, since your choice between basic liability and comprehensive protection significantly affects your premium after an accident.

We analyzed insurer quality using data from independent authorities:

* **AM Best:** Credit ratings and financial stability data showing which companies remain reliable long-term
* **J.D. Power:** Customer satisfaction rankings and claims experience research
* **National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC):** Consumer complaint ratios and regulatory data
* **Quadrant Information Services:** Comparative pricing analytics across all major insurers

We combined affordability with reliability to identify insurers that won't just offer competitive rates after an accident but will also deliver strong claims service when you need it. This approach helps you find financial protection that fits your budget without sacrificing coverage quality.

Drivers with accidents face two challenges: higher premiums from most insurers and the risk of claim denials or poor service from companies willing to accept high-risk customers. Our research identifies which insurers balance fair pricing with solid claims handling, so you get coverage that actually protects you financially when another accident occurs.
