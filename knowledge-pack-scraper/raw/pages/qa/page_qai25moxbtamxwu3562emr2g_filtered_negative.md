# Does Geico Cover Rental Cars?
PUBLISHED ON Jun, 04 2023  WRITTEN BY: Gil Farkash

Navigating the world of auto insurance can be a complex task, especially when it comes to understanding the specifics of coverage. One common query among policyholders is whether their insurance extends to rental cars. In this context, we will be focusing on one of the leading insurance providers in the United States: Geico.
Geico is renowned for its wide range of insurance policies, including [auto insurance](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/). But the question remains, does Geico cover rental cars? **The answer is not a simple “yes” or “no”** as it largely depends on the type of Geico auto insurance policy you hold, the reason for renting the car, and where you are planning to drive the rental vehicle.
In this article, we will delve into Geico’s policy terms and conditions to clarify under what circumstances rental cars are covered, thereby providing a comprehensive guide to understanding Geico’s rental car coverage.
## Rental Car Coverage: The Basics
### What rental car coverage generally includes
Rental car insurance typically includes several types of coverage. Here’s a general breakdown:
1. [**Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)/Loss Damage Waiver (LDW)**](https://carinsurent.com/car-rental-insurance/car-rental-collision-and-loss-damage-waiver-explained/): This is not traditional insurance, but rather a waiver that says the rental car company will not come after you for collision costs in case the rental car is damaged or stolen. There may be exclusions, so it’s important to read the terms and conditions.
2. [**Supplemental Liability Protection (SLP)**](https://carinsurent.com/car-rental-insurance/supplemental-liability-insurance//): This provides extra liability protection for costs associated with damage or injuries to other people or property if you’re at fault in an accident.
3. **[Personal Accident Insurance](https://carinsurent.com/car-rental-insurance/rental-car-insurance-what-is-it-how-does-it-work/) (PAI)**: This covers medical costs for you and your passengers if you’re involved in an accident.
4. **Personal Effects Coverage (PEC)**: This coverage protects personal belongings that are stolen from the rental car.
5. **Roadside Assistance**: Some rental car companies offer roadside assistance coverage for emergencies such as a flat tire, lockouts, and towing.
It’s important to remember that these coverage options can vary depending on the rental car company and the country in which you’re renting. Additionally, you may already have some of these coverage types through your personal auto insurance policy or [credit card benefits](https://carinsurent.com/guides/car-rental-insurance-guides/credit-card-rental-car-insurance-coverage-and-limitations/). Always read the terms and conditions carefully and check with your own insurance provider or credit card company before opting for additional rental car coverage.
### Importance and benefits of having rental car coverage
Having rental car coverage can provide several key benefits and serve as an important safeguard in certain circumstances. Here are a few reasons why it’s crucial:
1. **Financial Protection**: In the event of an accident or theft, having rental car insurance can save you from having to pay out of pocket for repair or replacement costs.
2. **Peace of Mind**: Knowing you’re covered can make your rental experience more relaxing and enjoyable. You won’t have to worry about potential accidents or incidents impacting your finances.
3. **Personal Effects Coverage**: If your personal belongings are stolen from the rental vehicle, rental car insurance can provide coverage, which your regular auto insurance might not offer.
4. **Gap Coverage**: Rental car companies may charge fees for “loss of use” (when the car can’t be rented out while it’s being repaired) and diminished value (the reduction in a vehicle’s value after an accident). Many regular insurance policies don’t cover these charges, but some rental car insurance does.
Remember, before purchasing rental car insurance, it’s important to check your existing auto insurance policy and any coverage provided by your credit card company to avoid buying unnecessary coverage. It’s also crucial to understand the details of any rental car coverage you consider, as policies and protections can vary widely.
## Geico’s Rental Car Insurance Policies
When it comes to rental cars, Geico’s coverage depends largely on the type of auto insurance policy you have with them.
1. **Personal Auto Policy**: If you have a personal auto insurance policy with Geico, the coverage will usually extend to a rental car. This means whatever coverage you have on your personal vehicle (such as liability, comprehensive, or collision) will apply to the rental car as well. **It’s essential to note that this is generally true only for rentals used for personal use and not for business.**
2. **Liability Insurance**: Geico’s Liability Insurance is a crucial component of its auto insurance policies. It’s designed to protect drivers financially in the event they are at fault in an accident that results in bodily injury to others or damage to their property.
3. ****Collision and Comprehensive Insurance:**** Geico’s auto insurance policies include optional Collision and Comprehensive coverages that provide financial protection for your vehicle in a variety of situations. **Geico** **Collision Coverage** helps pay for repair or replacement costs if your vehicle is damaged in a collision with another vehicle or an object (like a tree or a building), or if your vehicle flips over. Collision coverage applies regardless of who is at fault in the accident. When you purchase the add-on, you specify particular rental car reimbursement limits. For instance, if you select a $25 per day/$750 per claim cap for your rental reimbursement, GEICO will only cover up to $25 per day and a maximum of $750 per claim. **An important factor to consider is your deductible**, which is the amount you’ll pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. The lower the deductible, the higher the premium, and vice versa.
4. **Rental Car Reimbursement**: Geico offers rental car reimbursement as an optional coverage that you can add to your personal auto policy. If your vehicle is covered and is being repaired due to a covered loss, this coverage will reimburse the cost of a rental car up to your policy limits. It’s important to remember that this is not rental car insurance, but rather a coverage that pays for your rental car while your vehicle is being repaired.
5. **International Rentals**: Geico’s coverage might not extend to all countries. If you’re planning to rent a car abroad, you should contact Geico directly to understand the specifics of your coverage.
**It’s worth mentioning that Geico’s auto insurance policy does not cover certain charges that rental car companies might levy in the event of damage, like “loss of use” fees.**

## 10 Reasons to Consider CarInsuRent Car Rental Excess Insurance
1. **Zero Deductible** – In the event of an accident, you do not want to pay the [deductible](https://carinsurent.com/car-hire-excess-insurance/what-is-car-hire-excess-insurance/). Your rental car would also be subject to the high deductible on your auto insurance. Paying for [car rental excess insurance](https://carinsurent.com/) and knowing you won’t be responsible for more than that amount may give you piece of mind.
2. **Make no claim on your personal insurance**. Perhaps you’ve had a claim recently and don’t want your premium to skyrocket. You might want to err on the side of caution and purchase insurance because filing two claims in a single year will dramatically increase your insurance costs.
3. **Coverage in Foreign Countries**: If you’re traveling internationally, your personal auto insurance policy may not provide coverage. Rental car insurance ensures you’re covered in these situations.
4. **Theft Protection**: If the rental car is stolen, rental car insurance could cover the cost of the stolen vehicle.
5. **Protection Against Vandalism**: Car rental insurance can cover the cost of repairs if the car is vandalized.
6. **Gap Coverage**: Car rental companies may charge fees for “loss of use” and diminished value if their car gets damaged. These charges might not be covered by your regular insurance, but can be covered by rental car insurance.
7. **Personal Effects Coverage**: This covers the theft of personal items from the rental car.
8. **Convenience and Peace of Mind**: By opting for car rental insurance, you can avoid dealing with your own insurance company, and you don’t have to worry about your premiums increasing in case of an accident.
9. **Coverage in Case of Insufficient Personal Auto Insurance**: If your personal auto insurance has a high deductible or low limits, rental car insurance can provide additional protection. If you are renting a pricey car, keep in mind that the amount of coverage provided by your Geico auto insurance is limited to the policy’s maximum. For your enjoyable Corvette rental weekend, you might want to increase your coverage. Check your coverage limits frequently.
10. **Coverage for Additional Drivers**: If you plan to share the driving responsibilities with someone else during your rental period, rental insurance can ensure that all drivers are covered.

With the high fees associated with rental car insurance, many travelers wonder if it’s truly necessary or just a money-making scheme by rental companies. Are there alternative options that provide adequate coverage without breaking the bank?
