* The agent that helped me with my insurance from APlus Insurance “Veronica Moss” went up above and beyond to make sure that I got the best rate possible. She was very patient with me, as I knew nothing about cell phones or how to use them, & she walked me through step by step to make sure I received my policy, and cards on my phone to show for proof as having met the state requirements. She was very patient, professional, and caring all in one! I will definitely refer everyone to her for all of their insurance needs! If I had a #1 employee, she would be the one, without a doubt!! I am very pleased 😀!! Thank you, Veronica M. Andrew..

This company realizes that people need a dependable company, great customer service and online services that make it simple and fast for busy customers to report claims.

For Example, if you look at the various company ratings, Progressive scores exceptional where it counts the most.

2025 Progressive Auto & ASI (Homeowners) Insurance

## **History****of Progressive**

* Initially, Progressive was started in the thirties by two lawyers seeking a way to provide protection and security for automobile owners through insurance.
* They were one of the first companies that created an installment payment concept to make insurance more affordable and easier for customers.
* By the nineties, this insurer was one of the first insurers to begin supplying customers with an option for comparison shopping.
* Today, they average sales in the billions and is one of the largest US auto insurance companies.

## **Progressive Insurance Services**

* Progressive offers a large number of products to suit the needs of just about everybody.
* They sell recreational and vehicle coverage, property and home coverage and a wide assortment of insurance products to match the needs of your lifestyle.
* For instance, Progressive in [Denver](https://learnandserve.org/denver-car-insurance/ "Denver"), Colorado is ready to cater to the needs of active, outdoor enthusiasts. Whether you need auto, RV, boat, snowmobile, ATV (all terrain vehicle) or PWC (personal water craft), they have you covered.
* Do you need commercial auto insurance? You might! If you use your vehicle for your business or work(excluding simply using it for commuting) on a regular basis, you could need more coverage than what a simple personal policy will provide. Progressive can help you get coverage for that as well. Find out if you should think about obtaining a commercial policy.
* Many people out there are using their vehicles for ridesharing and food delivery services like Uber, Uber-Eats, Lyft, etc…and even more people don’t realize they need to have extra coverage

  I had an extremely pleasant and proficient experience with Crystal Farley when applying for and receiving auto insurance through your firm. Crystal was friendly and professional and went above and beyond her duties to facilitate my insurance needs. Based on her impeccable customer service skills, knowledge of the industry, and the speed and efficiency she worked with, I would not only recommend your company to others seeking insurance services, but feel she is deserving of a raise and or a promotion.
