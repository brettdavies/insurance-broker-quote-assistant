Lower insurance
###  1. Nebraska - $6,605
###  2. Louisiana - $6,479
###  3. Oklahoma - $6,472
###  1. Hawaii - $733
###  2. Delaware - $1,154
###  3. Oregon - $1,175
Oregon comes third on the list when it comes to the cheapest home insurance premiums, with an average annual cost of $1,175. One of the reasons for Oregon’s home insurance premiums being lower could be that the climate is fairly mild with weather events like tornadoes and hailstorms occurring quite rarely. This may mean the likelihood of homes being damaged or destroyed is fairly low compared to some states where the weather is more volatile.
