#  **ACTUARIAL STANDARD OF PRACTICE NO. 24****
**
**Compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation
**
**TO:** Members of Actuarial Organizations Governed by the Standards of Practice of the Actuarial Standards Board and Other Persons Interested in Compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation
This document contains the final version of the revision of ASOP No. 24, _Compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation._
The ASB adopted ASOP No. 24, _Compliance with the NAIC Life Illustrations Model Regulation_, in 1995. Since the promulgation of the original standard, life insurance product innovation has continued. In 2007, ASOP No. 24 was revised to be consistent with the current ASOP format and to update and reflect current, appropriate actuarial practices with respect to illustrations prepared in compliance with the _Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation_(_Model_). In 2015, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners released Actuarial Guideline 49 (AG 49) to clarify certain requirements of the _Model_ related to policies with index-based interest credits and further amended AG 49 in September 2016. The ASOP was revised to reflect the changes effected through AG 49, to clarify certain guidance, and to be consistent with the current style and format used for ASOPs.

_The Actuarial Standards Board (ASB) sets standards for appropriate actuarial practice in the United States through the development and promulgation of Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOPs). These ASOPs describe the procedures an actuary should follow when performing actuarial services and identify what the actuary should disclose when communicating the results of those services._
This actuarial standard of practice (ASOP) provides guidance to actuaries when performing professional services pursuant to applicable law based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) _Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation_ (_Model_) and related NAIC actuarial guidelines or when performing professional services with respect to illustrations represented to be in accordance with the _Model_.
This standard applies to actuaries when performing professional services to provide or support an actuarial certification pursuant to an applicable law based on the _Model_. The _Model_ applies to illustrations, both for proposals and in-force policies, as described in the _Model_, for group and individual life insurance other than variable life insurance. The _Model_ does not apply to individual and group annuity contracts, credit life insurance, and life insurance policies with no illustrated death benefits on any individual exceeding $10,000. NAIC Actuarial Guideline 49 (AG 49) is related to the _Model_ and applies to certain life insurance policies that are subject to the _Model_ and that provide interest credits linked to an external index or indices.
This standard applies to actuaries when performing professional services with respect to illustrations in the absence of applicable regulations if the illustrations are to be represented as being in accordance with the _Model_.
This standard does not apply to actuaries when performing professional services with respect to the determination of nonguaranteed elements payable. Determination of these items, as well as illustrations not included in the scope of this ASOP, are covered by ASOP No. 2, _Nonguaranteed Charges or Benefits for Life Insurance Policies and Annuity Contracts_, or ASOP No. 15, _Dividends for Individual Participating Life Insurance, Annuities, and Disability Insurance._
The terms below are defined for use in this actuarial standard of practice. Definitions 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 are intended to conform to those in the _Model_.
A scale of nonguaranteed elements, certified annually by the illustration actuary, constituting a limit on illustrations currently being illustrated by an insurer that is reasonably based on actual recent historical experience and that satisfies the requirements set forth in the _Model.
_
### 2.5 Experience Factor Class
An actuary who is appointed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the _Model_.
The _Model_ contains detailed instructions, tech­nical requirements, and prohibitions regarding many aspects of illustrations. Actuaries providing professional services within the scope of this standard should be familiar with the _Model,_ AG 49, any applicable state law based on the _Model_ (including state variations), and this standard.
Before accepting an appointment as an illustration actuary, the actuary should determine that he or she meets the qualifications described in the _Qualification Standards for Actuaries Issuing Statements of Actuarial Opinion in the United States_. The appointment should be in writing and should describe the scope of the illustration actuary’s responsibilities and establish the effective date. Acceptance of or withdrawal from the position should also be in writing.
The actuary should ensure that the illustrated scale meets the requirements imposed by the _Model_ as follows.
The actuary should use experience as analyzed within the insurer’s nonguaranteed element framework when setting experience factors underlying the disciplined current scale. To the extent actual experience is determinable, available, and credible, the actuary should use actual experience when setting experience factors underlying the disciplined current scale. When such suitable data are lacking, experience factors should be derived in a reasonable and appropriate manner from actual experience of other similar classes of business. Similar classes may be found within the same company, may be found in other companies, or may be from other sources, in that order of preference. When determining the extent to which actual experience is credible, the actuary should refer to ASOP No. 25, _Credibility Procedures_. As required by the _Model_, the experience factors underlying the disciplined current scale may not include any projected trends of improvement nor any assumed improvements in experience beyond the effective date of the illustrated scale, except as provided in section 3.8.
e. All Other Expenses: As described in the _Model_, the actuary should consider whether the min­imum expenses to be used in the calculation of the disciplined current scale for all policy forms during the certification year are based on sections (1), (2), or (3) below and are subject to the criteria that follow them:
If no GRET is approved and available, the _Model_ requires the use of fully allocated expenses. If a GRET is approved and available, the _Model_ allows the use of either a GRET or fully allocated expenses. The _Model_ permits the use of marginally allocated expenses only to the extent that they generate aggregate expenses that are at least as large as those generated by a GRET.
Actual experience may exhibit improvements from year to year. As required by the _Model_, such trends in improvement may not be assumed to continue into the future beyond the effective date of the disciplined current scale underlying the illustration.
The _Model_ requires every policy form illustrated by an insurer to be self-supporting according to the assumptions underlying the insurer’s disciplined current scale. This requirement applies to the illustration of policies in force for less than one year.
The _Model_ requires the following self-support test. At every illustrated point in time starting with the fifteenth policy anniversary (with the twentieth policy anniversary for second-or-later-to-die policies), the accumu­lated value of all policy cash flows, when using experience assumptions underlying the disciplined current scale, should be equal to or greater than the illus­trated policyholder value, i.e., the cash surrender values and any other illustrated benefit amounts available at the policyholder’s election. When policies expire according to their terms prior to 15 years (20 years for second-or-later-to-die policies), the illustrated scale should be self-supporting at the point of expiration.
The _Model_ prohibits illustration of nonguaranteed elements in policies that are deemed to be lapse-supported and establishes a lapse-support test to demonstrate com­pliance with this requirement. The lapse-support test requires that the policy form in question be self-supporting under the same assump­tions and with the same level of aggregation as described in section 3.5, changing only the persistency assumption. The modified persistency rate assumption will use the persistency rates underlying the disciplined current scale for the first five policy years and 100% policy persistency thereafter. In performing the lapse-support test for a policy form, the actuary should assume that benefits that are conditional only upon policy continuation will be provided to all policies in force at the end of year five and surviving to the date of such benefits. For policy forms that provide benefits that are conditional upon certain premium payment patterns, the actuary should consider whether all policies in force to the end of year five will qualify for such benefits.
As stated in the _Model_, policy forms that can never develop nonforfeiture values, such as certain term coverages, are exempt from the lapse-support test. The _Model_ requires that these policy forms pass the self-support requirement.
The illustration actuary is required to annually certify that the disciplined current scale, for both new business and in force illustrations, complies with the _Model_ and this standard. The _Model_ requires that the illustrated scale be no more favorable to the policyholder than the lesser of the currently payable scale and the disciplined current scale. The disciplined current scale, for a policy in force one year or more, continues to be in compliance with the _Model_ and this standard, if any of the following apply:
When relying on data or other information supplied by others, the actuary should refer to ASOP No. 23, _Data Quality_, for guidance.
The documentation that supports the actuarial certification described in section 4.1 with respect to the construction of the disciplined current scale, maintained in conformance with ASOP No. 41, _Actuarial Communications_, should include the following:
The _Model_ 1 requires the illustration actuary to certify annually that the illustrated scale and the disciplined current scale are in compliance both with the requirements as set forth in the _Model_ and with the requirements set forth in this ASOP. Certifications should also be made for newly introduced forms before a new policy form is illustrated.2
c. any inconsistencies between the illustrated nonguaranteed elements for new policies and similar in-­force policies;5 and
As required by the _Model_,7 if an illustration actuary is unable to certify the illustrated scale for any policy form the insurer intends to use, the actuary should notify the board of directors of the insurer and the commissioner promptly of his or her inability to certify.
As required by the _Model_ 8 if an error in a previous certification is discovered, the illustration actuary (or successor illustration actuary) shall promptly notify the board of directors of the insurer and the commissioner.
## Appendix 1 – Background and Current Practices _
_
_Note_: This appendix is provided for informational purposes but is not part of the standard of practice.
Sales illustrations have been of concern to regulators for over a century, going back at least to the Armstrong Commission (1905-1906). Developments prior to 1995 involving insurance products, illustration technology, and the volatility of financial markets led to heightened concern and to the adoption of the NAIC _Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation_ (_Model_).
Actuaries have been involved in the process of establishing scales of dividends and other nonguaranteed elements to be illustrated by insurance companies for decades. Until the 1980s, nonguaranteed elements were essentially synonymous with par­ticipating dividends, and the sources of scales of illustrated dividends were tables prepared by the respective insurance companies. Since that time, there has been a pro­liferation of policies with nonguaranteed elements other than dividends. Improving technology has also made possible the development of software that enables insurance agents to produce sales illustrations based on a variety of assumptions, potentially with little or no direct involvement on the part of the insurer. The _Model_ assigns major responsibilities regarding compliance to an actuary who is appointed by the insurer.
Since the promulgation of the original standard in 1995, product innovation has continued as pricing structures have been refined, secondary guarantees have been developed, an increasing variety of equity-indexed and other indexed life insurance products have been developed, and additional new underwriting classes have been added. Until the release of Actuarial Guideline 49 (AG 49), it had been common practice to illustrate these new products pursuant to the _Model_ and this standard as it existed. With the introduction of AG 49, illustrations of contracts providing interest credits linked to an external index or indices will be subject to AG 49 and this updated standard.
The exposure draft of this revised ASOP, _Compliance with the NAIC Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation_, was issued in June 2016 with a comment deadline of September 30, 2016. Five comment letters were received, some of which were submitted on behalf of multiple commentators, such as by firms or committees. For purposes of this appendix, the term “commentator” may refer to more than one person associated with a particular comment letter. The Task Force to Revise ASOP No. 24 carefully considered all comments received, reviewed the exposure draft, and proposed changes. The Life Committee and the ASB reviewed the proposed changes and made modifications where appropriate.
