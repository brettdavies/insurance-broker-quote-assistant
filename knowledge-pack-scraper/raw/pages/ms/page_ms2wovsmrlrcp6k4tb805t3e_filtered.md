## **How Much Does Auto Insurance Average Cost by State?**

Depending on where you live, your auto insurance premium can significantly vary. Apart from the minimum state mandated auto insurance coverage, there are other factors that influence auto insurance costs from one state to another.

Like the total number of automobiles driven on the road. States with more vehicles on the streets are more prone to road accidents. Speaking of car accidents, the cost of auto insurance also varies significantly depending on the number of automobile accidents that occur monthly, or on an annual basis.

This is because states with a higher accident ratio usually have a higher minimum coverage for auto insurance. Plus, insurance companies need to compensate a higher amount depending on your insurance plan, and the coverage limit.

Not to mention, natural disasters are also crucial in determining the minimum coverage limits. States that are more prone to environmental casualties like storms, hurricanes, and earthquakes have a higher minimum insurance coverage.

Insurance companies in those States also tend to charge a higher price for comprehensive, and full coverage insurance that typically covers vehicle damage due to severe weather.

Plus, states that have a higher crime rate also have a relatively pricier auto insurance premium due to increased risks of auto thefts, and robberies.

## **What Factors Impact the Average Cost of Auto Insurance?**

So far, we’ve addressed how the cost of auto insurance varies based on the state you’re residing in. Your location is one of the most important factors when estimating the average cost of auto insurance.

Apart from location there are other crucial factors that significantly affect the cost of auto insurance. Typically, your insurance company will mainly evaluate your profile, and quote a monthly or annual premium based on the insurance plan, and the coverage that you’re interested in.

Now, we will focus on these individual factors to help you estimate and give you an overall idea how much your insurance company might charge you. This will also help you choose the most reliable insurance provider within your budget.

### **Driving Record**

Driving record is the most crucial factor when it comes to forecasting, and determining how much your insurance company will have to compensate you. More importantly it also reflects how often your insurance company may have to compensate you.

So, depending on your driving record, your insurance company will quote your annual insurance premium.

Typically, your insurance company would like to see whether you got speeding tickets, got charged/fined for DUI (driving under influence), and how frequently you’ve claimed insurance after an at-fault accident.  
**Speeding Tickets**

Generally, you will have to pay an annual premium of $2,150 to $2,329 for full coverage, but if you get a speeding ticket, your auto insurance cost can jump by $500, or more. This will increase your auto insurance premium to $2,633 to $2,857 per year, which is 23% more of the national average.

**DUI (Driving Under Influence)**

If you’re charged for driving under influence, then your annual auto insurance coverage can significantly increase. This can increase your annual premium by 95%. So, in this case your insurance company might charge you $3,537 to $4,192 or more per year, instead of the national average of $2,15

### **After an At-Fault Accident**

If you have recently claimed an at-fault auto insurance in the last 3 years, then you will most likely have to pay 40% to 45% more than the national average. Usually, the average rate increases by $850 a year in such cases, so you would have to pay an annual premium of $3,005 to $3,378 or more, compared to the national average of $2,150.There are some exceptions though, for example in New York insurance companies cannot charge an additional rate if the accidental damage is less than $2,000, and no bodily injurie

**Insurance Coverage**

Your auto insurance cost will vary depending on the insurance plan, and the coverage that you choose to purchase. In general, if you go for the minimum coverage then you will have to pay a monthly premium of $43 to $70, or an annual premium of $507 to $1,060 or more.

If you go for full coverage insurance, then you will have to pay a monthly premium of $151 to $289, or an annual premium of $1,811 to $3,463 or more depending on the exact quote of your insurance provider. The data that’s mentioned here is from a thorough market analysis, so it can be auto insurance cost can be anything within this range, or beyond.

### **Insurance History**

The insurance provider will investigate your insurance history mainly to identify how frequently you’ve claimed auto insurance, and how much you were compensated for vehicle damage, and bodily injuries.

The total amount that has been compensated by your current or previous auto insurance provider will be a strong determinant of evaluating the insurance premium that you will have to pay annually.

As it was previously mentioned in this article, if you have recently claimed an auto insurance in the last 3 years then you may be charged a higher premium of 40% to 45% or more of the national or state average.

If you’re a loyal, and recurring customer of an auto insurance company, they might offer you accident forgiveness benefit, and on note that, your insurance premium won’t increase.

But then again, if you get involved in another at-fault accident right after, or if you claim another auto insurance any time soon then you may end up losing that benefit.

### **Age**

Regardless of whichever state that you’re residing in, one thing’s common throughout the entire country when it comes to determining auto insurance cost based on age. In the USA, teenagers have a bad record of getting into more frequent accidents and claiming more frequent auto insurance.

So, that’s why the annual premium for teenage drivers, particularly between the ages of 16 to 20 is significantly a lot higher. On average, adults between the ages of 25 to 60 are charged what we consider the normal rate.

Again, we’re only focusing on the age factor here, given the benefit of the doubt that adult drivers have a clean driving record. If they have a poor driving record, and insurance history then data presented below based on the age factor won’t necessarily apply to them.

Senior drivers from the age of 70, and beyond are generally charged with a higher annual premium. Although they’re more experienced, they usually have a slower response rate which can lead to more frequent accidents.

**The following data represents the average auto insurance cost based on age:**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age** | **Annual full coverage premium** | **Annual minimum coverage premium** |
| 16-year-old | $5,069 | $1,544 |
| 18-year-old | $4,365 | $1,305 |
| 20-year-old | $4,804 | $1,359 |
| 25-year-old | $2,932 | $800 |
| 30-year-old | $2,522 | $684 |
| 40-year-old | $2,329 | $633 |
| 50-year-old | $2,170 | $622 |
| 60-year-old | $2,135 | $609 |
| 70-year-old | $2,298 | $683 |

### **Credit Score**

In most US States, credit scores are a crucial metric of determining auto insurance costs, except for 8 States that don’t allow insurance companies to quote an insurance premium based on credit score, and credit history.

These 8 states include California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Utah.

If you’re residing in any of the other 42 States that do allow insurance companies to check your credit score, then it is vital for you to maintain a good credit score.

The reason credit scores are so important is, it reflects how quickly and sincerely you pay your credit bills. It mainly illustrates the full amount of credit debt that you’ve paid in due time.

So, having a good credit score automatically gives the impression that you will also pay your auto insurance premium in due time.

Drivers with a poor credit score happen to pay 76% to 87% more auto insurance premiums than drivers with a good credit score.

That’s an average increase of at least $1600 a year, which means if you had to pay an annual premium of $2,150 a year with a good credit score, then you may have to pay $3,779 or more for having a poor credit score.

### **Vehicle Price, and Type**

Depending on the type of vehicle that you drive, your auto insurance will significantly vary based on it. If you’re driving a sport, or luxury car then you’re more prone to getting into an accident.

Especially because you’re more likely to drive at much higher speed, and on top of that the cost of parts, and its overall maintenance cost is relatively much more expensive than average sedans.

Not to mention, sports car accidents are usually much more severe, especially when you’ve a car accident at a very high speed, you, and the other driver are likely to sustain more critical bodily injuries. So that adds a high risk of increased medical bills.

On the other hand, if you’re driving a minivan or any heavy vehicle of that sort, you may be safer from severe bodily injuries, but you may damage the other vehicle more.

Of course, if you’re driving cheaper vehicles like sedans then your auto insurance is likely to be cheaper. So, when it comes to auto insurance cost, your vehicle type, and its price has a huge impact on the insurance premium.

The following data below shows the **Auto Insurance Rate by Car Types:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Car Type** | **Average Annual Cost** |
| Minivan | $2,041 |
| Van | $2,168 |
| Trucks | $2,234 |
| Hatchback | $2,298 |
| SUV | $2,378 |
| Sedan | $3,184 |
| Convertible | $3,393 |
| Wagon | $3,438 |
| Coupe | $3,894 |

The cost of repairing an EV (electric vehicle) is relatively more expensive than gas, or hybrid. Based on the fuel type of your vehicle the annual insurance premium will also vary as follows,

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Car Fuel Type** | **Average Annual Cost** |
| Gas | $2,567 |
| Hybrid | $2,802 |
| Electric | $3,547 |

The cost of your auto insurance can significantly vary specifically based on the vehicle that you drive. So, based on the data acquired from Forbes, the following table shows the average annual cost of auto insurance for each of these Top Selling Vehicles in the USA.

## | | | | --- | --- | | **Vehicle** | **Annual Average Cost** | | Ford F-150 XL | $1,769 | | Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Limited WT | $1,812 | | Ram 1500 Classic Express | $1,963 | | Toyota RAV4 LE | $1,835 | | Tesla Model Y Long Range | $3,128 | | Toyota Camry SE | $2,095 | | Honda CR-V EX | $1,723 | | Chevrolet Equinox LS | $1,856 | | Toyota Tacoma SR | $1,990 | | GMC Sierra 1500 Pro | $1,827 |

### **Gender**

Although the average auto insurance cost does not vary much based on gender, yet male drivers are charged more than female drivers across various states in the US. This is particularly because male drivers are usually more prone to causing accidents compared to female drivers.

According to **[recent studies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/198017/total-number-of-us-licensed-drivers-in-2009-by-gender/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20in%20the%20United%20States%20by%20gender%202020%2D2021&text=In%202021%2C%20female%20motorists%20accounted,to%20115.2%20million%20male%20licensees.)** it was found that there are about 117.6 million licensed female drivers compared to 115.2 million male licensees. So, this means that female drivers are typically more aware of obeying the law compared to male drivers.

Over the last couple of years, male drivers have causes more fatal auto accidents than female drivers. Based on recent statistics, male drivers have been involved in 44,000 fatal accidents in the US, whereas female drivers were involved in more than 15,000 car accidents. So, based on the ratio men are typically involved in 72% of fatal auto accidents.

There’s another reason to it though, men tend to drive for mileage than women do, men drive about 6000 miles more than women per year in the US. Not to mention the male drivers get more speed tickets, and DUI (driving under influence) fines compared to female drivers.

Here’s one thing to note, gender profiling is not allowed as a cost factor for auto insurance in 8 States which includes California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Based on our analysis auto insurance cost can typically vary depending on the state that you’re residing in, which usually varies between 2% to 6%; male drivers have to pay the higher percentage there. The variation is significantly much higher in Wyoming though, as male drivers are charged 13% more than female drivers for auto insurance.

The table below shows the differences in auto insurance costs across **42 States in the USA based on gender.**

### **Marital Status**

Married couples tend to be more responsible when it comes to driving on the roads. In general, married individuals drive safer and obey traffic laws a lot more compared to single drivers, or unmarried drivers.

On top of that many auto insurance companies offer bundle plans for married couples; in this way they can save by getting exclusive discounts, and avail specialized auto insurance schemes like multi-vehicle discounts, and more!

If you’re married, then you can save at least $200 a year on auto insurance by going for multi-vehicle, or bundle plans that are specifically designed for married couples.

### **Annual Mileage**

The more you drive, the higher the risks of getting into an auto accident. So, that’s why annual mileage is another factor when it comes to evaluating the cost of your auto insurance.

Of course, it varies based on the state and the area, specifically because auto accidents are more frequent in densely urban areas compared to less populated cities or rural areas.

If your annual mileage is about 7500 or below, then you won’t be charged any additional costs for your auto insurance premium. But if it’s higher than that, then your auto insurance fee will increase based on the following data given below,

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Miles** | **Increase in Rates** |
| 7,500 | 10% |
| 10,000 | 7% |
| 12,000 | 4% |
| 20,000 | 25% |

### **Does Inflation Affect Auto Insurance Cost?**

Inflation is an overall economic impact that increases the price of various products and services throughout the entire country. The reason inflation has a direct effect on the cost of auto insurance are,

* Increases the price of automobiles
* Increases the cost of automobile repairs, and maintenance
* Increased healthcare, and medical costs

As of March 2024, it has been **[reported](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sigma-research/Economic-Insights/cpi-inflation-overestimating-auto-insurance-prices.html)** that due to inflation auto insurance rates have spiked up by 22.2%, which is the highest since 1976.

So, based on the inflation rate your auto insurance costs can significantly vary. It has also been reported that inflation seems to be cooling down this year, so there’s a high chance that auto insurance rates will also decrease in the following years.

But it’s hard to predict if it will decrease because there are many economic factors involved here that influence inflation and the overall prices of goods and services in the economy.

## **How to Lower Your Auto Insurance Cost?**

The first thing that you should do is explore multiple auto insurance companies. Go through their policies and compare their pricing.

As you’ll invest a good amount of money on a monthly or annual basis, it is crucial for you to consult with these insurance companies to get price quotes. In that way, you can easily compare and decide which insurance provider can provide you with the best offer at the most affordable price range.

While you’re at don’t hesitate to ask for discounts like multi-vehicle plans, and bundle offers, if you’re eligible for it then you can easily save up 6% to 23%.

Some insurance companies have certain policies to reduce the auto insurance premiums, if you’re a recurring customer, and if you have a smooth record of always paying on time.

If you have a good driving record, you can also negotiate at a lower price as you will have strong ground to prove that you’re less prone to getting into accidents.

Additionally, with a good driving record you can apply for telematics insurance. By doing so, you’ll agree to either install a tracking app on your phone, or plug-in device in your vehicle.

The telematics tracker will basically send real-time data from your vehicle’s speedometer, mileage covered, and how hard you have hit the brakes. This is to evaluate whether you’re a safe driver.

So, if you’re driving below 7500 miles a year, then you can safely opt for this scheme and save with a pay-per-mile program.
