# State Farm says I have to replace roof.

Hi! Got a notice last week from State Farm saying an inspector came out & said I need a new roof. I have pictures so yes they actually came out, but only could get 1 section of the roof. My roof is under 20 years old & no leaks. It’s not completely (or even very much) “shiny”. I certainly don’t have the $$ for a new roof + solar removal & reinstall. Is it worth fighting about or just find a different company. Do they put the new roof in a database to let other companies know. I’m in SoCal & not in a wildfire interface. I also know State Farm is trying to dump their customers in CA

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Edit: thank you all for your replies. I will get a roof inspection done. And go from there. Also apologies for thinking a 25 year roof warranty meant 25 years. Silly of me in this day & age!
