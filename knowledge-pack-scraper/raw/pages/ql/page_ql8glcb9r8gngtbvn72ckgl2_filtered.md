## Best cheap rates with accident forgiveness

## What is accident forgiveness?

Accident forgiveness keeps your car insurance rates from going up after your first at-fault accident. No law requires it, but several companies offer it as a cheap add-on.

An at-fault accident raises the average cost of full coverage car insurance 

Full coverage includes collision and comprehensive, which cover your own car for damage and theft.
 by $1,046 a year, or $87 a month. This works out to $3,138 over three years. This is about as long an accident stays on your record.

Accident forgiveness, on the other hand, only costs about $11 a month. It’s essentially a small charge now to avoid a possible large expense later.

### Accidents and car insurance rates

| Type of car insurance | Annual rate | Monthly rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full coverage with clean driving record | $2,101 | $175 |
| Full coverage with accident forgiveness | $2,231 | $186 |
| Full coverage with one “unforgiven” accident | $3,147 | $262 |

You have to add accident forgiveness to your auto insurance before an accident for the coverage to apply. It does not fully protect you from rate increases after your first accident. It just spares you from an accident surcharge 

Insurance companies add surcharges to your rate for at-fault accidents and most moving violations.
 you would otherwise have to pay.

* Accident forgiveness won’t protect you from a normal rate increase your insurance company charges all customers.
* Your rate can also go up if the good driver discount you had before an accident gets canceled.

## When is accident forgiveness worth it?

Accident forgiveness is usually worth it for an auto insurance policy that is already cheap. It’s not as important as essential coverages like liability 

Liability insurance covers injuries and property damage you cause to others. It’s required by law in almost every state.
 , collision 

Collision covers damage to your car from a collision with another vehicle or object.
 and comprehensive 

Comprehensive covers your car for theft and damage from non-collision causes, like fire, flood and vandalism.
 . Still, it can reduce some of the financial sting of an at-fault accident.

**Accident forgiveness is usually worth it if:**

* A car insurance quote with accident forgiveness costs the same or less than quotes without it.
* Your car insurance company gives it to you for free.

**Accident forgiveness is usually not worth it if:**

* You have to choose a more expensive company *just* to get accident forgiveness.

It’s good to ask the companies you contact for quotes about their accident forgiveness programs. Getting quotes with and without the coverage can help you decide if it’s worth it for you.

## Who has the cheapest accident forgiveness?

At $141 a month, Travelers has the [cheapest full coverage car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-full-coverage-car-insurance/) with accident forgiveness. Auto-Owners is only slightly more expensive at $143 a month.

Each company’s rates vary by customer. This is why it’s good to [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from a few different companies when you buy or renew auto insurance.

## How do I get accident forgiveness?

You usually have to be a good driver to get accident forgiveness. Companies that offer it normally make you have at least three years of incident-free driving before you can get it. Some require five years with no tickets or accidents.

You typically also have to pay a small fee to add it to your policy. However, a few companies offer paid and free versions of accident forgiveness.

Progressive, for example, gives you free accident forgiveness after five incident-free years while insured by the company. If you don’t want to wait that long, you can pay for accident forgiveness before then.

Progressive also automatically forgives your first accident if it causes less than $500 in claims expenses. However, claims this small are rare.

Geico and American Family also offer paid and free versions of accident forgiveness. You can get it for free if you avoid accidents for specified lengths of time. These requirements vary by state.

## Which car insurance companies have accident forgiveness?

The availability of accident forgiveness varies by insurance company and state. It’s generally not available in California. State Farm doesn’t offer it in any state.

Most other large companies offer it in most other states. Erie and Auto-Owners are among the smaller regional companies that also have it. Geico calls its program claims forgiveness.

Our team of insurance experts rated insurance companies based on several categories. These categories include average rates, discounts, coverage options, third-party customer service ratings and app/website experience. We weighted these categories based on what customers value in an insurance company.

For third-party customer service ratings, we included complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and financial strength ratings from AM Best. NAIC complaint index scores are used to determine how satisfied customers are with their claims, while financial strength ratings from AM Best reflect the ability to pay out claims.
