Replace the roof or find a new carrier. Those are your options.

I was able to request and obtain a 1 year extension from allstate after such a notice.
I cleared a bit of moss build up under a tree and cut back the tree.
They checked a year later and policy continued uninterrupted.

You could try to fight it but your time is probably better spent finding a new carrier. But be warned the new carrier could say the same thing during their discovery window.

This happened to my sister. Her roof was 15 years old. She replaced it after moving in. She got some damage from a tree falling about 10 years into that roof. She filed a claim and had a tiny section repaired. Around year 13 she moved and rented out her first house. 2 years later they told her to replace the roof or they were dropping her coverage. She tried 3 other companies who all said the same thing. No leaks and it looked to be in good shape. My house is 5 doors down with the same age of roof. They said nothing to me, even when I also rented out my house and changed my policy to a landlord policy.
She was so confused on why were were treated so differently. It almost seemed random.

They will not. Copies of your permits, invoices and warranty documentation should be saved to provide to future insurers.

This is why, while I’d love to go solar, I’ll never do it unless I had the acreage for it to the side. It bugs me not being able to even see my roof.

State Farm agent in California. We have had customers successfully “fight” their new roof requirement, get a year long extension on the non-renewal, and we’ve had customers submit evidence they think shows they don’t need a new roof and had underwriting come back and say they still need to replace their roof by the original non renewal date.
Get an inspection done by a licensed roofer and submit it to your agent so they can send it to underwriting. They may tell you that you just have to repair everything listed in the inspection, they may tell you that they’re still requiring a full replacement. This will take time. Possibly up to a month. And they may not extend your initial needed by day so keep that in mind.
You can shop, but there are not many carriers writing in California and they’re all focused on roofs so this same thing could happen again. You may get a new policy bound and they’ll still come back after their initial underwriting review and give you 30-60 days to get a new roof before they cancel coverage versus the probably 6ish months State Farm is giving you.
Call your agent. It’s why they are there.

Unless the roof is less than 10 years old it's on the downside of the [roof life](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=roof+life+insurance+purposes&cId=cf3dd82c-d2ea-42ac-a1a5-7942bb2c6ffb&iId=56015e74-f1f1-4349-b2eb-fe3546fcfbd8) curve for insurance purposes, regardless of what a roofer or the warranty covers. Insurance companies handle thousands of roof claims every year for all types of roofs, conditions, locations, and have a pretty good database on this.
You can try shopping, but eventually you'll end up with the same requirement.

Lots of "roofing contractors" going door to door after a heavier storm offering to get you a new roof for free from insurance. Lots of people taking them up on the offer. Congrats, now everyone has to pay higher premiums.

Yes the condition of the property may be updated in Lexis Nexis so it can and probably will be used in underwriting with another carrier if you leave.

Replace the roof or shop the market but it’s highly likely that any new carrier is gonna ask you to do the same, or exclude the roof from the policy (not a good idea at all)

Clean it, repair it, and have it inspected by a roofing contractor. Submit your own documentation. The 3rd party surveyors suck and take terrible pictures. -State Farm producer/service specialist

The reason is because some random roofing sales person at any time could get in your roof and say that blister on the shingle is from hail 3 years ago and get you to call in a claim. Then when the insurance denies it the roofing sales guy gets you to hire a public adjuster who then demands a full roof replacement for 3* what it actually costs. When that gets denied they either demand appraisal or start a suit.
Having a relatively newer roof kills a lot of the arguments.
Roofing claims are currently the biggest pain followed by smoke (less common but more severe) claims demanding gutting a house no matter the amount of actual damage

This is common amongst multiple carriers now. It happened to me with a different carrier, 14 year old roof. Just replace it, shop around, but you need to maintain it with roof washing.

You are not going to find a new carrier. Most insurance companies now ask for the age of roof. In Texas they won’t even insure you if the age is 10+ years
