          <p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Evolving Roof Requirements from Carriers</span></b></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s no secret insurance carriers have been tightening their underwriting guidelines and coverage&nbsp;related to roof age, condition, and claims payouts. For independent agents in Ohio, these changes are expected to directly impact both new business and client retention.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier this year, OIA members alerted the association to evolving roof policy changes, often discovered only near renewal periods, leading to growing client (and agent) frustration. In response, the OIA team conducted an in-depth review of ODI rate filings from major carriers to better understand the shifting requirements. Listed below are some of the trends we detected, or you can reference carrier-specific information uncovered by OIA in <a href="https://ohioinsuranceagents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carrier_Home_Roof_Specs_2025.pdf"><span style="color: #4891dc;">this resource</span></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Roof Age Matters More Than Ever</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Roof age has always been an important factor, but now it’s front and center for many carriers. Progressive, for example, applies a roof Loss Settlement schedule, and this coverage is applied to roofs at 11 years of age. Erie Insurance is flagging 3-tab shingle roofs over 10 years old for limited or functional replacement. Westfield has started applying depreciation to roofs after their 10th year, and Auto-Owners shifts to Actual Cash Value settlements once a roof reaches 16 years — unless a specific buy-back endorsement is secured.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Agents should expect more friction around renewals for properties with roofs between 10 and 20 years old. Clients accustomed to Replacement Cost payouts may be surprised to learn that no longer applies, depending on where their roof age falls in the Replacement Cost threshold. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Shift Toward Actual Cash Value Settlements</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Along with the age of roof restrictions comes the move away from Replacement Cost toward Actual Cash Value (ACV). </span><span data-contrast="none">Actual cash value</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;is calculated by taking the replacement cost value and then subtracting depreciation. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some carriers are implementing ACV once roofs reach a specific number of years of age.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;In the event of a claim, this change can dramatically reduce settlement amounts, often leaving homeowners with a hefty bill for additional necessary repairs.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> &nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While some carriers are offering endorsements that allow clients to “buy back” Replacement Cost coverage up to certain age limits, these solutions often require upfront action and careful documentation. Proactive conversations now can prevent difficult conversations — and potential E&amp;O exposure — later.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Deductible Structures Are Evolving Too</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Wind and hail deductibles are another evolving piece of the puzzle. Rather than using the standard flat dollar amounts, many insurance carriers are implementing a </span><span data-contrast="auto">percentage-based deductible specific to roof damage by windstorm and hail, often determined by the age and type of roof. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, carriers like Westfield, for windstorm and hail damage, offer a range of deductible options:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559683&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Percentage Deductibles:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> These are based on a percentage of the Coverage A (dwelling) limit—typically 1%, 2%, 5%, or even 10%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559683&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Premium Adjustment Deductibles and Higher Fixed-Dollar Deductibles: </span><span data-contrast="auto">These alternatives provide fixed but higher dollar amounts for windstorm or hail deductibles.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This shift is particularly relevant for agents in Ohio, where seasonal hail and strong storms are becoming more frequent. Helping clients understand the connection between roof condition and storm deductibles will be key to setting proper expectations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Matching Coverage May Leave Gaps</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another area where surprises can occur is matching coverage for roofs and siding. Insurance policies typically only provide coverage to the damaged area – a common misconception with homeowners who assume their entire roof or exterior will be replaced after partial damage. Some companies, however, do have matching endorsements that can be added on for an additional cost. Westfield’s standard limit for matching materials is $20,000 — which may not fully cover larger properties or homes in HOA-regulated communities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Agents should take the time to review these limits with clients, especially for high-value homes or those with strict aesthetic requirements.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stricter Inspections and Renewal Scrutiny</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, property inspections are becoming more rigorous. Carriers, such as Erie Insurance, are paying closer attention to roof condition during both underwriting and renewal. Homes with older 3-tab shingles, visible wear, or suspected installation issues may be flagged for surcharges, non-renewal, or limited coverage options.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Encouraging clients to perform regular maintenance, document roof updates, and share inspection results can help safeguard their eligibility — and make renewal conversations easier for everyone involved.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Agents Can Get Ahead</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The evolving roof requirements present an opportunity for agents who stay proactive. Reviewing renewal books to identify at-risk roofs, educating clients about buy-back options and deductible structures, and guiding homeowners through potential upgrades can solidify client trust and loyalty.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In an environment where roof-related claims and underwriting scrutiny are increasing, independent agents who lead the conversation will be positioned to grow — while those who react late may struggle with frustrated clients and diminished retention.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By starting the conversation now, you can help your clients maintain the protection they expect, and help your agency maintain its competitive advantage heading into the rest of 2025.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
