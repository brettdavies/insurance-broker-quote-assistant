You may think that your [auto insurance](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/) bill is set in stone. Not necessarily. The good news? Your savings on coverage may just be getting started. The following tips could help you get [cheaper car insurance](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/cheap-auto-insurance/):
[ ![Review your policy.](https://living.geico.com/wp-content/themes/2019/ads/login.jpg) ](https://ecams.geico.com/login)
## Install Vehicle Safety & Security Devices
While safety features like anti-lock brakes and air bags are now required by law in the U.S. for all new cars, be sure your insurer knows if your older car has such safety devices—it could save you some cash. Security devices may also help you cut your bill. GEICO offers a [discount ](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/)on the comprehensive portion of premiums to customers who install anti-theft alarm systems.
## Dig For Insurance Discounts
Check out the variety of discounts you could be eligible for on [GEICO’s discounts page](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/) _._ For instance, completing a [defensive driving course](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/) (or a [driver’s education](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/#education) course for teens) could also make you eligible for premium reductions depending on your age. GEICO is proud to offer [discounts to military members](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/military-discounts/) as well as [federal employees](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/federal-employee-discounts/). Call [(800) 861-8380](tel:+18008618380) to speak with an insurance representative about additional discounts you could be eligible for. Or, if you’re looking for a new policy, learn some tips to help you [compare car insurance policies](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/comparison/) and see all of the great discounts you may be eligible for with GEICO.
## Combine & Consolidate Insurance Policies
Many households with more than one vehicle maintain separate insurance policies for each, but they may be missing out on a [multi-car discount](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/#loyalty) of up to 25% on most coverages. Move all your vehicles to GEICO and see how much more you could save.
Depending on the state you live in, you could be eligible for a [multi-policy/multi-line discount](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/#loyalty) if you buy more than one type of coverage through the same insurer. Pairing [auto](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/) and [homeowners insurance](https://www.geico.com/homeowners-insurance/) is the most common scenario, but pairing auto insurance with [renters](https://www.geico.com/renters-insurance/), [condo](https://www.geico.com/condo-insurance/), or [mobile home insurance](https://www.geico.com/mobile-home-insurance/) could yield similar results. Get a [fast, free quote on geico.com](https://www.geico.com/) to see how much you could save on insurance by bundling your home and auto.
## Opt For a Higher Deductible
Typically, the higher your deductible (the portion of your claim you pay out of pocket), the lower your insurance premium. Many people avoid having a high deductible because they worry that they wouldn’t be able to cover it if something happened. To put your mind at ease, try opening a separate savings account just for emergencies. Once you’ve saved enough to comfortably pay potential deductible costs, call or go online to [geico.com](https://www.geico.com/) or use [GEICO’s award-winning mobile app](https://www.geico.com/web-and-mobile/mobile-apps/) to adjust your coverage.
## Reduce Coverage on Older Cars
Reducing coverage on older cars can help lower your car insurance premiums, especially if your vehicle’s value has depreciated significantly over time. As cars age, the cost of comprehensive and collision coverage may outweigh the potential payout if your car were damaged or totaled. By opting for liability-only coverage or reducing additional protections, you can cut down on your premium costs while still protecting yourself and meeting legal insurance requirements.
##  Participate in a Safe Driving Program
Participating in a safe driving program, such as [GEICO’s DriveEasy](https://www.geico.com/driveeasy/)*, can help lower your car insurance premiums by rewarding safe driving habits with discounts. These programs use a mobile app to track driving behaviors like speed, braking, and phone usage. If you demonstrate consistent safe driving, you may qualify for reduced premiums.
##  Get a Car That’s Cheaper to Insure
Some vehicles—like cars with strong safety ratings, lower repair costs, and less likelihood of theft—are considered less risky than others by insurers, which can result in lower premiums. For example, family sedans, minivans, and some SUVs are often less expensive to insure than sports cars or luxury vehicles. By selecting a vehicle with these cost-saving factors in mind, you can significantly reduce your insurance expenses while still enjoying reliable coverage.
## Take a Defensive Driving Course
Depending on your age and state, taking a defensive driving course can lower your car insurance premiums by proving to your insurer that you are committed to safe driving. Many insurance companies, including GEICO, offer [discounts for completing an approved defensive driving program](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/) because it reduces the risk of accidents. These courses teach advanced driving techniques, hazard awareness, and how to handle unexpected situations on the road.
## Avoid Small Claims
When you file frequent small claims, insurers may view you as a higher risk, which can lead to premium increases over time. Paying out of pocket for minor repairs, like dents and scratches, can help prevent rate increases and keep any applicable claims-free discounts. Although this method requires you to pay for repairs upfront, it will help you save money in the long run by keeping your car insurance rates lower.
## Pay Your Premium in Full
Depending on your state, paying your car insurance premium in full can often help lower your premium because GEICO offers discounts for those that pay their premium all at once. When you pay the entire premium at once, we save on administrative costs associated with processing multiple payments, and then we pass those savings on to you. Paying in full also helps you avoid installment fees or interest charges that can add up over time.
##  Improve Your Driving Record  

Improving your driving record can help lower your car insurance premiums by demonstrating to insurers that you are a low-risk driver. Insurance companies often charge higher rates for drivers with a history of accidents, traffic violations, or claims. However, if you maintain a clean driving record over time—free from speeding tickets, accidents, or other infractions—your insurer may reward you with lower premiums. GEICO, for example, offers a 5-year accident-free good driver discount to promote safe driving habits.
_There are even more ways to help drive down[auto insurance](https://www.geico.com/auto-insurance/) costs. Check out _[_GEICO’s discounts page_](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/) _to find out more on how to maximize your savings._

Hi Robert,  
You can view our available car insurance discounts here: <https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/>  
Keep in mind that not all discounts are available in all states or all GEICO companies, and that the discount amount varies in some states.  
Thanks!
