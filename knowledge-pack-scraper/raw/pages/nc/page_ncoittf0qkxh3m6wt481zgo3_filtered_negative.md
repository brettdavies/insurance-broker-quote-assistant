[![Texas Windstorm Insurance Map highlighting Texas counties requiring windstorm insurance](https://www.riseroofing.company/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Texas-Windstorm-Insurnace-County-Map-1024x538.jpg) ](https://www.riseroofing.company/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Texas-Windstorm-Insurnace-County-Map.jpg) Counties in Texas mandated to carry windstorm insurance coverage.
Texas Windstorm insurance is coverage specifically for damage caused by wind and hail – for example, losses from hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, or severe thunderstorms. (Some people even call it _hurricane insurance_.) It pays to repair or rebuild your house if it’s damaged by wind or hail events. In Texas, whether you need a separate windstorm insurance policy depends largely on where you live:
Flood vs Texas Windstorm Insurance: It’s important to note that windstorm insurance only covers wind and hail damage – _not_ flooding or storm surge. Flood damage (rising water entering your home) is excluded from both homeowners and TWIA policies and requires a separate flood insurance policy. For comprehensive protection on the coast, a homeowner typically has three policies: a standard homeowners policy (covering fire, theft, etc.), a windstorm insurance policy (TWIA or similar, covering wind and hail), and a flood policy (covering rising water). Each covers a different peril, and together they ensure all catastrophic events are insured.
* **Coverage Scope**: A typical Texas homeowners insurance policy covers a range of perils – fire, lightning, theft, plumbing leaks, etc. – and it usually covers wind and hail _except_ in designated coastal regions. A windstorm insurance policy (TWIA or private), on the other hand, covers only wind and hail losses – no other types of damage. For example, if a hurricane blows part of your roof off, the windstorm insurance policy would pay for the roof repairs. But if a fire breaks out in your kitchen, or a burglar steals your TV, those losses would fall under your homeowners policy. Neither policy covers flood damage, which is why separate flood insurance is recommended for coastal homes.
* **Complementary Coverage**: Because TWIA policies cover only wind/hail, they are meant to complement your primary homeowners policy – not replace it. In fact, TWIA itself emphasizes that it is “only a piece of the insurance puzzle” for coastal residents, and you should have proper coverage for _other_ risks like fire and flood through regular insurance. In practice, if you live in (for example) Corpus Christi, you might carry a homeowners policy that excludes wind/hail and a TWIA windstorm policy for wind/hail. In the event of a hurricane, your TWIA policy would cover the wind damage (roof, windows, etc.), while your homeowners policy could cover resulting interior damage _not_ directly caused by wind (such as rainwater damage inside the home after the wind created an opening). For any non-hurricane peril – say a kitchen fire or liability claim – your homeowners policy responds as usual.
* **Deductibles**: Texas Windstorm insurance often comes with its own deductible, separate from your homeowners policy deductible. In coastal Texas, many homeowners policies have a percentage deductible for windstorm/hail or a special _hurricane deductible_. Similarly, TWIA policies typically have a percentage deductible (commonly 1% or 2% of your dwelling coverage amount) that you must pay out-of-pocket on windstorm insurance claims. This means if your home is insured for $300,000 and you have a 2% windstorm insurance deductible, you would pay the first $6,000 of wind damage repairs, and the insurance would cover the rest. It’s important to be aware of these deductible amounts in your policies so you have funds set aside or know your exposure. Your insurance agent can explain the wind/hail deductible on your policy (or TWIA’s deductible options) so you won’t be caught off guard when filing a claim.
In summary, homeowners insurance and windstorm insurance complement each other: one covers most everyday risks and the structure generally, and the other specifically covers the _extraordinary_ risk of wind and hail in storm-prone areas. Having both (plus flood coverage if needed) means your home is fully protected against the range of disasters that Texas can throw at it.
Coverage area – TWIA policies are available only in the specific coastal region defined by law. Texas law designates a “catastrophe area” along the Gulf Coast where wind/hail insurance is considered not reasonably available from the standard market. This currently includes 14 first-tier coastal counties and part of Harris County (the part of Harris County that is east of Highway 146, along Galveston Bay). The first-tier counties are all the counties that border the Gulf of Mexico: _Aransas, Brazoria, Calhoun, Cameron, Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Kenedy, Kleberg, Matagorda, Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio,_ and _Willacy_, as well as a portion of _Harris_ County near the coast. If your property is in one of these counties (or certain communities in eastern Harris County), you’re in TWIA’s territory. Homeowners outside this area cannot get a TWIA windstorm insurance policy (nor would they typically need one, since private insurance covers wind in other regions).
_Figure: A map highlighting the Texas coastal counties (in green) that form the “designated catastrophe area” for Texas windstorm insurance coverage_ _. Properties in these first-tier coastal counties (and a portion of Harris County east of Hwy 146) are eligible for TWIA policies if wind/hail coverage is unavailable from private insurers. Homeowners in these regions must ensure their homes meet windstorm building codes to qualify for coverage._
* **Location** – The property must be in the _designated catastrophe area_ (one of the 14 coastal counties or eligible parts of Harris County).
A WPI-8 is a _Certificate of Compliance_ issued by the Texas Department of Insurance. It’s an official document (or electronic record) that verifies a structure or repair meets the applicable windstorm building code requirements. In simpler terms, a WPI-8 certificate is proof that your home (or your new roof, addition, etc.) was built or fixed _the right way_ to resist hurricane winds.
* Location triggers – First, WPI-8 requirements apply only in the designated coastal counties (the same 14 counties and part of Harris County we mentioned earlier). If you live in these areas and want windstorm insurance coverage, you fall under the WPI-8 rules. Homeowners in inland counties do _not_ need a WPI-8, because their wind coverage is through standard insurance that doesn’t require this state certificate.
* Additions and structural remodels – If you add a room, enclose a porch, or otherwise add onto your house, those new construction areas must be built to code and will need a WPI-8. Similarly, if you do an extensive remodel that involves structural changes to exterior walls, new windows, new exterior doors, or other structural elements (sometimes called a “redo”), you will likely need a WPI-8 for that project. Essentially any alteration that affects the _building envelope_ (walls, roof, foundation) in a windload sense should be checked.
In summary, if you live on the Texas coast and you’re doing _anything substantial to your home’s structure or exterior_, assume you’ll likely need a windstorm inspection during the construction and a WPI-8 certificate after completion. Always verify specific requirements for your project to stay safe (and insured).
* Qualified Engineer (For Hire): You can also hire a Texas-licensed professional engineer who is qualified under the windstorm program (often referred to as an _appointed qualified inspector_ if they are registered with TDI). Many coastal engineering firms or even some experienced contractors have relationships with qualified engineers. You would pay the engineer’s inspection fee (TDI doesn’t regulate how much they charge). The engineer will inspect the work and then file the necessary paperwork with TDI to get your certificate issued. Homeowners sometimes go this route if they want more flexibility in scheduling or if a TDI inspector isn’t readily available when needed.
In the past, there was a bit of a remedy: TWIA ran a WPI-8-C program (Certificate of Compliance for Completed Construction) from 2017 through May 2020 to help homeowners certify work that was already finished without prior inspection. Homeowners could apply for a WPI-8-C during that window, which often involved an engineer evaluating the finished work. However, that program has ended, and after June 1, 2020, Texas no longer allows after-the-fact windstorm certification in most cases. Now, all new construction or repairs must be inspected _during_ the process. If it wasn’t, you’re basically out of luck on getting it certified, except for some very narrow exceptions.
One such exception is for certain older or historically significant buildings. Texas law allows an exemption for designated historic structures, recognizing that modern wind retrofits could damage their character. A homeowner with a qualifying historic home (for example, a house listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark) can apply for a Windstorm Exemption (Form WEA-1). An approved WEA-1 exemption means the home does _not_ have to meet current windstorm building codes to be insured by TWIA – the owner can repair the building with like-kind materials to preserve its historical architecture. This exemption is mainly used in places like Galveston’s historic districts, where you wouldn’t want to replace antique wood windows with modern aluminum ones, for example. For most homeowners with typical houses, though, a WPI-8 compliance certificate is the route to go (your home likely isn’t eligible for an exemption unless it’s officially historic).
If you find yourself in the predicament of needing Texas windstorm insurance but lacking a WPI-8, what can you do? TWIA may still offer coverage but with a costly “WPI-8 waiver” surcharge. Essentially, they’ll insure a non-compliant property in some cases but charge an added premium (and this is typically temporary until you bring the property up to code in the next repair). It’s a _very_ expensive way to insure a home and not a guaranteed option – rules have changed over time on waiver allowances. The bottom line: it’s far better (and cheaper) to get the proper inspection and certificate when the work is done. Always insist on it from your contractor. If you’re working with a reputable outfit like RISE Roofing, they will make the WPI-8 process a standard part of the job, so you won’t have to worry about it. RISE Roofing, for example, is a TDI-certified contractor familiar with windstorm requirements – they ensure everything is done right to pass inspection and they will provide you the WPI-8 certificate upon completion of your roofing project.
* Paperwork and Certification: After the job is done and has passed inspection, RISE Roofing will ensure you (and your insurance agent) get a copy of the WPI-8 certificate. They’ll often even help submit it to TWIA or make sure it’s recorded. Down the line, if there’s any question about your home’s certification, RISE can help retrieve records or provide documentation. Essentially, they make sure the _administrative_ side – which can trip up homeowners not familiar with it – is fully taken care of.
In short, RISE Roofing simplifies the windstorm compliance process for homeowners. From start to finish, they integrate the WPI inspection steps into their workflow. This means you can focus on the outcome – a fortified home and continued insurance coverage – without getting bogged down in the technicalities. As a local Texas roofing contractor, RISE prides itself on doing things “the right way,” and for coastal homes, the right way _includes_ that WPI-8 certificate. Your home is likely your biggest investment; RISE helps you protect it by ensuring no corners are cut that would jeopardize your Texas windstorm insurance.
* Deductible – The amount you must pay out-of-pocket on a claim before insurance pays the rest. When you have a covered loss, the deductible is subtracted from the claim payment. For example, if you have a $2,000 deductible and $10,000 in covered damages, the insurer would pay $8,000 and you’re responsible for $2,000. (Many windstorm policies have percentage deductibles – see _Hurricane Deductible_ in the windstorm terms section.)
* Endorsement – A policy add-on or modification. Endorsements (also called riders) change the standard coverage. They can add coverage (for example, an endorsement to cover a home business or to schedule valuable jewelry) or they can exclude/limit coverage. In coastal areas, sometimes a _wind/hail exclusion endorsement_ is added to a homeowners policy (removing wind coverage, which is then picked up by TWIA). Always review any endorsements on your policy – they override the base contract language.
