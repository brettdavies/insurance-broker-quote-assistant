# Umbrella policy shock! Advice please?

I just got the renewal for our 1 million liability umbrella policy with State Farm. It went from $725 to $1289! We have not filed a single claim and, in fact, have just sold one vehicle to help lower our insurance cost, so there are even less automobile exposures. Is this a joke? We can't afford this hike in price and now have to cancel this policy. I live in Maryland.

Recommendations on other places to look for a reasonable policy?
