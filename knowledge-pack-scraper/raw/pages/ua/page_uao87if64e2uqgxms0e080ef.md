One of the easiest ways to [save on car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) is by taking advantage of discounts. The GEICO defensive driving discount is available in most states for drivers who complete an approved defensive driving course.
Though any driver can take a defensive driving course, younger and older drivers, as well as those looking to reduce auto insurance costs, could benefit from the discount.
[GEICO](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico) offers a defensive driving discount with up to 15% in savings, depending on your state. Here are the details you need to know, including how to qualify, how GEICO’s discount stacks up to the competition, and other discounts available to help you save even more.
## **What Is the GEICO Defensive Driving Discount?**
In most [states](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state), GEICO will give you a discount if you complete a state-approved defensive driving course. A defensive driving discount course teaches car accident prevention using defensive driving techniques.
Courses are available online or in person and can take four to 12 hours to complete. They can cost up to $100, but online courses generally cost $12 to $25.
The [defensive driver discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/defensive-driver-discount) isn’t as common as other car insurance discounts. It’s also one of the few discounts that require you to make a purchase to get the savings. GEICO offers the discount in almost all states, except for the following:
  * [Hawaii](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/hawaii)
  * [Massachusetts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/massachusetts)
  * [Michigan](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/michigan)
  * [North Carolina](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/north-carolina)
  * [Vermont](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/vermont)

## **How Much Can You Save With the GEICO Defensive Driving Discount?**
![A woman holding a steering wheel](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/8d213208b1/hand-on-steering-wheel.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Learning safe driving skills can save you up to 15% on auto insurance with the GEICO defensive driving discount. Discounts start at 5% but vary by state. The discount will stay on your policy for up to three years, and many states allow you to retake the driving course to continue getting the savings.
Keep in mind that being eligible for a 10% discount doesn’t mean your $600 premium will go down by $60. Most insurers, including GEICO, have a maximum discount percentage you can save and may only apply a discount to certain coverages, not the entire policy.
If you’re already getting the maximum savings, you may not get the savings you were hoping for, as some GEICO policyholders describe on Reddit.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-defensive-driver-discount#cite-1) In other cases, you may only get a partial discount, as one Yelp user complained.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-defensive-driver-discount#cite-2)
It’s a good idea to ask your GEICO agent how much you’ll save with the discount and factor in the cost of a defensive driving course in your state to see if the savings are worth completing the course.
### **How does GEICO’s defensive driving discount compare to competitors?**
GEICO isn’t the only insurance company that offers a discount for drivers who complete a defensive driving education course. State Farm, Progressive, Allstate, and Nationwide also offer savings if you complete a course.
The table below shows how GEICO stacks up to the competition, breaking down each company’s average rates, discount availability, and maximum potential savings, according to our research.
**Company** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Average Full-Coverage Premium** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Offers Defensive Driving Discount?** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Discount Availability** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Maximum Discount Savings** ![sort asc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://cdn.compare.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---|---|---|---  
GEICO | $138 | Yes | All states except HI, MA, MI, NC, and VT | 15%  
[State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm) | $108 | Yes | In legally mandated states | 15%  
[Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) | $171 | Yes | In legally mandated states | 5%  
[Allstate](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/allstate) | $137 | Yes | In legally mandated states | Varies  
[Nationwide](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/nationwide) | $178 | Yes | In legally mandated states | 5%  
Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Compare.com's 50-plus partner insurance providers and quote estimates from Quadrant Information Services. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.
The defensive driving discount varies by state and company, with most averaging 5%. GEICO and State Farm offer the highest potential savings, though GEICO’s discount is available in more states and you can complete courses online. Remember, online defensive driver courses are usually cheaper.
## **How to Get the GEICO Defensive Driving Course Discount**
![A car's dashboard](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/cdb107002b/spedometer.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
To get the discount, you have to complete the defensive driving course and provide the completion certificate to GEICO. Where to take the course, approved courses, and discount amounts vary by state. Some states, like [Alabama](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/alabama) and [Illinois](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/illinois), may call it a mature driver course because it’s only available to drivers 50 or older.
For example, a GEICO policyholder in [New Jersey](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/new-jersey) can save up to 5% by completing an approved in-person course or taking an online course through Defensive Driving by IMPROV, Safe Motorist, or the National Safety Council.
[New York](https://www.compare.com/by-state/new-york) drivers can take an online defensive course through the same companies and the New York Safety Program or attend an in-person safe driving course for up to 10% savings. Although New Jersey drivers must take the course voluntarily, New York drivers can take the course to reduce points on their driver’s license and get a discount.
After completing the course, log into your GEICO account online, go to the discounts page, and follow the instructions to submit the completion certificate.
## **Other GEICO Discounts to Consider**
![A woman using a laptop in a cafe](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/f7c6cbb9ba/woman-in-cafe.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
[GEICO offers 23 discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-discounts), so even if you don’t qualify for the defensive driving course discount, you can still save money. You can also stack them together to get even more savings.
Here are some other [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) GEICO offers:
  * **Vehicle safety features discount:** If your car has seat belts, airbags, or other passive restraint systems, you can save up to 23% with a [safety features discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/safety-features-discount). The discount applies only to personal injury protection (PIP) or medical payments coverage.
  * **Anti-theft device discount:** If your vehicle has an [anti-theft device](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/anti-theft-discount) installed, such as a car alarm or GPS tracking device, you can save up to 23% on your comprehensive coverage.
  * **Safe driver discount:** Maintaining a clean driving record can earn you savings. GEICO rewards [safe drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/safe-driver-discount) with up to 22% savings on most insurance policy coverages if you go without an accident for at least a year — most companies require three to five years.
  * **Multi-vehicle discount:** Insure at least two vehicles with GEICO to save up to 25% on most coverages with the [multi-car discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-car-insurance-discount).
  * **Good student discount:** Full-time students can qualify for a [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount) and save up to 15% on some GEICO coverages with a B average or better in school.
