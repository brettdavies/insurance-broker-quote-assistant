Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
The specifics of your [financial plan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/follow-these-steps-to-achieve-financial-wellness) and goals may not resemble anyone else's. Maybe you want to trek the globe after you retire while your neighbor plans to dive into full-time volunteer work. Regardless, some shared steps can help get you on track for your future.
A common financial regret for many people is not [saving early enough for retirement](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/retirement/retirement-advice-for-millennials-and-gen-x). Here's a breakdown of some money goals by age.
* Establish a consistent income and [good spending habits](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/the-psychology-of-spending-habits-and-mistakes).
* Sustain (and live with) a [budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown).
* [Eliminate debt](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-to-get-out-of-debt) (credit cards or loans), beginning with debt that has the highest interest.
* Enroll in [health insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/health).
* Start investing in a 401(k) and remember to contribute enough to receive the [maximum employer match](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-employer-401k-matching-works).
* Begin to develop an [emergency fund](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/build-an-emergency-fund) to help prepare for any unexpected financial situations.

* Eliminate additional non-mortgage debt, including [student loans](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/should-you-refinance-student-loans).
* Work on building up a [good credit score](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/what-is-a-good-credit-score) in the 700s or higher, if possible.
* Create a [will](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/what-is-a-will-and-why-do-you-need-one) and get [life insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/life).
* Maximize the match on [employer-sponsored retirement plans](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-employer-401k-matching-works).

* Pay extra on your mortgage, and [consider paying it off early](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/pay-off-mortgage-early).
* Discuss your [parents' finances](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-to-talk-about-money-with-aging-parents) and [estate plans](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/estate/does-everyone-need-estate-planning).
* Map out [college payment options](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/college/give-the-gift-of-education) with your kids (without touching retirement savings).
* Get [long-term care](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/health-insurance/dont-wait-too-long-to-get-longterm-care-coverage) insurance.
* Look into [financial advisors](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/when-do-i-need-a-financial-advisor) who can help you manage your situation.
