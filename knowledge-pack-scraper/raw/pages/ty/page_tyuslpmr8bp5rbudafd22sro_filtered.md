[Root](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) was among the early adopters of [telematics technology](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/), which helps to assign insurance rates based on driving habits instead of traditional rating factors. In fact, the company aims to discontinue using credit scores — a practice it calls "discriminatory" — by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive limited mileage.

## **Methodology:**

These results are based on a survey of 2,722 U.S. insurance policyholders assessing satisfaction with their car and homeowners insurance providers. The survey was conducted using Survey Monkey and designed by our in-house team. It aimed to collect detailed insights from a census-balanced sample reflecting age, gender, and region.

The questionnaire included demographic questions about age and gender identification and detailed inquiries into insurance experiences. Key topics:

* Duration with insurance provider and coverage specifics, including teen drivers.
* Claim filing experiences and satisfaction with claims handling.
* Customer service interactions, trust in providers, and likelihood of recommending their insurance.
* Use and satisfaction with digital tools and usage-based insurance programs.

Respondents rated their satisfaction on a Likert scale from 1 to 10 and provided qualitative feedback.

#### **Data Analysis**

Data were analyzed focusing on descriptive and inferential statistics to identify satisfaction trends and demographic impacts. Data cleaning and weighting were applied to ensure accuracy, alongside strict confidentiality protocols to protect data security.

## Telematics options: Root vs. GEICO

Each of these companies stands as a solid option for drivers interested in usage-based insurance. Telematics sits at the heart of Root's product, powering its entire pricing strategy. GEICO's DriveEasy, like Root, prices premiums based on an app that evaluates how you drive.

![root logo]()

Root Insurance

Root is one of the most prominent telematics-first insurance companies. Root uses its telematics app to gather information and calculate premiums for its customers. Rates are then set based on the insured's driving habits and frequency, rather than solely on demographic and historical information like past driving record or credit history.

![GEICO logo]()

GEICO DriveEasy

[GEICO DriveEasy Pro](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/geico-driveeasy/) is an app that tracks your driving habits to better assess your level of risk. For safe drivers, this can sometimes result in cheaper rates. Currently, the app is rated on app stores at 3.5 out of 5 stars (both Google Play and the Apple Store).

### Zebra Tip: Turn to Root for telematics

---

Root's intuitive app and usage-based pricing model places it at the forefront of insurance technology.

## Root vs. GEICO: home insurance

Root partners with Homesite to allow existing auto insurance customers to bundle homeowners insurance. Root home insurance is not available as a standalone insurance policy — a customer must be enrolled in Root's car insurance program to be eligible and could receive a 10% discount by bundling.

Though the company is seen as financially stable, it receives more customer complaints than average. Customers looking for top-notch customer satisfaction may do well to look into a policy with a more established insurance provider. In addition, Root homeowners insurance quotes can only be found via the company's mobile app, not its website.

Yes, when your company has to pay out on a claim, it will impact your rates.

I'm sorry to hear about your recent accidents. GEICO does reserve the right to non-renew your policy based on the number of claims you had. This is normal for insurance companies.

While I can't say with a certainty, it sounds like you were set up for EFT (auto-draft) payments with Allstate so you didn't have to worry about calling in or mailing a payment. Unfortunately with EFT options, it may not be possible to stop a scheduled payment draft depending on when the …
