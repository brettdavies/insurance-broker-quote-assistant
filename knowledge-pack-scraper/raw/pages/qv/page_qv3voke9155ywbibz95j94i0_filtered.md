South Florida is known for sunshine, tourism and one of the highest sinkhole risks in the United States. While Central Florida often gets the headlines, sinkholes are increasingly appearing across South Florida.

Most property owners don’t realize this: there is no agency in Florida responsible for sinkhole inspections. When a sinkhole appears on private property, it is the legal and financial responsibility of the owner to assess and repair it. Failing to act can lead not only to costly property damage but also serious safety risks and potential liability exposure.

This problem is growing as storm intensity increases across the region. Florida is the 5th rainiest state in the nation, averaging roughly 55 inches of rainfall per year over the past 50 years, according to Florida State University’s Climate Center. During South Florida’s rainy season, May through September, prolonged rainfall and fast-moving stormwater runoff intensify ground instability: one of the leading contributors to sinkhole formation.

### What Causes Sinkholes on Commercial Properties?

In Florida, sinkholes most commonly form for two reasons:

1. Naturally Occurring Karst Geology: South Florida is built on porous limestone, which naturally dissolves over time as water flows through it. Groundwater, rainfall and stormwater drainage all accelerate erosion, washing out supporting soil beneath the surface until it collapses.
2. Infrastructure Failure: Many property owners are surprised to learn that sinkholes often indicate stormwater system failure. A small defect inside a storm pipe, such as a separated joint or cracked inlet, can allow water to escape. That water carries soil with it, slowly creating a void that turns into a sinkhole. Over time, erosion increases pressure on the pipe, the section separates, and eventually the ground above collapses, creating a sinkhole.

### Early Warning Signs Property Owners Should Watch For

Because stormwater-related sinkholes develop over time, there are clear warning signs:

### Warning Sign

* Pooling stormwater
* Cracks around catch basins or pavement
* Sudden soft or spongy ground
* Bare soil areas that expand after rains
* Depressions forming near pipes, inlets or basins

### What It Could Mean

* Clogged or failing stormwater system
* Soil voids beneath infrastructure
* Subsurface washout
* Erosion from fast-moving runoff
* Pipe separation or asset failure

These minor signs can escalate quickly, often resulting in flooding, property damage, safety hazards and costly emergency repairs. Issues are far less expensive to fix before failure occurs.

### What do I do When a Sinkhole Appears?

If a sinkhole appears on your property:

* Immediately cordon off the area and mark it as unsafe
* Report hazards affecting traffic to local law enforcement
* If the road or land is privately owned, repairs are your responsibility
* Hire professionals to inspect and stabilize the site
* Contact a stormwater expert for inspection of subsurface assets and runoff flow

Corrective action may include geotechnical testing such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity testing, soil borings, or stormwater CCTV inspections to identify underground failure points.

### Preventative Inspections Are a Business Decision

Stormwater inspections aren’t just a compliance checkbox, they are risk mitigation for property value and safety.

* Annual stormwater inspections detect hidden failures before collapse
* Routine maintenance avoids Notice of Violation (NOV) fines
* Repairs are faster and more affordable when identified early
* Inspections during the dry season prepare your property for summer rainfall
* Reduces liability exposure for HOAs, REITs, commercial centers and industrial facilities

Ignoring early warning signs can lead to full-scale rehabilitations costing tens of thousands of dollars. Proactive management protects both budget and safety.
