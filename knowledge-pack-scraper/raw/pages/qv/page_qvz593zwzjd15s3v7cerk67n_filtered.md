Yes, in most cases, you need a permit to install hurricane shutters in Florida, as the state has specific building codes to ensure safety during hurricanes.

Below you will find answers to additional frequently asked questions from our readers about hurricane shutters.

#### **What legal codes and regulations apply to hurricane shutter installation in Florida?**

Florida’s strict building codes are designed to protect homes and residents in hurricane-prone areas. These regulations typically require a permit for hurricane shutter installation to ensure that the materials and installation methods meet safety standards. Permit requirements can vary by county or municipality, so it’s essential to check with your local building department for specific guidelines.

#### **What happens if you install hurricane shutters in Florida without a permit?**

Installing hurricane shutters without the required permit can result in fines, penalties, or orders to remove the shutters. Additionally, unpermitted installations may void manufacturer warranties and could create issues when selling your home, as buyers or lenders often require proof of compliance with local codes. It’s always best to obtain the necessary permits to avoid these complications.

#### **How can homeowners meet Florida’s hurricane shutter permit and code requirements?**

To ensure compliance, begin by contacting your local building department to determine the specific permit requirements in your area. You may need to submit an application, pay a fee, and provide detailed information about the shutters you plan to install, including product specifications and installation methods. Once approved, an inspection may be required after installation to verify compliance with local codes.

#### **Do you need professional installation to pass Florida’s permit inspection for hurricane shutters?**

Professional installation is not always required to meet permit guidelines, but it is often recommended. Licensed professionals are familiar with local building codes and can ensure that the shutters are installed correctly and pass inspection. If you choose to install them yourself, you’ll need to follow all manufacturer guidelines and provide documentation proving that the installation meets code requirements.
