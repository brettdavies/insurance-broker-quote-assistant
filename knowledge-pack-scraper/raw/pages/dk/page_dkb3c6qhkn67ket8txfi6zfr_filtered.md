## Understanding Umbrella Insurance

### What is Umbrella Insurance?

Umbrella insurance is a type of liability insurance that provides additional coverage beyond the limits of your existing policies. It acts as a safety net, protecting you from financial loss in the event of a claim exceeding your primary policy’s limits. Umbrella insurance typically covers personal liability, such as bodily injury, property damage, and even legal fees.

Let’s dive deeper into the concept of umbrella insurance and how it works. Imagine you’re hosting a backyard BBQ and one of your guests slips and falls on a wet surface, resulting in a serious injury. Your homeowner’s insurance policy may have a liability limit of $300,000, but the medical expenses and potential legal fees could easily exceed that amount. This is where umbrella insurance comes into play.

With umbrella insurance, you have an extra layer of protection. If the liability claim against you exceeds the limits of your homeowner’s insurance, your umbrella policy will kick in to cover the remaining costs, up to the policy’s limit. This can help safeguard your personal savings, investments, and other assets from being depleted in the event of a significant claim.

### Why is Umbrella Insurance Important?

Having umbrella insurance can provide valuable peace of mind. It helps protect your assets and future earnings from being jeopardized by unexpected events. For example, if you cause a severe automobile accident resulting in significant bodily injury and your auto insurance coverage isn’t sufficient to cover the damages, umbrella insurance can step in to bridge the gap.

Let’s take a closer look at why umbrella insurance is important. Accidents happen, and sometimes they can have devastating consequences. If you’re found liable for causing a major accident, the financial implications can be overwhelming. Medical bills, legal fees, and potential settlements can quickly add up, potentially leaving you in a dire financial situation.

Umbrella insurance acts as a safety net, providing an additional layer of coverage that goes beyond the limits of your primary policies. It can help protect your savings, investments, and other assets from being seized to satisfy a judgment against you. Without umbrella insurance, you may be forced to sell your home, dip into your retirement funds, or face wage garnishment to settle a large liability claim.

Furthermore, umbrella insurance doesn’t just protect your current assets; it also safeguards your future earnings. If you’re hit with a substantial liability claim that exceeds the limits of your primary policies, your future earnings could be at risk. Without umbrella insurance, a significant portion of your income could be garnished to satisfy the judgment, making it difficult to maintain your current lifestyle and financial goals.

Having umbrella insurance is especially important if you have significant assets or engage in activities that carry a higher risk of liability. This could include owning rental properties, having a swimming pool, or participating in high-risk hobbies like boating or skiing. Umbrella insurance provides an added layer of protection that can help shield your assets and future earnings from being wiped out in the face of a major liability claim.

Let’s take a closer look at the history of Progressive Insurance.

### History of Progressive Insurance

Progressive Insurance was founded by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green in 1937. Initially, the company focused solely on providing auto insurance to customers. However, as the years went by, Progressive realized the importance of diversifying its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its customers.

Throughout its history, Progressive has consistently adapted to changes in the insurance industry. In the 1950s, the company introduced a drive-in claims service, allowing customers to conveniently file claims without having to visit a physical office. This innovative approach to customer service set Progressive apart from its competitors and established the company as a leader in the industry.

As the demand for insurance coverage expanded beyond just automobiles, Progressive recognized the opportunity to expand its product lineup. In the 1960s, the company began offering home insurance, providing customers with comprehensive coverage for their most valuable asset – their homes.

Over the years, Progressive continued to innovate and expand its offerings. In the 1980s, the company introduced renters insurance, recognizing the growing number of individuals who were renting rather than owning homes. This product offering provided peace of mind to renters, ensuring that their personal belongings were protected in the event of theft, fire, or other covered perils.

Progressive also recognized the needs of motorcycle enthusiasts and introduced motorcycle insurance in the 1990s. This specialized coverage provided riders with the protection they needed while enjoying their passion for the open road.
