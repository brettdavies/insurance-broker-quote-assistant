* What to Know About Fire-Resistant Homes
![Man climbs a ladder to clear roof of fire-prone debris.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/fire-resistant-homes.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
When people hear the words "fire safety," they might often think of [in-home smoke detectors and fire extinguishers](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/fire-safety-equipment-for-home.html) or even [sprinkler systems](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/small-business/automatic-sprinkler-systems.html). However, it’s equally important to consider fire-resistant material for your home’s exterior to [help reduce the risk of starting or spreading fires](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/safety-for-home-fires.html). Fortunately, homeowners can take steps to help reduce fire hazards around their property.
* **Roof** — use composite, metal, clay, tile or [impact-resistant roofing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/impact-resistant-roofing-materials) to help deter fires. Close off gaps under the roof tiles, shingles and eaves to help block wind-blown embers. The same applies to patio covers.
* **Gutters** — non-combustible metal drip edges and gutter guards may help protect from ember exposure. Regularly [clear debris from the gutters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/stepbystep-guide-to-gutter-cleaning) and roofing — plant debris is especially vulnerable to ember ignition.
* **Windows** — use dual-paned glass, [tempered safety glass,](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-make-windows-more-energy-efficient) fireproof shutters and/or screens to help diminish the effects of fires.
* **Garages** — seal the outline of your garage door with weather stripping to minimize gaps for embers to enter. You may also want to perform regular [yard maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/spring-yard-cleanup-safety-tips) next to your driveway to limit the number of plants close to your home structure.
* **Chimneys** — use a non-flammable metal screen material to cover your chimney and stove pipe outlets. Close the fireplace when not in use and/or during [wildfire season](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/wildfire-safety-tips) and remember to [clean it and the chimney regularly](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/why-chimney-cleaning-is-important).

When possible, use a contractor to complete installations, or if you are [thinking about doing the renovations yourself](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-to-diy-and-when-to-go-pro), see that you follow safety guidelines carefully.
* **Fireworks** — according to the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)](https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Fireworks), in 2023 hospitals treated an estimated 9,700 injuries resulting from [fireworks](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/fireworks-safety-for-fourth-of-july). Additionally, the CPSC found that the sparks from at-home fireworks can burn as hot as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to risk of burns or embers landing on your home or other structures. Even in states where fireworks are legal, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) suggests [attending fireworks shows instead of producing your own](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230425/fourth-july-fema-promotes-safety-and-preparedness).
Fires aren’t the only risk homeowners face. To help prepare, check out some more [ways to help keep your home safe](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/prevention).
