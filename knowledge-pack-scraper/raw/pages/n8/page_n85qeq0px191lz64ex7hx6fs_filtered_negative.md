# What are the Most Common and Effective Solutions for Sinkholes in Florida?

Florida sits on top of a layer of limestone which makes the entire state vulnerable to sinkholes. Sinkholes are extremely common, causing major damage to homes, buildings, and other structures. That’s why it is important to inspect the interior and exterior of your property for sinkhole activity. Look for telltale signs such as:
* [![Common and Effective Solutions for Sinkholes in Florida](https://foundationprosfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/effective-sinkhole-repair.jpg)](https://foundationprosfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/effective-sinkhole-repair.jpg)Cracks in the interior joints of doors and windows
* Cracks in exterior brick and masonry
* Sticking windows and doors
* A yard or street depression
* Deep cracks in driveways or sidewalks
* Separation of pavement or slab
* Standing water in the yard
* Neighbors with sinkhole activity
* Round patches of wilting plants
* Leaning trees or fence posts
* The actual cavity starting to open
If you notice any of these signs, hire a professional to inspect your property for sinkhole activity.
## Sinkhole Repair Solutions in Florida
Many sinkhole remediations can be expensive and time-consuming because they use heavy equipment and require a lot of manpower, but there are common and effective sinkhole options for the residents in Florida. We offer the following methods:
* **Sinkhole Pressure Grouting:** Grouting includes compaction grouting, pressure grouting, and chemical grouting. All of these processes involve pumping material into the soil.
* **Compaction Grouting:** Compaction grouting involves injecting polyurethane foam into loose, weak soil around your home. The mixture fills the voids and gaps beneath the structure. As the foam expands, it compacts the soil and makes it denser. This helps supports and stabilizes the home and prevent sinkhole activity.
* **Permeation Grouting:** Permeation grouting can be used to fill in voids in the soil, improve soft-ground settlements, and control water movement through the soil. If concrete slabs are unleveled or sloping, injecting grout into the affected slab could raise the slab back to its original level. Permeation and compaction grouting can be used at the same time.
* **Void Filling:** [Void filling](https://foundationprosfl.com/services/void-fill/) is used for more serious sinkhole situations. Small holes are drilled into the site, causing little disruption to the work area. Polyurethane is used to fill in voids. This helps stabilizes the foundation. Void filling is more effective than other mudjacking techniques because it is quick with long-lasting results.
* **Underpinning:** Underpinning can be used to repair structural damage caused by sinkholes. [Steel piers](https://foundationprosfl.com/services/steel-push-piers/) are used to support and stabilize the foundation. Loose soil and sinkhole formations cause concrete foundations to move or shift over time. Piers are installed deep into the soil to lift structures to their original position.
