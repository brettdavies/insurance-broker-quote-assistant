[](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/blog/new-law-hurricane-protections-homeowners-associations/)[](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/blog/new-law-hurricane-protections-homeowners-associations/)[](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/blog/new-law-hurricane-protections-homeowners-associations/)[](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/blog/new-law-hurricane-protections-homeowners-associations/)
In late May, Florida’s Governor signed [House Bill 293](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/293) into law, which addresses hurricane protections for homeowners’ associations. Association directors, committee members, and property managers should review and, if necessary, revise their current approval policies to ensure compliance.
Specifically, the [new law](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/blog/florida-governor-signs-house-bill-293-into-law/) states that all Florida homeowners associations, regardless of when they were first established, must adopt hurricane protection specifications for all of the structures and types of improvements located on a parcel within their community. The law details that “hurricane protection” includes, but is not limited to, roof systems that comply with the [Florida Building Code](https://floridabuilding.org/) and meet ASCE 7-22 standards, permanent fixed storm shutters, roll-down track storm shutters, impact-resistant windows and doors, polycarbonate panels, reinforced garage doors, erosion controls, exterior fixed generators, fuel storage tanks, and other hurricane-protection products.
Given that this law has already gone into effect upon its gubernatorial approval, [homeowners’ associations](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0720/0720.html) that require prior review for owners’ storm-hardening property improvements should immediately review and address their policies and standards. Questions regarding the adoption of such specifications and how they will be enforced via an application and review process should be referred to highly qualified and experienced association legal counsel.
This new law is aimed at protecting the health, safety and welfare of the people of the state of Florida, while also enabling associations to help ensure uniformity and consistency in the hurricane protections installed by owners in their communities. Given its plain language, HOAs and their boards of directors would be well advised to develop and utilize clear specifications for all such improvements focusing only on their aesthetic qualities to maintain uniformity. Please [contact us](https://www.siegfriedrivera.com/contact/) with any questions on this new law.
