* **[Personal injury protection (PIP)](/car-insurance/how-pip-works-new-york "How Does Personal Injury Protection (PIP) Work in New York?"):** $50,000 per accident

### Supplemental spousal liability insurance NY

All auto insurance policies for married drivers in New York automatically include a new coverage called supplemental spousal liability insurance (SSLI), as of August 2023.

This coverage allows you to make a claim against your spouse's insurance if you're hurt in an accident while they're driving.

**Your supplemental spousal liability insurance limit is typically the same as your bodily injury liability limit.** However, you can only use this coverage once you've used all of your personal injury protection (PIP) coverage.

You can decline supplemental spousal liability insurance by contacting your insurance company and filling out a [form stating you're turning down this coverage](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/auto_insurers_supp_spousal_liability_insurance_declination_form.pdf "Supplemental Spousal Liability Insurance Declination Form").

How much does supplemental spousal liability coverage cost?

Supplemental spousal liability insurance costs an average of $22 per year.

However the cost varies by company. For example, Allstate doesn't charge extra for this coverage. But Geico customers pay an additional $73 per year for the coverage, on average.

#### Average cost of supplemental spousal liability insurance

| Company | Annual cost |
| --- | --- |
| Allstate | $0 |
| Progressive | $2 |
| Erie | $6 |
| USAA | $14 |
| State Farm | $23 |
| Geico | $73 |

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/award)

### What's the best car insurance coverage to get in New York?

Most New York drivers should get full coverage car insurance, which includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").

**If you have a car loan or lease, your lender typically requires you to have these coverages.** That's because they pay for damage to your car in many situations, regardless of whose fault it is. You should also consider adding comprehensive and collision coverage if your car is less than eight years old or worth more than $5,000.

In addition, full coverage policies typically have higher liability limits than the state requirement. **Higher liability limits are a good idea because New York's required limits may not be high enough to pay for a serious accident.**

For example, New York only required $10,000 of property damage liability insurance. If you crash into a Tesla and the other car is totaled, $10,000 won't be enough to fully replace the other driver's car.
