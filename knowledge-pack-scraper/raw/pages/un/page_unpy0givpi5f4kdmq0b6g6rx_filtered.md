# Calculate your possible line of credit

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

Enter your home value and mortgage amount to see what your line of credit could be.

Our line of credit calculator uses inputs of your home's value, what you currently owe and the maximum loan to value (LTV) ratio from your lending institution. This information is used to estimate how much your lender could consider issuing you for a home equity loan. Loans are typically the amount of proposed line of credit plus the outstanding balance of your current mortgage. The value of your home is usually the appraised value based on the current market value. The maximum loan to value varies from lender to lender.
