Rates can differ by hundreds of dollars per month depending on the company you choose. Full coverage with Farmers costs an average of $224 more per month than State Farm, for example. That's why young drivers should always shop around for multiple quotes to find the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies").

**However, if you get your license for the first time when you're 24, you'll probably pay more than 24-year-olds who have been driving for several years.** As you get older and gain more experience behind the wheel, your rates will probably go down, unless you [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "How Much Will My Car Insurance Rates Go Up After a Crash?") after an accident you cause.
**Car insurance is usually[more expensive for men](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gender-impacts-car-insurance-rates "Which Gender Pays More for Car Insurance?") than it is for women.** Men are statistically  more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors like speeding and driving drunk. That means they're more likely to get into accidents, so insurance companies charge men higher rates.
