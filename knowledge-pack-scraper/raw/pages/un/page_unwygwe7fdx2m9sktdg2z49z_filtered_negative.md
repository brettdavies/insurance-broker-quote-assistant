4. What is loss of use coverage on a homeowners insurance policy?
Loss of use coverage on [home insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) policies typically offer 10% or 20% of your dwelling coverage. For example, if you have $200,000 in dwelling coverage, you'd be covered up to $20,000 or $40,000 in the event of a covered loss, depending on your policy.
Typically, [condo insurance](https://www.progressive.com/condo-insurance/) policies will provide loss of use coverage that is equal to 20% of your combined [dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling-coverage/) and [personal property coverage limits](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-property-coverage/). For example, if you have a $60,000 limit for dwelling coverage and a $30,000 limit for personal property coverage, your loss of use coverage limit will be $18,000.
Depending on your insurance company, loss of use on [renters insurance](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/) may be a flat amount (between $3,000 and $5,000) or a percentage of your personal property coverage. At ASI, one of the insurers in Progressive's network and part of our family of companies, you're covered up to 40% of your personal property limit. That means if you have $100,000 in personal property coverage, you will have up to $40,000 in loss of use coverage.
