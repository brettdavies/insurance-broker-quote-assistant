Do insurance companies check your driving record? Yes, and if you have a history of accidents or traffic violations, you’ll have to buy [high-risk auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/high-risk-auto-insurance/) at a more expensive rate.

Insurers check driving records to determine whether you’re a high-risk driver. How auto insurance companies check driving records depends on state law, but most use driver’s license numbers to retrieve information. Enter your ZIP code above to see how your driving record impacts local rates.

Does Progressive check driving records? How often does USAA check driving records? Use this guide to answer these questions and find out what insurance companies are looking for and how to check the accident history of a driver

Things to remember...

* Insurance companies check driving records when you apply for a new policy and at renewal
* Accidents and traffic violations are the main red flags that raise insurance rates
* What is considered a clean driving record is no accidents, tickets, or recent claims

**How Auto Insurance Companies Check Driving Records**

How do insurance companies check driving records? Insurance companies know how to check a driving record with one simple legal identifier: your driver’s license. Any time you have an accident, make an insurance claim, or receive a citation for a traffic violation, your driver’s license number is associated with these events.

> Just as creditors can attain information about you through your Social Security number, insurance companies can get the information they require through your driver’s license number.

What do car insurance companies check? Insurance companies want to see your driving habits and how likely you are to make a claim. They will check for a history of speeding tickets, at-fault accidents, and DUI/DWIs. Driving behaviors like this increase your risk as a driver, which leads to higher insurance rates.

How far back do insurance companies check for DUI? State laws determine how long insurance companies can look back, but DUI charges stay on your driving record the longest — in some states as long as ten years.

### **What Insurance Companies Look for on Your Driving Record**

Can insurance companies see your driving record? Yes, and they look for any negative marks on your driving record that may indicate you are a high-risk driver.

> What driving record do insurance companies look at? Insurers view accidents, excessive insurance claims, and traffic violations as the biggest red flags. If your record check turns up any combination of these factors, your insurer will likely charge you a higher rate.

> **Licensed Insurance Agent**

You may be wondering how exactly an insurance company can get this information and how a negative driving record could affect you. Here are the rate increases that you can expect to pay after specific convictions.

**Rate Increase Averages Based on Driving Convictions**

| Infraction | Annual Rate Increase |
| --- | --- |
| Careless Driving | 16% |
| Driving Uninsured | 6% |
| Driving Without a License | 18% |
| Driving Without a Seat Belt | 3% |
| DUI | 19% |
| Failure to Stop | 14% |
| Failure to Yield | 9% |
| Improper Passing | 14% |

These [insurance surcharges affect auto insurance rates](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-accident-surcharges-affect-auto-insurance-rates/), but how much your premiums increase varies from carrier to carrier. Some convictions are considered less serious and come with a lesser penalty than others.

### The Difference Between a Clean and Good Driving Record

Do I have a clean driving record? That depends on your driving habits and your insurance company. A clean record typically means that a driver doesn’t have a single violation or claim on their driving record or insurance history, but a good record is a little more flexible.

**For instance, while one company might raise your rates by $45 after your first speeding ticket, another provider might not consider your first offense that risky and only raise rates by $20.**

This table shows how rates vary at national companies after different offenses:

How far back does State Farm check driving records? That depends on the violation and your state insurance laws. State Farm could look back as few as three years or as many as ten.

Even if you have a traffic violation that’s more than five years old, don’t automatically assume that it won’t be seen. And instead of stressing yourself out with questions like, “How far back does Geico look at your driving record?” or “How far back does Progressive look at your driving record?”, your best bet is to ask the insurance company about their driving record check timeframe.

If you’re curious about what is on your driving record, you can learn how to check driving records for insurance through your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). You can even get an instant driving record on the DMV website in many states.

## When can car insurance companies deny coverage?

An insurance company can choose to deny you coverage if they determine that you are too big of a risk. While this may seem unfair since most states require insurance to drive a vehicle, insurance companies are not in the business of losing money.

Aside from having too many previous claims or traffic violations, other reasons an insurance company may deny you coverage are:

* Fraudulent claims
* You own a luxury or exotic vehicle
* Providing false information on your insurance application

Can your driving record be checked by your insurance company. Yes, and if the company determines, based on what it finds, that you’re high risk for too many costly claims to be a profitable client, they can refuse to insure you. You will then have to find a [cheap auto insurance company for high-risk drivers,](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-auto-insurance-companies-for-high-risk-drivers/ "10 Best Auto Insurance Companies for High-Risk Drivers in 2024") which is certainly possible. 

> In most instances, an insurance company will still offer you coverage even with a negative driving record. Of course, your rates will be higher than someone with a sparkling clean record. 
>
> Jeffrey Manola
> **Licensed Insurance Agent**

In the most extreme circumstances, the insurer is within its right to deny coverage entirely. That’s why learning how to check your accident history before requesting auto insurance quotes can save you time and money. 

## **Maintain a Clean Record and Don’t Sweat Driving Record Checks**

Just as employers perform background checks on potential employees, auto insurance companies check driving records to determine whether you are a high-risk driver. Poor driving history can cause a lot of anxiety when you know an insurance company is going to check your record. That’s why it’s important to maintain a clean driving record.

Sometimes accidents happen through no fault of your own, and an isolated accident isn’t going to destroy your record. It’s the accumulation of multiple accidents, claims, and traffic violations that can make an impact.

## **Bottom Line on How Auto Insurance Companies Check Driving Records**

Do insurance companies check your license? Yes. How auto insurance companies check driving records is the same across most states since your driver’s license number contains all the information insurers need to determine your risk.

So, if you’re ever wondering, “How do insurance companies find out about tickets?”, it’s through your driver’s license number. And if you have accidents or speeding tickets on your record, your auto insurance rates will go up.

> All hope is not lost if you already have a record with more negative marks than you’d like to admit. You can rebuild your record by driving carefully to avoid accidents and traffic violations. You can also take defensive driving classes or sign up for [cheap usage-based auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/cheap-usage-based-auto-insurance/ "Cheap Usage-Based Auto Insurance in 2024 (Save With These 7 Companies)") for lower rates.

How far back does Allstate look at your driving record? Most insurance companies only look back three to five years.

In the meantime, you can [compare auto insurance quotes](#mdabottom) from various companies to see which can offer the best rate and coverage for high-risk insurance. Some are more forgiving than others regarding negative driving records, so it pays to shop around.
