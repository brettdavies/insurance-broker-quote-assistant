## **Is it Illegal to not Have Car Insurance in Texas? 2025 Update**
Yes, it is illegal to drive without car insurance in Texas. Texas laws require drivers to demonstrate financial proof to compensate for the losses they cause in an accident. Vehicle drivers fulfill their obligation by acquiring auto liability insurance.
[**Minimum coverage.**](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html)To cover both personal liability and property damage, drivers must maintain a minimum level of auto insurance. The bare minimums are:
  * $30,000 for liability cover for each injured person and up to $60,000 per accident
  * $25,000 for property damage per accident


The above coverage is also called 30/60/25 coverage.
You can enhance your protection using the following coverage:
  * Collision coverage
  * Comprehensive coverage
  * Personal injury protection coverage
  * Rental reimbursement coverage
  * Tow and labor coverage
  * Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage


## Penalties for Driving Without an Insurance in Texas
Anyone driving without insurance is liable for a misdemeanor offense, which carries a $175-$350 fine. Subsequent offenders need to[ pay up to $1000 in fines.](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/how-much-is-a-no-insurance-ticket-in-texas/)
Drivers found guilty of driving without insurance are often required to file form [SR-22 for two years](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/faq/section-9-sr-22-proof-financial-responsibility#:~:text=You%20must%20maintain%20a%20valid,actions%20and%2For%20reinstatement%20fees.) after the date of their recent conviction.
Additional driver consequences for failing to maintain insurance include:
  * License suspension
  * Vehicle impoundment
  * Legal liability
  * Difficulty in obtaining insurance
  * Surcharges

## What Percentage of Texas Drivers Do Not Have Insurance?
According to a [2023 study](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), 14 percent of motorists, or one in seven drivers, were uninsured. 
In Texas, 13.8 percent of drivers were uninsured in 2022.
## Uninsured Motorist Claims
If involved in an accident with an uninsured driver, there are avenues to protect your right to compensation. First, you can contact your insurer, which can provide compensation through uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.
Uninsured motorist coverage covers accident-related losses if the other [driver doesn’t have insurance.](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/consequences-uninsured-in-texas/) On the other hand, underinsurance motorist coverage pays for losses if the other driver has insufficient coverage.
Alternatively, you can work with a [car accident attorney](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/) to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. A judge or a jury can issue an order compelling the at-fault party to cater injury-related losses using their wages or assets.
## What Are the Legal Requirements for Auto Insurance in Austin, Texas?
**In Texas, it is illegal to drive without car insurance.** State law mandates that all drivers carry minimum liability coverage to cover damages in case of an accident. According to the [**Texas Department of Insurance**](https://tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html) (TDI), the required minimum coverage limits are:
  * **$30,000** per person for bodily injury.
  * **$60,000** per accident for bodily injury (if multiple people are injured).
  * **$25,000** for property damage per accident.


This is commonly referred to as **30/60/25 liability coverage** and is required to legally operate a vehicle in Austin and throughout Texas. Failing to carry this minimum insurance can result in fines, suspension of driving privileges, and potential vehicle impoundment. Repeat offenses can lead to even steeper penalties, including the possibility of an SR-22 requirement, which significantly increases insurance premiums.
Additionally, uninsured drivers may be personally liable for damages they cause in an accident. This means that if you are at fault in a crash and lack insurance, you could face lawsuits and be responsible for paying out-of-pocket for medical expenses, vehicle repairs, and other damages incurred by the other party.
### FAQs
#### _Is it legal to not have car insurance in the US?_
**No, in most states, car insurance is mandatory.** Nearly every U.S. state requires drivers to have minimum liability insurance to cover accidents. The only exceptions are **New Hampshire and Virginia.**
For Texas drivers, carrying valid auto insurance is **not optional,** and failure to do so can lead to serious legal and financial consequences. 
#### _How long can I be without car insurance?_
**Texas does not allow any grace period for lapsed car insurance coverage.** The moment your policy expires or is canceled, you are **uninsured** and subject to penalties, including:
  * Fines start at $175 for a first offense, increasing with repeat violations.
  * Vehicle registration and driver’s license suspension.
  * Possible vehicle impoundment.
  * SR-22 requirements for repeat offenders can significantly increase insurance rates.


If you are caught driving without insurance, Texas law enforcement may issue you a citation, and your vehicle may be towed. Additionally, reinstating your insurance after a lapse can result in significantly higher premiums, as insurers may view you as a high-risk driver.
To avoid legal trouble and financial risk, maintain continuous coverage and avoid lapses in your policy. If you struggle to afford coverage, Texas offers assistance through the **Texas Automobile Insurance Plan Association (TAIPA)** for high-risk drivers.
#### _What states legally require car insurance?_
**All states except New Hampshire and Virginia legally require car insurance.** However, even in these states, drivers must demonstrate financial responsibility.
  * **New Hampshire** : Drivers must prove they can cover damages in case of an accident, or else they must carry insurance.
  * **Virginia** : Drivers can opt out of insurance by paying an annual **$500 uninsured motor vehicle fee** , but they remain financially liable for any damages.


In all other states, including Texas, failure to maintain the **legally required insurance** can lead to legal penalties, license suspension, and higher future premiums. Additionally, in states with **no-fault insurance laws** , drivers must carry **personal injury protection (PIP)** coverage, which helps cover medical expenses regardless of who is at fault in an accident.
