# State Farm Discount/ADT rate reduction?

I have had ADT for 5 years (contract just ended) cameras are paid off and now I just pay the monthly monitor fee. Just found out state farm offers a discount for having home monitor system. However after looking at ADT and their monthly price for monitoring, I am considering switching to something cheaper or calling ADT and threatening to cancel if they don't reduce my monthly rate. Anyone had success in getting rate lowered? or is there another cheaper company that state farm will also accept and give me the discount for?

UPDATE: I called ADT and threatened to cancel. Was told they could reduce it to $50 a month +taxes. They said state farm gives a discount of $500-$600 a year for having ADT but having state farm doesnt lower their price so still $50 a month. Still looking at simplisafe and they are running a 50% off everything and first month free. Current equipment is 5 years old. By switching id cut the monthly price currently from $73 to about $35 (I estimate $35 with tax) for the core monitoring plan. After doing some more research on SS, apparently their cameras are shit. Probably wont be going with their cameras. I am gonna get back in touch with ADT to see if they will throw in a camera or two possibly.
