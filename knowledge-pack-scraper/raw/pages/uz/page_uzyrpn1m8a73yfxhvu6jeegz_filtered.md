## RV insurance requirements and coverages

Motorhomes — as the name implies — have a motor and can be driven independently. Trailer-type RVs require another vehicle to tow them. If you drive a motorhome, most states require a minimum amount of liability coverage. If you pull a travel trailer, you need liability coverage on your tow vehicle.

RV insurance policies offer many coverages that benefit you and your RV, such as:

* **Liability coverage**: All motorhome policies include bodily injury and property damage liability coverage that meets the state's minimum. RV liability coverage pays for damage and injuries you cause to others while driving your motorhome. Note that travel trailer policies don't include liability coverage.
* **Comprehensive coverage**: Comprehensive coverage protects your motorhome or trailer against damage from events beyond your control: severe weather, collisions with animals, fire, theft, and vandalism.
* **Collision coverage**: Collision coverage can pay for damage to your RV sustained in an accident with another vehicle, or object. Collision may also cover damage from rollovers.
