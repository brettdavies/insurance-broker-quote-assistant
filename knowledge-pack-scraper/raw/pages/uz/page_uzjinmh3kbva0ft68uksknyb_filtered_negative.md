Historically, most insurance has been sold and serviced via local agents, and those local relationships were a key component in that process. As the digital revolution continues to impact our lives, more and more "traditional" processes are being replaced with digital solutions. This is occurring across more and more industries traditionally handled via face-to-face interactions, including banking, automobile and home purchases, and virtually all consumer industries. Insurance companies, if they are to maintain and grow in the future, will most likely need to adapt to this new paradigm or [risk seeing] a revolution of new competitors as has occurred in so many consumer-focused businesses.
