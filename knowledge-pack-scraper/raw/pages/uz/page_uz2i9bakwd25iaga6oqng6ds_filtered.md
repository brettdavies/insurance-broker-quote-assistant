# What Is Windstorm Insurance?

* December 2, 2024

Floridians know that tropical storms, hurricanes, and even tornadoes are a part of life in the Sunshine State. While standard homeowners insurance typically includes coverage for wind damage, many homeowners don’t fully understand what their policy protects—and what it doesn’t.

For example, while windstorm insurance covers damage to your home and personal property caused by gusty winds, it may come with specific conditions, such as higher deductibles and exclusions that you may not realize are in place.

It’s crucial to take the time to understand your coverage, ensuring that your home is fully protected against Florida’s unpredictable weather. In this blog, we’ll break down what windstorm insurance is, how it works, and why understanding your policy is essential for safeguarding your home.

## What Is Windstorm Insurance?

[Windstorm insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windstorm-insurance.asp) is essential for protecting your home and personal property from damage caused by high winds, including those brought by hurricanes, tropical storms, and tornadoes. In Florida, coverage for wind damage is typically included in your homeowners policy by default. However, [state law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.712.html) allows homeowners to exclude this coverage—though not without significant precautions.

If you elect to remove windstorm coverage, you must sign an affidavit explicitly stating: “I do not want the insurance on my (home/mobile home/condominium unit) to pay for damage from windstorms. I will pay those costs. My insurance will not.”

Additionally, your mortgage lender or lienholder must agree to this exclusion, since they share in the financial risk of protecting your property.

In some areas of Florida, [such as “wind pools,”](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/florida-wind-insurance) wind coverage is **excluded** from homeowners policies but it may still be required by your mortgage lender. In this case, you would need to get standalone wind coverage.

## Do You Need Windstorm Insurance?

While excluding windstorm coverage might seem like a way to lower your insurance costs, it’s a gamble that could leave you financially exposed.

If you live in an area prone to hurricanes or other severe weather—and most of Florida qualifies—it’s critical to think carefully before signing away windstorm coverage. Coastal regions may face the highest risk, but even inland areas aren’t immune to wind damage during major storms.

Excluding this coverage might save you a little now, but it could cost you significantly more in the future if you’re forced to pay out of pocket for repairs.

Your home is one of your biggest investments, and windstorm coverage is a critical part of protecting it. If you’re considering waiving this protection, think twice. It’s not just about avoiding immediate costs—it’s about ensuring your peace of mind and the ability to rebuild if disaster strikes.

## Windstorm vs. Flood Insurance

While windstorm coverage is essential, it’s also important to understand its limitations. After all, not all storm damage is wind-related, and one of the most significant risks homeowners face during storms is flooding.

Unfortunately, [flooding is not included in most home insurance coverage](https://darrschackowinsurance.com/blog/home-insurance/why-are-floods-not-covered-by-homeowners-insurance/) or windstorm policies.

[Flooding is a costly hazard](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/floods/faq/), causing an average of $5 billion in damage each year across the United States. This means that even if your home is protected against wind damage, you could still be financially exposed if rising water damages your property.

For Florida homeowners, where tropical storms and hurricanes often bring heavy rain and storm surges, additional coverage like flood insurance is essential.

If you’re considering purchasing [flood insurance](https://darrschackowinsurance.com/blog/flood-insurance/do-i-need-flood-insurance/), plan ahead—policies typically take 30 days to go into effect. While this might seem like an added expense on top of your current insurance costs, it’s a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing your home is protected from every angle.

Together, windstorm and flood insurance provide comprehensive protection, ensuring your home and finances are safeguarded during Florida’s unpredictable storm seasons.

## What Does Windstorm Insurance Cost?

Windstorm insurance costs can vary widely depending on several factors, most notably the location of your property and the way your home is built.

Homeowners in high-risk areas—especially along the coast—often face higher premiums. These areas are more susceptible to wind damage, which increases the likelihood of claims and the overall cost of coverage.

Older homes or those built before modern hurricane codes may be more expensive to insure because they are less likely to withstand severe windstorms. Homes with features like impact-resistant windows, storm shutters, or reinforced roofs may qualify for lower premiums, as they are better equipped to handle storm damage.

While including windstorm coverage may increase your overall insurance costs, it is a vital investment to ensure your home and finances are protected.

## How To File a Windstorm Insurance Claim

Filing a windstorm insurance claim can feel overwhelming, especially in the aftermath of a damaging storm. However, taking the right steps can streamline the process and help you receive the coverage you’re entitled to.

Here’s what you need to know:

The first step after a windstorm is to **document the damage thoroughly**. Take clear photos or videos of all affected areas, including structural damage, broken windows, or personal property losses. This visual evidence will be invaluable during the windstorm insurance claims process.

Next, **contact your insurance company** as soon as possible to begin your claim. Be prepared to provide a detailed account of the damage and any supporting documents they request. Prompt communication with your insurer can help expedite the process and ensure a smoother resolution.

It’s also important to **understand how your policy’s separate deductible** applies to windstorm insurance claims. Windstorm coverage often comes with a [higher deductible](https://darrschackowinsurance.com/blog/home-insurance/what-is-a-hurricane-deductible/) than other types of claims, meaning you’ll need to pay more out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Knowing this in advance can help you avoid surprises when it’s time to file a claim.

By staying organized and informed, you can navigate the claims process with confidence and get your home back to normal as quickly as possible.

## Conclusion

When it comes to safeguarding your property, windstorm insurance is more than just a recommendation—it’s a necessity.

With the state’s susceptibility to hurricanes, tropical storms, and high winds, ensuring your policy includes coverage for wind damage is critical to protecting your home and your peace of mind.

One of the key takeaways for homeowners is to thoroughly review your existing policy. Confirm that your windstorm insurance covers the risks unique to your area, and consider adding additional coverage like flood insurance to address potential gaps.

It’s equally important to plan ahead for your policy’s separate deductible, so you’re financially prepared if the unexpected happens.
