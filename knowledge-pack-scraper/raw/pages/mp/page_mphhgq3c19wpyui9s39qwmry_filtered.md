## Description

The California Department of Insurance (CDI) was created in 1868 as part of a national system of state-based insurance regulation. California is the largest insurance market in the United States and the sixth largest insurance market in the world. More than 1,300 dedicated employees work at CDI to oversee more than 1,300 insurance companies and license more than 390,000 agents, brokers, adjusters, and business entities. CDI annually receives more than 170,000 consumer assistance calls, investigates more than 35,000 consumer complaints and, as a result, recovers more than $63 million a year for consumers. All of CDI's functions, including overseeing insurer solvency, licensing agents and brokers, conducting market conduct reviews, resolving consumer complaints, and investigating and prosecuting insurance fraud, are to protect consumers.

### Frequently Asked Questions

What are the eligibility requirements?

To be eligible for the California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance Program, or CLCA, consumers must:

* Have a valid California driver’s license

* Meet income eligibility guidelines
* Be at least 16 years of age

I’m a provider and I’m having a problem with insurers reimbursing, denying or contesting the claim I submitted in a timely manner. Can they do that?

No. Health insurers have a legal obligation to promptly pay claims. Insurance Code §§ 10123.13 and 10123.147 require insurers to pay claims as soon as possible but no later than 30 working days after receipt of a complete claim, unless the insurer notifies the provider in writing that the claim has been denied or is being contested. Insurers must pay interest on a completed claim if the claim has not been reimbursed, contested or denied within the 30 working-day deadline.11 Failure to comply with the claims handling deadlines in state law may also be considered an unfair claims settlement practice under Insurance Code § 790.03(h). Providers should contact the Department’s Provider Complaint Center if a health insurer is not paying claims in compliance with these deadlines.
