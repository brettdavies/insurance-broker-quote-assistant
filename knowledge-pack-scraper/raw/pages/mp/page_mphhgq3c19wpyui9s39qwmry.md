I’m a provider and I’m having a problem with insurers reimbursing, denying or contesting the claim I submitted in a timely manner. Can they do that?
No. Health insurers have a legal obligation to promptly pay claims. Insurance Code §§ 10123.13 and 10123.147 require insurers to pay claims as soon as possible but no later than 30 working days after receipt of a complete claim, unless the insurer notifies the provider in writing that the claim has been denied or is being contested. Insurers must pay interest on a completed claim if the claim has not been reimbursed, contested or denied within the 30 working-day deadline.11 Failure to comply with the claims handling deadlines in state law may also be considered an unfair claims settlement practice under Insurance Code § 790.03(h). Providers should contact the Department’s Provider Complaint Center if a health insurer is not paying claims in compliance with these deadlines.
