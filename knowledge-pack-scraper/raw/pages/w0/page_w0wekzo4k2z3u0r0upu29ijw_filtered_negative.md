# What Is A Hurricane Deductible And When Does It Apply?
1. a) The policyholder personally writes and provides to the insurance company the following statement in their handwriting, signs their name, and is signed by all other named policyholders on the policy and dated: “I do not want the insurance on my home to pay for the first (specify dollar value) of damage from hurricanes. I will pay for those costs. My insurance will not.” (Per Section 627.712(2)(a)1, Florida Statutes)
2. b) If the insured structure has a mortgage or lien, the policyholder must provide the insurance company with a written statement indicating the mortgagee approves the policyholder electing to have the specified deductible.
Hurricane Deductible applies to personal lines residential property policies. The provision states that after the first Hurricane Deductible has been used, the deductible for the second hurricane (during the same year) will be ** _the greater of_** the amount leftover from the first Hurricane Deductible if the deductible had not been met or the “all peril” deductible.
If the hurricane deductible was met in full for the first hurricane claim, the “all peril” deductible would apply to other Florida hurricane claims that occurred the same year.
Commercial, residential policies (for example), and condo association policies must provide either a hurricane deductible or one with a separate Hurricane Deductible for each hurricane.
The interpretation of your insurance policy can substantially impact the amount you can recover after a storm loss. It would be best if you always had a property insurance attorney or another insurance claim professional to review your policy and the facts of your claim to ensure you are fully compensated after your loss.
