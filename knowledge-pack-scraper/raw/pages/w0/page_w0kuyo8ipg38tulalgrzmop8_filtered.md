The main State Farm NAIC number is 25178. State Farm’s NAIC number is the five-digit code given by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which assigns numbers to authorized insurance providers in order to track customer complaints and ethics violations across state lines.

With State Farm’s NAIC insurance code, consumers can learn how many, and what kind, of complaints have been filed by State Farm customers, as well as examine any enforcement actions taken against the company. Consumers can also see certain financial data, report fraud, or file their own complaint about State Farm. In addition, drivers may need the State Farm insurance code to file an insurance claim or a report with the department of motor vehicles.

Although the main State Farm NAIC code is 25178, State Farm’s various businesses have been assigned different numbers by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, given the company’s position among the largest insurance providers in the country. There is an insurance code for each State Farm affiliate company.

These numbers are codes issued by a state’s insurance commissioner to companies that are authorized to sell policies in that state. They aren’t standardized nationwide like NAIC codes.
