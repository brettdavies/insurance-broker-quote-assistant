Is it better to bundle home and auto insurance?     

One of the most common tips for saving on home and auto insurance is to consider bundling policies with the same insurer. But it may not always be the best deal; sometimes you will pay less overall when you buy your insurance policies separately.

Bundling is one of the biggest [home insurance discounts](/homeowners-insurance-discounts.html); it’s also a big discount for the bundled auto insurance policy. The overall average savings with an auto and home bundle is 15%, based on our data.

But bundling is not always the best way to save. It’s important to do your homework and shop around.

J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study found that home and auto insurance bundling is declining. Only 21% of those surveyed said they would definitely switch their auto insurance if they switched home insurance companies. That means the vast majority are open to unbundling.

When we compared the [best home and auto bundles](/auto-insurance/home-and-auto-insurance-bundle.html), the data showed that a customer with Travelers could bundle home and auto insurance for an average annual cost of $4,706, a savings of 11%. However, if that same customer bought auto insurance from Travelers and home insurance from Amica, the total cost would be $3,587, a savings of $1,119 a year over bundling with Travelers. Sometimes, you'll pay less when your home and auto insurance policies are with two different companies.

## Pros and cons of bundling insurance

There are both benefits and disadvantages to bundling home and auto insurance.

**Pros:**

* Home and auto insurance discounts apply to both policies
* You will have a single insurance bill and single company to deal with
* Some insurance companies offer a single deductible when your bundled car and home are damaged in the same event.

**Cons:**

* You may be paying more for one or both insurance policies
* The discount is not the same on both insurance policies

## How does bundling home and car insurance work?

It's pretty simple: you buy more than one type of insurance from the same company, and they give you a discount in return.

Bundling discounts vary by company and may not be available in all states. No matter where you live, bundling your homeowner’s policy with your car insurance will get you larger savings than bundling it with a condo, renter’s insurance or life policy.

The way your discount is applied to your insurance policy varies. You typically receive discounts on auto and home insurance when you bundle coverage. The discount isn’t the same for each coverage type. Each carrierAn insurance carrier is the company that provides your car insurance policy and pays claims. has its own formulas, and companies may offer a larger discount on one than the other.

The best way to determine overall bundle savings is by considering the premiumThe payment required for an insurance policy to remain in force. Auto insurance premiums are quoted for either 6-month or annual policy periods. of both your home and auto insurance and the discounts given for each. That provides the total dollar amount you’re paying for both coverages and the total amount saved. Then, you can calculate the percentage of your overall bundling savings.

## Does bundling always save money?

If you prefer to stick with a specific insurer for your home and auto insurance, you can almost always count on getting a discount for bundling the policies.

On average, insurers offer a 15% discount for bundling, but some can be substantially higher. Indiana Farm bureau, for example, offers a discount of 28%, the highest of all companies in a 2022 Insurance.com analysis. State Farm was found to offer the biggest discount (25%) among national companies.

Although that sounds like a great deal, it’s not always the best way to save. Here are several hypothetical situations where the bundle isn’t the best deal.

**Example A: Mason**

Mason has his home and auto insurance bundled with COUNTRY Financial. His current average bundled rate is $4,386. That's a bundling discount of 18%.

If Mason were to keep his auto insurance with COUNTRY but change his home insurance coverage to Allstate, his car and home insurance costs would break down to:

* Auto insurance with COUNTRY: $1,680
* Home insurance with Allstate: $2,098
* Total cost: $3,778, a savings of $608 a year

**Example B: Salvatore**

Salvatore bundles his home and auto insurance with Progressive. The total cost of his home and auto insurance with the bundling discount is **$4,568**.

If Salvatore were to switch his home insurance coverage to Mercury, his total cost for car and home insurance would look like this:

* Auto insurance with Progressive: $1,998
* Home insurance with Mercury: $1,388
* Total cost: $3,386, a savings of $1,182

In both examples, it can be seen that while a big discount was offered by the insurer for bundling home with auto, the buyer could save even more if they purchased the policies separately.

Of course, these are average rates, and it’s important to compare rates for your specific needs to determine whether a bundle is a better deal for you.

## When is bundling home and auto worth it?

While it’s not always the cheapest route, bundling your home and auto insurance is generally a good way to save.

“It’s still one of the best strategies to save,” Humphreys, who’s been an insurance broker for about 20 years, says. “People with higher-end coverage in particular, who aren’t as price sensitive, prefer to go with one carrier for the convenience.”

In addition, bundling insurance has other benefits besides cheaper rates:

* You deal with only one insurance company.
* You may be able to manage your policies online at the same place or through the same agent.
* It’s easier to identify coverage gaps.
* Depending on the company, you may be able to align the renewal periods and effective dates of both policies or combine your billing statements.

There may be other perks as well when you bundle auto and home insurance, depending on the company and state you live in. For example, Safeco offers customers who bundle a single-loss deductibleThe deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket for a covered loss when you file a claim.. That means if your car is damaged in the same event that damages your home, such as a fire, your car insurance deductible is waived after your homeowners deductible has been paid.

## Why do insurance companies offer discounts for bundles?

For insurers, it makes simple business sense to offer you a discount. For starters, they not only want to win your business, but they also want to keep it.

If you have more than one policy with an insurer, you are more likely to stay with that company rather than go shopping around. It can be considered a loyalty factor, but it’s also a matter of the work required to shop for multiple policies.

Insurers also know that acquiring a customer costs time and money, and once you have that customer on board, the administrative costs are minimal.

Homeowners also have a record of being less likely to file a claimAn insurance claim is a request you make to your insurance company for coverage after your car is damaged or you have an accident. You can file a claim online, by phone, or in writing. on their auto policies, and insurers much prefer customers with a lower risk profile.

## What’s causing people to break up insurance bundles?

J.D. Power's [report](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-home-insurance-study?srsltid=AfmBOooXg7Oiw-eMnmLTWG4_kZ7XolnU-I0mCeWyxQxCdsdLJn8d9BTX) suggests more and more consumers are realizing they may be better off shopping around rather than sticking with one insurer.

As premiums rise, people are shopping around more often and switching insurance companies when they find substantial enough savings, even if it’s cheaper for only one of their policies. That means breaking up the bundle.

“Without a doubt it’s price driven,” says Randy Humphreys, an insurance broker with Reliable Risk Management, a full-service agency in Phoenix “With what’s going on with the economy, with what’s going on with interest rates, people are more price sensitive and more likely to shop around.

“I saw the same thing happen in 2008/2009 when the market crashed," he says.

Once a consumer does decide to leave a particular insurance company for one type of coverage, they are more likely to consider taking more of their business elsewhere.

## Should you bundle your insurance? The bottom line

Generally, bundling is a great strategy for saving on your car and home insurance and could be the way to get the best deal on both policies.

Just be aware that it’s not always the cheapest route. You may get a better deal by shopping for the policies separately. While it takes a little longer, checking the rates for both bundled and separate policies could save you a lot of money.

## Methodology

Insurance.com commissioned home and auto insurance rates in 2023 from Quadrant Data Services, as well as the average amount of the auto and home bundling discount for each company. Rates are based on a home insurance policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage and liability and a $1,000 deductible and a full coverage auto insurance policy with 100/300/100 in liability limits and $500 deductibles. Auto rates were fielded for a 40-year-old male driver with a clean record driving a 2023 Honda Accord LX.
