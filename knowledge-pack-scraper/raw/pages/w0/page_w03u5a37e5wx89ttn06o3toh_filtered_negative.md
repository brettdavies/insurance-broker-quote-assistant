* ###  What is the best car insurance company in Texas?
* ###  What is the average cost of minimum coverage in Texas?
The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) in Texas is $786 per year for minimum coverage. However, your cost could be higher or lower depending on your personal driving profile. Driving record, annual mileage, location and other factors impact your insurance rates.
* ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in Texas?
The [cheapest car insurance company in Texas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-texas/) will be different for everyone, depending on driving history and profile. Bankrate's analysis shows that Geico comes in with some of the cheapest average rates for drivers with minimal coverage, while State Farm is usually cheaper for teen drivers. However, getting personalized quotes from several carriers is the best way to find the most accurate and affordable rates.
* ###  How much insurance is required in Texas?
[Texas car insurance laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/texas-car-insurance-laws/) state that drivers must carry at least $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident in bodily injury liability and $25,000 per accident for property damage liability coverage. While most insurance experts advise drivers to carry higher limits for more financial protection, that option may not be available to drivers struggling to keep up with the rapid premium increase occurring in auto insurance over the past few years. Carrying state-required minimum limits is a better option than [driving uninsured in Texas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/).
