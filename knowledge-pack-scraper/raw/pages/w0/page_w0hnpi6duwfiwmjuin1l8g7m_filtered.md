# What are the different types of insurance?

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

You've probably heard of car insurance, homeowners insurance and life insurance. Learn about coverage options for these and other types of policies.

Insurance provides valuable protection for you and your family. Choosing the right type and amount of insurance depends on your needs. Here you’ll find some of the more common types of insurance along with a short description of each, a few examples of available coverages, and resources where you can find more detailed information on each.

## Property insurance

### Homeowners insurance

[Homeowners insurance](/insurance/homeowners) provides coverage for your home and other personal property in the case of a covered loss, such as a fire. Knowing about homeowners insurance and [what it covers](/simple-insights/residence/what-is-homeowners-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) is important. It can also provide liability coverage in case you accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property or if someone gets injured at your home.

### Renters insurance

[Renters insurance](/insurance/renters/coverage-options) provides coverage for your stuff such as computers, TVs, electronics, bicycles, furniture and clothing in the case of a covered loss, such as a fire, theft or vandalism. It can also provide liability coverage in case you accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property or if someone gets injured at your apartment. [How much renters insurance to buy](/simple-insights/residence/how-much-renters-insurance-do-i-need) depends on the value of your assets and what you need covered.

### Condo insurance

[Condo insurance](/insurance/condo-unit-owners) provides coverage for your condo and personal property in the case of a loss, such as a fire, theft or [other covered losses](/simple-insights/residence/your-condo-unitowners-insurance-do-you-know-whats-really-covered). It can also provide liability coverage in case you accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property or if someone gets injured at your condo. Generally, condo associations only insure the building and common areas, leaving you responsible for your property.

### Manufactured home insurance

[Manufactured home insurance](/insurance/manufactured-homes) provides coverage for your home and other personal property in the case of a covered loss. Your policy may vary depending on if you have a [manufactured or modular home](/simple-insights/residence/beyond-trailers-buying-modern-manufactured-homes) so it’s important to verify your coverage suits your needs.

### Farm and ranch insurance

[Farm and ranch insurance](/insurance/small-business/farm-and-ranch) provides coverage your dwelling and your household personal property like clothes, furniture, and appliances in your home. Your insurance can also cover farm buildings and farm personal property (such as farm machinery, grain, livestock and farm tools) that you use in your farming operations. You may want to explore the options of [scheduled or blanket coverage](/simple-insights/small-business/farm-scheduling-blanketing) for your farm personal property.

### Flood insurance

[Flood insurance](/simple-insights/residence/do-i-need-flood-insurance) provides coverage for your home and other personal property in the event it gets damaged due to a flood. If you’re a homeowner, you may want to [prepare for a flood](/simple-insights/safety/flood) and consider getting flood insurance since many homeowners insurance policies don’t cover damages caused by flooding. Even if you live in a moderate-to-low risk area, it can still be beneficial as those areas account for [about 40% of all flood claims](https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-zones-and-maps/what-is-my-flood-risk).

### Earthquake insurance

[Earthquake insurance](/simple-insights/residence/do-you-need-earthquake-insurance) provides coverage for your home and personal property in the case of an earthquake. This type of coverage is usually excluded in a homeowners or renters policy but can be added through the purchase of an earthquake endorsement or a separate earthquake policy.

## Vehicle insurance

### Car insurance

[Car insurance](/insurance/auto/coverage-options) provides coverage for your car if it gets damaged due to an event covered by your policy. It may cover things like an accident that involves another car, person, or even a thing. Car insurance can help protect you if you cause an accident. It may also help cover medical bills for you and your passengers if injured in an accident or if you’re hit by another driver who is either uninsured or underinsured. Car insurance may also provide you coverage for damage to property, theft, fire, vandalism and more so it’s important to [choose your coverages well](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) and review what your specific [state](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/minimum-car-insurance-requirements?msockid=0596a484ee8d6fef0e6ab114ef6e6ec2) requires.

There are a [few things to know](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-before-buying-an-rv) when purchasing an RV.

### Off-road vehicle insurance

[Off-road vehicle insurance](/insurance/off-road-vehicles-insurance) provides coverage for off-road vehicles (including [snowmobiles](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/snowmobile-tips-for-beginners), [golf carts](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/golf-cart-safety-tips) and trail bikes, etc.), damage to property, injuries, theft, fire, vandalism and more. Along with proper coverage for your all-terrain vehicle (ATV), UTV or Side-by-Side, it’s important to follow [ATV safety tips](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/atv-safety) for a more safe and smooth ride.

## Personal insurance

### Life insurance

[Life insurance](/insurance/life) provides financial protection for your [beneficiaries](/simple-insights/life-insurance/what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-beneficiary) in the unfortunate event you pass. There are [many options to choose from](/simple-insights/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance) such as time frames (ranging from 10 years to end of life) and coverage amounts, just to name a few.

### Health insurance

[Health insurance](/insurance/health) provides financial protection to help pay for costs associated with medical expenses. Health insurance can be complex, so it’s important to know [what it means](/simple-insights/financial/health-insurance-terms) and the coverage you have. With the rising costs of health care and prescriptions, health insurance can help protect you from incurring debilitating bills as a result of a serious accident or illness.

### Disability insurance

[Disability insurance](/insurance/disability) helps provide many types of financial protection from an unexpected loss of income. The [many benefits](/simple-insights/health-insurance/what-you-need-to-know-about-disability-insurance) of disability insurance help you pay for things such as a mortgage, rent, a car loan and other regular living expense in case you become disabled and are unable to work.

### Pet insurance

[Trupanion® pet insurance](/insurance/pet) provides coverage that can help lessen the financial burden when it comes to medical care for your pet. Pet insurance can [cover your pet](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/why-you-should-purchase-pet-insurance) for the long-term, as it often includes tests, surgeries and the treatment of breed-specific conditions.

### Identity restoration insurance

[Identity restoration insurance](/insurance/identity-restoration) provides coverage for things such as identity theft, computer attacks, cyber extortion and fraud, to name a few. Check out some tips on how to [help prevent identity theft](/simple-insights/family/prevent-identity-theft).

### Personal liability umbrella insurance

[Personal liability umbrella insurance](/insurance/liability/personal-umbrella-policy) provides coverage for situations that exceed the limits of liability covered by an underlying policy such as car insurance, homeowners insurance or boat insurance. [Legal liability](/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) can be the largest financial burden most individuals have. Umbrella insurance is meant to provide larger amounts of coverage for things included in the underlying policies and broader ranges of coverage for things not included in the underlying policies such as defamation of character, libel and slander.

### Personal articles insurance

[Personal articles insurance](/insurance/personal-articles-policy) provides coverage to repair or replace valuable items like a baseball card collection, camera equipment, fine art and jewelry, to name a few. Protection is usually broader than homeowners or renters insurance since those policies may have special dollar limits or only provide coverage for certain causes of loss.

### Business insurance

Business insurance policies provide property and liability coverage for business owners. Different policies include [Business Owners Policies](/insurance/small-business/business-owners-policy) (BOP), [workers’ compensation](/insurance/small-business/workers-compensation), [commercial auto insurance](/insurance/small-business/commercial-auto), [inland marine insurance](/small-business-solutions/insurance/inland-marine-mobile-property) and [commercial liability umbrella policies](/small-business-solutions/insurance/umbrella-policy).
