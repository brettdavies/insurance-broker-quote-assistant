We found a very small difference across genders in the price of motorcycle insurance for 20-year-olds. Many companies quote the same rates regardless of gender, but that’s not always the case.

Young women sometimes pay slightly more than young men for motorcycle insurance. This might come as a surprise, since women often pay less for car insurance than men.

For example, Dairyland charges female riders in New York $20 per year more for coverage than men. Allstate also charges its female applicants more.

|  | Men | Women |
| --- | --- | --- |
| California | $805 | $805 |
| Georgia | $830 | $829 |
| New York | $699 | $700 |
| Pennsylvania | $588 | $588 |
| Texas | $788 | $793 |

In the locations surveyed for this article, the gender of the applicant only accounted for a difference of $1 per month. While this data indicates that gender matters less to motorcycle insurers than it does to [car insurance providers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/20-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance Costs for 20-Year-Old Males and Females"), it's a good idea to compare the price you're quoted with a few different providers' rates.

As you age, your motorcycle insurance rates decrease.

## Is motorcycle insurance cheaper than car insurance?

Motorcycle insurance is much cheaper than car insurance. The average cost of car insurance for a 20-year-old is $5,517 per year, more than seven times the average cost of coverage for motorcyclists of the same age.

The cost difference between the two forms of insurance is due to vehicle size: In most cases, cars inflict far more damage or injury than motorcycles. Motorcycles are also worth much less than cars, meaning there are fewer expenses for your insurer if your bike is damaged and needs repair.

## Methodology

To find the cheapest motorcycle insurance for 20-year-old riders, we collected quotes from four top motorcycle insurers: Progressive, Geico, Allstate and Dairyland.

The quotes were all for full coverage and were gathered across five locations: San Jose, California; Augusta, Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Austin, Texas. The sample customer has been licensed to use a car and a motorcycle since they were 16, and they ride a 2020 Harley-Davidson Street 500.
