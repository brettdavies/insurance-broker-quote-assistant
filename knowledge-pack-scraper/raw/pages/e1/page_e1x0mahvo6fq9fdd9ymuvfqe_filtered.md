# Roof Replacement Rules and Insurance Coverage: What Florida Homeowners Need to Know

October 29, 2025

Your roof is your home’s first line of defense against Florida’s harsh weather — and also one of the biggest factors affecting your insurance policy. In recent years, roof age and condition have become major flashpoints between homeowners, insurers, and state regulators.

Here’s what every Florida homeowner needs to know about roof replacement, coverage, and the new rules that might affect your premiums.

### Why Roofs Are a Big Deal for Insurers

Florida’s hurricanes and severe storms lead to billions in roof-damage claims each year. For example, recent data shows that just two storms produced insured losses in Florida of over **$4 billion**.

Unfortunately, many of these claims are tied to fraudulent or exaggerated roof-replacement schemes, which have driven up costs across the board.

As a result, insurers have tightened their underwriting rules, refusing to cover homes with older roofs — sometimes regardless of condition.

### New Roof Age Rules in Florida

To combat widespread policy cancellations, the Florida Legislature passed laws (via Senate Bill 2‑D) starting July 1, 2022, that restrict insurers from denying coverage solely due to roof age.

Key updates include:

* Insurers cannot refuse to insure a roof that is **less than 15 years old** solely because of age. [Chapter 627 Section 7011 – 2023 Florida Statutes – The Florida Senate](https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2023/627.7011?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* If your roof is **15 years or older**, you can request an inspection to prove it has at least **5 years of useful life** remaining.

* Insurers must accept the inspection results in lieu of automatic replacement requirements.

### Actual Cash Value (ACV) vs. Replacement Cost Value (RCV)

When your roof is damaged, the way your insurance pays out depends on your policy type:

* **Replacement Cost Value (RCV)**: Covers the full cost to replace your roof with a new one.
* **Actual Cash Value (ACV)**: Pays only the depreciated value of your roof (i.e., what it’s worth today).

Some insurers in Florida have shifted to ACV-only policies for older roofs, meaning you’ll receive less money unless you have upgraded coverage. (Internal link suggestion: link to your site’s article on “Understanding ACV vs. RCV in homeowners insurance”)

### When Insurance Covers Roof Replacement

Your homeowners’ insurance may cover roof repair or replacement if the damage is caused by a **sudden and accidental event**, such as:

* Windstorm or hurricane damage
* Hail impact
* Fire
* Fallen trees or debris

However, wear and tear, neglect, or age-related deterioration are **not covered**. [Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Roof Replacement?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111815/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-replacement.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Roof Shape and Material Matter

Florida insurers often favor homes with:

* **Hip roofs** (sloped on all sides) — proven to perform better in hurricanes. [The Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model](https://www.icams-portal.gov/meetings/TCORF/ihc18/hamid.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Metal or tile roofs** — more resistant to wind uplift  
  These features may even qualify you for wind-mitigation discounts. (Internal link suggestion: your site’s article on “Wind mitigation credits & how to qualify”)

### Protecting Yourself as a Homeowner

* Get regular roof inspections (every 2–3 years).
* Keep documentation and photos for claims.
* Avoid signing Assignment of Benefits (AOB) contracts with roofers — these have been a source of fraud in Florida. [h0001Dz.APC.PDF](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022D/1D/Analyses/h0001Dz.APC.PDF?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Ask your insurer whether your policy pays ACV or RCV.

### Key Takeaway

Roof age no longer automatically disqualifies you from coverage in Florida—but **proactive maintenance**, proper **documentation**, and understanding your policy are essential to keep your home insurable and your premiums manageable.
