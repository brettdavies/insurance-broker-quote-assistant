## Average homeowners insurance rates by dwelling coverage amount

The amount of

you have plays a big role in how much you pay for home insurance.

## How do companies calculate home insurance rates?

Home insurance companies look at factors such as your home's building materials, where you live and your home's age when calculating your rate. You can control some of these factors, like how much coverage you get. But you can’t control others, like the age of your home.

### Factors you can control that affect your home insurance estimate

Coverage limits

The amount of coverage you want plays a major role in what you pay for home insurance. Typically, the more coverage you want, the more you'll pay.

![house icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70//icons/home-basic)

Insurance companies try to set your dwelling coverage limit as the cost of rebuilding your home, so you don't have much control over your coverage limit.

But, there are two different levels of dwelling coverage to choose from: [actual cash value and replacement cost](/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance").

* **Actual cash value coverage** pays for repairs based on the current condition of your home. So you may not get enough money to fully fix or rebuild your home after a disaster. Many insurance companies offer this coverage at a lower rate.
* **Replacement cost coverage** pays for the full cost to replace or rebuild your home, even as your home ages and needs more upkeep. For that reason, replacement cost is generally a better choice. However, it's typically much more expensive than actual cash value coverage.

![sofa icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70//icons/sofa)

**Your personal property and liability coverage also affect your home insurance rates.**

* Standard [liability coverage](/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?") generally starts at $100,000.
* Your [personal property coverage](/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?") limit is usually 20% to 50% of your dwelling coverage limit.

Raising either of these coverages will cost you more.

Deductible

Your deductible is the amount you must pay toward fixing or rebuilding your home when you use your insurance. [Choosing a higher deductible](/homeowners-insurance-deductibles#how-does "How your homeowners insurance deductible affects your rate") means lowering your potential payout, which makes your rates cheaper.

Renovations

**[Renovations that make your home safer or more resistant to damage](/consumers-save-on-home-insurance-after-renovations "Home Reno Could Save You $114 a Year on Home Insurance") could lower your rates.** This can include replacing an old roof or installing a security system.

On the other hand, increasing the square footage of your home could make your rates go up.

Credit score

**Many insurance companies view a good [credit score](/how-credit-scores-affect-homeowners-insurance-rates "How Credit Scores Can Affect Home Insurance Premiums") as a sign of financial stability.** In some states, companies may reward a good credit score with lower rates. In others, they may not be allowed to use credit scores to determine rates, but good credit scores can benefit you in other ways.

While [improving your credit score](/whats-a-good-credit-score#how-to-improve-credit-score "How to Get a Good Credit Score") takes time, it might help you get more affordable rates.

### Other factors that affect home insurance rates

Your home's age

Older homes are more likely to have wear and tear that increases both your risk and rates. Some homes may also not be built up to current standards, raising the risk of injuries and home insurance claims.

Building materials

Certain materials are more vulnerable to fire, rotting and other dangers. For instance, homes with metal or tile roofs will likely have lower insurance rates than homes with asphalt roofs.

Also, some materials cost more to replace than others, such as a marble countertop compared to a laminate countertop.

Location

If you live in an area with high crime rates or stormy weather, or you’re far from a fire department, you may pay more for home insurance. That's because your home and belongings are more likely to be damaged, which makes you more expensive to insure.

Pets

Liability insurance covers any injuries your pets may cause. If you have a particularly ["aggressive" breed as a pet](/homeowners-insurance-restricted-dog-breeds "Restricted Dog Breeds for Home Insurance"), your insurance company may increase your rates.

Claims history

Your [claims history](/will-home-insurance-go-up-after-claim "Does Homeowners Insurance Go Up After a Claim?") often shows how likely you are to file a claim in the future. The more claims you make, the higher your rates. Reducing the number of claims you file by only filing for expensive repairs could help you keep your rates lower.

Swimming pool or trampoline

[Swimming pools](/how-pool-affects-your-homeowners-insurance "How a Pool Affects Your Homeowners Insurance") and trampolines can make your home insurance rates go up. That's because guests visiting your home are more likely to hurt themselves by slipping on a wet pool deck or falling off a trampoline.

These injuries could result in lawsuits, so insurance companies tend to charge more to protect themselves against the added risk.

## How can you lower the cost of your homeowners insurance?

There are four main ways to lower your insurance costs: shop around for quotes, qualify for discounts, raise your deductible and update your home.

* **Shop around for coverage:** [Get quotes from multiple insurance companies](/homeowners-insurance "Compare Homeowners Insurance Quotes") and compare them side by side. This makes it easy to see which company offers the cheapest rate.
* **Get discounts:** Start by asking about the [homeowners insurance discounts](/homeowners-insurance-discounts-and-savings "Homeowners Insurance Discounts and Savings") your current insurer offers. But see which ones other companies offer, too. You may be able to get 
  multipolicy discounts,

  loyalty discounts
  or 
  home safety discounts,
  depending on your insurer.
* **Raise your deductible:** You'll pay more when you file a claim if you do this, but it also may lower your rates. **However, only raise your deductible to an amount you can pay after an emergency.**

---

**You should only raise your deductible to an amount you can easily afford to pay after an emergency.** If you can't afford an unexpected $5,000 expense, you should keep your deductible below that amount.

---

### Home renovations could save you more

**Certain [home renovations](/home-renovation-insurance-savings "Can Renovating Your House Lower Your Insurance Costs?") can lower your insurance rates or get you a discount.**

For example, replacing an old roof or outdated electrical system can help make your home safer and make it less likely that you'll file a claim for a leak or electrical fire in the future.

However, not all renovations result in a lower home insurance rate.

If you remodel your kitchen with marble countertops and high-end cabinetry, your home insurance rates will probably go up. That's because these materials cost more to replace than more basic versions.
