The amount of  dwelling coverage you have plays a big role in how much you pay for home insurance.
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?") | Annual rate
---|---
But, there are two different levels of dwelling coverage to choose from: [actual cash value and replacement cost](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance").
* Standard [liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?") generally starts at $100,000.
* Your [personal property coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?") limit is usually 20% to 50% of your dwelling coverage limit.
Your deductible is the amount you must pay toward fixing or rebuilding your home when you use your insurance. [Choosing a higher deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles#how-does "How your homeowners insurance deductible affects your rate") means lowering your potential payout, which makes your rates cheaper.
**[Renovations that make your home safer or more resistant to damage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/consumers-save-on-home-insurance-after-renovations "Home Reno Could Save You $114 a Year on Home Insurance") could lower your rates.** This can include replacing an old roof or installing a security system.
**Many insurance companies view a good[credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-credit-scores-affect-homeowners-insurance-rates "How Credit Scores Can Affect Home Insurance Premiums") as a sign of financial stability.** In some states, companies may reward a good credit score with lower rates. In others, they may not be allowed to use credit scores to determine rates, but good credit scores can benefit you in other ways.
While [improving your credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/whats-a-good-credit-score#how-to-improve-credit-score "How to Get a Good Credit Score") takes time, it might help you get more affordable rates.
Liability insurance covers any injuries your pets may cause. If you have a particularly ["aggressive" breed as a pet](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-restricted-dog-breeds "Restricted Dog Breeds for Home Insurance"), your insurance company may increase your rates.
Your [claims history](https://www.valuepenguin.com/will-home-insurance-go-up-after-claim "Does Homeowners Insurance Go Up After a Claim?") often shows how likely you are to file a claim in the future. The more claims you make, the higher your rates. Reducing the number of claims you file by only filing for expensive repairs could help you keep your rates lower.
[Swimming pools](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-pool-affects-your-homeowners-insurance "How a Pool Affects Your Homeowners Insurance") and trampolines can make your home insurance rates go up. That's because guests visiting your home are more likely to hurt themselves by slipping on a wet pool deck or falling off a trampoline.
* **Shop around for coverage:** [Get quotes from multiple insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance "Compare Homeowners Insurance Quotes") and compare them side by side. This makes it easy to see which company offers the cheapest rate.
* **Get discounts:** Start by asking about the [homeowners insurance discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-discounts-and-savings "Homeowners Insurance Discounts and Savings") your current insurer offers. But see which ones other companies offer, too. You may be able to get  multipolicy discounts, loyalty discounts or  home safety discounts, depending on your insurer.

**Certain[home renovations](https://www.valuepenguin.com/home-renovation-insurance-savings "Can Renovating Your House Lower Your Insurance Costs?") can lower your insurance rates or get you a discount.**

[Dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance?") pays to fix or rebuild your home if it's damaged by a covered event, like a fire. This usually includes your:
[Personal property coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?") protects your belongings from any damage caused by a covered event. A standard policy covers your:
[Liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: What Is It and How Much Does It Cost?") pays for property damage or injury to others that you accidentally cause. This can include:

The average price people pay for home insurance in the United States is $2,151 per year, or $179 per month. Rates can vary by $350 per month, [depending on which state you live in](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance#state "#state").
Homeowners insurance companies calculate rates using a number of [different factors](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance#factors "#factors"). Some of the most important are your home's location and building materials, your claims history and the amount of coverage you buy.
A $500,000 home costs an average of $2,891 per year to insure. [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") has the cheapest rates for $500,000 homes, at around $1,976 per year.
