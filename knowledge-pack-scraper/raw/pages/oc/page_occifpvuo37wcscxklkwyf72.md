#  State Farm denied my renters policy 4 weeks after I paid in full because of past homeowners insurance claims. 
[ Home Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)
My husband and I are in the process of moving across the country for work. We sold our house for a really good job opportunity and are renting temporarily until we get settled and our house closes before we begin looking for a new house to buy. I purchased a $300,000 renters insurance policy from a local State Farm branch in the area and I paid for the 12 months in full. About 4 weeks later, the agent I was working with called me to inform me that because we made claims on our homeowners policy (not State Farm), they were going to be rescinding my policy and I had until April 24th until my coverage lapses. 
Now I thought surely this must be a mistake. I disclosed that we made a claim on our roof (storm damage and recalled roof shingles) in 2023 before I purchased the policy. The agent said that there were multiple claims that I did not disclose, so I asked if she could share what those claims were. I forgot that we had a tree removed later in 2023 (storm damage, different storm) and forgot that my husband claimed this damage as well. So I asked the agent if this policy being denied was because I was (unintentionally) didn’t share 1 other claim, and she stated that my failure to disclose the 2nd claim was NOT the reason I was being denied coverage, but that it was simply just because State Farm felt that we had made an excessive number of claims on our homeowners policy. My husband and I have had 4 or 5 past renters policies before we purchased our home, we have NEVER made a claim on a renters policy. 
I’m not going to ask is State Farm allowed to do this. Clearly they are. But when I spoke with my family about this, they were bewildered. Did I do something wrong here? Is this common? I quick google search did not give me any luck. I have to find a new renters policy now, is it going to be a hassle to find coverage because of my 2 past homeowners claims? Is there something I need to say or disclose in the future? I’m at a total loss here. I am willing to take accountability if I am in the wrong here for forgetting about the 2nd claim I didn’t disclose, I would just like to know what I can do to avoid this problem moving forward. 
TLDR; renters policy denied because of homeowners claims with a different insurance company

Yes it's going to be difficult to find coverage due to multiple claims within in the past couple of years. Call an independent broker and let them know up front about all claims you've filed in the past 5 years so they know which companies to shop and not bother with the ones with tighter underwriting guidelines so you're not in this predicament again.

You will also have to disclose the cancellation from State Farm which is going to make things more difficult as well.

I’m just a layman. But I think long and hard about filing a claim these days. I’d rather pay a couple grand to remove a downed tree than a 1k deductible and raise my rates and potential insurability in perpetuity

This is what people don’t understand about insurance it’s meant for catastrophic losses, but it’s become so engrained to “claim” you really shouldn’t be making a claim unless it’s financially ruining. Auto 1-5,000$ should be repaired by you, or a claim against someone else’s insurance. Home 1-10,000$ should be paid by you, anything more make a claim. Most people are over strung on their homes, they buy the cap of the budget failing to have money for roof replacements, water or plumbing repairs. Financial literacy needs to be weaved into education in high school.

"become so engrained" as though state farm hasn't released dozens of commercials demonstrating that they cover non-catastrophic claims, and suggesting that they are a good neighbor. 
The insurance industry is in a very precarious state right now.

The thing is its SO EASY to blow thru those numbers. 
Septic ejector pump died, no flooding just having a plumber replace the pump...$4,000. 
Pipe along exterior wall froze and cracked, caught before it flooded more than a few inches into the carpet...$15,000-20,000 in repairs to find/fix the pipe, remove all the saturated insulation, dry out the building materials, repair the structure, re-insulate, repair the drywall, and that's with some stuff like buying the actual insulation and doing the painting myself! 
We paid the plumbing maintenance out of pocket but it was REALLY hard because that was like nearly a month of combined income. 
The "someone was dumb building this house and now a pipe froze" was not something we could...that's like new car territory levels of money. 
But yeah also there's a lot of stuff nobody ever teaches that is essential life information.

This. 
I just had the windshield replaced on my vehicle due to a crack down the entire length. Was chatting to my dad about it while I was waiting for the call that it was done. He was aghast that I paid for that out of pocket. 
"Insurance should cover that you know!" - yes, I've been in the industry a decade, I know my policy would cover the windshield. But I also know that's not what insurance is for.

Yeah I get that, I just didn’t really think that losses on a homeowners policy would really apply on a renters, especially since I have no losses on my prior renters policies. I just can’t believe they let me pay in full and waited 4 weeks to tell me.

You didn’t tell them about a claim you had made. They had no choice but to make a correction. They could have cancelled the policy for material misrepresentation rather than loss history. It’s fortunate they didn’t.

You have filed three claims, correct? Your husband filed a claim for the same tree damage as you did (not sure how that works) plus your roof damage. You are likely considered high risk due to excessive claims. You'll find a policy out there, you'll just be paying a lot.

You seem to be especially annoyed that “you paid in full” in multiple comments — they will have to refund you for the time that they didn’t insure you (so you’re covered through April 24 but the rest of the year you will get a refund check)

Your only option is to find another company with more liberal standards. Don't take it personally; you had 2 previous claims, and State Farms doesn't want your business. It's not arbitrary; that is their standard, and there isn't anything you can do about it other than move on.

Don't take it personally. They're not saying you did something wrong. They're telling you that their data shows that someone who makes two HO claims in the time period you did is far more likely to have a claim under their renters policy than someone who did not make two HO claims in that time period. All else being equal, one of the strongest indicators of future claim activity is recent past claim activity. State Farm is simply not comfortable with the risk you present based on your recent claims activity. You'll find another carrier that is more comfortable with that risk, although they may charge you more for it or limit its scope. 
Plenty of people have chimed in on this already, but it bears repeating - use HO insurance only when necessary, like when you'll face a significant financial hit if you don't go through insurance. Small stuff is just the cost of home ownership, and it's best to align your policy/deductible/coverages in a way that reflects how you should utilize insurance (e.g., higher deductibles).

You filed claims for a tree? I would suggest you NOT buy a house in the next 10 years or you are going to pay super high homeowner insurance rates. As someone who has been through multiple hurricanes I would never file a claim for the small stuff, like tree removal or roof replacement. Unfortunately you’re going to pay for a long time because of that.

They are allowed to deny you coverage if they decide not to insure you. Because they think you're too much of a risk. You'll have to contact other companies. The prices will probably be high.

Not sure what state you’re in, but carriers have two ways they can look at homeowners claims here in PA. Some companies think the losses follow the person, so no matter what location a claim was filed for, they’ll count it against you. Some companies think losses are location specific and may allow you to “exclude” losses that aren’t specific to your current location. 
Underwriting guidelines are still pretty tight right now. The prior losses and now underwriting cancellation from State Farm will likely make it more difficult to find a new policy. Agree with poster above who suggested calling an independent agent. They will have a better chance of placing coverage for you than a captive, IMO. 
Best of luck to you!

Reading through the comments, OP, it’s important to know that your property claims history follows you from a home to a renters policy and vice versa. It’s unfortunate they didn’t pull your claims history before issuing the policy, so I understand your frustration there

Did you do something wrong, not necessarily. Did the Agent that sold you the policy do something wrong, YES. Any good agent will know their underwriting rules and should have never sold the policy. Im an Allstate agent, so i cant speak 100% on this for SF but our systems pull in all necessary claims info. Im able to see that upfront whether you disclose it or not. Our systems do the underwriting at the agency before we even issue the policy so if something goes against our UW rules it doesnt get issued in the beginning. Doesnt sound like their systems do that so the agent bears more responsibility to understand what is acceptable and what isnt

State Farm was able to write it with just one claim. They didn’t cancel her because she forgot about a claim. But that forgotten claim did bump her up to having an excessive number of claims and caused her to drop. 
I don’t get how it’s the agents fault for her not telling them the info needed to get an accurate quote.

SF is the biggest carrier is the USA. Now assuming the insured hasn't changed their name or something like that claims come into my system from their LIS report. If the SF agent isn't able to view the LIS report that's poor on the carrier. Assuming they can view it the agent should have know about the claim
