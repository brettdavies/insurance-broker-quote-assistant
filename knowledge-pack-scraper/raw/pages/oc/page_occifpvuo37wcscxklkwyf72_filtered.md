# State Farm denied my renters policy 4 weeks after I paid in full because of past homeowners insurance claims.

[Home Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)

My husband and I are in the process of moving across the country for work. We sold our house for a really good job opportunity and are renting temporarily until we get settled and our house closes before we begin looking for a new house to buy. I purchased a $300,000 renters insurance policy from a local State Farm branch in the area and I paid for the 12 months in full. About 4 weeks later, the agent I was working with called me to inform me that because we made claims on our homeowners policy (not State Farm), they were going to be rescinding my policy and I had until April 24th until my coverage lapses.

Now I thought surely this must be a mistake. I disclosed that we made a claim on our roof (storm damage and recalled roof shingles) in 2023 before I purchased the policy. The agent said that there were multiple claims that I did not disclose, so I asked if she could share what those claims were. I forgot that we had a tree removed later in 2023 (storm damage, different storm) and forgot that my husband claimed this damage as well. So I asked the agent if this policy being denied was because I was (unintentionally) didn’t share 1 other claim, and she stated that my failure to disclose the 2nd claim was NOT the reason I was being denied coverage, but that it was simply just because State Farm felt that we had made an excessive number of claims on our homeowners policy. My husband and I have had 4 or 5 past renters policies before we purchased our home, we have NEVER made a claim on a renters policy.

I’m not going to ask is State Farm allowed to do this. Clearly they are. But when I spoke with my family about this, they were bewildered. Did I do something wrong here? Is this common? I quick google search did not give me any luck. I have to find a new renters policy now, is it going to be a hassle to find coverage because of my 2 past homeowners claims? Is there something I need to say or disclose in the future? I’m at a total loss here. I am willing to take accountability if I am in the wrong here for forgetting about the 2nd claim I didn’t disclose, I would just like to know what I can do to avoid this problem moving forward.

TLDR; renters policy denied because of homeowners claims with a different insurance company
