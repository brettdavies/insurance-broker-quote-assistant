## Key takeaways

* Home prices have skyrocketed, creating affordability issues for prospective buyers.
* Upfront expenses associated with buying a home include the down payment, closing costs and moving costs.
* Ongoing expenses of homeownership, beyond the mortgage payment, include property taxes, insurance and maintenance.

For many prospective buyers, today’s high home prices make homeownership feel increasingly elusive. But the costs associated with buying a home go beyond just the price of the house itself. To determine [how much house you can afford,](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/new-house-calculator/) it’s important to factor in all the additional expenses, such as closing costs, insurance, taxes and maintenance, before committing to a purchase. Let’s break down the total cost of buying a home.

## Home prices in the U.S.

The price of the property itself is undoubtedly the biggest and most important cost when you’re [shopping for a home](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-buy-a-house/). While there will be additional costs associated with your purchase, a home’s price — and whether you can afford it — is the first thing to consider.

As of July 2025, the [median existing-home price](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/existing-home-sales/) in the U.S. was $422,400, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. That’s the highest July median NAR has ever recorded, and it represents an amazing 25 straight months of annual price increases.

Given these elevated prices, it’s reasonable to wonder whether you should [buy a home now or wait](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/should-i-buy-a-house-now-or-wait/). Making that decision will depend on your finances, credit and long-term goals — as well as on the prevailing mortgage rates, also currently on the high side, which reduces your purchasing power.

“Home prices are near record levels, and mortgage rates remain near 7 percent. But there’s no guarantee that conditions will be better for buyers in a year or two,” says Bankrate analyst Jeff Ostrowski. “In fact, it’s quite possible that home prices will keep creeping up and that mortgage rates won’t fall considerably. So, if you’re ready to buy a home, my advice is to do it now rather than wait.”

## Costs associated with buying a home

Matt and Ross Hester, father-and-son founders of the Hester Group with Harry Norman Realtors in Atlanta, encourage all their clients to prepare for the funds needed to purchase. “If you do not consider all the costs, your monthly expense budget can be flipped on its head,” Matt Hester says.

Keep in mind that home prices in your area might be much higher — or lower — than national figures, and prices depend heavily on the type of property you’re looking to buy. [Your credit score](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house/) also matters, as a higher score will qualify you for a better mortgage rate. And the size of your down payment plays a large role as well: The more you pay upfront, the less you have to borrow, which means lower monthly payments and less interest.

The costs associated with [leaving renting behind](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-save-for-a-house-while-renting/) and purchasing a home fall into two basic categories:

### Upfront costs

* Down payment
* Closing costs
* Reserves
* Moving

### Ongoing costs

* Mortgage payments
* Property taxes
* HOA fees (if applicable)
* Insurance premiums
* Maintenance and upkeep

## Upfront costs of buying a home

### ​​Down payment

The [down payment](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-down-payment/) is the part of the home’s purchase price you pay upfront, rather than financing it through a mortgage. If you’re buying a $300,000 home, for example, and put down 10 percent, or $30,000, you’d be getting a mortgage for $270,000.

The amount of down payment required will be a percentage of the home’s overall price and depends on what [type of mortgage loan](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/types-of-mortgages/) you get — different loans might require anywhere from 3 to 20 percent down, and if you’re eligible, some require no money down at all.

### Closing costs

Before you get the keys to the property, you’ll need to pay all the associated [closing costs](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/who-pays-closing-costs/). These can vary widely but typically range from 2 percent to 5 percent of the loan principal, and can include:

* **Application and credit fees:** Many lenders charge nominal fees to initiate a loan application and check your credit.
* **Origination and underwriting fees:** Essentially the administrative fees that the lender charges for generating and processing the loan; fees usually start at 0.5 percent of the loan amount.
* **Title fees:** Title insurance protects against ownership problems; fees usually start at 0.5 percent of the loan amount. If the home is not new construction, a title search company will consult property records to verify that there are no encumbrances or liens on the property’s title.
* **Appraisal fee:** Getting the house professionally appraised is critical to verifying its worth — and, if you’re financing your purchase, likely mandatory. Lenders want to ensure that the amount they offer does not exceed the value of the property.
* **Home inspection:** While not required, having a property professionally inspected before a deal goes through is highly recommended. It can uncover minor problems before they become major ones.
* **Transfer tax:** Most states charge a transfer tax, covering the cost to transfer the title from the seller to the buyer. The amount varies by location.

“There are a number of standard closing-table items for which the actual cost will vary,” Ross Hester says. Many lenders offer a [no-closing-cost mortgage](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/no-closing-cost-mortgage-loan/) option, in which the closing costs are added to your loan principal or otherwise paid for in the form of a higher interest rate. Both save you from having to pay upfront but can cost you more in the long run.

### Reserves

To make sure a homebuyer isn’t completely wiping out their savings, lenders may require them to show they’ve got additional cash at their disposal. This acts as a form of guarantee that the borrower will be able to make mortgage payments. Typically a borrower is required to have at least two months’ worth of mortgage payments in reserve. The good news is that assets such as stocks and retirement savings can count toward this amount.

“Lenders want to see a cash cushion — they prefer that you not empty out the bank account to cover the down payment and closing costs and then have no money to replace the water heater or repair the air conditioning,” says Ostrowski.

### Moving

When working through your budget, don’t forget that, whether you do it yourself or hire professionals, you will incur [moving costs](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-much-does-it-cost-to-move/). Hiring a pro to help you [relocate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/relocating-to-afford-a-home/) typically costs between $882 and $2,566, according to HomeAdvisor, and you can expect to pay more for a long-distance move.

## Ongoing costs of buying a home

It’s also important to be prepared for the ongoing expenses you’ll be on the hook for after you become a homeowner. Understanding these costs helps ensure you don’t get in over your head.

“The principal and interest are just part of your new financial responsibility. You’ll also have to pay property taxes, homeowners insurance and possibly mortgage insurance,” says Ostrowski. “But the real surprise comes from all the other expenses — lawn care, pest control, maintenance, repairs.”

![](https://navi.cohesionapps.com/display?write_key=wk_2M3TlVcWbz8i1RTZjLkSmbWfyQC&adId=fb725f8284&req=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Freal-estate%2Fcosts-of-buying-a-home%2F&ref=)

### Mortgage payments

> "The good news is that a fixed-rate mortgage locks in one part of your housing budget."
>
> — Jeff Ostrowski, Principal Writer, Bankrate

Your monthly mortgage payment will almost certainly be your biggest recurring housing expense. Start with this number when you’re budgeting for costs and then build around it. “The good news is that a fixed-rate mortgage locks in one part of your housing budget,” Ostrowski says.

### Property taxes

Typically, [property taxes](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/property-taxes/) are included in your monthly mortgage payment along with the interest and principal. For instance, if you own a home with an assessed value of $100,000, and the tax rate is 2 percent, your annual property tax would be $2,000, paid in $167 increments added to each of your 12 monthly mortgage payments throughout the year.

Keep in mind that your home’s assessed value is not the same as the price you paid for it, or the [price you could sell it for](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/fair-market-value/). If home values go up in your area, your city or county could assess your home at a higher value, meaning you’ll pay more in property taxes.

### Insurance premiums

When buying a home, there are two kinds of insurance to consider.

Most mortgage lenders will require you to take out a [homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/) policy. The cost significantly varies, especially in areas at high risk of floods or severe weather. There are many options, so it’s smart to compare offers to keep the expense as low as possible.

The second type is [private mortgage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi/) (PMI), generally required for conventional loan borrowers who put less than 20 percent down. PMI can considerably increase your mortgage payment, but it isn’t necessarily permanent: As you pay down your mortgage and build equity in your home, it’s possible to [get rid of PMI](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/rising-home-values-helped-lower-my-mortgage-bill/).

### HOA fees

If you’re buying a condo or any home in a community overseen by a [homeowners association](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/hoa-homeowners-association-rules/) (HOA), you’ll likely be required to pay a monthly fee. HOA fees are determined by the association and are highly variable. These funds go toward services provided, which may include security, amenities like a pool or gym, landscaping and maintenance. HOAs might also charge occasional special assessment fees for urgent repairs.

### Maintenance and upkeep

No matter where you live, you’ll need to plan for general home maintenance, upkeep and repairs. Wear-and-tear happens, so it’s important to have extra funds on hand. Many experts recommend budgeting 1 percent of your home’s value for home maintenance each year, as well as maintaining an [emergency fund](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/using-home-equity-to-finance-emergency-repairs/) to address urgent, non-budgeted concerns as they crop up.

Don’t forget that you’ll also need to pay for basic utilities, like water, sewer, gas and electricity. These costs vary according to location, but generally the larger the property, the more utilities will cost.

## Cost breakdown example

Let’s say you’ve purchased a new home for $500,000, and you’ve put down 20 percent, or $100,000, as a down payment. That means you’ll have a loan for the remaining $400,000. Before the deal went through, you had to cover the closing costs. Let’s say these netted out at around 3 percent of the loan principal — so you’ll have paid $11,700 in closing costs. Your monthly mortgage payments will be $2,300, so you’ll likely need at least $4,600 in your bank account as reserves to secure your loan. That’s a total of $116,300 for upfront costs.

For ongoing costs, factor in the $2,300 monthly mortgage payment, plus property taxes, homeowners insurance, utilities and HOA fees. And don’t forget to keep enough left over to cover routine maintenance and repairs.

## FAQs

* ### What’s the minimum down payment I need to buy a house?

  Caret Down Icon

  [Down payment requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-much-is-a-down-payment-on-a-house/) differ depending on the type of loan you choose. For most people, FHA loans have the lowest minimum down payment at 3.5 percent for qualified borrowers. Some loan types require no down payment at all if you qualify. To avoid paying extra for private mortgage insurance, you’ll typically have to put at least 20 percent down.
* ### What are typical closing costs for a buyer?

  Caret Down Icon

  While homebuyers and sellers both pay some form of closing costs on a real estate transaction, buyers are generally on the hook for the majority of them. This is because many typical closing costs are associated with taking out a mortgage — these can include an application fee, an origination fee, and fees for the home appraisal, credit check, title search and more. Buyers also often pay closing costs not associated with the home loan, such as home inspection costs and transfer taxes. And if you use a real estate agent, you may also need to pay their commission fee (although sometimes home sellers will agree to cover this cost).
