## Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers: Buying Guide

Finding affordable car insurance after violations requires comparison shopping and understanding your options. This guide covers essential steps to secure the best coverage at competitive rates, from evaluating insurers specializing in high-risk drivers to maximizing available discounts and choosing the right coverage levels.

### How to Get Cheap Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers

Our research shows that comparison shopping and taking advantage of available programs can save high-risk drivers up to 40% on annual premiums. Whether you're already classified as a high-risk driver or want to avoid falling into that category, you can take specific actions to reduce your insurance cost.

1. 1

   Review and compare policies regularly

   Our research shows rate differences of up to 35% between companies for identical driver profiles. Get at least five quotes when shopping for high-risk coverage. As your circumstances change, compare car insurance policies to find the best rates for your needs.
2. 2

   Drive safely moving forward

   The best high-risk insurance companies reduce surcharges after six to 12 months of violation-free driving, and violations fall off your record after three years.
3. 3

   Improve your credit history

   In most states, the best high-risk car insurance companies reward drivers for making on-time payments, reducing credit card balances and disputing inaccuracies in their credit reports—often resulting in savings of 15% to 20% within six to 12 months. For immediate options, check our guide to [car insurance for drivers with bad credit](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-bad-credit/).
4. 4

   Take a defensive driving course

   Many of the best high-risk insurance companies offer 5% to 15% discounts to those who complete an approved defensive driving course. Defensive driving courses cost $25 to $75 and can be completed online in most states. SR-22 and FR-44 filers won't see lower premiums until the filing period ends.
5. 5

   Consider usage-based insurance programs

   Telematics programs like Progressive's Snapshot, Allstate's Drivewise or State Farm's Drive Safe & Save monitor your current driving habits and can reduce premiums by 10% to 40% for demonstrated safe driving, regardless of past infractions.
6. 6

   Explore all available discounts

   Even high-risk drivers qualify for discounts unrelated to driving history, including:

   * **Paperless billing** and automatic payment options yield 5% to 10% savings on premiums
   * **Multi-policy bundling** offers the most discounts, ranging from 10% to 25% when combining home, auto or other coverage
   * **Professional organization memberships** can reduce rates by 3% to 8%
   * **Paying premiums in full upfront** may save policyholders 5% to 10%
   * **Vehicle safety features** provide variable discounts depending on the insurance provider and technology

CAN HIGH-RISK DRIVERS TAKE DEFENSIVE DRIVING COURSES?

You need a clean driving record (no moving violations or at-fault accidents) for at least three years to be eligible for a defensive driving course discount. Speak with your insurer to determine its policy and whether completing this course may help you lower your premium. — [***Mark Friedlander***](https://www.moneygeek.com/editorial/mark-friedlander/)*, Director, Corporate Communications,* [*Insurance Information Institute*](https://www.iii.org/about-us/the-team/mark-friedlander)

### High-Risk Car Insurance: FAQ

We answer common questions to help you find the best and cheapest high-risk car insurance:

### What is the best insurance company for high-risk drivers?

State Farm is the [best car insurance company](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies/) for high-risk drivers, but getting quotes from multiple providers is essential to find the best deal for your driver profile.

### What is the cheapest insurance company for high-risk drivers?

For widely available policies, State Farm offers the [most affordable car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) for high-risk drivers, with an annual average premium of $715. Travelers is also a solid option, charging $947.

### How much is insurance for a high-risk driver?

A 40-year-old driver with a clean record pays $1,220 per year for car insurance, while a high-risk driver spends as much as $2,160 for the same coverage. These figures are averages, so use a [car insurance calculator](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-estimate-calculator/) for a more accurate estimate of your premiums.

### Who is considered a high-risk driver?

High-risk drivers aren't limited to those with violations on their record. Insurance companies may also classify high-risk drivers as those with poor credit histories, who drive sports cars or have little or no driving experience.

### What’s the difference between a DUI, DWI, OWI and OVWI?

DUI, DWI, OWI and OVWI all refer to impaired driving offenses, but their meanings vary by state. DUI (driving under the influence) and DWI (driving while intoxicated) are the most common and often used interchangeably. OWI (operating while intoxicated) and OVWI (operating a vehicle while intoxicated) are similar but focus on operating any vehicle, not just driving.

### What’s the difference between a credit score and credit-based insurance score?

A credit score evaluates your ability to repay debts, while a credit-based insurance score assesses your risk as a policyholder. While both use your credit history, a credit score helps lenders determine creditworthiness and a credit-based insurance score predicts the likelihood of filing claims.

### Which common premium rating factors are prohibited in certain states?

Six states don't allow gender as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Four states don't allow credit as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. Also, Hawaii doesn't allow age as a rating factor.

### Best Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers: Our Review Methodology

Finding reliable car insurance after violations feels overwhelming, but MoneyGeek's research simplifies the process. We evaluated more than 68 insurance companies nationwide to identify which providers offer high-risk drivers the best combination of affordable rates, reliable service and comprehensive coverage.

We gathered data from independent sources including state insurance departments, J.D. Power ratings, NAIC complaint indexes and AM Best financial strength ratings. Our research team analyzed 210,564 quotes across 897 ZIP codes to create comprehensive rankings tailored to high-risk driver needs.

**Our scoring methodology:**

**Customer satisfaction (35% of total score):** We collected data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners [(NAIC) customer complaint index](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm) and [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-us-auto-insurance-study/) customer satisfaction scores to assess how well insurers handle policy setup and service interactions.

**Affordability (20% of total score):** We collected data from Quadrant Information Services and state insurance departments to analyze how premiums compare between providers for high-risk drivers.

**Claims (20% of total score):** We collected data from the [J.D. Power Claims Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) and the [CRASH Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) to determine customer satisfaction during the claim process.

**Coverage (20% of total score):** We collected data on coverage offerings from various insurers to determine if they provide essential coverages most high-risk drivers need, including both standard and unique coverage options.

**Financial stability (5% of total score):** We used [AM Best](https://ratings.ambest.com/) financial stability ratings to determine insurers' record of meeting financial obligations with claims.

**Sample driver profile used for cost analysis:**

* 2012 Toyota Camry LE
* 12,000 miles driven annually
* Male or female driver

We modified the sample driver to account for these personalized factors:

* Age
* Geographic location and state
* Driving record: speeding tickets, at-fault accidents and DUIs (or similar offenses, depending on the state) on record

**Coverage details:** Using our sample driver profile, we collected data on premiums for a full coverage policy with a $500 deductible meeting state minimum coverage requirements. In a collision incident or at-fault accident, the deductible is the amount you'll pay before your insurance kicks in to cover the damage to your vehicle.

Coverage requirements are set at the state level. We collected data on state-specific rates based on each state's coverage requirements to determine state and national averages for minimum coverage.

MONEYGEEK EXPERT TIP

Traffic violations affect premiums based on severity and your insurer's specific rating system. Most violations affect your rates for three to five years, but the impact diminishes each year if you maintain a clean record afterward.
