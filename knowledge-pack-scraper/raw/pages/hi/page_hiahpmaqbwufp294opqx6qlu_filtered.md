California has some of the most comprehensive employee benefit requirements in the country, designed to protect workers and ensure access to essential support. Employers must comply with laws covering health insurance, paid leave, disability benefits, and retirement plans. Failing to meet these obligations can result in penalties and legal consequences.

Understanding these requirements is crucial for both employers and employees to ensure compliance and access to entitled benefits.

## Health Insurance Mandate

California requires certain employers to provide health insurance under both state and federal laws. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees offer health coverage meeting minimum essential coverage (MEC) standards. Additionally, the California Individual Mandate requires residents to maintain qualifying health coverage or face a state-imposed penalty, indirectly pressuring employers to offer compliant plans.

The state also offers the Small Business Health Options Program (Covered California for Small Business), allowing companies with up to 100 employees to provide coverage through a state-run exchange. While not mandatory, businesses using this program may qualify for tax credits. Large employers must ensure their plans meet affordability standards, meaning the employee’s share of premiums cannot exceed 9.12% of their household income in 2023, a figure adjusted annually.

California law prohibits structuring benefits in a way that discriminates against lower-wage workers. Employers must submit detailed health coverage information to the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to verify compliance with the state mandate. Failure to report can result in fines separate from federal penalties.

## Paid Sick Leave

The Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 requires employers to provide paid time off for personal illness, caregiving, or medical appointments. Employees working at least 30 days within a year accrue sick leave at a minimum rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked. Employers may cap annual usage at 40 hours or five days, but unused time must carry over to the next year, subject to a cap of 80 hours or ten days.

Certain local jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Oakland, have stricter requirements. For example, San Francisco mandates up to 72 hours of paid sick leave for larger businesses. Employers must track accrued and used sick leave and display mandatory notices informing employees of their rights. Retaliation against workers for taking leave is prohibited, and employees can file complaints with the California Labor Commissioner if their rights are violated.

Paid sick leave can be used for physical or mental illness, preventive care, or caring for a family member. California defines “family member” broadly, including children, parents, spouses, registered domestic partners, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. Employees may also use leave under the Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Victim Leave law for medical attention, legal assistance, or counseling related to such incidents. Employers cannot require workers to find a replacement before using sick leave or demand documentation for short absences unless there is reasonable suspicion of abuse.

## Family Leave Requirements

The California Family Rights Act (CFRA) requires employers with five or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period. This leave can be used for a serious health condition, caring for a family member, or bonding with a new child through birth, adoption, or foster placement. Unlike the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), CFRA includes domestic partners, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren in its definition of “family member.”

Pregnancy-related disabilities are covered separately under California’s Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL) law, which grants up to four months of leave for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Employees can take PDL for pregnancy complications and then use CFRA leave for bonding, extending their total leave to nearly seven months.

Employers must continue health benefits during CFRA and PDL leave under the same terms as if the employee were actively working. In 2021, CFRA was expanded to cover leave related to a qualifying exigency arising from a family member’s military deployment.

## Workers Compensation

California requires all employers to provide workers’ compensation insurance for job-related injuries or illnesses. This applies to businesses of all sizes, even those with only one employee. Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system, meaning employees receive benefits regardless of who caused the workplace injury.

Benefits include medical treatment, temporary disability payments, permanent disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, and death benefits for surviving dependents. Medical care is covered without out-of-pocket costs, while temporary disability benefits replace lost wages at two-thirds of the employee’s average weekly earnings, with a 2024 weekly cap of $1,619.15. Permanent disability payments depend on the severity of impairment and its impact on future earnings.

## State Disability Insurance

California’s State Disability Insurance (SDI) program provides short-term wage replacement for employees unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. Funded through employee payroll deductions, SDI applies to conditions arising outside of employment. To qualify, employees must have earned at least $300 in wages subject to SDI deductions and submit medical certification.

SDI benefits replace 60% to 70% of wages, depending on income level, with a 2024 weekly maximum of $1,620. Benefits can last up to 52 weeks, depending on medical necessity. Claims must be filed within 49 days of becoming disabled.

The Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, under SDI, allows up to eight weeks of wage replacement for caring for a seriously ill family member or bonding with a new child. Employers cannot retaliate against employees for applying for SDI benefits, and failure to properly deduct SDI contributions can result in penalties from the Employment Development Department (EDD).

## Unemployment Coverage

California’s unemployment insurance (UI) system provides financial assistance to employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Employers must participate in the UI program, funded through payroll taxes. To qualify, claimants must have earned sufficient wages during a designated base period and actively seek new employment.

Weekly UI benefits range from $40 to a maximum of $450 in 2024, with payments available for up to 26 weeks. The federal government may extend benefits during periods of high unemployment. Employers who improperly terminate workers to avoid UI claims may face penalties, including increased tax rates or legal action. The EDD conducts audits to ensure businesses properly report wages and contributions.

## Retirement Plan Mandates

California requires certain employers to facilitate retirement savings under the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program. Businesses with five or more employees that do not offer a qualified retirement plan must enroll their workers in CalSavers or establish a private retirement plan. Employees are automatically enrolled unless they opt out, with payroll deductions funding individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

The default contribution rate is 5% of wages, with an automatic annual increase of 1% up to a maximum of 8%. Employers are not required to contribute but must ensure compliance with enrollment and payroll deduction procedures. Failure to register or provide required information can result in penalties starting at $250 per eligible employee, increasing to $500 if non-compliance persists beyond 180 days. Employers offering retirement benefits must maintain documentation proving exemption from the mandate.
