Power score of 737 out of 1,000 leads all insurers, though the company isn't formally ranked due to eligibility restrictions limiting membership to military members, veterans and their families.

  USAA excels in digital experience and claims handling, offering military-focused benefits that competitors can't match.

The company's claims process works efficiently for both straightforward and complex claims, with dedicated support teams familiar with military life and unique coverage needs during overseas assignments.  
  USAA's digital tools set the industry standard for online policy management and claims tracking. The mobile app handles everything from filing claims with photo uploads to adjusting coverage limits and requesting policy documents.

* #### Our Take on Mercury Home Insurance

  Mercury earned our Best for Affordable Rates designation with a MoneyGeek rating of 4.3 out of 5.0, delivering the lowest premiums among top-rated Texas insurers at $3,025 annually. The company consistently offers the cheapest rates across various homeowner profiles, including young and older homeowners, large and small homes, those with recent claims and those with poor credit. Mercury's 56% savings compared to Texas's $6,854 state average makes it the clear choice for budget-conscious homeowners willing to accept below-average customer satisfaction scores.  
  Mercury balances rock-bottom premiums with solid coverage options, though customer experience trails competitors like State Farm and USAA. The insurer's J.D. Power score of 575 out of 1,000 falls below the industry average, reflecting slower claims processing and limited digital tools compared to higher-rated providers. Mercury compensates for this gap with generous bundling discounts up to 17.9% and affordable endorsements like home systems protection and cyber coverage. If saving money matters more than premium customer service, Mercury delivers exceptional value for Texas homeowners.

  Mercury charges $3,025 annually for Texas homeowners, which is 56% below the state average of $6,854. The insurer consistently ranks as the cheapest option across many Texas homeowner profiles, including young and old homeowners, large and small homes, those with a recent claim and those with poor credit.   
  On top of its low average rates, Mercury's bundling discount saves up to 17.9% on home coverage when you combine policies with auto insurance, which also nets you up to 14.5% off your auto premium. Additional discounts for new homes under 10 years old, fire and theft protective devices, water leak detection systems and three-plus years claims-free further reduce your already-low premiums.

* #### Mercury Home Insurance Customer Experience

  Mercury scored 575 out of 1,000 in J.D.

Texas homeowners report that Mercury's claims process works efficiently for straightforward incidents like fire, theft and wind damage, with simple procedures that resolve common claims without unnecessary complexity. Complex claims involving multiple perils or extensive damage seem to require more patience and follow-up, according to customer reviews.  
  Mercury's limited agent network means most interactions happen by phone or online rather than in-person meetings. Budget-conscious Texas homeowners appreciate Mercury's no-frills approach.
* #### Mercury Home Insurance Coverage Options

  Mercury offers affordable endorsements that extend protection beyond standard homeowners policies. The company focuses on practical add-ons like [appliance protection](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/homeowners-appliance-insurance/) and cyber coverage rather than extensive customization options.

The company ranked second in the J.D. Power 2025 Home Insurance Study, highlighting its focus on superior customer care. Chubb's approach includes complimentary home appraisals to assess hurricane preparedness for coastal Texas homes and wildfire risks for Hill Country properties while also providing security advice.

  Chubb's A++ AM Best rating demonstrates outstanding financial stability, giving Texas homeowners confidence their hurricane or hail damage claims get paid reliably. The company goes beyond standard coverage with innovative HomeScan technology that detects hidden problems before they cause damage, plus comprehensive replacement cost coverage that rebuilds your home exactly as it was. While Chubb's $9,358 average annual premium sits 37% above Texas's $6,854 state average, the combination of white-glove service, extended replacement cost and unique benefits makes it ideal for homeowners who value superior protection and personalized attention over basic coverage.
* #### Chubb Home Insurance Cost

  Chubb's average annual premium of $9,358 for Texas homeowners is 37% above the state average of $6,854, reflecting the company's focus on comprehensive coverage and superior service.

The company's personalized approach includes risk consultants who conduct complimentary home appraisals, assessing hurricane preparedness for coastal Texas properties and wildfire risks for Hill Country homes while providing security and fire prevention advice. During claims, Chubb helps arrange comfortable temporary housing, including finding homes in your school district when possible—particularly valuable for Texas families displaced by hurricanes or severe storms.  
  Chubb's A++ AM Best rating confirms strong financial stability and prompt claims handling, critical for Texas homeowners facing costly hurricane or hail damage. The insurer's white-glove service includes HomeScan technology that uses infrared detection to find hidden problems like water leaks or electrical issues before damage occurs. Texas homeowners appreciate Chubb's flexibility during the claims process, with options to take cash settlements instead of rebuilding after total losses. The premium service justifies Chubb's higher costs for homeowners who value exceptional customer experience and comprehensive coverage.

* #### Our Take on Nationwide Home Insurance

  [Nationwide](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/reviews/nationwide-insurance/) earned our Best Coverage Options award because of its wide variety of endorsement options that address Texas homeowner needs. The company's dwelling replacement cost coverage pays up to twice your dwelling limit if rebuilding costs exceed your policy after a covered loss, which is valuable protection given Texas's volatile construction costs and severe weather risks. Nationwide's J.D. Power score of 641 out of 1,000 matches the industry average, reflecting solid but unexceptional customer satisfaction compared to leaders like USAA and Chubb.

  Nationwide stands out for customization options rather than rock-bottom premiums or exceptional service. Texas homeowners can add water backup coverage for sewer and drain overflow, equipment breakdown protection for appliances, service line coverage for underground utilities and separate earthquake and flood policies. The company's Valuables Plus coverage protects high-value items like jewelry and art beyond standard limits, while umbrella insurance extends liability protection. Nationwide works well for homeowners who prioritize comprehensive coverage options and don't mind paying slightly above-average premiums for flexibility.
* #### Nationwide Home Insurance Cost

  Nationwide charges $7,306 annually for Texas homeowners, 7% above the state average of $6,854. This premium reflects Nationwide's extensive coverage options and established national presence, though budget-conscious homeowners can find cheaper alternatives with State Farm at $4,457 or Mercury at $3,025.

## How Much Is Home Insurance in Texas?

[Home insurance in Texas costs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-home-insurance-cost-calculator-texas/) **$6,854 per year on average**, 93% higher than the [nationwide average](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-cost-of-home-insurance/) of $3,548. Texas homeowners face steep premiums due to hurricanes, hailstorms and severe weather that drive frequent claims and high rebuilding costs. Your actual premium depends on your home's value, age, location and personal factors like credit score and claims history. Newer homes built in 2020 cost $4,195 annually to insure, while older homes from 1980 average $6,757 per year. Your dwelling coverage limit significantly impacts costs, with $100,000 coverage averaging $3,622 annually compared to $11,358 for $500,000 in coverage.

Your credit score and claims history create the widest cost variations among Texas homeowners. Homeowners with excellent credit pay $5,056 annually, while those with poor credit face premiums of $11,527 — a 128% increase for the same coverage. A recent claim raises your average cost to $8,137 per year, $1,283 more than homeowners without claims.

| Cost Category | Average Annual Cost | Average Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Average | $6,854 | $571 |

## How to Find the Best Texas Home Insurance

Texas homeowners need coverage that protects against hurricanes, hail and severe weather without breaking the bank. These steps help you find affordable protection and maximize your discounts.

1. 1

   Determine Your Coverage Needs

   Calculate your [dwelling coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/what-is-dwelling-coverage/) by estimating your home's rebuilding cost, not its market value. Texas building costs average $150 to $200 per square foot, meaning a 2,000-square-foot home needs $300,000 to $400,000 in dwelling coverage. Add personal property coverage worth 50% to 70% of your dwelling amount, plus liability protection of at least $300,000. Don't skip essential Texas endorsements like water backup coverage for Gulf Coast homes or windstorm protection in hurricane zones.
2. 2

   Research Costs and Discounts

   Texas home insurance averages $6,854 annually, but your cost varies by location, home age and personal factors. Each insurer weighs these cost factors differently, so request quotes from multiple companies to find the best deal for your situation. Verify each quote includes identical coverage limits, deductibles and endorsements before [comparing prices](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/). Ask agents about all available discounts up front, as insurers won't usually apply them automatically. Focus on stackable discounts that combine for maximum savings, like bundling (up to 25%), protective devices (5% to 10%) and claims-free history (10% to 15%).
3. 3

   Find the Best Providers for Your Needs

   Narrow your search to insurers matching your priorities. State Farm offers the best overall value at $4,457 annually with strong customer service. Mercury provides the cheapest rates at $3,025 for budget-focused homeowners. USAA delivers unbeatable rates and service for military families at $4,243. Find providers that offer the coverage options you need as well — coastal homeowners need robust hurricane coverage, while inland residents prioritize hail and windstorm protection.
4. 4

   Consider Bundling Your Policies

   [Bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-auto-bundle-in-texas/) saves up to 25% on your home premium in Texas, plus additional auto policy discounts. State Farm offers the best bundling value with a combined annual cost of $2,559 and a 25% discount that saves $847 compared to separate policies. Compare bundled rates against separate policies from different insurers, as sometimes two specialized providers beat one bundled rate.
5. 5

   Use State Programs If Necessary

   The Texas Fair Plan Association (TFPA) provides coverage for high-risk homeowners denied by traditional insurers. TFPA offers basic dwelling and personal property coverage, though limits are lower than standard policies and wind/hail protection requires separate Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) coverage for coastal properties. TFPA rates often beat high-risk insurers willing to cover you, making it a viable option if you haven’t had much luck with traditional insurance companies.

## Home Insurance Coverage for Texas Weather Risks

Texas homeowners face unique [weather risks](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/high-risk/) requiring specific coverage protections:

![wind icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/wind_bsswab.svg)

Wind and Hail Coverage

Standard homeowners policies cover wind and hail damage from severe thunderstorms and hurricanes. Texas leads the nation in hail claims, with storms causing roof damage, broken windows and dented siding. Your policy covers repairs minus your deductible. Coastal homeowners often face separate wind and hail deductibles of 1% to 5% of their dwelling coverage amount rather than flat dollar amounts.

![rain icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/rain_fkozzi.svg)

Flood Insurance

Standard Texas home insurance policies exclude flood damage. You'll need a separate policy through your insurer or the National Flood Insurance Program to protect against heavy rainfall and tropical storms.

![houseRebuild icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/house_rebuild_jfh2zw.svg)

Extended Replacement Cost

This coverage handles building cost increases after major storms, protecting you when reconstruction costs surge during high-demand periods.

![faucet icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/faucet_qh7dlf.svg)

Water Backup Coverage

This coverage protects against [sewer backups](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-sewer-line-replacement/) during heavy rain events common in Texas.

![laptop icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/laptop_eiq1bz.svg)

Personal Property Replacement Cost

This coverage replaces damaged [personal property](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/what-is-personal-property-coverage-how-much-do-you-need/) at current prices rather than depreciated value. Without replacement cost coverage, you'll receive only what your belongings were worth at the time of loss, which may not cover the full cost of replacing them after weather damage.

## Top-Rated Texas Home Insurance Companies: Bottom Line

State Farm offers the best overall value for most Texas homeowners at $4,457 annually, combining competitive rates with strong customer service. USAA delivers unbeatable premiums and satisfaction scores for military families at $4,243, while Mercury provides the cheapest rates at $3,025 for budget-conscious homeowners.

Texas home insurance costs significantly more than the national average due to severe weather and frequent claims. Maximize savings by [bundling policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/), maintaining good credit, staying claims-free and comparing quotes from multiple insurers to find the best coverage for your home.

Maximize savings by bundling home and auto policies for up to 25% off, installing protective devices and maintaining a claims-free history. Focus on insurers that understand Texas-specific risks like hurricanes, hail and windstorms.

### How much home insurance do I need in Texas?

Your dwelling coverage should equal your home's rebuilding cost, typically $150 to $200 per square foot in Texas, not its market value. Add personal property coverage worth 50% to 70% of your dwelling amount and liability protection of at least $300,000. Consider essential Texas endorsements like water backup coverage and windstorm protection based on your location.

### How much is home insurance in Texas per month?

Home insurance in Texas costs $571 per month on average, or $6,854 annually. Monthly costs vary from $302 for lower dwelling coverage limits ($100,000) to $946 for higher limits ($500,000). Your actual monthly premium depends on your home's value, age, location, credit score and claims history.

### Why is Texas home insurance so expensive?

Texas home insurance costs 93% more than the national average due to hurricanes, hailstorms and severe weather that cause frequent and costly claims. Coastal areas face higher premiums from hurricane exposure and flooding risks, while inland regions deal with damaging hailstorms and tornadoes. Rising construction costs and increased claim frequency drive premiums higher across the state.

### Is flood insurance included in Texas homeowners insurance?

Flood insurance isn't included in standard Texas homeowners policies and requires a separate policy through your insurer or the National Flood Insurance Program. Homeowners in high-risk flood zones with mortgages must purchase flood coverage as a lending requirement. Even if you're not in a high-risk area, flood insurance is worth considering since 25% of flood claims occur outside designated flood zones.

## How We Found the Top 5 Homeowners Insurance Companies in Texas

Texas homeowners face some of the country's highest insurance costs due to hurricanes, hailstorms and severe weather. We evaluated major insurers operating in Texas to find which companies deliver the best combination of affordable rates, reliable customer service and strong coverage options for the state's unique risks.

**Our Research Approach**

We analyzed home insurance providers based on three core factors that matter most when choosing coverage: affordability, customer experience and coverage options. Each factor received equal weight in our evaluation, ensuring companies excel across all areas rather than just offering low prices or great service alone.

**Affordability Analysis**

We gathered premium quotes for Texas homeowners across different profiles, including various home values, ages and locations throughout the state. Our rate analysis covered both minimum required coverage and enhanced protection levels to understand pricing at different coverage tiers. We calculated average annual premiums for each insurer and compared them against the Texas state average of $6,854 to identify which companies offer the most competitive rates.

**Customer Experience Evaluation**

We reviewed J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Home Insurance Study scores to measure customer satisfaction with claims handling, policy offerings and customer service. Companies with scores above the industry average earned higher ratings in our methodology. We also considered AM Best financial strength ratings to ensure recommended insurers maintain the financial stability needed to pay claims reliably, particularly after major weather events affecting multiple policyholders simultaneously.

**Coverage Options Assessment**

We examined each insurer's standard policy features and available endorsements, focusing on Texas-specific needs like water backup coverage, windstorm protection and service line coverage. Companies offering flexible customization options, separate flood and earthquake policies, and innovative features like technology protection or home systems coverage scored higher. We prioritized insurers that let you tailor coverage to your home's location and risk profile rather than forcing one-size-fits-all policies.

**Standard Profile Details**

Our baseline quotes represent a typical Texas homeowner to make cost comparisons meaningful across insurers. We used homeowners ages 41 to 60 with $250,000 in dwelling coverage, homes built in 2000, good credit scores and no previous claims. This profile reflects middle-income Texas homeowners with established homes and solid insurance histories, letting you gauge whether your situation will cost more or less than our quoted averages.

**Why This Matters for Texas Homeowners**

Our balanced approach helps you find insurers that won't leave you scrambling during claims or force you to overpay for basic coverage. The best home insurance company for your neighbor might not work for you. Your home's age, location near the coast or in tornado alley, and personal priorities like local agent access versus digital tools all influence which insurer fits best.
