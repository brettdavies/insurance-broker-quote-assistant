## How does bundling home and car insurance work?

The concept of bundling is pretty straightforward. You buy more than one type of insurance from the same company and, in exchange for the increased business, the insurance company gives you a discount. And there’s an additional benefit for the insurer for offering bundles: Customers who bundle are more likely to renew their policies.

You typically get discounts on both [car insurance](/auto-insurance.aspx) and [home insurance](/home-and-renters-insurance.aspx) when you bundle coverage. The discount isn’t the same for both policies. Each provider has its own discount formulas. Companies may offer a more substantial discount on one than the other.

## The pros and cons of home and auto insurance bundles

The biggest benefit of bundling your home and car insurance is a cheaper premium.

But keep in mind that [you don't always save money by bundling](/auto-insurance/is-bundling-home-and-auto-really-the-best-deal). You could find a company with a low enough price on one of the two policies to result in more affordable overall rates than a bundle elsewhere. Here’s how that works:

* If you pay $1,000 for car insurance from one provider currently and $1,200 for home insurance from another, the total is $2,200.
* Let's say, however, you decide to get your home insurance from your car insurance company. The price is $1,500 for the new home insurance policy, $300 more than what you pay right now.
* The new combined premium would mean a $300 increase, totaling $2,500.
* You would need a bundling discount of $400 or so, at minimum, to decrease the total bundle rate by enough money to save when compared to the price you currently pay for the separate policies.

Bundled rates aren't always cheaper in absolute terms. This is why you should carefully compare what you pay for separate policies now to quotes on home and car insurance bundles.

## Should you bundle home and auto insurance in Louisiana?

Prior to signing up for an auto and home bundle, it’s important to shop around. Bundling your car and homeowners insurance has many advantages; you only have to deal with a single company and with a single bill and you typically get a discount on both policies. Yet bundling isn’t always the best deal.

Some companies have [cheap car insurance rates](/auto-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-rates-by-state) but less competitive [home insurance rates](/average-home-insurance-rates), and vice versa. You might pay less overall by choosing two different companies for your insurance.

Shop around and evaluate Louisiana car insurance rates on an individual basis and with a bundling discount to make sure you’re getting the best deal before you buy.

## Methodology

In the spring of 2023, [Insurance.com](/) analyzed rate and discount data from Quadrant Data Services.

Rates were fielded for a full-coverage policy (100/300/100 with a $500 collision and comprehensive deductible). Homeowners insurance rates are based on $300,000 in dwelling coverage with $300,000 in liability and a $1,000 deductible.

## FAQ: Home and auto insurance bundling

### What information do you need to bundle your policies?

To bundle your policies you will need all of the details for both the cars and the home you want to insure. That includes VINs, driver information and details about the home. Your current home and auto policies will list this information for easy reference.

### Which insurance companies bundle home and auto insurance?

Almost every insurance company offers a bundling discount, often called a multi-policy discount. Multi-policy discounts aren't just for auto and home. They often include other home insurance policies like renters and condo, as well as motorcycle insurance and in some cases life, RV, boat, and others.

### What type of insurance policies can I bundle?

Multi-policy discounts can also apply to other types of insurance policies that you buy from the same insurance company. Depending upon the insurer, you may also be able to bundle these [types of insurance](/auto-insurance/types-of-car-insurance.html) policies:

* Condo
* Renters
* Motorcycle
* RV
* Life

Some [auto insurance companies](/auto-insurance/carriers.aspx) don't write homeowners insurance, but some may align themselves with a home insurer to offer a discount. Ask your agent or customer service representative to see if you can bundle [multiple insurance policies](/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/multi-car-policies.html).
