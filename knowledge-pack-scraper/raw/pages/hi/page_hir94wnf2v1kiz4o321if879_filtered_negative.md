You typically get discounts on both [car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance.aspx) and [home insurance](https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance.aspx) when you bundle coverage. The discount isn’t the same for both policies. Each provider has its own discount formulas. Companies may offer a more substantial discount on one than the other.
But keep in mind that [you don't always save money by bundling](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/is-bundling-home-and-auto-really-the-best-deal). You could find a company with a low enough price on one of the two policies to result in more affordable overall rates than a bundle elsewhere. Here’s how that works:
Some companies have [cheap car insurance rates](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-rates-by-state) but less competitive [home insurance rates](https://www.insurance.com/average-home-insurance-rates), and vice versa. You might pay less overall by choosing two different companies for your insurance.
In the spring of 2023, [Insurance.com](https://www.insurance.com/) analyzed rate and discount data from Quadrant Data Services. The rates, from 2022, are the most recent available to Insurance.com and are based on a 40-year-old male driver with a 12-mile daily commute, good credit and a clean driving history. Rates were fielded for a full-coverage policy (100/300/100 with a $500 collision and comprehensive deductible). Homeowners insurance rates are based on $300,000 in dwelling coverage with $300,000 in liability and a $1,000 deductible.
Multi-policy discounts can also apply to other types of insurance policies that you buy from the same insurance company. Depending upon the insurer, you may also be able to bundle these [types of insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/types-of-car-insurance.html) policies:
Some [auto insurance companies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers.aspx) don't write homeowners insurance, but some may align themselves with a home insurer to offer a discount. Ask your agent or customer service representative to see if you can bundle [multiple insurance policies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/multi-car-policies.html).
