## Texas Minimum Coverage Requirements & What They Cover

Texas auto insurance requirements specify minimum coverage limits that are written in a set format, which includes amounts in thousands of dollars for bodily injury or death for one person, multiple people, and property damage.

* **Bodily Injury Liability:** [Bodily injury liability auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/bodily-injury-liability-insurance/) is meant to protect you if you’re found liable (or at fault) in a car crash. This specific type is meant to cover bodily injuries for passengers in other vehicles that are involved in the crash. This is usually rolled into one plan with property damage insurance.
* **Property Damage Liability:** Like bodily injury liability insurance, this type is meant to cover the driver who is found to be at fault. This type protects against financial liabilities if the property is destroyed in a car crash, often (but not always) involving the other car. This is often combined into one plan with bodily injury coverage. Learn more about [property damage liability (PDL) auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-property-damage-liability-auto-insurance-companies/) to explore providers that offer tailored policies to suit your needs.

Under Texas’s state minimum car insurance laws, the minimum auto insurance limits are set as follows: $30,000 for bodily injury or death per person, $60,000 for total bodily injury or death per accident, and $25,000 for total property damage per accident. These minimum limits are required to ensure basic coverage for drivers in the state.

These limits are expressed as 30/60/25 coverage, which is a standard format for Texas minimum liability insurance. While understanding Texas [auto insurance laws](https://www.autoinsurance.org/auto-insurance-laws/) can seem difficult at first, once you are familiar with this structure, it becomes easier to interpret the required coverage limits.

## **Other Coverage Options to Consider in Texas**

There are several different types of automotive insurance, providing for different occasions and types of accidents. In general, these different types can be explained as follows:

* **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** [Personal injury protection auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/personal-injury-protection-insurance/) is meant to insure the driver against injuries inflicted upon themself and anyone in the vehicle with them, regardless of who is found liable for the crash. It can also be used to account for wages lost as a result of a crash, often from drivers missing work after collisions. The state of Texas requires all insurance companies to offer their customers PIP, with most benefits ranging between $2,500 and $5000.
* **Collision:** [Collision auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-is-collision-insurance/) covers damage to the driver’s own car, designed to repair or replace parts after a crash. This coverage does not only provide financial safety in the event of a two-car collision but also in the event of a crash into a tree or other inanimate object.
* **Comprehensive:** Considered a vital type of coverage to hold, [comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) plans protect against financial debt in instances that do not always involve a car crash. These plans cover automotive theft, fires that damage the vehicle, hitting animals, and a variety of other conditions.
* **[Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-uninsured-and-underinsured-motorist-coverage/) Coverage:** Although all drivers in the state of Texas are required to have insurance, that is not always the case. This coverage protects against collisions where another driver is found to be at fault but either doesn’t have insurance, doesn’t have enough insurance, or if it’s a hit-and-run.

In Texas, it’s crucial to meet the minimum liability insurance requirements in Texas and the state required minimum car insurance coverage in Texas to stay compliant with the law.

![Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements")![Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Personal-Injury-Protection-8.png "Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements")

Understanding your options, such as Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability, and Personal Injury Protection (PIP), can help you choose the right coverage for added protection and peace of mind on the road.

## Penalties for Driving Without Auto Insurance in Texas

Driving in Texas without insurance coverage will seriously endanger you. Texas requires every driver to maintain auto insurance, protecting all drivers on Texas roads. In a situation where you are caught driving without insurance coverage, you might be dealt a set of the following penalties:

* **Fines****:** Up to $350 for a first offense, with higher fines for repeat offenses.
* **License Suspension****:** Your driver’s license could be suspended for up to one year.

* **Increased Penalties for Repeat Offenders:** If caught multiple times, penalties become more severe.

It’s important to know that car insurance is required in Texas and to meet the state of Texas minimum auto insurance requirements to avoid these penalties.

## Other Texas Car Insurance Laws

Texas insurance requirements state that drivers also need to prove that they can be financially responsible for any fees that might result from an automotive accident. They are considered to have taken financial responsibility when a vehicle has been officially and legally registered in their name.

They are, however, required to return their state-issued license plates to a DMV location to insure that the vehicle is not used. They can also submit their vehicle and title to the DMV for demolition.

![USAA Screenshot: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201187%20759'%3E%3C/svg%3E "USAA Screenshot: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements")![USAA Screenshot: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/USAA-HomePage-Screenshot-4-1.png "USAA Screenshot: Texas Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements")

These car insurance laws in Texas are designed to ensure that every vehicle on the road has someone who takes financial responsibility for any damages that result from its operation.

In subsequent offenses, these fines increase to between $350 and $1,000, and the driver can have their license and registration revoked until proof of insurance is provided to a local DMV.
