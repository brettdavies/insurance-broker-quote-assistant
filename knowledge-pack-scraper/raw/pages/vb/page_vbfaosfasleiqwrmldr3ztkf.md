**Hail Damage 101: What Homeowners Need to Know**
  

Texas storms are no joke, and if you live in the Lone Star State, you know that hail season can be brutal. From minor dents to catastrophic damage, hail can compromise your roof’s integrity, leading to costly repairs if left unchecked. At Texas Premier Roofing, we specialize in storm damage recovery, helping homeowners like you stay protected before and after severe weather.
  

### **How Hail Damages Your Roof**
Even if your roof looks fine from the ground, hail can cause hidden damage that worsens over time. Here’s what you need to know:
  * 1-inch hail – While seemingly small, this size can wear down shingles, loosen granules, and shorten your roof’s lifespan. Over time, this leads to leaks and costly repairs.
  * 1.5-inch hail – Big enough to crack shingles and bruise underlayment, which can lead to water intrusion and structural issues.
  * 2-inch hail & larger (catastrophic damage) – This size can puncture shingles, damage flashing, and even break through roofing materials, requiring immediate attention.


  

### **Signs of Hail Damage**
After a storm, look for these warning signs:  
✔ Dented gutters and downspouts  
✔ Missing or loose shingles  
✔ Soft or bruised spots on shingles  
✔ Leaks or water stains on ceilings  
✔ Debris buildup in gutters from granule loss
If you notice any of these signs—or even if you don’t—a professional inspection is crucial to catch hidden damage before it leads to bigger problems.
  

### **Why You Shouldn’t Wait**
Hail damage doesn’t go away. Ignoring it can lead to:  
❌ Higher repair costs as damage worsens  
❌ Roof leaks, mold growth, and interior damage  
❌ Insurance claim deadlines passing before you take action
  

### **Texas Premier Roofing: Your Severe Storm Specialists**

###  [STORM SEASON: PREPARE WITH TEXAS PREMIER ROOFING](https://www.txpremierroofing.com/winter-weather)
January 28, 2025
How Winter Weather Affects Your Roof: Prepare with Texas Premier Roofing As a homeowner in Texas, you know that the weather here can be unpredictable. From freezing temperatures and heavy rainfall to the occasional hailstorm, your roof is exposed to some of the harshest conditions possible. Winter weather and spring storms can cause long-term damage to your roof and home if left unchecked. Fortunately, staying proactive and getting ahead of the storm season can help protect your home and ensure that your roof is ready for whatever Texas weather throws your way. At Texas Premier Roofing, we specialize in helping homeowners assess their roofs and make sure they’re ready to face the seasonal elements. In this blog, we’ll break down the effects of winter weather on your roof, how rainfall can cause hidden damage, and why getting ahead of Texas' unpredictable storm season is crucial. How Winter Weather Can Affect Your Roof Winter weather in Texas might not be as severe as in northern states, but it still brings challenges that can affect your roof and overall home structure. Freezing temperatures, ice, and even snow accumulation can cause significant damage to your roofing materials. Here are a few ways winter weather can take a toll on your roof: Freezing and Thawing Cycles When temperatures dip below freezing, water that has entered small cracks in your roof or gutters can freeze, expand, and cause further damage. As the temperature rises during the day, the ice melts, but the water can seep into roofing materials or the attic. This freeze-and-thaw cycle puts stress on your roof, creating cracks and gaps that allow water to infiltrate your home. Ice Dams Ice dams occur when snow accumulates on your roof and melts due to heat escaping from your attic. The water then refreezes at the edge of the roof, blocking proper drainage. This creates a pool of water that can back up under shingles, leading to roof leaks, mold growth, and structural damage to your home. Weight of Snow and Ice While snow accumulation isn’t as common in Texas, if it does happen, the weight of heavy snow and ice can stress your roof’s structure. Flat roofs or older homes may be at a higher risk of collapse under the weight of snow. Ensure your roof can withstand these extreme weather conditions by scheduling regular inspections and clearing snow buildup if needed. The Impact of Rainfall on Your Roof Though Texas might not experience the frequent rainfall of other states, the heavy rainstorms we do get can be highly damaging to your roof. Even a brief but intense storm can put your roof at risk, especially if it’s already compromised by previous weather conditions. Here’s how rainfall can harm your roof: Roof Leaks Roof leaks are one of the most common issues caused by rainfall. When shingles are missing, cracked, or worn out, water can seep into your home. This leads to ceiling stains, mold growth, and potential structural damage. If left unaddressed, water damage can spread throughout your home, costing you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in repairs. Clogged Gutters Rainfall can quickly overwhelm gutters that are clogged with leaves, twigs, or debris. When gutters can’t drain properly, water backs up onto the roof, creating water pooling. This can lead to water penetration into the roof deck, causing rotting, leaks, and mold growth. Regular gutter cleaning is key to ensuring proper drainage during rainfall. Erosion and Wear Over time, constant exposure to rain can wear down the materials of your roof. Asphalt shingles may lose their granules, leading to deterioration and a decrease in the shingles' ability to protect your home from moisture. Roofs that aren't regularly maintained or inspected may develop weak spots that are more vulnerable to further damage. Getting Ahead of Spring Storm Season Winter weather may be behind us, but spring in Texas brings its own set of challenges for homeowners. Known for its severe thunderstorms and hail, the spring storm season can cause a lot of damage to your roof if it isn’t adequately prepared. Here’s how to get ahead of the season and ensure your roof is ready to handle what’s to come: Schedule a Pre-Storm Roof Inspection The best way to ensure your roof is ready for spring storms is by having a professional roof inspection. At Texas Premier Roofing, we’ll conduct a thorough inspection to identify any weak spots, missing shingles, or areas that could be vulnerable to hail and heavy rain. Our team can also check for any damage caused by winter weather so that you can address issues before they escalate. Reinforce Your Roof with Storm-Resistant Materials If your roof is aging or showing signs of wear, it might be time to consider upgrading to more durable materials that can better withstand Texas’ spring storms. Impact-resistant shingles are designed to resist hail damage, while stronger roof coatings can help protect against water penetration. Clear Your Gutters and Downspouts Rainfall in Texas can quickly overwhelm clogged gutters. Make sure your gutters are clear of leaves, debris, and anything else that could prevent proper drainage. Clean gutters will help ensure water flows away from your roof and prevent issues like water damage, rot, and leaks. Trim Overhanging Trees Spring storms often bring high winds that can knock down branches onto your roof. Trim any overhanging trees and remove loose branches to reduce the risk of damage from flying debris. This also helps prevent leaves from clogging your gutters during rainfall.
