Anything your renters policy normally covers would also be covered in your storage unit usually. Belongings such as clothing, furniture, electronics and appliances will all be covered should a fire, tornado or water leak damage them. Even if a [robber steals your things](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-renters-insurance-cover-theft "When does renters insurance cover theft") from the unit, your renters policy will still cover you. You are out of luck, however, if pests, a [flood](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-renters-insurance-cover-flood-damage "When does renters insurance cover flood damage") or an earthquake destroys your stored items.
There are a couple of exceptions and specifications to note. Coverage for items in a self-storage unit is limited to a small percentage of your policy maximum. Your insurer will refuse claim payment if the object is not in your home or your storage unit because it is being repaired or refurbished. You also won't be covered for items that you usually store in another residence that your [cheapest renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies") does not cover.
[Renters insurance will cover](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-does-renters-insurance-cover "What Does \(And Doesn't\) Renters Insurance Cover?") items in a self-storage unit up to a percentage of your policy's limits, which is usually 10%. If you have a policy that covers your personal property up to a maximum of $50,000, you would be insured up to $5,000 for the items in your storage unit. Coverage limits afforded to certain items would still apply in the storage unit: Any electronics, jewelry or musical instruments will be capped at their normal limits.

If you [got an endorsement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/renters-insurance-endorsements-and-floaters "Types of endorsements and scheduled floater policies for renters insurance") for any of those belongings — also known as "scheduling an item"— you need to read the policy language carefully. You should understand how much coverage you will receive for those items while in storage, versus how much is covered while they're in your home.
These policies are generally pretty cheap, but it all depends on how much coverage you want. The [cost of most renters insurance policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-renters-insurance "Average Cost of Renters Insurance") is usually less than $30 a month. Getting coverage through SafeStor for more than $10,000 would essentially cost the same as having another renters policy.
