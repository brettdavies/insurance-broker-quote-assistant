Government regulators have generally accepted [gender-based pricing](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/male-vs-female-car-insurance-rates/) because insurers have been able to show risk correlated with gender. For example, male [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/teen-driving-and-income/) are statistically far more likely to crash and file claims than female teens, so they should have to pay more for insurance. That said, considering gender as a rating factor is outlawed in seven states: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

The states that have outlawed insurance companies from considering gender as a rating factor have mostly prohibited other personal rating factors besides gender, including age, credit history, education, occupation, employment status, etc. Lawmakers in these states have decided it is unfair for insurance companies to charge some drivers more due to personal characteristics. States favoring these more restrictive regulations believe drivers' car insurance costs primarily reflect their driving and claims history.
* * *
This is because historical data shows that men, particularly young men, tend to be involved in more accidents, drive more aggressively and file more costly claims than women. As a result, insurers often view male drivers as higher risk, especially in the teen and young adult age brackets. According to IIHS, “Men typically drive more miles than women and more often engage in risky driving practices including not using safety belts, driving while impaired by alcohol, and speeding. Crashes involving male drivers often are more severe than those involving female drivers.”[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-1)
–For nearly every year from 1975 to 2022, the number of male crash deaths was more than twice the number of female crash deaths, according to IIHS.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-1)
– In terms of distracted driving, previously, women were actually more likely to engage in phone use while driving. Still, as of 2022 (the last year for which data is available), men and women use cell phones while driving at approximately the same rate. That said, men are still more likely than women to die in car accidents where distracted driving is a factor. [[2]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-2)
– In 2022, alcohol-impaired drivers were involved in one-third of all fatal car crashes — and most of those drivers were men. According to NHTSA, there were three male alcohol-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes for every female alcohol-impaired driver (44,359 versus 15,260).[[3]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-3)
What's interesting here is that these numbers have not dramatically changed. Men, and particularly male teenagers, consistently have shown increased risk for insurance companies. Yet, previously, women were paid  _more_ than men in half of all states.
So if women have always demonstrated a lower risk than male drivers, why haven't they always historically paid less? There has been substantial investigation into this topic by many state insurance regulators with unclear answers. This is in part why some states have outlawed gender being considered as a rating factor all together.
Another possible contributor to this market correction is credit scores. As mentioned above, personal rating factors aren’t looked at independently, but are combined as a whole when considering the amount a person will pay for car insurance. Credit score is another rating factor that has an impact on car
insurance rates where the difference between a poor credit score and an excellent one can change your auto insurance rates by as much as [114%](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/credit-insurance-rates/). Back in 2018, men’s credit scores were on average about 10 points higher than women’s, whereas today they are nearly identical.[[5]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-5) This change in credit score then might be a contributing factor to women now paying less. Of course, it’s impossible to look
at credit and gender as independent rating factors because the states that outlaw gender from being considered in determining insurance pricing, also outlaw credit
* * *
Industry trade groups have disputed previous consumer studies showing that women are charged more than men, but they have not shared alternate data or explained why female drivers may see higher prices in some states.[[4]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/men-women-auto-insurance-differences-by-state/#footnote-4)
* * *
Data for over 32 million car insurance rates was used to examine how gender impacts insurance pricing nationwide.
