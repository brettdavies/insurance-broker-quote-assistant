## About Citizens home insurance

Citizens Property Insurance was created in 2002 by the Florida legislature to provide coverage for homeowners who couldn’t find insurance on the private market. But today, what was designed to be a “last resort” option has ballooned into one of the state’s largest insurers. Thanks to inflation, hurricanes and litigation, many other insurers have gone bankrupt or decided to write fewer policies in the state. That's left many Florida homeowners with nowhere to turn but Citizens.

Not everyone is eligible for Citizens home insurance. You can get a Citizens policy only if you can’t find coverage on the private market or the premiums from other companies are more than 20% higher than the rates Citizens offers you for similar coverage.

Even if Citizens does offer you the cheapest policy, you may end up having to pay a surcharge if a major storm strikes Florida and the company doesn’t have enough funds to pay its claims. A 2022 law requiring Citizens policyholders to buy flood insurance could further strain your budget.

These aren’t the only potential drawbacks of a Citizens home insurance policy. The company’s coverage choices tend to be more limited than what’s available on the private market. That means your lower premiums may come with skimpier coverage.

That said, Citizens may still be the best — or only — homeowners insurance option for many Floridians. Here’s what you need to know.

## Get home insurance quotes in minutes

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

* ### Why doesn't this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  Because Citizens is a government entity and insurer of last resort, it doesn't fit neatly into a rating scale designed for standard insurance companies.

### Where Citizens home insurance stands out

**Discounts for protecting your home from damage.** Citizens rewards homeowners who strengthen their homes against wind and other potential problems.

**Coverage for those who can’t find it elsewhere.** At a time when many Floridians have trouble finding insurance, Citizens provides a source of affordable coverage.

### Where Citizens home insurance falls short

**Coverage options.** Citizens has lower coverage caps and relatively few add-on options compared to most private insurers.

**Potential surcharges.** If a massive storm or series of catastrophes leaves Citizens without enough money to pay its claims, by law it must charge all policyholders an assessment to help restore its funds.

## What Citizens home insurance covers

These types of home insurance coverage generally come standard:

* ### Dwelling

  [Dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) pays to repair or rebuild the structure of your home after a covered event. It also covers attached structures, such as porches.

  **Typical amount**: Enough to rebuild your home.
* ### Other structures

  [Other structures coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/other-structures-coverage) pays to repair or rebuild stand-alone structures on your property, such as a fence or shed.

  **Typical amount**: 10% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal property

  [Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance) pays to repair or replace stolen or damaged belongings. Personal property coverage comes in one of two options: [actual cash value or replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

  **Typical amount:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Loss of use

  [Loss of use coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage), sometimes known as additional living expenses coverage, helps pay temporary living expenses while your home is being repaired. This can cover hotel stays, home rentals and meals.

  **Typical amount**: 20% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal liability

  [Personal liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-liability-insurance-homeowners) pays if you injure someone or cause property damage unintentionally or through neglect.

  **Typical amount**: $100,000 to $500,000.
* ### Medical payments

  [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners) pays to treat someone injured on your property, regardless of who’s at fault. It also pays if you, a family member or a pet injures someone away from your home.

  **Typical amount**: $1,000 to $5,000.

For more details, see [What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance)

The dwelling coverage limit for a Citizens policy must be less than $700,000 by law in most Florida counties. (The limit must be less than $1 million in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.) If your house would cost more than this amount to rebuild, you’ll likely need to seek insurance elsewhere.

Citizens has strict limits on other types of coverage, as well. For example, its policies come with $100,000 in personal liability coverage, with no option to select more. And unlike many insurance companies, Citizens doesn’t cover [dog bites](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-cover-dog-bites) or other animal liability claims.

While many homeowners policies cover your belongings anywhere in the world, Citizens won’t pay for the theft of items from any location other than your home.

Besides the standard types of coverage above, a Citizens policy may also include coverage for things like:

* Catastrophic ground cover collapse.
* Debris removal.
* Losses due to counterfeit money, forgery or the unauthorized use of credit cards.
* Upgrading your home to meet current building codes after a covered claim.
* Trees, shrubs and plants.
* Charges for the services of a fire department.
* Fungi, wet or dry rot, yeast or bacteria.

### Optional Citizens home insurance coverage

You may be able to add the following optional types of coverage to a Citizens policy:

**Sinkhole loss coverage**, which pays for damage from a broader range of scenarios than the catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage included in a standard policy.

[**Replacement cost coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) **for personal belongings**, which ensures that if your stuff is stolen or damaged, Citizens will pay enough for you to buy brand-new replacements. Without this coverage, your policy will cover your belongings for their [actual cash value](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value).

**Increased limits for** [**ordinance or law coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/ordinance-or-law-coverage), which pays to bring your home in line with the latest building codes after a covered claim.

### What's not covered

Citizens home insurance doesn't cover:

* Belongings stolen from anywhere other than your house.
* Liability claims related to your pets.
* [Extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost) for your home’s structure.
* Damage caused by flooding or earthquakes.
* Damage to carports or porches.
* Water backed up from sewers, drains or sump pump failure.

## More Nerdy Perspective

Most insurance companies offer certain coverage add-ons that aren’t available from Citizens. One example is [scheduled personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/scheduled-personal-property) for valuable items such as an engagement ring. Citizens’ coverage for jewelry is limited to $1,000, with no option to choose a higher amount. If you have expensive jewelry and Citizens is your only option for home insurance, consider buying separate [jewelry insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/jewelry-insurance).

## Where Citizens home insurance is available

Citizens homeowners insurance policies are available only in Florida.

## Flood insurance requirements for Citizens policyholders

Under a 2022 law, all Citizens policyholders whose policies include coverage for wind damage must buy separate [flood insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance). (A standard homeowners insurance policy doesn’t cover damage from scenarios like tidal surge or heavy rain.) The deadline for this requirement depends on where you live and the amount it would cost to rebuild your home.

If you live within a Special Flood Hazard Area as defined by the National Flood Insurance Program, you must buy flood insurance immediately (for new policies) or by the time of your next Citizens policy renewal.

If you don’t live in a Special Flood Hazard Area, you’ll need to have flood insurance if your dwelling coverage limit is $500,000 or more. Those with lower dwelling coverage limits must buy flood insurance by the following deadlines.

* **January 1, 2026:** Policies with dwelling coverage of $400,000 or more.
* **January 1, 2027:** All other policies.

## Discounts

Depending on where you live and the kind of home you have, you may be able to save on your Citizens homeowners insurance premium by:

* Installing a centrally monitored fire or burglar alarm.
* Protecting your home from wind damage with hurricane shutters, a hip roof or impact-resistant windows and doors.
* Insuring a relatively new home that’s compliant with recent Florida building codes.
* Having a roof with certain construction features.

To get these discounts, you may need to provide documentation or have your home inspected.

## Consumer satisfaction

One sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Citizens scores highly on this measure, drawing a very low proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

* ### What Reddit users say about Citizens home insurance

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics, including financial subjects like home insurance. We used artificial intelligence to browse Reddit forums for posts about insurers, then manually sifted through the results and summed up consumer sentiment about each company. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  Reddit comments about Citizens are mixed. Several posters note that they saved money by switching to Citizens, but some people worry that the company may not be financially stable if too many major storms hit Florida. In response, posters explain that if funds fall short, Citizens can charge assessments on its own policyholders and, if necessary, all policyholders across Florida.

  Other frequent topics of conversation include questions about the home inspections that Citizens performs from time to time and about what to do when Citizens asks you to make fixes to your home. Commenters share that they’ve been asked to do things like remove tree limbs or replace outdated pipes in order to keep their coverage.

## How to file a claim with Citizens

You can report a claim 24/7 by calling 866-411-2742 or logging in to your online account. Once filed, you can also track claims through your Citizens account.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

**Phone:** To contact Citizens, call 866-411-2742. Customer support is available on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.

**Email:** You can send a message to Citizens through the company's contact page.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is Citizens Insurance good?

As a last-resort insurer, Citizens serves a valuable purpose for people who can't find affordable home insurance. However, its coverage options are limited compared to what you’d find on the private market.

### Can Citizens Insurance drop me?

Yes. Citizens won’t renew your policy if inflation drives the replacement value of your home above the company’s maximum coverage levels ($700,000 in most counties and $1 million in Miami-Dade or Monroe County). Citizens will also not renew your policy if a private company offers you coverage at a rate less than 20% above your Citizens renewal premium.

### Does Citizens Insurance cover solar panels?

Maybe. You’ll need to contact an agent to check.

### Who owns Citizens Insurance?

Citizens Property Insurance is an entity of the Florida government. It was created by the state legislature as a not-for-profit insurer of last resort for the people of Florida.

### Why is Citizens sending me an offer of coverage from another insurance company?

Citizens is required by law to help policyholders find coverage in the private market through its “depopulation” program. If another company is willing to take over your policy, Citizens will notify you of the offer. You’ll need to respond by choosing the other policy or staying with Citizens. However, you won’t be eligible to stay if the price of the alternative coverage is within 20% of your Citizens premium.

### Why does Citizens want to inspect my property?

Like many insurance companies, Citizens occasionally inspects the homes it insures. These home surveys may involve examinations of both the inside and outside of your house. Citizens uses reports from these surveys to verify the condition of the insured properties. It may also share this information with private insurers looking to assume Citizens’ policies.

**Star rating methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts, claims process and website functionality. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or star ratings.

Here’s how we weighted each category to come up with our list of the best home insurance companies:

* Consumer experience (40%).
* Financial strength (30%).
* Coverage (25%).
* Discounts (5%).

Read our [full home insurance ratings methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-home-insurance) for more details.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
