7. [Methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/car-insurance/auto-insurance-trends-report/#methodology)
Overall — and there are some significant variations based on location, which we’ll dive into below — the average driver in the U.S. is paying $2,189. That’s a nearly [19% increase ](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/car-insurance/insurance-outlook-for-2024/)over the previous year. Over the past 10 years, there has been an overall increase of 78%!
###  Rising repair costs
As we know, car insurance pays for car repairs after an accident. When car repair costs rise, so do insurance costs. Average repair costs increased by 3.7% in the first half of 2024.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/car-insurance/auto-insurance-trends-report/#footnote-1)While this might not seem like a huge jump, it’s built on top of several more significant jumps (including an increase of 10% in 2022) from which the prices have never come down.[[2]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/car-insurance/auto-insurance-trends-report/#footnote-2)

Let’s take Florida as an example. Florida has the highest rates for insurance, which makes sense when you consider factors like severe weather threats, high incidence of car theft (Florida has the third highest rate in the nation), and high rates of uninsured drivers.[[3]](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/car-insurance/auto-insurance-trends-report/#footnote-3) These factors serve to make Florida a fairly high-risk state for insurers. Additionally, no-fault laws in Florida — which mean that each driver’s insurance pays for their expenses regardless of fault in the accident — have also led to higher insurance rates overall.
