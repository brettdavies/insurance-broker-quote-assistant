By Florida law, all drivers must carry at least $10,000 in PIP coverage with their auto insurance policies. Because the state follows no-fault laws, this part of auto insurance is meant to cover the costs of medical expenses if a person is injured in an accident. This is the case regardless of who is at fault for a car accident. However, if PIP coverage isn’t sufficient to fully cover a person’s medical expenses, they may be able to file a lawsuit directly against the at-fault driver.

## Types of PIP Coverage in Florida

Different types of PIP coverage exist in Florida. They include medical expenses, disability benefits, death benefits, essential services, funeral expenses and lost wages.

### Medical Expenses

Florida’s PIP insurance coverage pays for up to 80% of all medical expenses for individuals injured in a car accident. Anything related to the accident is covered up to $10,000. This includes medical bills, hospital bills, doctor’s visits, dental work, ambulance rides and anything else that’s relevant. PIP pays for medical expenses as long as the injured person receives treatment within 14 days of the accident.

### Disability Benefits

If a person is injured in a car accident to the point of disability and cannot work, their PIP insurance can cover up to 60% of their wages up to $10,000. Disability benefits are available to those who must miss work temporarily while recuperating from their injuries or who have sustained permanent injuries that prevent them from returning to work.

### Death Benefits

In Florida, PIP coverage also provides death benefits to the surviving family members of loved ones who die in a car accident. The cost covered is $5,000 for each person, but this doesn’t count toward the $10,000 limit for PIP coverage.

### Essential Services

Essential services are regular daily household necessities such as home cleaning, childcare and more. If a person suffers injuries serious enough that they cannot tend to these matters themselves, their Florida PIP insurance can cover the costs.

### Funeral Expenses

If a person is killed due to the injuries they sustained in a car accident, PIP coverage can pay for the funeral expenses. This relieves the family of some of the financial burden associated with their tragic loss.

### Lost Wages

PIP insurance coverage can pay the costs of lost wages after a person is injured and is unable to work. This coverage pays 60% of your total income during the time you are out of work.

## What Does Florida PIP Insurance Cover?

Florida PIP insurance covers 80% of all your medical expenses up to $10,000 if you were injured in a [car accident](https://www.andrewpickettlaw.com/car-accident-lawyers/) regardless of who was at fault. It also covers death benefits at $5,000, household and other important services, lost wages and funeral expenses.

## Benefits of PIP Coverage

There are certain benefits available with PIP coverage. They include medical bills and costs, funeral expenses, death benefits and other financial benefits.

### Medical Bills and Costs

If you suffer a personal injury in a car accident, regardless of whether you or another driver was at fault, you can receive coverage for your medical bills and ongoing necessary medical treatment from your PIP insurance. PIP covers such expenses at up to $10,000 per person per accident.

### Funeral Expenses

PIP insurance includes coverage for funeral expenses. If a person is killed in a car accident, regardless of who was at fault, their survivors can be relieved of some of the financial responsibility thanks to PIP coverage.

### Death Benefits

If a person dies after a car accident, PIP insurance can provide their surviving family members death benefits. This amounts to $5,000 per person killed per accident and is separate from the $10,000 PIP coverage limit.

### Other Financial Benefits

Other financial benefits PIP insurance provides are household services. This may include areas like housekeeping and childcare if you sustain car accident injuries that render you unable to take care of these tasks yourself.

## Eligibility for PIP Coverage in Florida

Certain criteria make people eligible for PIP coverage in Florida. Those are meeting driver’s liability insurance requirements and vehicle ownership requirements.

### Driver’s Liability Insurance Requirements

In order to be eligible for Florida PIP coverage, drivers must meet the state’s liability insurance requirements. This includes property damage liability (PDL) coverage of at least $10,000, which must be added as soon as a person registers their vehicle.

### Vehicle Ownership Requirements

When a person in Florida registers their vehicle, they must carry both PIP and PDL coverage. They must have at least $10,000 in coverage for both and must continue carrying PIP and PDL even if they aren’t driving their vehicle or the vehicle is inoperable.

## How to File a Claim for PIP Coverage in Florida

It’s important to know how to file a claim for PIP coverage in Florida. To do that, you should also have other information readily at hand, including what steps to take after an accident occurs, how to claim forms and documentation and how to receive PIP benefits.

### Steps to Take After an Accident Occurs

Regardless of who’s at fault, after a car accident, it’s important to take certain steps. First, you should get to a safe spot so that you’re no longer on the road in the path of traffic. Check yourself and your passengers, if you have any, for injuries.

Even if you feel fine, you should still seek medical attention within the same day of an accident. Doing so gives you a record of treatment that can be used as evidence in a car accident claim. You can also find out if you have sustained an injury and receive the treatment you need.

Call 911 and remain at the scene of the accident. Leaving can result in hit-and-run charges even if you were not at fault. When police arrive, make sure to ask where to obtain a copy of the accident report for your own records.

Exchange information with the other driver or drivers involved in the accident. Never admit fault or even apologize; it can be misconstrued and later used against you if another driver decides to file a lawsuit.

Look for witnesses and get their names and contact information. Ask to record their statements regarding the events of the accident. Take photos of the accident scene and jot down anything you recall from the accident. This information can be valuable evidence.

Contact your insurance company and inform an agent that you were in an accident. You don’t have to give specific details, but informing is enough to help when you plan on filing a claim with your insurer.

### Submitting Claim Forms and Documentation

When you submit a claim with your insurance company, you must include all evidence to show what happened. Your medical records and bills, photos of the accident, the police report and witness statements are all things to include as they can strengthen your claim. Your insurance company should have its own set of forms for you to complete. Once you have completed all the information and added your documentation, you can submit them.

### Receiving PIP Benefits

If you follow the proper procedures after submitting your claim, you should be able to receive your PIP benefits. You must see a doctor for medical care within 14 days of your car accident to be eligible for those benefits. If you fail to get medical care within that time, your claim may be denied.
