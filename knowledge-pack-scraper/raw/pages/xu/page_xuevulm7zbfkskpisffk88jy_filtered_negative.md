_I know you're focused on finding the cheapest car insurance in California. Those premium numbers are high, and saving money makes sense. California's $60,000 bodily injury limit per accident can disappear quickly with today's medical costs when multiple people are involved, and without comprehensive coverage, you're rolling the dice on car break-ins and weather damage. Minimum coverage gets you legal, but it might not cover you fully if things go wrong._
_The_ [_cheapest insurer_](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) _isn't necessarily the best car insurance for your needs. If you're considering full coverage, scroll down to see the cheapest options for full coverage in California._
