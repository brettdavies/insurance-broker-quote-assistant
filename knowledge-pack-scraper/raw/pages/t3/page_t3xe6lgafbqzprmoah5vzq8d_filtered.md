# State Farm agent claims “seepage” won’t be covered

[Home Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)

Hi y’all. Had a ton of rain over a couple days in the twin cities area of Minnesota and seems as if water is coming up through the basement floor.

We have a sump pump and drain tile. Agent claimed it probably won’t be covered. I have yet to have my claim reviewed yet but it’s in process.

Does my policy need to specifically say that “seepage” isn’t included in the policy?

Advice would be great thanks!
