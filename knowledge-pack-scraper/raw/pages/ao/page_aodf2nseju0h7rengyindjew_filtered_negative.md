3. What are the Laws on Commercial Property Damage in Texas?

To avoid this, commercial property owners should take the time to review their insurance policies thoroughly. Consulting with experienced legal counsel during this process can be helpful, as insurance coverage lawyers can give valuable insight into a policy and note any gaps in coverage that may make a claim difficult. While it may be time-consuming, it can cause fewer headaches in the long run when property damage does happen and will likely help the property owner have a successful claims process.
Immediately after damage occurs at a commercial property, one of the key requirements outlined in an insurance policy is for property owners to take reasonable steps to protect it from further damage. This does not mean the insured should begin [repairing the property](https://www.raiznerlaw.com/blog/before-repairing-property-damage-file-an-insurance-claim/). Rather, the property owner should make arrangements to ensure the property doesn’t sustain additional damage while the claim is being investigated. For instance, if a commercial property’s roof was damaged due to a hurricane, hailstorm, or tornado and then was left exposed to the elements causing further damage to the interior of the property, the insurance provider may flat-out deny the claim altogether. Installing tarps where needed and blocking off damaged areas from non-damaged areas can help contain existing damage and prevent further damage.
Timely notice by the policyholder is often a requirement in many commercial policies. Just as insurers are required by the Texas Insurance Code to abide by strict time limits during the processing of a claim, policyholders are expected to notify their insurer of damage within a reasonable amount of time as well. While Texas allows for up to two years for a property damage claim to be filed, it is in the best interest of the policyholder to notify their insurer as soon as possible. Failing to report the claim within a reasonable timeframe could result in the insurer denying coverage.
