A variety of different factors affect how much you’ll pay for car insurance, including your driving record, age and gender, and location. Insurers also consider things like your vehicle’s age, condition, and safety features, as well as whether it’s been in an accident. In many states, insurers also consider your credit history when determining rates.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-2)
Your coverage level will also play a big role in how much you pay. Every state except New Hampshire requires liability car insurance, so you’ll need to meet your [**state’s minimum requirements**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/). This covers bodily injury and property damage, but you’ll likely want to purchase [**full-coverage car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) to protect yourself and your vehicle more thoroughly.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-3)
Check out the table below to see the [**cheapest car insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) for both coverage levels.

Full-coverage car insurance costs have increased by 15% since the start of 2024, according to [**Insurify’s latest report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/). Insurify’s data science team projects rates to increase by a total of 22% over the year. These dramatic increases are largely due to record losses ($33.1 billion) that insurers suffered in 2022.
Finding the [**best car insurance company**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/) for you and your needs is easier said than done. Use this checklist when starting your search:[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-4)
1. **Figure out what coverage you need.** Think about how you use your car, how often you drive, if you’re in traffic frequently, and how much coverage you can afford. Consider if other family members will use the car, especially if you have any [**teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) or young drivers.
Fortunately, you can find numerous ways to save money on your car insurance policy. Take a look at this list to get started:[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-5)
Start by driving safely and keeping a [**clean driving record**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/). Good drivers get the cheapest rates of any group on the road, as insurers have little reason to be concerned about potential claims from them.
Most insurance companies offer discounts for bundling multiple insurance policies with them. Consider combining your [**auto and home**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) or renters insurance with one company.
Just about every auto insurance company offers multiple [**discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/). Ask your insurance agent which discounts are available and which you qualify for. You can end up saving quite a bit.
If you can afford to pay a [**higher deductible**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/high-deductible/) out of pocket, you could save on your premium. The higher your deductible is, the lower your premium will be.
