At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.

Why we picked this company
GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.
Pros
  * Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
  * No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
  * Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

Why we picked this company
The fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer by market share, Allstate is available in all 50 states. The company has been in business for more than 90 years and also sells home, renters, and condo policies — so it’s a good option for those who want to save by bundling auto with another type of policy. Allstate also offers helpful optional auto coverages, like gap insurance and accident forgiveness. AM Best gives the company a high rating for financial strength, but Allstate has a higher-than-average number of complaints in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Consumer Complaint Index.
Pros
  * Ample opportunities for bundling discount
  * Offers a pay-per-mile option
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * Low customer satisfaction
  * Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
  * Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study

## 10 top regional insurers
Regional car insurance companies serve drivers in only a select number of states — not nationwide. But they’re still good choices for many people.
Since regional insurers serve fewer customers than national insurers, they’re often more available for customer service. Local insurance companies may also have more expertise on your area and on which risk factors and local laws will affect your car insurance rates. And importantly, regional insurers can often offer more affordable rates than large ones.
Here’s a closer look at 10 of the top regional insurers in the country.

Insurance Experience
Reviewed in Nevada on October 2025
It's good insurance, but I'm over 55, own my vehicle, and have been with them for many years, yet my policy has never gone down. It just steadily rises. I even drive less than 20 miles a day. It seems like you pay and pay and pay, and I never get anything out of it. Like with most insurance companies, you may never use it, and you've paid all this money. It's frustrating paying for something you don't get anything out of.

Getting too pricey
Reviewed in Illinois on October 2025
The experience has been good; the exception is the constant percentage increases. They are pricing me out of their services because I can purchase comparable coverage for less (and we are “bundled” with autos, home, and liability). I believe I will be changing my auto insurance as I find comparable coverage for $230/6 months for less.

Awesome and they don't raise my premium for something that wasn't my fault, and they don't have a big turnover in sales reps in their office. You also get to deal with the main agent, unlike State Farm in Toronto, Ohio.

The website is not so easy to navigate. There isn’t a way to contact the customer service team directly, and it looks like they are deliberately trying to make it difficult for the customer to get in touch with a real human who can assist them. However, if you miss one day in paying the bill, they are quick to send out a letter to cancel your policy. Their response to that is rapid fire!

## Cheapest car insurance companies
A variety of different factors affect how much you’ll pay for car insurance, including your driving record, age and gender, and location. Insurers also consider things like your vehicle’s age, condition, and safety features, as well as whether it’s been in an accident. In many states, insurers also consider your credit history when determining rates.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-2)
Your coverage level will also play a big role in how much you pay. Every state except New Hampshire requires liability car insurance, so you’ll need to meet your [**state’s minimum requirements**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/). This covers bodily injury and property damage, but you’ll likely want to purchase [**full-coverage car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) to protect yourself and your vehicle more thoroughly.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-3)
Check out the table below to see the [**cheapest car insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) for both coverage levels.

## How much does car insurance cost?
Full-coverage car insurance costs have increased by 15% since the start of 2024, according to [**Insurify’s latest report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/). Insurify’s data science team projects rates to increase by a total of 22% over the year. These dramatic increases are largely due to record losses ($33.1 billion) that insurers suffered in 2022.
In 2023, insurer losses were cut in half to $17 billion but were still large enough to cause rate increases. The increasing costs of vehicle repairs and new cars are the main causes of these record losses.
Another factor is the increase in severe weather events, which leads to increased claims in affected areas. The cost of insuring cars keeps rising, so insurers continue to raise rates to account for it. As of now, the average full-coverage car insurance premium in the U.S. is $177 per month, or $2,126 per year.
## How to choose the best car insurance company
Finding the [**best car insurance company**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/) for you and your needs is easier said than done. Use this checklist when starting your search:[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/#cite-4)
  1. **Figure out what coverage you need.** Think about how you use your car, how often you drive, if you’re in traffic frequently, and how much coverage you can afford. Consider if other family members will use the car, especially if you have any [**teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) or young drivers.
  2. **Research car insurance companies in your area to get an idea of what’s available.** Ask friends and family about their car insurance companies and whether they’re satisfied with them. It’s also a good idea to look up what additional coverages and services each offers in case you need to expand your coverage.
  3. **Compare quotes.** This is the most important step. Make sure you compare car insurance quotes from all the companies you’re considering. Every insurer determines rates differently, so it’s important to know which one fits your unique driving profile best.
  4. **Check customer reviews, ratings, and financial stability.** It’s important to have an insurance company that will be easy to work with if you need to file a claim. Look for a company with a strong AM Best financial strength rating, a large network of customer service agents, and a good mobile app.
  5. **Pick the best policy.** Don’t just choose the policy with the lowest rates. Choose a company that combines affordable rates, reliable customer service, and the insurance coverage you need. You should review your car insurance policy and company each year to see if any other companies better suit your needs.

#### Drive safely 
Start by driving safely and keeping a [**clean driving record**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/). Good drivers get the cheapest rates of any group on the road, as insurers have little reason to be concerned about potential claims from them.

#### Bundle policies
Most insurance companies offer discounts for bundling multiple insurance policies with them. Consider combining your [**auto and home**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) or renters insurance with one company.

#### Take advantage of discounts
Just about every auto insurance company offers multiple [**discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/). Ask your insurance agent which discounts are available and which you qualify for. You can end up saving quite a bit.

#### Increase your deductible
If you can afford to pay a [**higher deductible**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/high-deductible/) out of pocket, you could save on your premium. The higher your deductible is, the lower your premium will be.
