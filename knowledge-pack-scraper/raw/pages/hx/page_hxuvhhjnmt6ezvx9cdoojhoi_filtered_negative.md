* What Is Medical Payments Coverage?
![A female doctor checks in with a patient’s family member in the waiting room.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/what-is-medical-payments-coverage.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_Medical Payments Coverage (MPC), often called Med Pay, is an optional coverage that can be added to auto insurance policies to help cover medical expenses for you and your passengers after a car accident, regardless of who was at fault. Med Pay helps provide protection against emergency medical costs and can help fill gaps left by health insurance deductibles or limits. This coverage applies to you, your family members and passengers in your vehicle._
If you’re shopping for car insurance or reviewing your current policy, you’ve probably heard the term “Medical Payments Coverage” or “Med Pay.” But what is [Medical Payments Coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/medical-payments-coverage)? Med Pay is an optional part of car insurance that helps pay for medical bills for you and your passengers after a car crash, no matter who was at fault. Med Pay is not available in every state. State Farm® offers Medical Payments Coverage only where permitted by state law. In some states, a similar type of coverage called Personal Injury Protection (PIP) is required instead. Unlike [liability coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage) (which pays for damage and injuries you cause to others), Med Pay focuses on you and the people in your car. In most states, Med Pay isn’t required by law, but it’s easy to add to your policy if offered in your state.
