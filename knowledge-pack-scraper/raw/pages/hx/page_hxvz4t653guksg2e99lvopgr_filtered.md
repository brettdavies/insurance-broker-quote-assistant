State Farm, the nation’s largest auto and home insurer, announced last week that it will enter the Massachusetts market — breaking into a field dominated by local and regional insurers.

State Farm, headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, filed an [intent](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/statefarm-to-enter-massachusetts/) to enter the Massachusetts Marketplace with plans to begin availability in early 2027.

The insurance company currently offers a limited portfolio of auto and life products to existing customers who move to the state.

As of Sept. 2, State Farm says it has about 22,000 personal auto and about 10,000 homeowners policies in the state.

“We see tremendous opportunity to meet customer needs and serve more customers in more ways,” a company spokesperson told Boston.com. “So, we have begun filings in the state and are in the early stages of this process.”

State Farm, known for its “[Jake From State Farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFBG3OYL9nM)” ads, reports having more than 19,400 agents and 67,000 employees serving over 91 million policies and accounts, including auto, fire, life, renters, boats and motorcycles.

According to the 2023 [Annual Home Insurance Report](https://www.mass.gov/doc/the-2023-massachusetts-market-for-home-insurance/download#:~:text=multiple%20peril%20line%20of%20business%20writings%20by%20company%20group.&text=Type%20of%20Coverage*-,*Policies%20reflect%20reported%20house%2Dyears.,the%20term%20of%20the%20policy.&text=Most%20of%20the%20coverage%20in,coverage%20primarily%20in%20the%20Northeast.&text=*Based%20on%20total%20premium%20collected,written%20and%20not%20house%2Dyears.&text=of%20business%20by-,company%20group.,licensed%20insurer%20writing%20home%20insurance.&text=in%20the%20Commonwealth%20to%20be,coverage%20in%20the%20voluntary%20market.&text=another%20state%20(or%20country).,on%20the%20surplus%20lines%20market.), the latest data available, most coverage in the state is provided by regional companies primarily in the Northeast.

Mapfre Insurance Group, the parent company of Commece Insurance Company, has the largest share of the 2023 market, with 12.5% of the home insurance premiums. Liberty Mutual Group came next at 6.5%, followed by Andover Group at 6.5%, and Travelers Group at 6.4%.
