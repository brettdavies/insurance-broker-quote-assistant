# What Every Florida Homeowner Needs to Know About Sinkholes

![Sinkholes in florida - property damage](https://kpattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sinkholes-in-florida-scaled.jpeg)
Sinkholes are a common occurrence in the Sunshine State and are a major problem for many Florida homeowners. When sinkholes form underneath buildings, they’re likely to cause severe damage and sometimes even personal tragedy.
Although insurance companies are supposed to cover damages related to sinkholes if you have the appropriate coverage, it’s not uncommon for insurance adjusters to deny these claims, chalking up the losses to something the owner did or an excluded peril instead of legitimate catastrophic collapse or sinkhole damage.
If your insurance company is denying you compensation for necessary home repairs and sinkhole stabilization, it may be time to reach out to a skilled property damage lawyer who can help you recover a fair settlement.
## **What Is a Sinkhole?**
A sinkhole is a depression or pit in the landscape that is bowl-shaped with steep rocky sides. A deep sinkhole can even be home to a small lake.
Sinkhole sizes are far from standardized. Some are small and cause no significant damage, while others are big and capable of swallowing up buildings, swimming pools, roads and vehicles.
In Florida, the constant threat of sinkholes is due to fact that the state is built on a bedrock of limestone. Rain gradually dissolves the rock, causing rainwater to be become acidic. As the acidic rainwater seeps through the soil, it causes the terrain to become riddled with cavities. When these cavities become too big, the ground above them collapses, resulting in sinkholes.
## **Where In Florida Are Sinkholes Common?**
Sinkholes can form and cause damage anywhere in the Sunshine State, but they’re most prevalent in west Central Florida’s Hernando, Pasco and Hillsborough Counties. The three counties are colloquially known as Sinkhole Alley—the worst sinkhole area in the entire state. Additionally, Jacksonville has experienced sinkhole incidents, such as the large washout that blocked traffic along I-95 in Duval County in September 2024.
Other counties highly prone to sinkholes include:
  * Marion County
  * Citrus County
  * Polk County
  * Orange County
  * Seminole County
  * Lake County


## **Common Signs of Sinkhole Activity**
No matter where you are in Florida, your home or business may be at risk of damage from sinkhole activity. If you notice one or more of the following signs, reach out to a geologist or geotechnical engineer who can determine what’s causing the damage and offer solutions:
  * Cracks in foundation
  * Cracks in your home’s siding
  * Cracks in ceiling
  * Cracks in concrete
  * Circular street depressions
  * Wilting plants
  * Sinking fences
  * Neighbors affected by sinkholes
  * Loss of water in your swimming pool
  * Sloping floors


## **Does My Homeowners Insurance Cover Sinkhole Damage in Florida?**
Despite the rising number of sinkholes, sinkhole coverage in Florida is somewhat scarce. Most homeowners insurance policies exclude sinkhole coverage. Keep in mind, insurance carriers are for-profit companies, meaning their ultimate goal is to make money. To avoid the property damage costs associated with the rise in sinkhole activity and resulting insurance claims, most insurance companies have ceased to include sinkhole coverage in their standard policy.
Although your standard homeowners policy may include coverage for a catastrophic collapse of your home, it’s often only applicable if the building becomes uninhabitable. Damage the insurance company considers minor or aesthetic may not qualify.
Many insurance companies offer sinkhole coverage for an additional cost, but even then, adjusters may look for reasons to deny your claim. For example, the insurance adjuster may try to attribute the damage to something else or claim the building hasn’t sustained enough structural damage to be considered a sinkhole loss.
### **How an Experienced Florida Sinkhole Lawyer Can Help Your Case**
A sinkhole can cause significant damage to your Florida home or business. If you’ve been diligently paying your insurance premiums for years or decades but are now faced with a sinkhole claim denial, you’re likely feeling frustrated and discouraged about the outcome.
Don’t let your insurance company’s sinkhole claim denial keep you from getting the compensation you deserve. Consider working with a skilled and aggressive property damage attorney who can protect your rights and help you reverse the denied claim and fight to maximize your payout.
A property damage lawyer skilled in handling sinkhole claims can conduct their own investigation of the incident, ensure proper testing was performed by the insurance company and negotiate a fair settlement on your behalf.
