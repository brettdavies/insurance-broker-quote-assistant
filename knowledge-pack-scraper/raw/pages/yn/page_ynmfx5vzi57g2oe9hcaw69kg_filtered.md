# Geico renters insurance

Hello quick question. I have geico renters insurance for the home we are renting from my father. The house has fallen into disrepair and has become unsafe in my eyes. Multiple roof leaks, soft spots in floors etc. he will not turn it into his homeowners insurance and wants me to fix it. I said no.

My issue is I don’t have the $3600 for first/last and security deposit ($1200 each). I see the loss of use line but it doesn’t say what it covers. We want out and to relocate to a different place but I’d rather not sue my dad kinda thing.

Does geico renters insurance cover something like this?

If it matters I carry a $60k policy for many years with no claims.
