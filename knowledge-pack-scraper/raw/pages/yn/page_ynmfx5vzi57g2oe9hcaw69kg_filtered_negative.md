this would not be a covered loss with any company i’m aware of. you can confirm this by looking at the “perils” listed on your full policy. they are almost all sudden events like tornadoes and hailstorms, not lack of maintenance

You'd need a covered loss to trigger loss of use, which you apparently don't have.
