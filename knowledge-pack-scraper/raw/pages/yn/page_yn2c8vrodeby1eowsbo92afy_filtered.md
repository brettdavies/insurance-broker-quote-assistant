Installing a home security system doesn’t just protect your home; it can also help you save money on your homeowners or renters’ insurance policy. While most people install security systems for safety and peace of mind, the added financial benefit of insurance discounts can be a welcome bonus, potentially even making the system pay for itself. Here’s everything you need to know about how much you can save and how to get the maximum discount.

## **How Insurance Companies Calculate Discounts**

Insurance providers calculate your premium based on risk. Properties with a lower likelihood of burglary, fire, or water damage typically cost less to insure. A security system, especially one that includes monitoring, environmental sensors, and automation, reduces those risks.

### **Key Devices Insurers Consider:**

* **Security Systems**: Deter theft and reduce the frequency of claims.
* **Smoke and CO detectors**: Help prevent serious fire or gas-related damage.
* **Water leak sensors**: Reduce flood damage claims.
* **Professional monitoring**: Offers faster emergency response, lowering loss potential.

## **Typical Savings by System Type**

Discounts vary depending on your insurer and the features your system includes. Here’s a general breakdown:

* **Basic, unmonitored alarm**: 5–10% discount
* **Monitored security system**: 10–15% discount
* **Comprehensive system (with environmental sensors + monitoring)**: Up to 20%+ discount

If your security system includes 24/7 monitoring, smoke/fire detection, and is professionally installed or certified, you’ll typically qualify for the highest discount tier.

## **What Documentation You’ll Need To Provide**

To qualify for a discount, insurers usually require:

* Proof of installation (invoice or certificate)
* Monitoring service agreement (if applicable)
* Feature list showing protection types (fire, burglary, environmental)

If you’re using a DIY system like [Abode](https://goabode.com/), most insurers will accept a PDF certificate showing activation and coverage. Any respectable system should have an easy way to get a certificate proving coverage.

## **Factors That Affect Your Discount**

### **1. Your Insurance Provider**

Each company offers different rates and discount thresholds. State Farm, Allstate, USAA, and Liberty Mutual all offer home security incentives, but the exact percentage varies.

### **2. Your Location and Primary Risk Factors**

Homes in high-crime areas may benefit more from security-related discounts. On the other hand, homes in flood-prone zones may get deeper discounts from water leak detection.

### **3. System Quality & Integration**

Monitored DIY systems (like Abode) with smart home automation and environmental monitoring are often eligible for higher discounts than basic door alarms.

## **Long-Term Financial Benefits**

A monitored, self-installed security system may cost $200–$600 upfront, with ongoing monitoring fees ranging from $10 to $30/month. However, annual insurance discounts of $50–$150 or more can offset this cost, essentially making your system pay for itself over time.

And that doesn’t include the potential cost avoidance from avoiding a major incident. A single break-in can cost thousands. Fires or floods? Even more. A small monthly fee could save you from a massive loss (not to mention headache).

## **Tips to Maximize Your Insurance Savings**

* Ask your insurer what features are required for the maximum discount.
* Choose a system with burglary, fire, and water leak detection.
* Opt into a monitoring plan.
* Provide updated documentation annually to maintain your discount.
* Compare insurers—some reward security-conscious homeowners more than others.

## **Why This Matters for DIY Home Security Users**

DIY security systems aren’t just for renters or tech enthusiasts—they’re smart financial tools, too. With professional-grade monitoring, integrations like Apple HomeKit, and smart sensors, systems like Abode qualify for meaningful insurance savings without expensive installation or long-term contracts.
