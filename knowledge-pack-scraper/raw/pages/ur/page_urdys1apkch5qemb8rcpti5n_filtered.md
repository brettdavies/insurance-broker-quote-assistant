* **Is minimum coverage enough?** A minimum coverage insurance policy gives you enough insurance to legally drive and avoid penalties such as [getting your vehicle registration suspended](/auto-insurance/california/vehicle-registration-suspension "Vehicle Registration Suspension in California"), but it

 How to Pay Less than $100 for California Car Insurance](#california-savings) 

### How to get California car insurance for less than $100

1. **Use a [cheap insurance company like Geico Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California](#full-coverage "Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California")  to lower your rates to $124 per month.** In California, a good driver who chooses Geico saves 26% off the state average of $168 per month.

   $105 per month.** All companies offer some ways to save, and [Geico's discounts](/geico-insurance-review#auto-discounts "Geico Auto Insurance Discounts") include savings for your car's safety features, a welcome discount and a good driver discount.
3. **[Bundle your insurance policies](/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles") to lower your rate to about 
   $95 per month.** This brings your car insurance rate to less than $100 per month, without changing your coverage.
4. **Only [increase your deductible](/how-do-deductibles-affect-car-insurance-premiums "How Do Deductibles Affect Car Insurance Premiums?") if you have plenty of savings.** You could save about $18 per month with a higher deductible, but you'll have higher expenses if you file a claim.
5. **Check if there are coverage options that you don't need.** Some insurance companies automatically add extras like [roadside assistance](/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") or [rental car coverage](/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?"), which you may not need.

6. **Consider a [usage-based insurance program](/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") if your insurance is still more than you can afford.** If you have high rates, usage-based insurance can help you show your insurance company that you're a safe driver.

* Minimum coverage car insurance quotes meet California's [minimum legal requirements Minimum car insurance requirements in California](#min-reqs "Minimum car insurance requirements in California") .
* Full coverage goes beyond [minimum coverage](/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheapest Liability-Only Car Insurance") to include comprehensive and collision insurance. This protects your own car from damage after a crash, theft, vandalism or storm, regardless of whose fault it is.

**If you live in one of California's expensive ZIP codes and have savings or investments, you should raise your liability insurance limits.** You should also consider adding [umbrella coverage](/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?") for extra financial protection.

On the other hand, if you're a college student with an older car who doesn't drive often, you may not need the same level of protection.
