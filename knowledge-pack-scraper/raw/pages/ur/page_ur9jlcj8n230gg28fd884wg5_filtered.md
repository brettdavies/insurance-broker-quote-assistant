## What Is Considered an Old Roof?

To a certain extent, **what counts as an “old” roof depends on who you ask.** For example, you may have heard that insurance companies won’t insure a roof that’s been around for more than 20 years. While this isn’t exactly true, it’s not far off.

You’re probably aware of [Florida’s homeowners insurance crisis](https://pitchroofing.com/roofing/how-your-roof-could-save-you-from-the-homeowners-insurance-crisis/ "Florida Homeowners Insurance"). As a result of the crisis, homeowners insurance providers are picky about what homes they will and won’t ensure. And **most insurers are indeed hesitant to insurance a roof that’s 20 years old**; in some cases, a 15-year-old roof might even be a risk that many insurers aren’t willing to take.

But it’s not quite true that you can’t insure a 20-year-old roof. While insurance companies see these roofs as old, **you can usually still qualify for coverage if you get a roof inspection.** As long as a licensed contractor can inspect your roof and not find any immediate problems, then your roof probably isn’t “too old” to insure.

That said, many 20-year-old roofs will have reached the natural end of their lives. But when trying to figure out what is considered an old roof, it’s important to remember that **your roofing material has a big impact on how long your roof will last.** That’s why we’re going to take a look at what counts as “old” for [Florida’s favorite roofing materials](https://www.cloudroofing.com/blog/what-roofing-material-lasts-longest "Roofing Material Lifespans")!

## Lifespan of Roofing Materials in Florida

When determining if a roof is too old or not, insurers have very different requirements for different materials. Often, these requirements fall well short of the actual natural life of your roof. To take a look at this discrepancy, let’s first cover how long a roof lasts in Florida:

* **Architectural shingles**: 20–25 years
* **Concrete roofing tiles**: 50 years
* **Clay roofing tiles**: 50–100+ years
* **Standing seam metal roofs**: 50–70 years
* **Corrugated metal roofs**: 40–50 years
* **Modified bitumen flat roofs**: 15–20 years
* **TPO flat roofs**: 20–30 years

When looking at what is considered an old roof, it’s important to keep all these differences in mind. As we can see, a 20-year-old shingle roof is fairly old, whereas a 20-year-old metal roof is just getting started.

However, **insurance companies don’t look at these materials the same way that roofers do.** By the standards of most insurers, a shingle roof is old at 20 years old, as are most flat roofs. On the other hand, materials like tile and metal are considered old after 50 years.

So when determining if a roof is old, it’s important to look at both of these numbers. For example, we know that a 15-year-old shingle roof is somewhat old, but still has years of life left and can most likely be insured. On the other hand, a 50-year-old concrete tile roof will be harder to insure.

**Even if your roof is considered old, though, it may still be possible to get insurance.** Remember those roofing inspections we mentioned earlier? If your roofing inspection comes back saying that your roof has at least 3 years of life left, you will probably be able to qualify for [Citizens Insurance](https://www.citizensfla.com/-/content-policies-and-statutes "Citizens Insurance"). However, once a roof gets near the end of its lifespan, Citizens will probably be your only option.

## FAQs About Older Roofs in Florida

[![FAQs About Older Roofs in Florida](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "FAQs About Older Roofs in Florida")![FAQs About Older Roofs in Florida](https://i0.wp.com/pitchroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FAQs-About-Older-Roofs-in-Florida.webp?resize=1200%2C513&ssl=1 "FAQs About Older Roofs in Florida")](https://i0.wp.com/pitchroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FAQs-About-Older-Roofs-in-Florida.jpg?ssl=1)

**1. Q: Should I buy a home with an old roof in Florida?**

**A:** Using the information above, you should have a good idea of when a roof is “old.” But ultimately, determining whether or not a roof is “too old” for you to buy a home depends on you. If you’re comfortable having a Citizens policy and potentially having to replace your roof within the next few years, then there’s no reason not to buy a home with an older roof. On the other hand, if you want to have as many insurance options as possible, then you’ll want a roof that’s at least 5 years away from being considered old by insurance companies.

**2. Q: Should I get a roof replacement before selling my home?**

**A:** If your roof is near the end of its life, getting a new roof installed can make your home much more appealing to potential buyers. On the other hand, [roof replacements](https://pitchroofing.com/services/roof-replacement/ "Residential Roof Replacement") are a big investment. Ultimately the right choice depends on your needs, but replacing your roof could be a good idea if your shingle roof is 20+ years old and you need your home to sell quickly.

**3. Q: Is it bad to have a home insurance policy with Citizens?**

**A:** Citizens is an excellent insurance option. In fact, because of the homeowners insurance crisis, it’s currently Florida’s largest insurer. However, it is not always the cheapest option. As a result, many homeowners prefer to have other options rather than being stuck with the insurer of last resort.

**4. Q: Can I repair an old roof to help my home sell?**

**A:** If your roof is currently experiencing leaks or has other signs of roofing damage, then yes, fixing those issues can make your home more appealing to buyers. However, there is no way to “fix” a roof being considered old. So if your problem is only your roof’s age, a roof replacement is the only real solution.

**5. Q: Can I get insurance to replace my old roof before I sell my home?**

**A:** Check your policy for the specifics of what your insurance will and won’t cover. But generally speaking, most insurers will only replace a roof if it has been damaged during a storm or other natural event. That means that your roof being too old is not usually enough to get insurance to pay for a roof replacement.
