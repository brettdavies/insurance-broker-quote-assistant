# Nevada homeowners insurance

Despite being mostly desert, Nevada is one of the most mountainous states in the country, with peaks soaring to 13,000 feet. It's also the driest state, with high temperatures and windstorms being common. Due to the state's mixed terrain, weather and climate can be both varied and extreme. Winter storms and thunderstorms are common in Northern Nevada, while the southern part of the state can experience extreme heat and windstorms. Whichever part of Nevada you call home, protect your property and assets with affordable homeowners insurance coverage from Progressive.

## How you're covered

A typical policy in Nevada may include the following [homeowners insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/):

* **Dwelling Coverage (Coverage A)** protects your home's structure (roof, walls, etc.) as well as attached structures, like a porch.
* **Other Structures Coverage (Coverage B)** protects detached structures, such as a fence, shed, or detached garage.
* **Personal Property Coverage (Coverage C)** protects your personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics. Certain items, like jewelry, art, and collectibles, are often only covered up to a specific limit so you may want to purchase an endorsement to schedule these items on your policy at the coverage amount needed, also known as "adding a rider."
* **Loss of Use Coverage (Coverage D)** may help cover costs associated with an increase in living expenses, up to your policy's limit, if you're unable to stay in your home while it's being repaired or rebuilt due to a covered loss.
* **Personal Liability Coverage (Coverage E)** protects you financially if you're legally responsible for another person's injuries or damage to their property.
* **Medical Payments to Others (Coverage F)** may pay for medical expenses due to a covered occurrence.

Keep in mind coverage under your policy is subject to exclusions and conditions within your policy. It is important to read your policy to understand the coverage provided.

Did you know?

Wind damage continually ranks as the most common cause of property damage, [according to the Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance). Nevadans can protect both their property and their assets from windstorm damage with homeowners insurance coverage.

### More ways to stay covered in Nevada

In some cases, you can buy extra protection by adding coverage to your homeowners policy or purchasing a separate standalone policy for specific perils and hazards not typically covered on a standard homeowners policy. If available, Nevadans may want to consider:

* **Flood**: Flooding is not typically covered under a homeowners policy. If you're concerned about flooding in your area, a [private flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) or [NFIP](https://www.progressive.com/answers/private-flood-insurance-vs-nfip/), where available, may help protect your property and belongings against flood damage.
* **Umbrella**: An [umbrella policy](https://www.progressive.com/umbrella-insurance/), where available, may help protect your assets if you exceed the personal liability coverage on your homeowners policy.
* **Sump pump**: Sewage back-up or sump pump overflows aren't typically one of the standard coverages automatically included with homeowners insurance. Adding [water back-up coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-water-backup-coverage/) as on optional coverage, if available, may help in the event of sewage back-up or sump pump overflow due to heavy storms.
