* **Is minimum coverage enough?** A minimum coverage insurance policy gives you enough insurance to legally drive and avoid penalties such as [getting your vehicle registration suspended](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/vehicle-registration-suspension "Vehicle Registration Suspension in California"), but it  usually isn't enough to protect you after a bad accident. So it's often worth it to increase your coverage if you can afford it.

**In addition, teens should get full coverage if they drive a lot or have a newer car.** The added protection of [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") is especially useful if you're worried about how to replace your car if you cause an accident and it's totaled.
**USAA is a good option for drivers with military ties. ** At $157 per month, full coverage from USAA is $37 per month less than Geico.
---|---
**Full coverage car insurance in California costs $73 more per month after a speeding ticket.** That's a 43% increase. You'll typically [pay more for car insurance after a speeding ticket](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost "Speeding Ticket Car Insurance Cost") because insurance companies believe you're more likely to cause an accident in the future.

* * *
**Geico also has the cheapest quotes for most teens who have had an accident, at $179 per month for minimum coverage.** Plus, Geico offers [accident forgiveness](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness-what-it-and-who-offers-it "How Does Accident Forgiveness Work?").

[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto/california-car-insurance-savings-d_e7suwo) How to Pay Less than $100 for California Car Insurance ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-california#california-savings)
1. **Use a[cheap insurance company like Geico Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-california#full-coverage "Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California") to lower your rates to $124 per month.** In California, a good driver who chooses Geico saves 26% off the state average of $168 per month.
2. **Car insurance discounts can lower your rates to about $105 per month. ** All companies offer some ways to save, and [Geico's discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review#auto-discounts "Geico Auto Insurance Discounts") include savings for your car's safety features, a welcome discount and a good driver discount.
3. **[Bundle your insurance policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles") to lower your rate to about  $95 per month. ** This brings your car insurance rate to less than $100 per month, without changing your coverage.
4. **Only[increase your deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-do-deductibles-affect-car-insurance-premiums "How Do Deductibles Affect Car Insurance Premiums?") if you have plenty of savings.** You could save about $18 per month with a higher deductible, but you'll have higher expenses if you file a claim.
5. **Check if there are coverage options that you don't need.** Some insurance companies automatically add extras like [roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") or [rental car coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?"), which you may not need. For example, you might not need rental car coverage if you have another way to get around after an accident, and removing it could save you about $4 per month.
6. **Consider a[usage-based insurance program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") if your insurance is still more than you can afford.** If you have high rates, usage-based insurance can help you show your insurance company that you're a safe driver. But watch out for any programs that could increase your rates based on how you drive.
