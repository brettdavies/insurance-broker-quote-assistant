# StateFarm: Worried about being dropped if I submit a claim for replacing roof

I have StateFarm for both Auto and Home. Each of the past two years, 2022 and 2023, we have submitted a claim due to water damage inside the home, though each for completely different issues. After the previous claim, the person working on our claim "suggested to not have any more for a while".

However, we recently had a hail and wind storm that damaged the shingles of our ~12 year old roof and blew a few of them away. At this point we generally lose about 15 shingles per year during storms which we've had put back.

My worry is that submitting a claim for a new roof just as a few of our neighbors have done will potentially cause State Farm to drop us. Is our worry valid? Happy to get yall's advice as how to navigate this.
