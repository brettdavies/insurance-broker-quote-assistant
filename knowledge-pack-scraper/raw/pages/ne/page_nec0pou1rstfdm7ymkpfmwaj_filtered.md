* Ask your neighbors who insures their properties
* Ask your broker to try to find you more comprehensive coverages
* Do not rely on just one source for insurance information

* Consider purchasing a supplemental policy to cover types of losses we don’t, such as flood, earthquake or a Difference in Conditions policy
* Work with your broker ensure you have purchased appropriate coverage
* Review your coverages with your broker

## Need additional coverage?

For more complete property coverage, consider purchasing the Difference in Conditions, Flood or Earthquake policies which supplement the FAIR Plan policy by covering most perils that we don’t cover. The FAIR Plan does not offer these coverages. Contact your broker for more information about them.

## Getting started

To discuss your insurance needs, please contact a licensed broker. Brokers may be able to offer you additional insurance options that provide more comprehensive coverage than the FAIR Plan. Additionally, you may wish to contact more than one broker to see whether they can offer you coverage through other insurers. Not all brokers are registered to work with the FAIR Plan.
