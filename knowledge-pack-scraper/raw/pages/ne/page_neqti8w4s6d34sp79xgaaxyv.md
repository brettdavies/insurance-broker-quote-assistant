## What is a homeowners insurance premium?
A home insurance premium is the amount of money a homeowner pays for insurance coverage for a specified amount of time, called the policy term. Generally, a homeowners insurance policy only remains active so long as the associated home insurance premium is paid.
Most [home insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) offer flexible payment options, with the ability to pay premiums monthly, quarterly or annually. If you have a mortgage, your lender will often pay your homeowners insurance premium through your [escrow account](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/escrow-home-insurance/) as part of your monthly mortgage payment. Your lender then pays the premium annually to your insurer.
## How are home insurance premiums calculated?
When you purchase a new home insurance policy, the insurance company will review [various rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/) to determine your premium. Some are personal to you, such as your claims history. In states that allow it, [credit history](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-credit-score-affect-home-insurance/) may also be used. Other rating factors are related to your home like the ZIP code, the year it was built, the square footage, its general condition and its proximity to a fire station, to name a few.
Ultimately, some homes and homeowners are riskier to insure than others. For example, it is less risky for the insurance company to cover a newer home or a homeowner with a good [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/). It’s more risky to insure a home in poor condition or a homeowner with poor credit. The more risk you and your home carry, the higher your premium will likely be.
Each home insurance company also has a unique underwriting algorithm, which is why you'll see rates differ across different providers even for the same coverage types and limits. One company may be okay with a somewhat older roof, but another may see it as a larger risk and charge you more to insure it.

## How much is the average homeowners insurance premium?
Based on September 2025 data from Quadrant Information Services, the [average annual cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) in the U.S. is $2,408 for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. However, the price of home insurance varies based on a number of factors. As mentioned, you might pay more or less than the national average based on details specific to you and your home.
One of the biggest factors that impacts your premium is where you live. The cost of home insurance varies by state. In general, homeowners who live in states with a high risk of severe weather or communities with high levels of burglary and vandalism typically pay the most for home insurance.

## What is the difference between a homeowners insurance premium and a quote?
A [quote](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) is how much a home insurer estimates you’ll pay based on the information you provide during the inquiry process. A premium is the final amount that the policy will cost.
When you shop for homeowners insurance, you’ll usually provide basic information to a home insurance company about your property, the [types of coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) you'd like and the amount of coverage you need. For instance, you might specify whether you need coverage for a pool or expensive personal property like art or jewelry. You’ll need to provide your address too, since location greatly affects how much you pay for insurance. Depending on the insurance provider, you might have to answer specific questions about the home’s structure, such as the age and condition of your roof, as well.
In return, the company will generate a homeowners insurance quote. The quote typically details what coverage your potential policy would provide and up to what dollar amount (called a policy limit). The quote should also show how much you would be expected to pay in order to keep the policy active — this is your premium. 
Keep in mind that your quoted premium could change as the insurance provider finalizes your policy and verifies information.

## Reasons your homeowners insurance premium can change
At times, you might need to make coverage changes to your insurance policy that impact the premium. Other times, the insurance company might make a rate or coverage adjustment. Either way, it is common for homeowners insurance premiums to change each renewal period. Whether your premium increases or decreases depends on the specifics.
While many factors can impact the cost of home insurance, one of the most common reasons for a premium increase is due to inflation protection. Also known as “inflation guard,” insurance companies increase the level of coverage on your insurance policy each year to account for the rising cost of building materials and labor costs associated with repairing your home. Without adjusting for inflation, policyholders could be [underinsured](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/minimum-coverage-risks/), especially if you experience a total loss and the home needs to be completely rebuilt.
It is important to note that insurers must file a justifiable request and receive approval for broad rate increases with the Department of Insurance in each state where they operate.
### Homeowners insurance premium increases
Factors that could cause an increase in your homeowners insurance premium are:
  * Your insurer has filed for an average rate increase in your state.
  * You [renovated your home](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-and-renovations/).
  * You purchased new high-value items like fine jewelry.
  * You filed claims.
  * Crime rates increased in your ZIP code.
  * Your home is located somewhere where severe weather events and other natural disasters are becoming more common or causing more damage.
  * Your coverage limits increased to keep in line with replacement costs.
  * You extend your coverage limits for personal property or other items or add new endorsements to your policy.


### Homeowners insurance premium decreases
Applying [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) is one of the best ways to decrease your homeowners insurance premium. A [home and auto bundle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) is often the largest discount on offer. Depending on the insurer, you might also earn a discount for adding safety devices like burglar alarms or smart home features. Improvements, such as adding a new roof or updating your electrical system, may also make you eligible for a discount.
Another way to lower your homeowners insurance premium is to increase your [policy’s deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/). However, a higher deductible means a higher out-of-pocket expense if you file a claim, so you may want to think through this adjustment carefully.
Lowering your coverage limits can also reduce how much you pay for home insurance, but this should be done with caution, too. Reducing your limits could leave you open to financial strain if you need to file a claim. Examples of when it might make sense include if you filled in a swimming pool and could potentially lower your liability insurance limit, or if you sold an expensive ring and no longer need as much [scheduled personal property coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/scheduled-personal-property/). Experts recommend speaking with a licensed insurance agent for guidance.
## How to pay your homeowners insurance premium
When it comes to paying your home insurance premium, you have a few options:
  * Pay your insurance through your escrow account.
  * Pay your insurance directly to the insurance company.


### Escrow account payments
One way is to pay the premium through your mortgage lender. With this option, your lender will add the cost of your insurance premium to your monthly mortgage payment and keep it in an escrow account along with funds for your property taxes. With each payment, the lender sets aside a portion of the money that goes directly to your insurance company. Depending on your lender and loan type, this may be required.
### Direct to insurance company payments
The other option is to pay the insurance company directly, which works like any other bill. Depending on the insurer, you may be able to charge your premium to a credit card, mail in a check or set up an electronic funds transfer (EFT) from a checking or savings account, which is a direct deposit to the insurer. With direct premium payments, you can usually choose to pay annually, bi-annually, quarterly or monthly. Some companies offer discounts if you sign up for automatic payments using your bank’s routing and account number as opposed to a credit or debit card.
Keep in mind that some installment plans have service fees in addition to the monthly premium. Paying for your entire policy term (typically a year) in full may mean you can avoid service fees. Further, many insurance companies will give homeowners a discount if they pay the annual premium upfront.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the average home insurance premium?
Caret Down Icon
The average home insurance premium in the U.S. is $2,408 per year or $201 per month for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. However, you might pay more or less than the average premium depending on a number of factors. Your ZIP code, insurance-based credit score (in most states) and claims history can all affect your rate, as well as the size, age and condition of your home.
  * ###  Are there other home insurance costs besides the premium?
Caret Down Icon
Your premium is the amount of money you pay to keep your policy in force. But if you have to [file a claim](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/filing-a-claim/) for damage to your home or personal property, you are also required to pay a deductible. A deductible is the amount of damage you agree to cover out of pocket for repairs after a claimable incident. The remaining damage will be covered by your insurance company up to the policy limits if a claim is approved.
You can choose a deductible when you buy home insurance, which usually ranges from $500 to $2,500 or even higher. It could also be a percentage of the [dwelling coverage amount](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage/). In states along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, as well as in Washington, D.C., your home policy will contain a separate deductible for windstorm coverage for named tropical cyclones. Also called a [hurricane deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/hurricane-damage/), this is typically set at 1 to 5 percent of your dwelling coverage.
  * ###  How do I get a homeowners insurance quote?
Caret Down Icon
Insurance professionals recommend that you get a minimum of three quotes to compare prices and coverage. When shopping for home insurance, it is easy to get quotes from different property insurers, but make sure to request identical coverage limits and deductible amounts (or as close as possible) to ensure you are making a fair comparison. 
Many insurers have an online quote tool that will help [calculate your estimate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-calculator/) based on the information you submit. Numerous consumer comparison sites also allow you to obtain quotes from multiple insurers. A local agent or [insurance broker](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-broker/) could help you obtain quotes and other information about home insurers, too.
  * ###  Can I pay for my auto insurance and my home insurance premiums together?
Caret Down Icon
Auto and home policies usually have separate billing account numbers. While many insurance companies offer car and home insurance bundles, they might be unable to combine the account numbers to allow one payment to apply to multiple policies. However, you can usually view the billing account information for all your insurance policies under the same login. Home and auto policies issued together have a better chance of sharing an account number if the insurance company has the capability. For any account questions, you might check with your insurance agent for assistance.
  * ######  What is the cheapest home insurance company?
Caret Down Icon
There's not a single cheapest home insurance company since insurance is such a personalized product. The cheapest company for you might not be the cheapest for your friends or neighbors, since insurers weigh unique factors like your home's condition, your claims history, location and more. To help you select the cheapest coverage, you might request home insurance quotes from several providers and find out what discounts you're eligible for. For instance, you might be eligible for a discount if you bundle home insurance with your auto insurance, or you may earn a discount for being a member of a specific organization. To help you compare quotes, try to select the same coverage types and limits for each quote you submit.
