## Policies
Our insurance policies are tailored to provide Californians with basic fire coverage when this coverage is not available from a traditional carrier. Work with a broker to find a policy that fits your needs.

## Protect yourself
People often discover after they suffer a loss that they have not purchased enough insurance or the right kind of insurance coverage. It is your responsibility to accurately assess your insurance needs to protect you in case of an insured loss - and a licensed broker can help.
#### Annual insurance checklist
  * Shop around for coverage with other insurers
  * Ask your neighbors who insures their properties
  * Ask your broker to try to find you more comprehensive coverages
  * Do not rely on just one source for insurance information
  * Read your policy
  * Consider purchasing a supplemental policy to cover types of losses we don’t, such as flood, earthquake or a Difference in Conditions policy
  * Work with your broker ensure you have purchased appropriate coverage
  * Review your coverages with your broker

## Need additional coverage?
For more complete property coverage, consider purchasing the Difference in Conditions, Flood or Earthquake policies which supplement the FAIR Plan policy by covering most perils that we don’t cover. The FAIR Plan does not offer these coverages. Contact your broker for more information about them.

## Getting started
To discuss your insurance needs, please contact a licensed broker. Brokers may be able to offer you additional insurance options that provide more comprehensive coverage than the FAIR Plan. Additionally, you may wish to contact more than one broker to see whether they can offer you coverage through other insurers. Not all brokers are registered to work with the FAIR Plan.

The FAIR Plan is an insurer of last resort, established by statute to provide basic property insurance to Californians statewide when no other option is reasonably available.
