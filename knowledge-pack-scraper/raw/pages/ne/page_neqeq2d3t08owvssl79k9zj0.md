#  StateFarm: Worried about being dropped if I submit a claim for replacing roof 
I have StateFarm for both Auto and Home. Each of the past two years, 2022 and 2023, we have submitted a claim due to water damage inside the home, though each for completely different issues. After the previous claim, the person working on our claim "suggested to not have any more for a while". 
However, we recently had a hail and wind storm that damaged the shingles of our ~12 year old roof and blew a few of them away. At this point we generally lose about 15 shingles per year during storms which we've had put back. 
My worry is that submitting a claim for a new roof just as a few of our neighbors have done will potentially cause State Farm to drop us. Is our worry valid? Happy to get yall's advice as how to navigate this.

You're losing 15 shingles a year? That sounds like an installation issue to me. 
I worked at the Farm. Some people would get dropped after one claim. Others were still policyholders with 10+ claims. No one would be able to give you a definitive answer.

My guess is State Farm will drop you. Three claims in three years is a lot. Further, interior water claims are the kiss of death for insurance companies. Those get rated the hardest in my experience. 
You also need to worry about not being able to obtain insurance in the future assuming the policy is non renewed. Most insurance companies guidelines won’t allow a policy to be written with that history. Plus the cost will skyrocket for the carrier that can insure you. 
I’d look hard at replacing the roof yourself, and then submitting proof of the new roof to obtain a discount moving forward.

Our water claim ended up being $250k including a new roof. Surprisingly they didn’t cancel us after that. That’s the type of claim you actually file.

2 is generally the threshold that an insurer will tolerate. Some will to 3 most will not. You're likely going to end up on the secondary market as a result.

Bummer, but thanks for the clear answer. In general do you know long we should wait until submitting another claim (2 years? 5 years?). 
I don’t expect to submit another one but I said that after the first one also. Just can never be for sure and wish I knew before the first claim that there was a “threshold” of two claims before we’d be at risk of being dropped. Otherwise we’d have done the first out of pocket since we knew the roof would need to be done at some point. We’ve renovated damn near everything at this point but it’s also a 60 year old house so… 
The joys of home ownership!

The killer isn't the roof, it's the two water claims. A lot of carriers will turn you down for even one, and nearly all will for two water claims. You're lucky they're still insuring you.

By your road admission your roof is basically coming apart, year by year, and you think that insurance is going to step up to the plate, and buy you a new roof? 
Those are delusions you're having. 
Most people go their entire lives without making a single home insurance claim, so I'm pretty sure that three is going to make you uninsurable...

In this market home insurance is to cover a catastrophic loss where there is no other option but to submit a claim. 
A few shingles blowing off your roof each year is when you call a local roofer to fix it and pay out of pocket.

It sounds like your roof is failing, insurance isn't a maintenance policy go buy a new roof. If you decide you still want to file a claim... you shouldn't but w/e you may want to confirm your roof has RCV & not ACV (replacement cost and not actual cost value). If it's ACV you're roof will be the cost minus depreciation and the payout will only be a small portion of the cost of replacing your roof. Most carriers view roofs 15-20 years old as in need of replacement. Your roofer will say it's a 30 year roof but they mean 30 years protection from mfg defects. Factors like hail, sun, wind etc accelerate the aging process and shorten the life span.

You'll almost certainly get dropped if you file another claim, I'm actually kinda surprised they didn't drop you after the second water claim in two years. 
Is replacing the roof yourself at all feasible? Like another commenter said, it's probably not going to be possible to find you replacement coverage if you get dropped. Three claims in three years are a lot regardless but those water claims especially are gonna make your life very difficult.

I work the other side basically, the side trying to help you to file a claim to do the work. 
I would recommend not filing this claim, especially if you’re concerned about your monthly premiums and you like being with State Farm. State Farm is inexpensive, most of the big carriers can’t touch them when it comes to premiums. 
I’ve been trying to get both of my parents to leave State Farm for half a decade now, every single time we quote through any other carrier, it’s almost double what State Farm wants to charge. 
We train all project manager’s/salesmen to direct homeowners away from filing State Farm claims if they have filed one previously within the last five years or so. The second claim doesn’t usually create concern for being dropped, but the third one definitely does. 
If you file the roof claim and then you have a fire or a flood, something most people have zero control over, your insurance costs will skyrocket once State Farm drops you. Any benefit you receive from that roof claim will be lost from the 3 to 5 years of crazy premiums you’ll be paying moving forward. 
I saw it a few times as I was coming up through this industry. The homeowners are usually devastated when they figure it out. Then comes the blame game. This is why we train everyone to be as honest as possible about what will actually happen after the claim is filed.

Yes, don't do it. 3 claims in a 5 year period can make you uninsurable. You are lucky you haven't gotten dropped with 2 water claims in a 5 year period.

If 15 shingles are coming off the roof every year, the roof is most likely more than 12 years old and it should be replaced unless you like playing wack-a-mole. I get that $25k doesn’t grow on trees but it is the home owners responsibility to maintain their home. We recently replaced our roof out of pocket and I am an ins adjuster. Get 5 or 6 estimates from good companies and go with the one that provides the most detail on what they will replace. The one we chose doesn’t work with insurance. Our estimates ranged from $26k - $75k. Your SF agent may have a few roofers they can recommend.
