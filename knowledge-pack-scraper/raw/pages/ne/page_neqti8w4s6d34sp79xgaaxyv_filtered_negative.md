Most [home insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) offer flexible payment options, with the ability to pay premiums monthly, quarterly or annually. If you have a mortgage, your lender will often pay your homeowners insurance premium through your [escrow account](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/escrow-home-insurance/) as part of your monthly mortgage payment. Your lender then pays the premium annually to your insurer.
When you purchase a new home insurance policy, the insurance company will review [various rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/) to determine your premium. Some are personal to you, such as your claims history. In states that allow it, [credit history](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-credit-score-affect-home-insurance/) may also be used. Other rating factors are related to your home like the ZIP code, the year it was built, the square footage, its general condition and its proximity to a fire station, to name a few.
Ultimately, some homes and homeowners are riskier to insure than others. For example, it is less risky for the insurance company to cover a newer home or a homeowner with a good [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/). It’s more risky to insure a home in poor condition or a homeowner with poor credit. The more risk you and your home carry, the higher your premium will likely be.

A [quote](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) is how much a home insurer estimates you’ll pay based on the information you provide during the inquiry process. A premium is the final amount that the policy will cost.
When you shop for homeowners insurance, you’ll usually provide basic information to a home insurance company about your property, the [types of coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) you'd like and the amount of coverage you need. For instance, you might specify whether you need coverage for a pool or expensive personal property like art or jewelry. You’ll need to provide your address too, since location greatly affects how much you pay for insurance. Depending on the insurance provider, you might have to answer specific questions about the home’s structure, such as the age and condition of your roof, as well.

While many factors can impact the cost of home insurance, one of the most common reasons for a premium increase is due to inflation protection. Also known as “inflation guard,” insurance companies increase the level of coverage on your insurance policy each year to account for the rising cost of building materials and labor costs associated with repairing your home. Without adjusting for inflation, policyholders could be [underinsured](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/minimum-coverage-risks/), especially if you experience a total loss and the home needs to be completely rebuilt.
* You [renovated your home](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-and-renovations/).
Applying [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) is one of the best ways to decrease your homeowners insurance premium. A [home and auto bundle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) is often the largest discount on offer. Depending on the insurer, you might also earn a discount for adding safety devices like burglar alarms or smart home features. Improvements, such as adding a new roof or updating your electrical system, may also make you eligible for a discount.
Another way to lower your homeowners insurance premium is to increase your [policy’s deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/). However, a higher deductible means a higher out-of-pocket expense if you file a claim, so you may want to think through this adjustment carefully.
Lowering your coverage limits can also reduce how much you pay for home insurance, but this should be done with caution, too. Reducing your limits could leave you open to financial strain if you need to file a claim. Examples of when it might make sense include if you filled in a swimming pool and could potentially lower your liability insurance limit, or if you sold an expensive ring and no longer need as much [scheduled personal property coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/scheduled-personal-property/). Experts recommend speaking with a licensed insurance agent for guidance.
* ###  What is the average home insurance premium?
* ###  Are there other home insurance costs besides the premium?
Your premium is the amount of money you pay to keep your policy in force. But if you have to [file a claim](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/filing-a-claim/) for damage to your home or personal property, you are also required to pay a deductible. A deductible is the amount of damage you agree to cover out of pocket for repairs after a claimable incident. The remaining damage will be covered by your insurance company up to the policy limits if a claim is approved.
You can choose a deductible when you buy home insurance, which usually ranges from $500 to $2,500 or even higher. It could also be a percentage of the [dwelling coverage amount](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage/). In states along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, as well as in Washington, D.C., your home policy will contain a separate deductible for windstorm coverage for named tropical cyclones. Also called a [hurricane deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/hurricane-damage/), this is typically set at 1 to 5 percent of your dwelling coverage.
* ###  How do I get a homeowners insurance quote?
Many insurers have an online quote tool that will help [calculate your estimate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-calculator/) based on the information you submit. Numerous consumer comparison sites also allow you to obtain quotes from multiple insurers. A local agent or [insurance broker](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-broker/) could help you obtain quotes and other information about home insurers, too.
