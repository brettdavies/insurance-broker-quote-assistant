[Homeowners insurance](https://www.proinsgrp.com/essential-homeowner-insurance-tips-for-illinois-residents/) is your first line of defense against property damage and loss. In Illinois, homeowners can buy standard property coverage and liability protection or explore the many add-ons and endorsements available, such as additional coverage for flood damage and valuable items.
Additional endorsements include earthquake, flood, mobile home, and [tenant insurance](https://www.proinsgrp.com/does-landlord-insurance-cover-tenant-property-damage/). While none of these is required by state law for non-mortgage lenders, all Illinois homeowners should review their lender’s policy requirements and consider protecting themselves.

In the absence of specific state regulations, [Illinois homeowners](https://www.proinsgrp.com/illinois-homeowner-insurance-navigating-policies-coverage-and-claims/) should shop between providers to find a plan that balances good coverage with an acceptable deductible, noting that plans with lower deductibles will have higher premiums. The best plan for you depends on the coverage you hope to achieve.
When building codes, zoning laws, or other local regulations change, Illinois homeowners may need ordinance or law coverage, also known as “[building code upgrade](https://claimsmate.com/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-building-code-insurance/#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20building%20code,additional%20costs%20out%20of%20pocket.)” coverage. Standard [Illinois home insurance](https://www.proinsgrp.com/personal/home-insurance/illinois/) usually pays to restore damaged property to its original state, which could conflict with new building codes.
While Illinois homeowners need separate coverage for tornados, floods, and earthquakes, additional building code coverage helps them recover from the damage without paying for reconstruction _and_ renovation.
Illinois is an increasingly difficult insurance market, but you don’t have to figure it out on your own. [Contact Pro Insurance Group](https://www.proinsgrp.com/contact/) today for [personalized solutions](https://www.proinsgrp.com/request-a-quote/) to homeowners insurance.
