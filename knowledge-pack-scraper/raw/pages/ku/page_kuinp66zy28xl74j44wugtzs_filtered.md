NEW YORK (November 18, 2024) – Today, professional women’s basketball league Unrivaled announced a multiyear sponsorship with State Farm, signing the company as the league’s exclusive home and auto insurance sponsor, as well as the presenting sponsor for Unrivaled’s highly anticipated club selection announcement, set to release on November 20, 2024.

State Farm will have a visible presence across Unrivaled properties, including the league’s official digital assets and throughout all regular season and postseason games, which will be produced and hosted at the league’s state-of-the-art facility in Miami, Florida.

“The popularity of women’s basketball continues to explode,” said Kristyn Cook, Chief Agency, Sales and Marketing Officer at State Farm. “Sponsoring Unrivaled is another opportunity for State Farm to deepen our long-standing investments in women’s sports. We want to be part of bringing awareness and excitement to this new league, and in doing so help grow the game for athletes and fans alike.”

State Farm has put an intentional focus on women’s sports for decades, and this sponsorship is just the latest effort in the brand’s twenty-year history of investing in women’s sports. Unrivaled athletes Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum and Arike Ogunbowale have all been featured in past State Farm commercials, further emphasizing the shared commitment of celebrating and elevating women in the game.

“We’re excited to team up with State Farm ahead of our inaugural season this January and look forward to working with them to continue elevating the women’s basketball ecosystem,” said Unrivaled President Alex Bazzell. “Bringing on State Farm as an official sponsor further highlights the league’s dedication to building an unparalleled roster of players, staff and partners.”
