* Insurance Questions to Ask Your Agent
![Insurance agent smiles while sitting at her desk by a computer.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/insurance-questions-to-ask-your-agent.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
It's totally understandable to think that insurance is a "set it, forget it" kind of a thing — especially when lots of competing priorities try to snatch up time. But a regular check-in with your agent can be great to discuss any big changes that may have occurred (a promotion with a boost in income that should be matched by a boost in life insurance, for example). If you don't have time for an in-person meeting, check in with your agent by contacting them utilizing a [mobile app](https://www.statefarm.com/customer-care/download-mobile-apps) or through email.
Many insurers provide [ID cards](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/electronic-proof-of-insurance), coverage limits and [deductibles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) through their mobile app. And a deductible could be one thing to talk about with your agent. You can change your deductibles from year to year based on any number of factors, from the size of your [emergency fund](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/build-an-emergency-fund) (which you can use to cover the cost) to potential changes in insurance costs. (That's another reason to set up that regular meeting or contact your agent. If you like a traditional in-person approach, we have a [PDF](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/pdf/V-insurance-questions-checklist.pdf) that can help with the discussion.)
When you choose to bundle[footnote 1](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/insurance-questions-to-ask-your-agent#footnote-1) products together, such as homeowner’s and auto policies, you may receive a [discount](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts). There may also be additional discounts offered when you are a [safe driver](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save). Ask your agent about available discounts.
Understanding [how filing a claim works](https://www.statefarm.com/claims) could be a necessary piece of understanding your policy. Documentation of the damage, for example photos of damage on a car, is an important starting point for many claims. Your insurance agent can help you with the claims process and filing online may be a convenient option as well.
When you meet with your agent, talk to them about what you can be doing to be proactive against loss — everything from [tire maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care) to [cleaning your gutters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/stepbystep-guide-to-gutter-cleaning).
And if you're in-between agent visits, we've got another source: [Simple Insights](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights). Every month, there's more and more content on a range of topics, from [setting up a budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/breakdown-down-a-budget) to [seasonal home maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/maintenance), starting an [emergency fund](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/build-an-emergency-fund) and prepping for [retirement](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/retirement). And if you want to do even more to be a better driver, check out the [mobile apps](https://www.statefarm.com/customer-care/download-mobile-apps). For example, [Drive Safe & Save®](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) may help you improve your road skills (and earn possible discounts).[footnote 2](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/insurance-questions-to-ask-your-agent#footnote-2)
Life happens and sometimes it is necessary to make changes to your insurance policy to accommodate things like a difference in your budget, a [move](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/moving-dont-forget-to-make-insurance-changes-too), [expanding your family](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-moments/adding-a-child) or [buying a house.](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/steps-to-buy-a-house) Your agent can help guide you through policy changes and discuss coverage options.
An umbrella policy is another term for a [personal liability umbrella policy](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) (PLUP). Discuss with your agent whether you need more coverage than what your existing policies cover and whether a PLUP is the answer.
Not all auto policies provide the same coverage. Your policy may include [collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-collision-coverage), [comprehensive coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/importance-of-comprehensive-coverage), [liability coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage), [uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-uninsured-and-underinsured-motorist-coverage), [medical payments coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-first-party-medical-and-pip-coverage) or other coverages fitting to your auto coverage needs. Your agent can help you navigate what your policy currently includes and what other [coverage options](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need) you may choose that are right for you.
The first thing to remember [after an accident](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident) is to make sure you and your passengers are safe and call the police. Cooperate by providing the other party with your insurance information and obtain theirs. Your Insurance ID Card has valuable information to share with the other parties and your agent’s phone number to report the accident.
Your policy provides coverage for your personal property, but that coverage is usually limited to only certain causes of loss. Some types of property also have special dollar limits like jewelry which means you may not have enough coverage to replace your property. A [personal articles policy](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/personal-articles-policy) offers broader protection for your treasured items, like [collectibles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-appraise-and-insure-collectibles), with higher coverage limits available.
Even if you never buy a different vehicle or live in the same house for decades, [life insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/life) may be reason enough to schedule that meeting with your agent. A one-on-one conversation lets you consider those deeper questions about insurance that helps [provide for loved ones](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/reasons-to-buy-life-insurance) if the insured passes away.
[Life insurance needs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/how-much-life-insurance-do-i-need) may change depending on your family situation. For instance, the age of your children, the amount of time left on your mortgage and your retirement investment strategy may all play a role in how much life insurance you really need.
Meet with your State Farm agent and use the [insurance meeting essentials ](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/pdf/V-insurance-questions-checklist.pdf)form to record the basics.
