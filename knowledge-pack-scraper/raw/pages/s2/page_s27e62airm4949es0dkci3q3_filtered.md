## Statement on Contingent (Profit) Commission

In order for us to maintain strong relationships with quality insurers, we work with each to provide the type of business they desire. The insurers with an asterisk (\*) noted above recognize our efforts through a Contingent Commission contract. Payment of this Contingent Commission may depend on a combination of growth, profitability (loss ratio), volume, retention and increased services that we provide on behalf of the Insurer. Contingent Commission is not guaranteed. For detailed information on Contingent Commission, please go to the individual company’s website.
