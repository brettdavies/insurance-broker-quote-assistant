State Farm homeowners insurance provides coverage for unforeseen or accidental damages, including fire or smoke damage, hail damage, wind damage, and frozen pipes. While policies vary, State Farm has introduced new endorsements for special policy limits on water damage from plumbing leaks, ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. However, State Farm, like other insurance companies, aims to minimise claim payouts, and there are several reasons why they may deny water damage claims, including mould or microbial growth, repeated leakage, failure to maintain, and wear and tear.

## **State Farm's Special Limit for Water Damage endorsement**

While this endorsement offers reduced premiums, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks. Most plumbing leaks require repairs that exceed the lower limit of coverage provided by the endorsement. As a result, customers may find themselves underinsured in the event of a plumbing leak.

State Farm has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding this endorsement. There is concern that customers may not fully understand the implications of selecting this option, as the potential risks may not be adequately explained. It is advised that customers carefully review their policies and consider the likelihood of water damage before opting for this endorsement.

Homeowner's insurance policies from State Farm typically cover water damage from abrupt leaks, frozen pipes, sewer or drain backups (with an endorsement), and ice dams. However, it is important to note that water damage due to floods, surface water, and subsurface water is generally not covered. Additionally, mold damage is often excluded or limited in coverage.

## **State Farm's denial of water damage claims**

State Farm, the largest insurance company in the US, regularly rejects water damage claims. In fact, denied water damage claims are a common complaint among policyholders. State Farm has a team of adjusters, lawyers, and experts who will look for reasons to deny a claim or reduce its value.

State Farm denies water damage claims due to missing or unclear details. When State Farm denies a claim, the company may point to specific provisions as a reason for the denial. Each insurance policy has a list of what it does and does not cover, but it may not always be clear what kind of damage falls into these categories. For example, State Farm may not automatically include natural disasters like hurricanes in insurance policies. This coverage may be part of an additional policy that needs to be purchased separately. State Farm's policy has also been criticised for excluding coverage for continuous water leaks that occur "over a period of time", without specifying the duration of this period.

If State Farm denies a water damage claim, policyholders can take several steps. Firstly, gather as much evidence as possible, such as photos, videos, receipts, invoices, repair estimates, and expert opinions. Document everything related to the water damage incident and your communication with State Farm. Secondly, write a letter to State Farm explaining why you disagree with their denial and why you believe your claim is valid. Include all the evidence and documentation that supports your claim. Be polite, professional, and persuasive in your letter. Thirdly, if State Farm still denies your claim or offers a low settlement, consider hiring a lawyer to represent you. A lawyer can help negotiate with State Farm, file a complaint with the state insurance department, or take them to court if necessary.

It is important to note that State Farm homeowners insurance typically does not provide coverage for damages due to a lack of maintenance or wear and tear. For example, if a roof has been deteriorating over the years and starts to leak, the repair would likely not be covered. Homeowners insurance is intended for unforeseen or accidental damages rather than typical household maintenance. Policyholders can contact their local State Farm agent for information on Home Systems Protection, which may offer insurance protection for certain perils typically not covered by a homeowners policy.

## **Homeowners insurance and plumbing leaks**

Homeowners insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your home and personal property in the case of unforeseen or accidental damages. While policies vary, a typical homeowners policy can provide insurance protection for the physical dwelling structure, other structures attached to it, and personal property. Homeowners insurance is not used for typical household maintenance, but rather for unforeseen or accidental damages.

State Farm homeowners insurance covers losses caused by water abruptly leaking from a pipe inside the home, frozen/burst pipes, water backing up through a sewer or drain (with an endorsement), and water damage to your home caused by ice dams. However, State Farm does not cover damage that results from normal wear and tear, ageing, deterioration, or corrosion. Additionally, there is an exclusion for water damage from a plumbing system, shower, shower pan, or HVAC system that occurs over a period of time.

State Farm introduced new endorsements in 2021, titled "Special Limit for Water Damage," which provide special policy limits between $5,000 and $25,000 for water damage from plumbing leaks, including hot water heaters, air conditioners, and sprinkler systems. These endorsements are optional and will only be added to a policy upon customer request. While these endorsements have been approved by many states, State Farm has been criticized for failing to address how insured individuals could determine if this endorsement is a good idea.

If you experience a plumbing leak, it is important to review your State Farm policy carefully to understand what is covered and what is excluded. Gather evidence, such as photos, videos, receipts, and repair estimates, to support your claim. Remember that State Farm, like any other insurance company, aims to minimize claim payouts, so they may look for reasons to deny your claim or reduce its value. Consider contacting a lawyer if you need help navigating the claim process or appealing a denial.

## **State Farm's coverage for frozen pipes**

State Farm homeowners insurance covers losses caused by water leaking from a pipe inside the home, including frozen and burst pipes, as long as reasonable care was taken to maintain heat in the home. This is because frozen pipes can cause water damage and the need for plumbing repairs. For example, in 2021, State Farm paid more than $472 million in damages to policyholders just from frozen pipe claims. From August 2022 to August 2023, State Farm paid out over $806 million for over 32,000 claims from frozen pipe and water damage, with claims averaging $25,000.

To prevent frozen pipes, State Farm recommends leaving cabinet doors open to allow for airflow to keep pipes warm and opening a faucet to allow a slow drip, keeping warmer water flowing through the pipes. If your water pipes have already frozen, you can try to thaw them with a hairdryer, but be cautious and do not use an open flame as it could cause a fire hazard. If your pipes have burst, turn off the water at the main shutoff valve and make sure everyone in your family knows where the valve is and how to open and close it.

## **State Farm's coverage for leaking roofs**

State Farm homeowners insurance provides coverage for specific incidents, including windstorms, hail, fire, and lightning. It also covers losses caused by water leaking from a pipe inside the home, frozen/burst pipes, and water backing up through a sewer or drain.

Regarding leaking roofs, State Farm insurance may cover leaks caused by wind or hail damage. For example, if wind or hail causes an opening in the roof, allowing water to enter, this would likely be covered. Additionally, State Farm offers guidance on detecting and addressing roof leaks, recommending regular inspections of roof shingles to identify missing or damaged areas. They emphasize the importance of early leak detection to prevent interior damage and create a safe environment.

However, it's important to note that State Farm homeowners insurance typically does not cover damages resulting from a lack of maintenance, wear and tear, rot, deterioration, or improper installation/repairs. If a roof has been deteriorating over time and starts to leak, the repair would likely not be covered. Instead, insurance is intended for unforeseen or accidental damages.

State Farm also provides resources for filing roof claims. They recommend reporting claims as soon as possible and offer assistance in differentiating between normal wear and aging versus damage caused by events like hailstorms. Policyholders can utilize the Contractor Locator page to find Network Service Providers for roofing repairs, although State Farm does not guarantee the performance of these contractors.

While State Farm offers guidance and resources, it is always recommended to refer to your specific policy and consult with your State Farm agent to determine the coverage applicable to your situation.

Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover plumbing leaks?

State Farm homeowners insurance covers sudden or accidental water damage, including water leaking from a pipe inside the home, frozen/burst pipes, and water backing up through a sewer or drain. However, there is an exclusion for water damage from a plumbing system that occurs over a period of time.

What is considered a sudden or accidental water damage event?

A sudden or accidental water damage event is typically when water abruptly leaks from a pipe inside the home or when a frozen/burst pipe causes water damage.

What is the Special Limit for Water Damage endorsement?

The Special Limit for Water Damage endorsement provides policyholders with the option to select coverage limits between $5,000 and $25,000 for water damage from plumbing leaks. This endorsement is optional and will only be added to a policy upon request.

Why would someone choose a lower limit for water damage coverage?

A policyholder may choose a lower limit for water damage coverage if they feel they do not need the full amount provided by the base policy. In exchange, they may receive a reduction in their premium.

What are some reasons State Farm might deny a water damage claim?

State Farm may deny a water damage claim due to repeated leakage or seepage, failure to maintain, wear and tear, or faulty installation. It is important to review your policy carefully to understand what is covered and excluded.
