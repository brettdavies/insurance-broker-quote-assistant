# Geico increased our rate by $300 after updating odometer and said California law prevents correcting it?

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

We recently got hit with a $300 rate increase on our 6-month Geico auto policy just because we updated our odometer. Here’s the timeline:

* We bought a used 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV in August 2024. At the time, the odometer read ~30,500 miles.
* In January 2025, we started a new auto policy with Geico.
* Now, in June 2025, we updated the odometer to 36,500 miles through their system.
* After this update, Geico increased our premium significantly.

I called a Geico agent, who told me the system assumes 36.5k miles over the entire life of the car, starting from the car’s model year (Chevy Bolt EUV 2022). Since it’s about 3.5 years old, Geico calculates our annual mileage as ~10,400 miles/year, even though we’ve only driven about 6,000 miles in the 10 months we've owned it.

She also said that California law prohibits them from adjusting the previous odometer data, even if we can prove when we bought the car and how much we’ve actually driven. That part sounded the most questionable to me, but I’m not sure, which is why I’m here for some advice.

I’m not trying to cheat the system, we just want our actual usage reflected accurately. I can provide documentation of the purchase date and odometer at the time (from the bill of sale or DMV forms), but I’m not even sure that can help since the Geico agent said there’s nothing they can do to adjust the previous odometer.

My questions:

1. Is it true that California law doesn’t allow insurers to adjust for actual usage if it wasn’t reported at the start?
2. Has anyone successfully appealed something like this with Geico?
3. Should I just start shopping around now for another insurer that works better for low-mileage drivers?

Appreciate any insight or advice. This feels really unfair and arbitrary, especially since we were trying to be honest and accurate with our info.
