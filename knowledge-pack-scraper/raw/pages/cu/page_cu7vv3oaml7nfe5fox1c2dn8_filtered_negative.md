1 - no
2 - no, its their underwriting guidelines
3 - up to you
This sounds more like its GEICO's policy here, its not state law. But, if they have a policy they won't just arbitrarily change it, there are laws about treating everyone the same and making exceptions here and there, even well intentioned, can lead to lawsuits and claiming discrimination. Mileage is probably the second largest rating factor behind [driving record](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+driving+record&cId=50c932ad-cc52-417f-959b-2740972dd9bf&iId=280ee3aa-deeb-4f56-999d-b4d06f6d99d7) and underreporting of mileage in the state is huge.

1. Total BS. No such [CA law](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=California+insurance+law&cId=d5f6d9fc-5bc6-48c8-8543-6f1603c48dd9&iId=3bb6e467-1f5f-44bc-b073-03e0fafe1b4b). In fact, CA law requires them to update. BUT that’s Geicos rule.
2. Nope - They want you to leave
3. Shop! [Mercury](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Mercury+insurance&cId=63645558-a064-4141-831d-efd1e823d344&iId=4567d47a-15f0-45ef-945e-75c9c8e885a8) or Safeco would be my go to for lower annual miles

No law exists. It’s their California guidelines, they’ll want you to provide proof that you drive less with 2 separate verifications. Then they’ll lower your rate but won’t refund you anything.
Escalate it immediately and see if they help or else you’re stuck until your next renewal after you provide proof.

The reason that you are told it's a state law is because if they tell you it's a geico rule, customers start yelling at the Rep. Geico doesn't support it's employees, so they have to put up with it and have zero recourse. They just want to make it through their shift with at least one call where they don't get yelled at

I've never sold insurance, but I've blamed many things on either "state law", "federal law", or "corporate policy" even when I was the owner of the business and it was really just, "that's our rule."

I'm in California and have GEICO car insurance. I self-reported my low annual mileage usage after it went down significantly post COVID as I now work from home. They sent me a letter from the underwriting department requesting a picture of my current odometer reading, and I sent them an email with the info they wanted and that was the end of effort on my part.
So not only is "it's a law in California" total BS, I have specifically had this insurer reduce my annual mileage (which resulted in a lower rate) which sounds like what they are saying they can't do? Either someone grossly misunderstood or there was a miscommunication, maybe?

Often you can requote on their website and the rates will be better for identical coverages. Insurance likes to do fancy year over year math to justify rate increases that just drive away long term clients

A new quote sometimes gets a “new customer” credit, which would be removed by the underwriter once coverage is bound.

It's Geico and they won't do anything. I'm in a similar situation. I have two weekend cars that see about 250-500 miles a year, verified mileage. This latest renewal, they upped the estimated mileage to over 1k mikes, putting it into the next code class. I spent a while with support for them to finally say they couldn't do anything about the clearly improper estimate. It is what someone or a computer said, and the alternative is a another insurance company.

You have to switch to progressive they have snapshot. Geico‘s just doing It’s a way to weed out all people who are doing pizza deliver DoorDash and rideshare, but it screws a few people they might have like you people put more miles in a car in a year and they don’t wanna do the work to find them people to charge more money they just want to instantly charge more money. Insurance companies are going after data everywhere from third parties to based the prices on people. most people would be shocked all the information insurance companies get a lot of times it’s AI is digging it up. It’s not humans.

This is just Geico's policy in California. You can try to escalate it and, if you still want to remain with Geico, submit a complaint to the Department of Insurance over their practices.
Every carrier in California is required to report and verify an estimated mileage, but how it's done is up to each carrier. Most carriers usually are happy to adjust mileage downward every policy renewal and adjust upwards as many times as you ask. For example, I started with low mileage but then went hybrid, so Progressive was more than willing to go upward over chat. Same thing when my junker was overrated, they adjusted downward and I got a premium refund.

I just got an odometer verification email from GEICO, will they immediately charge the new rate once verified? Or should I start shopping? If this crazy rate increase happens to me I’m going to have to cancel anyway.

No, that is not accurate. What you are dealing with is GEICO’s internal policy, not a legal requirement. They referenced California law, but state rules allow adjustments under the right circumstances.
What California actually requires:
* Insurers must request mileage information when writing or renewing a policy, especially every three years. They can rely on DMV smog-test readings or other verified sources.
* Insurers cannot retroactively or prospectively change premiums based on actual mileage unless they offer a verified mileage program with odometer readings or tech tracking and notify you in advance.
So the claim that “California law prohibits them from adjusting previous odometer data” is false. The law allows and even encourages accurate mileage reporting, especially if you can support it with evidence.
What people have reported
Other drivers in California have said the same thing happened to them. Some called it unfair and pointed out that California law requires insurers to update mileage. GEICO, however, enforces its own rule and sometimes makes it hard to get corrected.
What you can do next
1. Document everything. Gather your bill of sale, DMV paperwork, and any service records showing odometer readings around August 2024 and January 2025.
2. Request a mileage correction formally. Submit those documents to GEICO and ask them to use your actual usage to adjust your rate fairly.
3. Ask if they offer a verified mileage program. Under California law, if they have one, they must notify you ahead of time and offer the option to enroll.
4. Shop around. Some insurers may be more flexible or offer low-mileage programs. Companies like Mercury or Safeco sometimes rate more fairly for drivers with low annual mileage.
You have grounds to push back. California law supports accurate odometer reporting, and properly documented mileage can affect your rate. If GEICO will not correct it, you can consider filing a complaint with the California Department of Insurance or shopping for another insurer that has a better low-mileage program.

My Geico rates doubled by 50% at my 6mo renewal. Same bare minimum coverages for a mini cooper now $1500 for 6mo. That’s $3k a year!! This is bullshit!! If federal and state governments mandate car insurance then they should also cap the costs. This country really blows…
