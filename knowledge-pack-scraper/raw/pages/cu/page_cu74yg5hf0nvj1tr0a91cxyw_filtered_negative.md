TFPA is authorized to issue policies throughout Texas; however, it is not authorized to provide windstorm and hail insurance for properties eligible for coverage through the [Texas Windstorm Insurance Association](https://www.twia.org/) (TWIA). If you reside in the [TWIA coverage area](http://www.tdi.texas.gov/wind/maps/index.html) and qualify for TFPA, you may have to carry both a TFPA and TWIA policy. Visit the TWIA website for more information about its [coverage and eligibility requirements](https://www.twia.org/coverage-eligibility/).
* Applicants must have been denied coverage by at least two insurance companies licensed to write and actually writing property insurance in Texas (click here to view the [TFPA Proof of Declination of Coverage form](https://www.texasfairplan.org/wp-content/uploads/Proof-of-Declination-of-Coverage-2021.pdf)).
TFPA does not sell policies directly to the public and does not have agents of its own. Applicants may only apply to TFPA through an agent. TFPA accepts applications submitted by any licensed property and casualty agent who meets its minimum requirements and [performance standards](https://www.texasfairplan.org/agents/requirements-performance-standards/).
Coverage must be obtained through an authorized licensed Texas agent. Any agent licensed to write property and casualty insurance in Texas can be authorized to write coverage through the Texas FAIR Plan Association. Visit our [Find an Agent](https://www.texasfairplan.org/property-owners/find-agent/) page to find an authorized agent in your area.
