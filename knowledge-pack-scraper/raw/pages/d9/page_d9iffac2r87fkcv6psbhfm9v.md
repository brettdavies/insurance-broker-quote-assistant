The **Government Employees Insurance Company** (**GEICO** [/ˈɡaɪkoʊ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) is an American [vehicle insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance "Vehicle insurance") company headquartered in [Chevy Chase, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase,_Maryland "Chevy Chase, Maryland"). In addition to auto insurance, GEICO provides motorcycle, ATV, RV, boat, snowmobile, travel, pet, event, homeowner, renter, and jewelry insurance options.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-4) It is the third largest auto insurer in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), after [State Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm "State Farm") and [Progressive Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Corporation "Progressive Corporation").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-5) GEICO is a wholly owned [subsidiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary "Subsidiary") of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway "Berkshire Hathaway"), which provides coverage for more than 24 million [motor vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicles "Motor vehicles") owned by more than 15 million [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_contract "Insurance contract") holders as of 2017. GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance in all 50 [U.S. states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") and the [District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."). The insurance agency sells policies through local agents, called GEICO Field Representatives, over the phone directly to the consumer via licensed insurance agents, and through their website. Its mascot is a [gold dust day gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_dust_day_gecko "Gold dust day gecko") with a [Cockney accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney_accent "Cockney accent"), voiced by the English actor [Jake Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Wood "Jake Wood"). GEICO is well known in popular culture for its advertising. 
Despite the presence of the word "government" in its name, GEICO has always been a [private corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company "Privately held company") and not a government agency or a government-owned corporation. [Leo Goodwin Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Goodwin_Sr. "Leo Goodwin Sr.") and his wife [Lillian Goodwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Goodwin "Lillian Goodwin") originally founded the company in 1936 to sell auto insurance to [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") employees.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-history-6)
GEICO manages the policies as the "insurance agent" and has a separate customer care team that handles the property and umbrella policies. 
## History
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GEICO&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]
GEICO was founded in 1936 by [Leo Goodwin Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Goodwin_Sr. "Leo Goodwin Sr.") and his wife [Lillian Goodwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Goodwin "Lillian Goodwin") to provide auto insurance directly to [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") employees and their families.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-history-6) Since 1925, Goodwin had worked for [USAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAA "USAA"), an insurer that specialized in insuring only military personnel. He decided to start his own company after rising as far as a civilian could go in USAA's military-dominated hierarchy. The Goodwins funded the creation of GEICO with $25,000 of their own money and $75,000 from [Fort Worth, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas "Fort Worth, Texas")-based banker Cleaves Rhea, with legal assistance from future GEICO CEO Lorimer Davidson.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1) Based on Goodwin's experience at USAA, GEICO's original business model was predicated on the assumption that federal employees, as a group, would constitute a less risky and more financially stable pool of insureds compared to the general public.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
In 1937, the Goodwins relocated GEICO from [San Antonio, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio "San Antonio"), to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), and reincorporated the company as a D.C. corporation after realizing that their business model would work best in the place with the highest concentration of federal employees.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-7)
In 1948, the Rhea family sold its 75% stake of GEICO to a coalition of investors, which was led by [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham "Benjamin Graham")'s Graham-Newman Partnership taking 50% (worth $712,000 at the time); this sale accidentally violated a [SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission") regulation, which forced Graham-Newman to divest a portion of their holdings in 1949, resulting in GEICO becoming a publicly traded company at ~$27/sh.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1) Graham-Newman's investment in GEICO eventually resulted in a position worth $400 million by 1972, which was by far Graham-Newman's best investment and outperformed the rest of their portfolio combined.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1)
In 1951, [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett "Warren Buffett"), then a [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") graduate student under Benjamin Graham, interviewed Lorimer Davidson (then a VP) and named GEICO "The Security I Like Best." From 1948 to 1958, GEICO's market capitalization grew almost 50 times.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1)
In 1958, Goodwin retired and was succeeded by Lorimer Davidson,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-history-6) who grew the company's insurance premiums at a compound rate of 16% annually from $40 million to $250 million over his tenure. Davidson retired and was replaced in 1970 by Ralph Peck (President and COO)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1) and [David Lloyd Kreeger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_Kreeger "David Lloyd Kreeger") (Chairman and CEO), who had been one of the other investors in 1948.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-newyorktimes-8)
In 1974 under Kreeger's leadership, GEICO began to insure the general public after real-time access to computerized driving records became available throughout the United States. At this time, GEICO was briefly the fifth-largest U.S. auto insurer. By 1975, it was clear that GEICO had expanded far too rapidly (during the [1973–75 recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9375_recession "1973–75 recession")) when it reported a US$126.5 million loss.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-9) Kreeger retired in 1975, although he continued in his role as chairman of the executive committee until 1979 when he was named honorary chairman,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-newyorktimes-8) and Peck left in 1976 after GEICO's share price had fallen from $42 to $5.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1) To prevent GEICO from collapsing, a consortium of 45 insurance companies agreed to take over a quarter of its policies, and it was forced to issue a stock offering, thus diluting existing stockholders, to raise money to pay claims. It took five years – during which the company shrank significantly – and a massive reorganization led by [John J. Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Byrne "John J. Byrne") and supported substantially by Buffett,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-Empower-1) to set GEICO on the path to recovery. Alvin E. Krause, retired from GEICO, was given carte blanche by the directors to help bring about a wholesale reorganization of GEICO's underwriting operations – including promotions and dismissals. He helped nurse the insurance firm back to financial health. He was a director of the GEICO Corp. from 1978 to 1983, and was an honorary director at the time of his death. He was chairman of Criterion from 1978 to 1981. Having been with GEICO since 1938. 
## Modern development
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GEICO&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Modern development")]
GEICO generally deals directly with consumers via [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone "Telephone") and [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"); however, the local agent program has more than 300 independent offices across the United States. GEICO is now the second-largest writer of private auto insurance in the country. 
In 2015, GEICO began offering coverage for drivers of [ridesharing companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_companies "Ridesharing companies") in select states, including in high-population states such as [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania"), [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio "Ohio"), and [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(U.S._state\) "Georgia \(U.S. state\)").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-10) The policy, which is issued through GEICO's commercial department, has received praise from insurance experts and quickly launched GEICO as the largest insurance provider for [ridesharing company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company "Ridesharing company") drivers.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-11)
In 2016, [J.D. Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.D._Power "J.D. Power") rated the company #20 out of 24 for overall purchase experience, with a 2/5 score.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-12)
In April 2021, a data breach was reported to have exposed customers' driver's license numbers through GEICO's online sales application for over a month.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-14)
In October 2023, GEICO issued a return to office mandate for employees to return to their office on specific days. Many staff have been hybrid or fully remote in recent months. In addition, the insurance company announced it will lay off 2,000 staff members, or 6% of its workforce.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-15)
## Advertising campaigns
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GEICO&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Advertising campaigns")]
GEICO has many well-known ad campaigns. In 2012, GEICO spent over US$1.1 billion in advertising, or 6.8% of its revenue.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-16) All campaigns are made and produced by [The Martin Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martin_Agency "The Martin Agency") in [Richmond, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia "Richmond, Virginia") and feature voice-over by Andrew Anthony[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-17) (namely the iconic tag "GEICO: 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance."). GEICO ads have featured several well-known mascots, including: 
  * The GEICO Gecko is their most well-known spokesperson mascot. He is voiced by British actor [Jake Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Wood "Jake Wood") currently, though other actors have been used in the past, including Andrew Randall, and [Kelsey Grammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer "Kelsey Grammer").
  * The [GEICO Cavemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO_Cavemen "GEICO Cavemen") (from ads claiming using their website is "so easy, a caveman could do it").
  * Actor [Mike McGlone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McGlone "Mike McGlone"), who uses [film noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir")-style narration to compare the ease of GEICO to things, famous people, or idioms. ("Could switching to GEICO really save you 15% or more on car insurance?...Is having a snowball fight with pitching great [Randy Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Johnson "Randy Johnson") a bad idea?") The scene is then acted out, with typically humorous results, similar to its "Did You Know" commercials. In addition to Johnson, other ads have included [Charlie Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Daniels "Charlie Daniels"), [Andrés Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Cantor "Andrés Cantor"), [Foghorn Leghorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn "Foghorn Leghorn"), [Elmer Fudd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Fudd "Elmer Fudd"), [R. Lee Ermey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey "R. Lee Ermey"), and [Ed "Too Tall" Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%22Too_Tall%22_Jones "Ed "Too Tall" Jones") among others.
  * Maxwell the Pig: Originally from the above campaign, as [the pig who cried "Wee wee wee!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Little_Piggy "This Little Piggy") from a vehicle on his way home, he later spun-off into his own series of commercials that promoted the GEICO app. GEICO reintroduced the Maxwell ad 15 years later for the [2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament "2025 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO#cite_note-18)
  * The "money savers" campaign enlisted actors to portray average consumers who have resorted to various humorous extremes in order to save money, such as teaching a dog to sing or teaching a group of Guinea pigs to row a boat and perform some mundane task for the consumer, and then presented switching to GEICO as an easy alternative to such endeavors with the common line ".... there's an easier way to save money."
  * The "Happier Than...." duo features Jimmy (actor Timothy Ryan Cole) and Ronnie (musician Alex Harvey) playing a guitar and a mandolin, respectively, on a small portable stage. They comment on a fictitious preceding event, such as a man dressed in 15th-century attire laughing as he leads a trio of speed boats with the painted names _Niña_ , _Pinta_ , and _Santa Maria_. After cutting to the duo, one says to the other, "You know, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy." The other then replied, "How happy are they, (Jimmy/Ronnie)?" and in the case above, the response is "Happier than [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") with speedboats!" This series is known for its viral "Hump Day" ad, showing a camel in an office.
  * Kash, the stack of cash that represents the money insurance customers could have saved by switching to GEICO. "[Somebody's Watching Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody%27s_Watching_Me "Somebody's Watching Me")" would play in the background.


There are also GEICO ads that feature stories from GEICO [customers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer "Customer") about situations in which the company assisted them, but are translated by celebrities like [Little Richard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Richard "Little Richard") and [Joan Rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers "Joan Rivers"). Film trailer announcer [Don LaFontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_LaFontaine "Don LaFontaine") appeared in one such ad, shortly before his death. The tag announcer for these spots was [D. C. Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._C._Douglas "D. C. Douglas"). GEICO is also an official sponsor of the [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League "National Hockey League") and themed commercials that always feature members of the hometown [Washington Capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals "Washington Capitals").
