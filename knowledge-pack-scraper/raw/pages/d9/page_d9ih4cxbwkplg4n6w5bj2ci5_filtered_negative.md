If you want to protect your home and rent it out as well, landlord insurance is a must. You might also want to suggest that your tenants take out a [renters insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renters-insurance.asp) policy so that their own personal effects will be covered in the event of an accident _._
