A car insurance broker is a licensed insurance expert who can work for you to help you get the best combination of good coverage and [cheap rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies").
* **They can help you choose and customize your coverage.** You might not know [how much coverage you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?") or when to pay more for extra coverage.
* **They can save you time.** Although [online quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") have made shopping for car insurance much easier, some companies only offer quotes through agents or over the phone. Gathering quotes can take a lot of time, so having a professional do it for you could be helpful.
**Having a good broker typically means you'll have a much easier[claims experience](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim") after an accident.**
* * *
This is especially true if you get a policy from a larger company that [offers quotes online](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free Car Insurance Quotes Online") because you'll miss out on getting a discount for buying your policy online.
* **Your insurance needs are simple:** An insurance broker is most useful when you have uncommon needs, like a [bad driving record](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record "Best Cheap Car Insurance For Those With a Bad Driving Record") or special coverage. Your insurance search might be fairly simple if you have a clean driving record and average or better credit.
* * *
It's important to find a trustworthy broker who won't advise you to get [more coverage than you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?") so they make a higher commission.
An insurance broker can be worth it if you have complex [insurance needs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need "Do You Really Need Car Insurance? How Much?") or value a personal customer service experience. While a broker could also save you money, it's important to understand whether they charge any fees that will impact your savings.
You need help figuring out [how much or what kind of coverage you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?").
You don't have time to [gather quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online").

You've [never filed a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-auto-insurance#usage-based "Best usage-based auto insurance").
You don't mind spending the time to [gather multiple quotes to compare rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online").
You want insurance from a big company that doesn't work with brokers, like [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") or [Geico](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review "Geico Insurance Review").
If you choose not to work with a broker, you can [get quotes online](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free Car Insurance Quotes Online") or work with an insurance agent.
* **Shop for and buy a policy yourself:** Most major companies offer online quotes, which makes it much easier for you to [compare insurance options](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online"). Depending on the company, you can typically get a quote in under half an hour, and sometimes much quicker. And some companies offer a discount for buying online.
