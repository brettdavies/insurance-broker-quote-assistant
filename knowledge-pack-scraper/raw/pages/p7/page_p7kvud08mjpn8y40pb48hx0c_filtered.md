* Lauren is the most amazing and helpful agent I have ever had. She thoroughly explained and presented me with options, was very personable and patient, supportive and kind! And I’m so happy to be insured with her as my agent. If you get the option to have her as your agent, consider yourself lucky! Her communication, direction and awareness of what was necessary to become insured made it possible for me to get what I need to move forward!

## **Why Progressive in Missouri**

### **Discount programs**

* [Snapshot® usage-based](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/) (safe-driving app)
* Multi-car, homeowner, paperless, paid-in-full
* Auto + [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) bundles

### **Coverage options**

* Liability through higher limits (e.g., 100/300/100)
* UM/UIM & MedPay/PIP shown next to your base quote
* Roadside, rental, and gap when relevant

### **SR-22 when required**

* Attach SR-22 at bind and e-file to the state
* Read our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) for timelines
* Keep continuous coverage to avoid resets

## **Coverage & bundles for Missouri drivers**

### **Liability-only**

Meets MO legal minimums; many step up to 100/300/100. See trade-offs in our [comparison guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance-comparison/).

### **Full coverage**

Collision + comprehensive for newer/financed cars; choose deductibles you can afford; price it beside liability-only.

### **Bundle & save**

Auto + [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) often lowers total cost; ask us to quote bundles with Progressive and peers.

**Getting Started (Missouri + Progressive)**

### Can you quote Progressive and other carriers at once?

Yes — we run Progressive alongside peers so you see the best fit. Start the [online quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/) or [call](tel:18884452793).

### What info should I have ready?

Licenses, VINs, garaging ZIP, mileage, and prior policy. Prep tips in our [auto guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance/).

### How fast do I get ID cards?

Minutes after binding — emailed or texted for DMV/dealer visits.

### Will my bind price match the quote?

It should when data is accurate; undisclosed tickets/drivers or address changes can adjust it.

### Moving within Missouri — reshop?

Yes — ZIPs differ; we re-quote Progressive vs others in one [pass](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).

**Pricing & Discounts (Snapshot®, UBI, bundles)**

### Does Progressive Snapshot® help in Missouri?

Often — safer, daytime driving can earn discounts. Details in our [Progressive pillar](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/).

### Prefer generic UBI?

We’ll compare usage-based insurance vs traditional plans side-by-side (SmartRide®, Drivewise®, RightTrack®, Signal®).

### Which discounts matter most?

Bundle, multi-car, homeowner, paperless, paid-in-full — browse brand menus in our [insurance providers overview](https://learnandserve.org/insurance-providers/).

### Is paid-in-full cheaper?

Usually — monthly billing may include fees; we show both in your [quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).

### Will one ticket spike my rate?

It can; the impact fades. We can reshop at renewal to keep costs in line.

**Coverage Details (Missouri)**

### Which liability limits should I choose?

Many MO households select 100/300/100 or higher; compare price vs protection in our [guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance-comparison/).

### UM/UIM & MedPay/PIP — add or skip?

Often smart; protect you and passengers — we’ll price them next to base.

### Full coverage for financed vehicles?

Typically required by lenders; we align deductibles and show options.

### Roadside and rental — add now or later?

Usually inexpensive; add anytime in your [quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).

### Gap coverage — do I need it?

If loan-to-value is tight, yes — we’ll compare gap choices.

**Proof, SR-22 & Changes**

### Can Progressive file an SR-22 for me?

In many cases yes. If you need filing, review our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) and we’ll attach it at bind.

### Switch carriers without a lapse?

Bind new first (Progressive or another), then cancel old for the same date — we’ll coordinate timing.

### Send proof to my lender or dealer?

Yes — with permission we send proof directly and copy you.

### Mid-term address or vehicle change?

Tell us before you swap; we’ll update and resend ID cards immediately.

### Who do I call for a claim?

Call us — we’ll triage and connect you with your carrier’s claims team.

## **Progressive in Missouri — get your best rate**

The simplest way to find the right price in Missouri is to compare Progressive with a few peers in one pass… each carrier weighs drivers, vehicles, ZIPs, and mileage differently across KC, STL, and Springfield. Decide coverage first — many households pick 100/300/100 and add UM/UIM and MedPay/PIP to protect themselves and passengers. If your vehicle is newer or financed, full coverage with deductibles you can manage is typically the right call. For extra savings, consider usage-based programs like [Progressive Snapshot®](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/) or alternatives (SmartRide®, Drivewise®, RightTrack®, Signal®) — we’ll show how UBI prices next to traditional plans. Bundling auto with [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) can also reduce total cost. If you’re reinstating, only some situations need a filing — our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) explains basics. Start a [quote online](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/) or [call](tel:18884452793) — we’ll compare Progressive and alternatives for your Missouri ZIP and email proof the same day.
