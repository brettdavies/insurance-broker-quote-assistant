## **Why Progressive in Missouri**
### **Discount programs**
  * [Snapshot® usage-based](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/) (safe-driving app)
  * Multi-car, homeowner, paperless, paid-in-full
  * Auto + [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) bundles


### **Coverage options**
  * Liability through higher limits (e.g., 100/300/100)
  * UM/UIM & MedPay/PIP shown next to your base quote
  * Roadside, rental, and gap when relevant


### **SR-22 when required**
  * Attach SR-22 at bind and e-file to the state
  * Read our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) for timelines
  * Keep continuous coverage to avoid resets


## **Coverage & bundles for Missouri drivers**
### **Liability-only**
Meets MO legal minimums; many step up to 100/300/100. See trade-offs in our [comparison guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance-comparison/).
### **Full coverage**
Collision + comprehensive for newer/financed cars; choose deductibles you can afford; price it beside liability-only.
### **Bundle & save**
Auto + [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) often lowers total cost; ask us to quote bundles with Progressive and peers.
**Getting Started (Missouri + Progressive)**
### Can you quote Progressive and other carriers at once?
Yes — we run Progressive alongside peers so you see the best fit. Start the [online quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/) or [call](tel:18884452793).
### What info should I have ready?
Licenses, VINs, garaging ZIP, mileage, and prior policy. Prep tips in our [auto guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance/).
### How fast do I get ID cards?
Minutes after binding — emailed or texted for DMV/dealer visits.
### Will my bind price match the quote?
It should when data is accurate; undisclosed tickets/drivers or address changes can adjust it.
### Moving within Missouri — reshop?
Yes — ZIPs differ; we re-quote Progressive vs others in one [pass](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).
**Pricing & Discounts (Snapshot®, UBI, bundles)**
### Does Progressive Snapshot® help in Missouri?
Often — safer, daytime driving can earn discounts. Details in our [Progressive pillar](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/).
### Prefer generic UBI?
We’ll compare usage-based insurance vs traditional plans side-by-side (SmartRide®, Drivewise®, RightTrack®, Signal®).
### Which discounts matter most?
Bundle, multi-car, homeowner, paperless, paid-in-full — browse brand menus in our [insurance providers overview](https://learnandserve.org/insurance-providers/).
### Is paid-in-full cheaper?
Usually — monthly billing may include fees; we show both in your [quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).
### Will one ticket spike my rate?
It can; the impact fades. We can reshop at renewal to keep costs in line.
**Coverage Details (Missouri)**
### Which liability limits should I choose?
Many MO households select 100/300/100 or higher; compare price vs protection in our [guide](https://learnandserve.org/auto-insurance-comparison/).
### UM/UIM & MedPay/PIP — add or skip?
Often smart; protect you and passengers — we’ll price them next to base.
### Full coverage for financed vehicles?
Typically required by lenders; we align deductibles and show options.
### Roadside and rental — add now or later?
Usually inexpensive; add anytime in your [quote](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/).
### Gap coverage — do I need it?
If loan-to-value is tight, yes — we’ll compare gap choices.
**Proof, SR-22 & Changes**
### Can Progressive file an SR-22 for me?
In many cases yes. If you need filing, review our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) and we’ll attach it at bind. 
### Switch carriers without a lapse?
Bind new first (Progressive or another), then cancel old for the same date — we’ll coordinate timing.
### Send proof to my lender or dealer?
Yes — with permission we send proof directly and copy you.
### Mid-term address or vehicle change?
Tell us before you swap; we’ll update and resend ID cards immediately.
### Who do I call for a claim?
Call us — we’ll triage and connect you with your carrier’s claims team.

## **Progressive in Missouri — get your best rate**
The simplest way to find the right price in Missouri is to compare Progressive with a few peers in one pass… each carrier weighs drivers, vehicles, ZIPs, and mileage differently across KC, STL, and Springfield. Decide coverage first — many households pick 100/300/100 and add UM/UIM and MedPay/PIP to protect themselves and passengers. If your vehicle is newer or financed, full coverage with deductibles you can manage is typically the right call. For extra savings, consider usage-based programs like [Progressive Snapshot®](https://learnandserve.org/progressive-drive-insurance-california/) or alternatives (SmartRide®, Drivewise®, RightTrack®, Signal®) — we’ll show how UBI prices next to traditional plans. Bundling auto with [homeowners](https://learnandserve.org/homeowners-insurance/) can also reduce total cost. If you’re reinstating, only some situations need a filing — our [SR-22 guide](https://learnandserve.org/sr22-states) explains basics. Start a [quote online](https://learnandserve.org/a-plus-ai-auto-quote-helper/) or [call](tel:18884452793) — we’ll compare Progressive and alternatives for your Missouri ZIP and email proof the same day.
