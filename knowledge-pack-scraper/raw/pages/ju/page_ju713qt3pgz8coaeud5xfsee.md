![money icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/money_kmo8zz.svg)
**Take Advantage of Discounts**
Many discounts are available to help you save including a pay-in-full, autopay, and military/membership reduction for most providers. Bundling motorcycle insurance with other policies is also another great way to save if you want to have coverage with your current provider.
![driverLicense icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/driver-license_qzgm49.svg)
**Get a Full Motorcycle License**
Getting a full motorcycle license instead of just an endorsement can save you a large sum on insurance for your bike. It works as a signal to insurers that you are less risky than other drivers, lowing premiums overall.
