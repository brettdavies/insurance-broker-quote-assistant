[Progressive Insurance](/us/companies/progressive-insurance/115985/) is expanding protections for for-hire truckers with the launch of a new endorsement called Cargo Plus, now available in 42 states across the US.

Cargo Plus builds on Progressive’s existing motor truck cargo policy, which covers legal liability for damage to goods under a trucker’s control. The endorsement introduces added protections against damage caused by wetness, rust, and corrosion, and includes coverage for temperature fluctuations on refrigerated loads for policyholders with Refrigeration Breakdown coverage.

“Our trucking customers rely on Progressive Commercial for a broad range of insurance solutions, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service. The new Cargo Plus endorsement allows us to better serve the coverage needs of our trucking customers,” said Peter Niro, truck product development manager at Progressive.

Cargo Plus is automatically included in new Progressive policies with Motor Truck Cargo coverage. Current customers with qualifying cargo or refrigeration coverage are also eligible to receive the enhanced benefits prior to policy renewal.

Eligible states for the new endorsement include Texas, Illinois, Florida, New Jersey, and 38 others. Progressive expects Cargo Plus to reach 49 states by May 21, 2025, and achieve full nationwide availability by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.

However, Refrigeration Breakdown coverage is not available in California and Florida.
