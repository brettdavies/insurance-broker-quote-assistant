Whether you're renting a studio apartment or an entire single-family home, renters insurance will protect what your landlord's policy does not. For instance, if a fire destroys your rented home, renters insurance could cover your personal belongings and valuables. And if someone sues you for injuries on your property, renters insurance will ensure you're covered.

If you're in the military or a veteran, [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/k5002040e28d) is an option worth considering. Its life insurance is the only product open to non-military customers.
Insurify states USAA is priced at $10 a month, significantly more affordable than the national average. However, as you may already know, USAA insurance coverage is limited to US military members, veterans, and their immediate families. Civilian renters are not eligible for its rock-bottom pricing.

Renters insurance covers personal property when damaged by a covered peril, or a loss listed in your policy, like fire, smoke, theft, and storms. Your landlord's insurance policy will typically cover the building and the structure, and your insurance covers anything inside your home.
###  How much does renters insurance cost?

The average cost of renters insurance in the US is about $15 per month, or $173 a year, according to 2020 data from the Insurance Information Institute. Premiums may vary based on zip code, any history of claims, and more. You could get additional savings by bundling your renters insurance policy with car insurance or other types of insurance.
###  What company has the cheapest renters insurance?

The cheapest renters insurance tends to vary based on location, so it's worth getting quotes from a few different companies. Overall, though, Lemonade tends to offer cheap rates across the US.
###  Why do people not get renters insurance?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
People may opt to not get renters insurance by simply overlooking its importance, or if they incorrectly think their valuables are covered by the landlord's building insurance. Anyone with items of value in their apartment should get renters insurance to protect their belongings.
