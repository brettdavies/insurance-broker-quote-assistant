Geico vs. Liberty Mutual comparison Is Geico cheaper than Liberty Mutual? Geico vs. Liberty Mutual: discounts Geico vs. Liberty Mutual: customer experience comparison Frequently asked questions Methodology
If you’ve narrowed down potential car insurance companies to Geico and Liberty Mutual, it may help to do a side by side comparison. We analyzed available coverage types, discount opportunities, telematics programs, customer satisfaction ratings and more. We found that Geico generally offers lower premiums. The company also won the 2025 Bankrate Award for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers. Meanwhile, Liberty Mutual might be a better option for drivers looking to customize their policies with endorsements. That said, both companies offer a wide selection of coverage types and discounts.
