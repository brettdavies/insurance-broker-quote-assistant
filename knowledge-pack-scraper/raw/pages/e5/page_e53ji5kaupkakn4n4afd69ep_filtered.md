Want to protect your car?

This calculator can help compare the cost of [buying a new car](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-buy-a-new-car-from-a-dealership "How to buy a new car from a dealership") vs a [used car](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-buy-a-used-car "How to buy a used car from a dealer or private seller"). Factors such as depreciation, operating and [maintenance](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-maintenance-that-you-can-do-yourself "Car maintenance that you can do yourself") costs, and years of ownership are used to determine what the overall costs might be.

## What factors will determine the results?

* **Purchase price:** Purchasing a new vehicle over a used vehicle of the same make and model will clearly cost more. The new vehicle will drop in value more than the used vehicle due to the depreciation rate. Our calculator allows you to select the rate as average, high or low.
* **Depreciation:** Some vehicles just [depreciate](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-minimize-car-depreciation "How to minimize car depreciation") faster than others do. The faster they depreciate the lower the value becomes. Likewise, if they depreciate slower, the resale value is higher.
* **Operating costs:** A new vehicle will need less maintenance than a used vehicle. Additionally, the [fuel consumption](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/use-less-gas-with-these-simple-tricks-of-efficient-drivers "Use less gas with these simple tricks of efficient drivers") of used vehicles may be more than their newer counterparts.
* **Years of ownership:** If you own a vehicle for a longer period of time, the average annual cost might be lower since costs are spread out over the years of ownership.
* **Financing costs:** Generally, when getting a [car loan](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-loan-basics-you-need-to-know "Car loan basics you need to know"), the interest rate for a newer car is less than a used car.
