This calculator can help compare the cost of [buying a new car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-buy-a-new-car-from-a-dealership "How to buy a new car from a dealership") vs a [used car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-buy-a-used-car "How to buy a used car from a dealer or private seller"). Factors such as depreciation, operating and [maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-maintenance-that-you-can-do-yourself "Car maintenance that you can do yourself") costs, and years of ownership are used to determine what the overall costs might be.
* **Depreciation:** Some vehicles just [depreciate](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-minimize-car-depreciation "How to minimize car depreciation") faster than others do. The faster they depreciate the lower the value becomes. Likewise, if they depreciate slower, the resale value is higher.
* **Operating costs:** A new vehicle will need less maintenance than a used vehicle. Additionally, the [fuel consumption](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/use-less-gas-with-these-simple-tricks-of-efficient-drivers "Use less gas with these simple tricks of efficient drivers") of used vehicles may be more than their newer counterparts.
* **Financing costs:** Generally, when getting a [car loan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-loan-basics-you-need-to-know "Car loan basics you need to know"), the interest rate for a newer car is less than a used car.
Once you decide on what car to purchase, consider talking to a [State Farm® agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/ " Find State Farm Agents Near You") to learn about available [car insurance coverages](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options "Coverage options") and the advantage of choosing to [bundle insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/bundling "Multiline").
