In 2025, a homeowners insurance policy in California averaged about [$1,674 a year](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/). That’s significantly less than the $2,692 national average, but still a 20% increase from 2024.

In addition, owners in wildfire-prone areas of the Golden State are being hit with rate increases and some carriers have [stopped or paused writing new policies](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/05/what-homeowners-need-to-know-as-insurers-leave-high-risk-climate-areas.html) altogether.

Whether you’re getting coverage for a new home or shopping for a replacement policy, it’s still possible to find solid coverage.

## How much does homeowners insurance cost in California?

The average homeowners insurance policy in California costs about $1,439 per year, or roughly $120 a month.

Individual rates can vary greatly, depending on the location, age and condition of the home, as well as the coverage you choose, your claims history and other factors.

## What does homeowners insurance cover in California?

In California, homeowners insurance covers what it typically does in other states:

* **Dwelling coverage**: Pays to rebuild or repair the home, including its structure, permanent fixtures, appliances and attached structures.
* **Personal property coverage**: Repairs or replaces items damaged in a covered event, like a fire.
* **Liability coverage:** Can cover lawyers’ fees and other costs if you’re found responsible for causing damage to someone else.
* **Additional living expenses coverage:** Pay for a place lodging, meals and other benefits if your home is unlivable after a covered incident.

## Additional homeowners insurance in California

A standard homeowners insurance policy covers a lot, but it may not cover every situation you may face in California:

### Earthquakes

Earthquake coverage is not usually covered by homeowners insurance, but you can get a separate policy, either as a rider on your homeowners insurance policy or with a separate plan.

### Floods

Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flooding: You can opt for flood insurance coverage through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. [Private flood insurance companies](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/) are also an option and can offer higher limits and coverage options.

## How to save on homeowners insurance in California

To get the best possible rate on homeowners insurance in California, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Shop around

Get three to five quotes from insurers who operate in your state, choosing the same coverage amount and deductibles to get a fair comparison.

### Step 2: Raise your deductible

Your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) is the amount you’re going to have to shell out before your insurer gets involved. You can have more than one deductible, depending on the coverage types, but raising them will almost always result in a lower monthly premium.   
  
The trick, of course, is making sure you can afford that higher, new deductible if you have to file a claim.

### Step 3: Bundle home and auto

Practically every insurance company will cut you a deal for buying more than one policy. Bundling home and auto can save you as much as 30%, with other discounts for tying in life and even pet insurance.

### Step 4: Add wildfire-mitigation features

If you live in an area of California that’s prone to wildfires, taking some mitigation steps could keep your rates down — or at least ensure you’re renewed. Updating HVAC and electrical systems can help, as can adding fire and smoke detectors and a sprinkler system.
