## How SR-22 Affects Your Insurance Rates
When you’re told to file an SR-22, your car insurance rates will most likely go up. This happens because you’re now considered a high-risk driver after something serious like a DUI, too many tickets, or driving without insurance.
Once your insurance company sends the SR-22 auto insurance form to the state, your rates may increase immediately. How much they go up depends on your driving history and the company you choose.
To save money, it’s smart to compare SR-22 car insurance quotes online from different providers. Companies like [The General](https://www.quote.com/companies/the-general-insurance-review/ "The General"), Geico, Progressive, and State Farm offer coverage for drivers who need to file an SR-22. The General is known for working with high-risk drivers and may offer good options.
