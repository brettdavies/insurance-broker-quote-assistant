Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. 
Drivers with accidents, traffic violations and multiple claims generally pay much more for car insurance than good drivers. That’s why our research can help you find a car insurance company that offers coverage at a decent cost for your driver profile.   
  
To identify the best car insurance companies for high-risk drivers, we evaluated 14 insurers. We analyzed feedback from customers, the average cost for high-risk drivers, complaints, and more. We found a range of coverage options and prices, so read our reviews to identify the car insurance company that offers the best rates for your particular situation.

Our Expert Take
We’re impressed with USAA’s outstanding rates for military members with various high-risk profiles. We found that USAA offers the lowest costs for drivers who have caused an accident with injury or property damage, drivers with one or two speeding tickets and those with a speeding ticket and accident on their record.
Rates are also excellent for teens and young adult drivers, as well as senior drivers, both age categories that can be considered high-risk by insurers. USAA also has the lowest average rates for state minimum car insurance, which is good for high-risk drivers wanting a bare-bones policy.
If you’re looking for a variety of coverage options, USAA doesn’t disappoint, offering such items as accident forgiveness and new car replacement. It also offers non-owner insurance for high-risk drivers who don’t own a car but need car insurance—perhaps to get their license back.
USAA’s complaint level with state insurance departments is slightly below the industry average. However, many of its top competitors have a much lower rate of complaints.
Based on our survey of USAA customers:
  * They are extremely likely to recommend USAA car insurance to a friend or family member.
  * They are extremely satisfied with their purchase.


Among USAA customers who have made claims:
  * They were satisfied overall with the claims process.


**More:**[USAA Car Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usaa-car-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Cheapest rates among the companies we assessed for drivers convicted of reckless driving or driving with a suspended license.
  * Superb costs for drivers with bad credit.
  * Offers SR-22 filings to high-risk drivers in need.
  * Available in 50 states, and you can get a quote and buy a policy online.


  * Does not offer gap insurance or a vanishing deductible.
  * Limits eligibility to veterans, active members of the military and their immediate families.
  * Has a low grade (D+) from auto body specialists for its claims procedures.


States Available In 
USAA is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Our Expert Take
We like Nationwide because it offers low rates for many high-risk driver profiles and is the cheapest for drivers with bad credit. It also has the lowest cost for teen drivers being added to their parent’s policy and for seniors ages 65 to 80, two high-risk age groups for insurers.
Nationwide has the cheapest rates available to the general public for drivers with a speeding ticket and those who caused an accident with injury. USAA is a tad cheaper for a few of the driver profiles we examined, but it sells only to military members, veterans and their immediate families.
Nationwide is a good choice for high-risk drivers seeking diverse coverage options, such as accident and minor violation forgiveness, gap insurance, new car replacement, and a vanishing deductible. Be aware that traffic violations or claims may limit some benefits.
Based on our survey of Nationwide customers:
  * They are likely to recommend Nationwide car insurance to a friend or family member.
  * They are very satisfied with their purchase.


Among Nationwide customers who have made claims:
  * They were very satisfied overall with the claims process.


**More:**[Nationwide Car Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/nationwide-car-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Files SR-22s for those in need and offers non-owner policies.
  * Offers gap insurance for a relatively good price of $34 a year.
  * Has a Spanish version of its website.
  * Offers a pay-per-mile insurance program (SmartMiles) for low-mileage drivers who want to save.


  * Rates for drivers with a DUI are higher than those of some top competitors.
  * Has higher-than-average rates for drivers with tickets for reckless driving or driving with a suspended license.


States Available In 
Nationwide car insurance is available in 46 states and Washington, D.C. It is not available in Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana or Massachusetts.

Our Expert Take
Erie stands out for its great rates for drivers who have caused two accidents with injury, which usually will result in you being classified as a high-risk driver.
Erie’s overall rates for drivers with black marks on their records are fairly good. This includes drivers with a speeding ticket or two, having a speeding ticket and an accident on their record, a DUI, and a speeding ticket and a DUI. Teens, young adults and senior drivers also see affordable rates with Erie.
Erie also impressed us with its grade of A- from collision repair experts for its claim procedures. That is the highest grade among the insurers we analyzed. It signals that Erie has a straightforward claims process that allows for quality repairs and acceptable outcomes.
Erie offers a solid lineup of coverage offerings, with some automatically included without an additional cost, like no deductible for windshield repair, pet injury coverage and rental care reimbursement (in most states). If you haven’t made a claim within three years, you can also qualify for accident forgiveness at no extra cost.
Based on our survey of Erie customers:
  * They are extremely likely to recommend Erie car insurance to a friend or family member.
  * They are extremely satisfied with their purchase.


Among Erie customers who have made claims:
  * They were extremely satisfied overall with the claims process.

Our Expert Take
We’re impressed with Progressive for its low-cost rates offered to drivers with a DUI, which are the cheapest among the companies we evaluated. A DUI is a serious offense that can double your rates with some insurers, but it only goes up 24% with Progressive.
We also like that Progressive offers other high-risk drivers competitive rates, such as drivers who have caused accidents and drivers with speeding tickets or bad credit. It also has decent rates for teens and seniors, who are regarded as high risk by auto insurers.
If your high-risk driver status isn’t due to tickets or accidents, you can add on a vanishing deductible and accident forgiveness. Progressive has three types of accident forgiveness.
“Small accident forgiveness” is for claims up to $500 and is automatically included in most states. For claims exceeding $500, you can pay accident forgiveness coverage if you’ve been with Progressive for at least five years and without violations or accidents. Or you can pay for an accident forgiveness option that allows you to have one accident forgiven per policy period.
Based on our survey of Progressive customers:
  * They are likely to recommend Progressive car insurance to a friend or family member.
  * They are very satisfied with their purchase.


Among Progressive customers who have made claims:
  * They were somewhat satisfied overall with the claims process.


**More:**[Progressive Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-car-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Offers nonowner car insurance and SR-22 filings.
  * Low level of complaints made to state insurance departments.
  * You can get a quote and buy a car insurance policy online.


  * Rates for young adults on their own policy are on the high side.
  * No new car replacement coverage.
  * Received only a C grade for the last five years from auto repair experts for its collision claim process.


States Available In 
Progressive is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

## Who Qualifies as a High-Risk Driver?
Having traffic tickets, accidents or claims as well as having a serious traffic infraction—such as reckless driving or a DUI—can get you labeled as a high-risk driver.
When auto insurers find you more likely than most other drivers to make a claim, you’re considered a high-risk driver.
Common driver profiles that car insurance companies classify as high risk include:
  * Teen and young adult drivers.
  * New drivers (of any age).
  * Senior drivers (those over 65 typically).
  * Drivers with one or more DUI convictions.
  * Drivers with at-fault accidents on their record.
  * Drivers with multiple car insurance claims.
  * Drivers with multiple minor traffic violations, such as two speeding tickets.
  * Drivers with serious traffic violations, such as reckless driving.
  * Drivers with bad credit.


## How Does Your Driving Record Affect Your Car Insurance Rates?
Your driving record gives car insurance companies a window into your driving behavior, which they use to determine how much risk you pose. Drivers with tickets and accidents demonstrate risky behaviors, so they see higher rates.
Here’s how various driving record offenses are used as [car insurance rating factors](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/factors-in-rates/) and how much they can affect your rates.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/car-crash@2x.svg) | 
### At-Fault Accidents
One minor accident may not affect your car insurance costs, especially if you have [accident forgiveness coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/). But if you’ve made multiple car insurance claims or caused a serious crash, insurers see you showing risky behavior on the roadway and deem you a high-risk driver.   
**How much more do you pay after an accident or two?** Car insurance costs increase an average of 50% after an accident with injuries, according to our analysis of [car insurance costs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rate-increase-after-accident/). If you’re at fault for two accidents with injury, rates go up an average of 105%.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image5.png) | 
### Speeding Ticket
You’ll pay more for [car insurance after a speeding ticket](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/speeding-ticket-rate-increase/) because higher speeds can lead to more serious accidents if you crash. One ticket may not affect you much, but having multiple speeding tickets shows a pattern of riskier driving and categorizes you as a high-risk driver.   
**How much more do you pay after a speeding ticket or two?** Car insurance costs increase 25% on average after one speeding ticket and 55% on average after two speeding tickets.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Crash.png) | 
### Reckless Driving
Reckless driving’s definition varies by state, but a common definition is driving your vehicle with a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. In short, it’s driving dangerously and could result in a severe accident, so insurers label drivers with this offense as a high risk.    
**How much more do you pay after a reckless driving ticket?** Auto insurance costs increase 63% on average after a reckless driving ticket, according to our analysis. Rates increase by over $1,250 per year on average, showing how seriously insurers take this offense.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Drunk-driver@2x.svg) | 
### DUI
[Car insurance costs after a DUI](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-dui-car-insurance/) are high because being under the influence of alcohol or drugs impairs your judgment, coordination and reaction times—all of which vastly affect your driving abilities and make you more likely to be in an auto accident.   
**How much more do you pay after a DUI ticket?** Auto insurance costs increase 72% on average for drivers with a DUI, according to our analysis. The cost difference between a good driver with a clean driving record and a high-risk driver with a DUI is over $1,400 per year.   
### Car Insurance Rates for High-Risk Drivers
The average car insurance cost for a high-risk driver is over $3,500 a year, that’s nearly $1,400 a year more than a good driver pays.
Here’s a look at the rates for common offenses that may classify you as a high-risk driver, depending on the car insurance company’s guidelines.
Driving record  |  Average annual rates   
---|---  
Clean driving record (good driver) |  $2,149  
Driver with two speeding tickets |  $3,218  
Driver with a reckless driving ticket |  $3,361  
Driver with a DUI conviction |  $3,593  
Driver with an at-fault accident with injury |  $3,210  
Driver with two at-fault accidents with injury |  $4,285

## What Non-Driving Factors Make You a High-Risk Driver?
Factors unrelated to driving are also used to [calculate auto insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-need/) rates, such as age, credit score and location.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Cake@2x.svg) | 
### Age
Teen drivers as well as senior drivers over 65 are deemed higher risks because they’re more accident-prone. Age is not permitted as a cost factor in California, Hawaii and Massachusetts.   
**How much more do teens and senior drivers pay?** Auto insurance costs increase 97% on average for parents adding a [16-year-old driver](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) to their policy. Prices are 35% higher on average for a senior driver at age 80 compared to age 60, according to our analysis.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-score.png) | 
### Credit
[Car insurance costs for drivers with bad credit](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) run high because insurers believe credit predicts claim likelihood and those with bad credit have a higher chance of filing claims. Using credit to set car insurance rates is banned in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.   
**How much more do drivers with bad credit pay?** Car insurance prices increase 96% on average for drivers with bad credit. Our analysis found drivers with bad credit pay nearly $2,000 more per year than those with good credit.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Location@2x.svg) | 
### Location
If you live where insurers receive a higher-than-average amount of claims, it can bump you into a higher risk category. For instance, living in an area with a high rate of [car theft](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/coverage-for-car-theft/) or severe weather can result in an increased number of claims and make you riskier to insure.   
**How can your location affect your rates?** An example is Louisiana compared to Vermont. Louisiana is prone to severe weather, like hurricanes, and its average car insurance price is around 200% more expensive than Vermont, which has milder weather.  
## How Long Are You Considered a High-Risk Driver?
You typically can be considered a high-risk driver for three to five years, depending on the specific reason for your high-risk classification.
Accidents and traffic tickets will usually fall off your driving record—and no longer affect rates with auto insurance companies—after three to five years.
A DUI conviction may remain on your driving record longer, affecting your car insurance costs longer if your state laws allow it. And if bad credit is making you a higher risk, raising your score should bring down your auto insurance prices.
Be sure to shop around and [compare car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) once an offense falls off your record or you bring up your credit score.
## Factors To Consider When Choosing an Insurance Company for a High-Risk Policy
Shopping as a high-risk driver often means you have fewer car insurance companies vying for your business. Consider these factors when choosing an auto insurance company for a high-risk policy:
  * **Coverage Options.** Just because you’re a high-risk driver doesn’t mean you can’t buy optional coverage you may need, like [gap insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/gap-insurance/). But also look to eliminate coverage options you don’t need to try to lower your insurance costs.
  * **Customer Service.** Whether considering a well-known national insurer or a smaller regional one, check out ratings such as ours to see how the company stacks up.
  * **Price.** Your rates are going to run high already if you’re considered a high-risk driver, so make sure to shop around so that you can find an insurance company that offers the best car insurance price for your specific situation.

#### Compare Quotes
Car insurance company prices vary greatly, so high-risk drivers need to [compare car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from several insurers.
I recommend you request the same coverage and limits when comparison shopping. If you need an SR-22 filed or non-owner car insurance, make certain the companies you compare offer these choices.

#### Take a Defensive Driving Course
Some insurers offer a [car insurance discount](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/) if you take a defensive driving course to improve your skills behind the wheel. If you’re taking the defensive driving course specifically to obtain a discount, ask your car insurance company for a list of approved providers.

#### Raise Your Deductible
A [car insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-car-insurance-deductible/) is the amount subtracted from car insurance [collision and comprehensive claim checks](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance/). You can save money by raising your deductible. For example, I found you can save 19% on average by going from a $250 deductible to a $1,000 deductible.

#### Learn When To File Collision Claims
[Collision insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-collision-insurance/) will pay for your car repairs from an accidental collision with another car or object, regardless of fault. If you make an auto insurance claim for minor issues, they can add up quickly and get you labeled as a high risk for making multiple claims. I recommend finding out the cost of the repairs and then deciding if it’s worth making a claim.

#### Ask for Discounts
You may not be eligible for a claims-free or accident-free discount depending on the reason you’re considered a high-risk driver, but there are plenty of other car insurance discounts.

## How Can You Lower Your Risk?
Lowering the risk you pose can help you reduce your car insurance costs. Here are some actions that may help you find cheaper car insurance prices.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Driver-in-car@2x.svg) | 
### Be a Safe Driver
Work toward a clean driving record, one without traffic violations or accidents. While it may take three to five years for past offenses to fall off your driving record, consistent safe driving will build trust with car insurance companies that you now pose less risk.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image4-2.png) | 
### Improve Your Credit Score
Building up a better credit score will help you get lower car insurance prices in states that allow the use of [credit-based auto insurance scores](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-insurance-score/) as a rating factor.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pay-per-mile@2x-1.svg) | 
### Drive Less
If you drive less, you have less risk of being in an accident. If your situation has changed, such as working from home or retirement, inform your car insurance company that your annual mileage has decreased to see about [low-mileage car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-low-mileage-car-insurance/) that can bring down your rates.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Car-insurance-policy-1.svg) | 
### Keep Continuous Coverage
You can be considered a high-risk driver if you’ve failed to keep car insurance in force or if it’s your first car insurance policy. To become less of a risk, get car insurance and keep it. Consistently having an active auto policy can also lead to discounts, such as a loyalty discount.  
## How To Get Car Insurance if You’ve Been Denied Coverage as a High Risk Driver
If you’ve been denied coverage by a car insurance company because you’re a high-risk driver, obtaining an auto policy is still possible with other insurers or through state agencies. Here are the main ways to find car insurance after a denial.
### Comparison Shop With a Wide Variety of Companies
Your first step is to comparison shop with multiple car insurance companies. Auto insurers weigh driver issues differently in their rating calculations—shopping around may allow you to find the insurer willing to take on your risk.
Pro Tip
Compare quotes with big companies, regional companies and nonstandard auto insurance companies.
Nonstandard auto insurers cater to high-risk drivers who have trouble getting insurance with mainstream companies. You can look at nonstandard insurers such as [Direct Auto](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/direct-auto-insurance-review/), National General and The General.
### Try Out the Non-Voluntary Market
If you can’t find car insurance within the voluntary market—meaning you shop for your own policy—you can look to the “insurer of last resort” or non-voluntary market. That’s the state’s [assigned risk pool](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/assigned-risk/) that will help you find coverage.
All states have a form of assigned risk systems in place to guarantee that high-risk drivers who’ve been denied coverage elsewhere can obtain auto insurance. The downside is that these policies typically have very high rates.

## Methodology
To identify the best high-risk car insurance companies, we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of high-risk drivers, non-owner car insurance options, complaints about auto insurance against the company, and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (65% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for:
  * Drivers who have caused an accident with injury.
  * Drivers who have caused an accident with property damage.
  * Drivers with a DUI.
  * Drivers with poor credit.
  * Drivers who have two speeding tickets.
  * Drivers with two accidents with injury.
  * Drivers with a reckless driving conviction.
  * Drivers with one speeding ticket and one accident.
  * Drivers with one speeding ticket and one DUI.
  * Drivers with a driving with a suspended license conviction.
  * Teen drivers ages 16 to 19 added to a parent’s policy.
  * Teens and young adult drivers ages 18 to 25 on their own policy.
  * Senior drivers ages 65 to 80.


Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Satisfaction with customer service and price; satisfaction with claims process (20% of score):** For customer satisfaction, we surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company. This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11-29, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.5 point with 95% confidence. This survey was overseen by Talker Research, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society (MRS) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).
For satisfaction with the claims process, we surveyed 3,000 American drivers who had filed a car insurance claim within the past 12 months. This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11 to November 12, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.8 point with 95% confidence. This survey was overseen by Talker Research, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society (MRS) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).
**Complaints (10% of score):** We used car insurance complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and denials.

The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.

**Car insurance coverage non-owner option (5% of score):** Auto insurance companies for high-risk drivers need to include coverage that is important to this segment of drivers. One such coverage is non-owners for when the driver needs car insurance—perhaps to keep their driver’s license or reinstate it— but doesn’t own a car. Also, all of the car insurance companies we evaluated offer to file SR-22 certificates of financial responsibility for drivers in need.
