Using a mix of public and internal data, we analyzed millions of rate averages across U.S. ZIP codes. These rates were publicly sourced from insurer filings and should be used for comparative purposes only.
- CSAA provides the cheapest liability coverage at $25 per month in California.  
  
- CSAA offers the cheapest rates for full coverage insurance in California at $81 per month.  
  
- At $126 per month, Mount Shasta is the cheapest city for car insurance in California.

Additionally, the effect on premiums in California may differ from the national average due to regional risks and rules.
