While you should enjoy everything life has to offer, it’s important to plan for what will happen when you die. If you have dependents who rely on your income, you probably need a life insurance policy. But choosing the right life insurance policy for your family can be challenging. If you’re not sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place. 
In this life insurance buying guide, we’ll cover the different types of life insurance, how to calculate how much life insurance you need, and how to compare companies to find the [best life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-companies-8763666) for your needs. We’ll also provide an overview of our favorite life insurance providers, so you can choose the best life insurance for your needs.

##  Types of Life Insurance 
To choose a life insurance policy, you need to first identify which type of life insurance you need. There are two general types to consider: term and permanent. 
###  Term Life Insurance 
Term life insurance provides temporary coverage for a fixed period of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. (Some companies, such as [Protective](https://dotdashprotective.covrtech.com/landing/term?utm_source=7483886), offer terms up to 40 years.) If you die while the policy is in effect, your beneficiaries receive a payout. If you outlive the policy’s expiration, you won’t receive any money from your insurance company, unless you have a return-of-premium policy. 
Term life insurance is designed to provide money for your dependents when they need it most—during your income-earning, child-rearing, college-saving, mortgage-paying years. Though term life insurance doesn’t provide a permanent [death benefit](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-death-benefit-and-cash-value-insurance-policy.asp), it’s sufficient for most people’s needs. 
It also costs significantly less than permanent life insurance. While rates will vary depending on your age, gender, health, policy choices, and other factors, our research found that a healthy 30-year-old female would pay an [average life insurance cost](https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-is-life-insurance-7112541) of about $25 per month for a 30-year, $500,000 policy. 
###  Permanent Life Insurance 
Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance is designed to last a lifetime, It will provide a death benefit for your beneficiaries no matter when you die, as long as your [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022316/understanding-life-insurance-premiums.asp) are paid. There are a few different types of permanent life insurance, but most have a [cash value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-value-life-insurance.asp) element that can be withdrawn from or borrowed against while you’re still alive. 
  * **Whole life insurance:**[Whole life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-whole-life-insurance-8763569) has fixed premiums and a guaranteed death benefit. Whole life insurance can cost up to 10 times the premium for a term policy with the same death benefit.1 It’s best for individuals with lifelong dependents or estate planning needs. 
  * **Universal life insurance:**[Universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-universal-life-insurance-8762927) features flexible premiums and an adjustable death benefit along with an interest-earning cash value component. It’s similar to whole life insurance, but has fewer guarantees and is best for people who need more flexibility. [Variable life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/variable-life-insurance.asp) and [equity-indexed life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity-indexed-universal-life-insurance.asp) are usually types of universal life insurance. In both, your cash value fluctuates according to market performance. 
  * **Final expense insurance:** Also known as burial insurance, [final expense insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/final-expense-insurance-4801018) is a type of whole life insurance with a small death benefit (usually $40,000 or less). It’s designed for older people with health issues and doesn’t require a medical exam. 


##  How to Choose the Best Life Insurance Policy 
To choose the [best life insurance company](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-companies-8763666), you’ll first need to determine what you need. Then, you can narrow down your options to companies that offer the coverage you’re looking for. 
###  Figure Out What You Need 
  1. **How much coverage do you need?** To calculate [how much life insurance you need](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/insureneeds.asp), start with the income you generate for your dependents. Include workplace benefits and any services you provide that they would need to replace. Multiply the result by as many years as you need coverage, adjusting for inflation and subtracting any Social Security benefits you expect to receive. Add money for your children's college needs or your spouse’s retirement as you see fit. 
  2. **How long do you need coverage for?** You should plan for a policy to cover you until you retire, until you have paid your debts and have sufficient savings for your family to depend on, or until your [dependents](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp) are self-sufficient. 
  3. **How much life insurance can you afford?** You may have to trim other areas of your budget to get a life insurance policy that meets your needs, or you may need to compromise on the type of policy you get. Look at your other expenses and determine what’s feasible for you to spend each month. If you want [permanent life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanentlife.asp) coverage, consider supplementing that with a term policy to get the death benefit you need at a price you can afford.
  4. **What riders or policy features are important to you?**[Life insurance riders](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/life_insurance_rider.asp) are a way to get more benefits out of your policy. For example, some riders allow you to access a portion of the death benefit while you’re still living if you need it for health-related expenses. Others allow you to stop premium payments if you become disabled. When buying a term policy, you should also decide if you want the option to convert your policy to a permanent one. Some riders may be included at no additional charge while others may cost extra. 


###  Compare Life Insurance Companies 
  1. **Check financial strength:** To ensure the company you choose is financially stable enough to pay your death benefit in the future, consider financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies such as [AM Best](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-m-best.asp). 
  2. **Review customer complaints:** Look up each company’s [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp) complaint index, which shows whether a company received a below-average or above-average number of complaints relative to other companies. A [complaint index](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-the-naic-complaint-index-for-insurance-8685590) of less than 1.00 is ideal—the lower, the better. You may also look at customer reviews on third-party sites like Trustpilot for patterns of complaints. 
  3. **Assess customer satisfaction:** Check the company’s ranking with [J.D. Power’s](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-j-d-power-5025160) most recent U.S. individual life insurance study, which measures customer satisfaction in a variety of areas. 
  4. **Consider available policy types:** Narrow down your options to companies that offer the type of coverage you want in the amount you need.
  5. **Consider riders:** Once you’ve identified which riders you want, see how much they cost with each company and whether any are included at no upfront cost. For example, some companies are much better at including [living benefit riders](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-life-insurance-with-living-benefits-8606326) in their policies than others. 
  6. **Consider the application process:** Many companies offer same-day issue policies that don’t require a medical exam, especially for term and final expense policies. But it could be to your advantage to get an exam if you’re in good health. The cost of life insurance is based in large part on your health and you may not be eligible for the highest health classification with a [no-exam life insurance policy](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance-8773567).
  7. **Get life insurance quotes:** Collect quotes from a handful of life insurance providers. Start by getting online quotes from the companies that offer them, using an insurance comparison website, or calling an insurance broker. 
  8. **Read the fine print:** Before you pay your first premium, make sure you understand the details of the policy and any exclusions. 
  9. **Know how long the free-look period is:** Life insurance companies are required to give new owners a [free-look period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-look-period.asp) during which they can consider policy details and cancel coverage for a full refund, no questions asked. The length of this period varies by state, but is typically at least 10 days.

###  Consult With a Financial Advisor 
If you’re confused about your life insurance options, you may want to [speak to a financial advisor](https://www.investopedia.com/managing-wealth/when-should-you-hire-financial-advisor/) to help you navigate the complexity of selecting a permanent life policy. It’s probably not necessary if you’re young, healthy, and want to buy term life insurance coverage. But a financial advsior can help if you have lifelong dependents and need a permanent policy; if you need help with estate planning; or if you have health issues and are worried about being denied coverage. If you’re also concerned about your retirement planning or other investments, a financial advisor can help you understand your financial picture as a whole. 
## What Is Life Insurance?
A [life insurance policy](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-companies-8763666) is a contract with an insurance company that provides a lump-sum payment to beneficiaries you choose in the event of your death. The policy must be in force at the time of death for the insurer to issue the death benefit. Life insurance comes in both temporary and permanent varieties. It can sometimes be used to supplement saving for retirement. It can also provide access to benefits during your lifetime.
## What Is Term Life Insurance?
[Term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-term-life-insurance-8764257) is a policy of up to 30 or 40 years that provides a payout if you die within the period of time specified by your policy. If you die after the policy expires, your beneficiaries won’t receive a death benefit. Term life insurance is affordable and sufficient for most people’s needs. Some term policies may be convertible to a permanent policy or may come with benefits you can use during your lifetime in certain situations.
## What Is Whole Life Insurance?
[Whole life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-whole-life-insurance-8763569) is a type of permanent life insurance that delivers a death benefit no matter when you die, as long as your premiums have been paid. Premiums are fixed, and part of each premium goes towards building cash value (which you can access while you’re alive). Whole life insurance premiums can cost six to 10 times those for a term life policy with the same face value.
## How Does Life Insurance Work?
[Life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-companies-8763666) starts with a policy application, which may require a medical exam. The insurer will evaluate your age, health, and other factors when setting your premiums. If you’re happy with your rate quote, you’ll then sign your life insurance contract. As long as you pay necessary premiums and die before the policy expires (only for term life insurance), your designated beneficiaries will receive a death benefit.
## How Much Life Insurance Do I Need?
There are a few [rules of thumb](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/insureneeds.asp) to calculate how much[ life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-life-insurance-companies-8763666) you need. One popular method is to multiple your annual income by 10. Another, called the DIME method, is to add up your debt, your income for the number of years you’ll have dependents, the balance of your mortgage, and the cost to send your children to college. Ultimately, you’ll need to evaluate your individual financial situation and your budget when deciding how much life insurance to buy.
