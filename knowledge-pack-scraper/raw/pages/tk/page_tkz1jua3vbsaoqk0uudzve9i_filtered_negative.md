### GEICO vs. AAA: pricing by credit score
---|---|---
Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
If you're dealing with an [at-fault collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, GEICO could be a better choice than AAA. However, it's important to keep in mind that each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you better and provides the most savings.
---|---|---
---|---|---
Aside from affordability, GEICO and AAA each come with pros and cons, including their customer satisfaction ratings, discount programs, policy add-ons and financial stability. Be sure to weigh these elements and [see personalized quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) before deciding.

While both companies are major providers of auto insurance, GEICO and AAA also sell [home insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/). They also have one thing in common — these insurers offer homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under their own banners. That said, both companies provide a variety of coverage types with plentiful [add-ons](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/) that many homeowners may find appealing, depending on their needs and budget.

AAA's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,296 per year, or $108 per month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for [homeowners quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance/) from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
Based on the data we have available, **AAA has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $108 per month**.

[Home insurance discounts](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/home-insurance-discounts/) are a great way to save money on your premiums. While both companies offer discounts, AAA provides more options for saving. It's also important to note that there may be more options for discounts through GEICO's or AAA's partner companies.

I'm sorry to hear about the damage (and the sweater!). The good news is that since you are in California, glass claims should not impact your premium.
