## GEICO vs. Farmers: car insurance rate comparison
In an effort to simplify the comparison process, we've collected average rates from Farmers and GEICO. These rates cover an array of pricing components, including credit rating, driving history and age. Take a look at these rates to help you in your search for an affordable policy. Keep in mind, however, that your rates are likely to be different than our samples — these premiums should be used as a jumping-off point so you know what a fair car insurance quote looks like.

Want to learn more about these two companies? Read our full reviews of [GEICO](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) and [Farmers](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/farmers-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/).
Cheapest average rates
GEICO has the most affordable rates overall on average. However, this can vary from person to person according to the rating factors companies use to generate estimates. This is why it's always a good idea to [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) from many different insurers to see which policy is best for you.

On average, GEICO offers cheaper rates than Farmers for drivers at every credit level. Check out average insurance costs by credit level for Farmers and GEICO:
##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: FARMERS VS. GEICO
**Credit level** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $2,051 | $2,633  
Fair (580-669) | $1,358 | $1,736  
Good (670-739) | $1,485 | $1,882

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### GEICO vs. Farmers: rates for high-risk drivers
If you have infractions like an [at-fault collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/) or reckless driving violation in your driving history, GEICO could be more budget-friendly for insurance coverage than Farmers. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't hesitate to shop around to figure out which insurer is best for you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: FARMERS VS. GEICO
**Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $2,334  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $1,699  
DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $3,239  
Reckless driving | $2,238 | $4,636  
Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $2,045  
### GEICO vs. Farmers: rates by age
Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.
According to our data, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Farmers: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $3.010 compared to Farmers. At all ages, GEICO was the cheapest.
##### RATES BY AGE: FARMERS VS. GEICO
**Age bracket** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $3,508 | $6,518  
**20s** | $1,438 | $2,020  
**30s** | $1,218 | $2,020  
**40s** | $1,189 | $1,511  
**50s** | $1,160 | $1,507  
**60s** | $1,065 | $1,402  
Costs aside, GEICO and Farmers both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Make an informed decision by getting quotes and [comparing rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before finalizing a policy.

### Which company comes out on top?
#### Farmers
* * *
Both GEICO and Farmers can provide customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Farmers. Farmers' extensive list of coverage options and affordable rates secure this company the win here.

### GEICO vs. Farmers: home insurance rate comparison
Farmerss [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,455, or just under $121 a month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates will vary from one company to another. This is because every insurance company has different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will weigh factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home differently.
For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate. While cost is an important factor when shopping for homeowners insurance, it's most important to have good coverage from an insurer that you can trust.
Cheapest average rates
Based on the data we have available, **Farmers has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $121 per month**.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

Generally you can't remove a household member from your policy unless they have their own separate insurance coverage. You should have the option to exclude your son from the policy if you don't want him to impact your rate, but that means he will not be covered to drive any of the vehicl…
