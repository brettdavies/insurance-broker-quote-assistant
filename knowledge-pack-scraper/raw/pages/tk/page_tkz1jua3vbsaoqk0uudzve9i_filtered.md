Perhaps best known for its roadside assistance programs, AAA also offers car insurance to its members. In most cases, coverage is not provided by AAA themselves, but through partner companies. AAA simply acts as an intermediary, meaning that coverage options and experiences can be vastly different based on location.

## GEICO vs. AAA: car insurance rate comparison

Choosing a [car insurance company](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) can be tough: companies' rates differ by [driving history](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/), [age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) and [location](https://www.thezebra.com/states/). GEICO and AAA are two of the most popular insurers, providing competitively priced policies in most states.

In an effort to simplify the comparison process, we've collected average rates from AAA and GEICO. These rates cover a variety of pricing components, including credit rating, driving history and age.

![Cheapest average rates]()

Cheapest average rates

GEICO has the cheapest rates overall on average. However, this can vary from person to person, so it's always a good idea to [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) from many different insurers to see which policy is most affordable.

---

### GEICO vs. AAA: pricing by credit score

If you have [very poor credit](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/), GEICO could be the way to go. On average, GEICO offers more affordable rates than AAA for drivers with credit scores that dip below 580. Drivers with outstanding credit — a score of 800 or better — should consider GEICO as well, for an average savings of $1,750 per year compared to AAA. View common insurance rates by credit level for GEICO and AAA below.

##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: AAA VS. GEICO

| **Credit level** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **AAA avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Poor (300-579) | $2,051 | $6,569 |
| Fair (580-669) | $1,358 | $4,023 |

### GEICO vs. AAA: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're dealing with an [at-fault collision](/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, GEICO could be a better choice than AAA. However, it's important to keep in mind that each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you better and provides the most savings.

##### RATES BY CITATION: AAA VS. GEICO

| **Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **AAA avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $4,078 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $4,002 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $5,530 |
| Reckless driving | $2,238 | $5,530 |
| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $4,078 |

### GEICO vs. AAA: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of AAA: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $6,748, compared to AAA.

##### RATES BY AGE: AAA VS. GEICO

| **Age** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **AAA avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $3,508 | $10,256 |
| **20s** | $1,438 | $4,644 |
| **30s** | $1,218 | $4,644 |
| **40s** | $1,189 | $3,195 |
| **50s** | $1,160 | $3,083 |
| **60s** | $1,065 | $2,887 |

Aside from affordability, GEICO and AAA each come with pros and cons, including their customer satisfaction ratings, discount programs, policy add-ons and financial stability. Be sure to weigh these elements and [see personalized quotes](/car-insurance-quotes/) before deciding.

## Ratings comparison: GEICO vs. AAA

When looking for a new auto policy and deciding on an insurance provider, the cost shouldn't be the only thing to compare. Positive scores from customers and third-party rating agencies can help you find an insurance company that provides fair rates and great customer service. To help, we've found a variety of ratings of both GEICO and AAA to help you determine each company's customer satisfaction level, number of complaints and state of its fiscal health.

That said, both companies provide a variety of coverage types with plentiful [add-ons](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/) that many homeowners may find appealing, depending on their needs and budget.

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Tie

---

Both GEICO and AAA can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because neither company doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's difficult to say which insurer comes out on top because your experience may differ depending on which company you are paired with. For that reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.

---

### GEICO vs. AAA: home insurance rate comparison

AAA's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,296 per year, or $108 per month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for [homeowners quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance/) from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.

![Cheapest average rates]()

Cheapest average rates

Based on the data we have available, **AAA has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $108 per month**.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology

These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.
