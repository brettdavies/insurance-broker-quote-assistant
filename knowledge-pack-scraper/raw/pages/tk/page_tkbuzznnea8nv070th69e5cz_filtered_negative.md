## GEICO vs. Farmers: car insurance rate comparison
Because companies' rates differ by so many factors, including [driving history](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/), [age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/), [location](https://www.thezebra.com/states/) and more, choosing a [car insurance company](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) can prove challenging, which makes it all the more important to compare their pros and cons.
Want to learn more about these two companies? Read our full reviews of [GEICO](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) and [Farmers](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/farmers-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/).

Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
If you have infractions like an [at-fault collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/) or reckless driving violation in your driving history, GEICO could be more budget-friendly for insurance coverage than Farmers. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't hesitate to shop around to figure out which insurer is best for you.

Both Farmers and GEICO offer [homeowners coverage options](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/). These can be purchased as individual policies or bundled together with auto or other coverage types. It's important to note that GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner.

Because of its robust policy options and reasonable rates, Farmers remains a popular option for homeowners insurance. The company earned roughly average reviews from various third-party reviewers and consumers and placed 7th overall for homeowners insurance in [The Zebra's Customer Satisfaction Survey](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/).

Both GEICO and Farmers can provide customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Farmers. Farmers' extensive list of coverage options and affordable rates secure this company the win here.
* * *
Your individual rates will vary from one company to another. This is because every insurance company has different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will weigh factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home differently.
For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate. While cost is an important factor when shopping for homeowners insurance, it's most important to have good coverage from an insurer that you can trust.
Based on the data we have available, **Farmers has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $121 per month**.

Sorry to hear about your accident. If you have comprehensive coverage, it should cover any damages caused by debris. However, just like collision coverage, it will usually have a deductible. I would suggest using our claims calculator to see if it's worth filing a claim or simply paying for the dam…
