* ### How Bankrate chose the best home insurance companies in Texas

  Caret Down Icon 

  To find the [best home insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) in Texas, Bankrate first analyzed average homeowners insurance premiums obtained from Quadrant Information Services for the largest insurance providers in the state. However, price is only one feature of a home insurance policy; we also reviewed each company’s coverage offerings, discounts, customer satisfaction scores, complaint indexes, financial strength ratings and digital tools.

  We combined each of these metrics into our proprietary Bankrate Score model. The Scores are on a scale from 0.0 to 5.0, with higher scores indicating that a company scored better within the individual metrics. Our methodology was specifically created to help you gain a well-rounded view of each company.

## Common Texas home insurance problems

Acquiring home insurance in Texas isn't always straightforward. Given the state's predisposition to various natural calamities and its vast territorial expanse, insurers may often approach policies with caution. This unique blend of factors can sometimes make it challenging for homeowners to find comprehensive coverage at affordable rates.

Some common issues Texas homeowners might encounter include:

* **Higher premiums**: Homeowners may see increased rates due to frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes and hail storms.
* **Flood insurance gaps**: Standard policies don't cover flooding, which is common throughout Texas. To be financially protected from flood damage, you’ll need a separate policy.
* **Wind coverage**: If you live along the Gulf Coast, your home insurance policy may not cover wind damage. In that case, you’ll need to purchase wind insurance separately.
* **Limited coverage in certain areas**: Insurers might offer limited coverage or charge higher premiums in areas particularly prone to events like wildfires or coastal storms.
* **Claim delays**: After widespread events, the sheer volume of claims might lead to delays in processing and payouts.
* Policy non-renewals: In high-risk areas, some insurers may decide to [nonrenew policies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/get-home-insurance-after-non-renewal/), forcing homeowners to seek coverage elsewhere

## Cheapest home insurance companies in Texas

The Lone Star State can pose some challenges for homeowners seeking insurance. However, there are still insurance providers that offer competitive rates without compromising on coverage.

Home insurance rates are known to fluctuate frequently, but you can rely on Bankrate to offer you the latest options available. These are sample rates for comparative purposes only. Your quotes will differ.

### How to get cheap home insurance in Texas

Finding the best home insurance in Texas for your needs at a [cheap rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-choose-cheap-home-insurance/) may take extra research. Insurance premiums tend to be higher in areas prone to extreme weather, and Texas is no exception. From ice storms and tornadoes in the north to wildfires and hurricanes in other parts of the state, home insurance coverage needs and prices may vary drastically depending on the risk in your area. Here are some strategies you can use to help you find a lower premium:

* **Shop around**: Getting quotes from multiple insurance companies can help you find cheap coverage since rates can vary widely by company. Shopping online, working with an insurance broker or local agent or calling around are a few ways to get home insurance quotes.
* **Apply discounts**: While many carriers offer common discounts, some may be unique to certain companies. When gathering quotes, check out what discounts are available with each company to maximize savings.
* **Fortify your home**: You may be able to get a cheaper premium if you have a home security system, fire alarms and other safety features installed on your property. These risk-mitigation measures are often rewarded by homeowners insurance companies because they reduce your likelihood of needing to file a serious claim. Even a DIY security system with window alarms and cameras could help you nab savings.

### Best home insurance discounts in Texas

Discounts are an easy way to lower your homeowners insurance premium. Below are some [common discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) Texas homeowners may qualify for:

* Advanced quote: Existing homeowners who switch companies in advance (before their existing policy expires or renews) may qualify for an advanced quote or early shopper discount with some providers.
* Home security: Homeowners with active and monitored security systems may qualify for extra savings with a home security discount.
* Bundling discount: Bundling discounts can offer significant savings with many insurance companies. Homeowners shopping for cheaper home insurance may want to consider what savings they may earn if they get their auto insurance coverage with the same carrier.
* Claim-free: Homeowners who have not filed a property insurance claim in the past may be eligible for a claim-free discount. Some insurers require you to be claim-free for at least three to five years to qualify.

### How to save on home insurance policy renewals in Texas

Year after year, as homeowners confront policy renewals, many wonder how they might obtain better rates or discounts without sacrificing crucial coverage. In Texas, with its unique set of challenges and risks, leveraging certain strategies could result in [potential savings on home insurance renewals](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/keep-home-insurance-cost-down/). Here are some actionable steps you can consider:

* **Compare quotes before your policy renews**: Don't just auto-renew without taking a moment to consider other potential insurance options. Compare rates from different insurers to ensure you're getting the best deal. Remember, insurance markets evolve and premiums can vary from one provider to another.
* **Bundle policies**: Many insurers offer discounts if you bundle multiple policies with them, such as [auto and home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/).
* **Increase your deductible**: Opting for a higher deductible can reduce your premium, but ensure it's an amount you can afford out of pocket in case of a claim.
* **Maintain good credit**: Insurers often use credit history to help determine premiums. Having a positive credit history might get you a better rate, so taking steps to improve your credit-based insurance score can be worthwhile.

* ### Does my homeowners insurance policy include additional living expenses?

  Caret Down Icon 

  If you are unable to live in your home due to a covered loss, your home insurance policy can help with the extra costs if you’re displaced. These typically include lodging, food, laundry bills and even pet boarding. You usually have around 20 to 30 percent of your dwelling limit earmarked for additional living expenses.

* ### Why is Texas home insurance so expensive?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Home insurance costs are, broadly speaking, a reflection of an area’s risk. Homes in higher-risk locations — ones that are more prone to natural disasters, theft and other covered losses — are usually more expensive to insure. Texas’ hurricane-prone weather makes damage more likely, and therefore drives home insurance policy costs up.

### Bankrate Scores

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto and home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [NAIC](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/), were analyzed.
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
