Active-duty military and veterans can usually get more affordable car insurance with a military discount. Compared to most [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts), this one is hard to find and is available from only a few insurance companies. Some insurers may offer the discount only in select states.
GEICO offers military members up to 15% savings on their auto insurance premiums, but availability may vary by coverage type and state. It’s among the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance) companies overall, according to our research. GEICO also offers a long list of other discounts to help you lower your costs and scores relatively high in our [head-to-head ratings](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies).
Here’s more information on the GEICO military discount, including who qualifies, how to get it, and other ways to save.
## **What Is the GEICO Military Discount?**
![Woman using calculator and reading documents and receipts](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/813b9e63cd/woman-with-calculator.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Members of the military community have been insuring their vehicles with GEICO since 1936. The insurance giant offers a special [military discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/military-discount) for active-duty, retired, and honorably discharged military service members that can lower your [car insurance premiums](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium) by up to 15%.
But GEICO doesn’t stop there. It has a dedicated military team to answer any questions or concerns about your policy, your discount, or how your service or discharge will affect your insurance. GEICO’s Military Center is also available to help you before, during, and after deployment, including pre-deployment checklists and helping you reintegrate into civilian life.
Next, we’ll discuss how to qualify and sign up for the GEICO military discount.
## **GEICO Military Discount Eligibility Requirements**
GEICO offers a military discount to active-duty and retired military members, including National Guard and Reserves members. You can qualify from any of the six military branches, including:
  * Air Force
  * Army
  * Coast Guard
  * Marine Corps
  * Navy
  * Space Force


Active-duty soldiers, reservists, National Guard members, honorably discharged, and retired military veterans can qualify for savings with auto insurance through GEICO.
GEICO is already one of the cheapest auto insurance companies, so it’s worth [getting a quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) if you currently have insurance elsewhere. It also has several other military-specific discounts, which we discuss in more detail below.
Here’s how easy it is to sign up for the GEICO military discount.
## **How to Sign Up for the GEICO Military Discount**
![Man wearing a cap driving truck](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/79aa1d3484/man-with-a-cap-driving.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
You can sign up for the GEICO military discount when applying for a new car insurance policy or by adding it to your existing one. Although several policy service options are available online and through GEICO’s mobile app, you have to call customer service or visit your local GEICO agent to apply the military discount to your policy.
You should expect to provide proof of current or past military affiliation, such as your current Department of Defense (DOD) orders or separation paperwork (i.e., a DD-214 form) if you received an honorable discharge or retired.
## **GEICO Military Discount vs. the Competition**
If you’re part of the military community, chances are you can qualify for GEICO’s military discount. It’s one of a few companies offering military-specific savings.
The table below shows how GEICO compares to other insurers offering a military discount for eligible members and military families, according to our research.

---|---|---  
[USAA](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/usaa) | Savings for storing your vehicle on base | Up to 60%  
[Direct Auto](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/direct-general) | Available for active service members in [Alabama](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/alabama), [Florida](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/florida), and [Louisiana](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/louisiana) | Up to 25%  
[GEICO](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico) | Provides savings for active-duty and retired military members | Up to 15%  
USAA | Discount on [comprehensive coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/comprehensive-insurance) when garaging your vehicle on a military base | Up to 15%  
[Liberty Mutual](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/liberty-mutual) | Available for active-duty military members, veterans, and reservists | Up to 10%  
[Farmers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/farmers) | Affinity savings available for active-duty, reserves, honorably discharged, and retired service members | Up to 10%  
Armed Forces Insurance | Savings for active-duty and retired military, DOD civilian employees, and their immediate families | Varies  
Though USAA and Direct Auto offer a larger military discount, not everyone will qualify for coverage. For example, USAA only provides 60% savings when you store your car on base and don’t drive it. And Direct Auto only offers up to 25% savings in three states.
We found that GEICO offers better savings on your total insurance premium than other insurers with a military discount.
