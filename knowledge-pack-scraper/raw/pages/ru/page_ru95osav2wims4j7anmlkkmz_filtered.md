## About USAA home insurance

4.8[NerdWallet rating](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/usaa-home-insurance-review)

### Where USAA home insurance stands out

**Generous coverage.** USAA includes identity theft insurance in its standard policies, along with [replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) for your belongings. These types of coverage often cost extra from other insurers.

**Few consumer complaints.** The relative lack of complaints to state regulators suggests that most USAA policyholders are satisfied with their coverage.

**Perks for military homeowners.** Unique offerings from USAA include coverage for personal belongings destroyed by war and deductible-free insurance for your uniform.

### Where USAA home insurance falls short

**Limited availability.** USAA’s restricted eligibility is its main drawback. It’s not open to the general public, only to active military, veterans, employees of some federal agencies and their families.

## What USAA home insurance covers

These types of home insurance coverage generally come standard:

* ### Dwelling

  [Dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) pays to repair or rebuild the structure of your home after a covered event. It also covers attached structures, such as porches.

  **Typical amount**: Enough to rebuild your home.
* ### Other structures

  [Other structures coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/other-structures-coverage) pays to repair or rebuild stand-alone structures on your property, such as a fence or shed.

  **Typical amount**: 10% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal property

  [Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance) pays to repair or replace stolen or damaged belongings. Personal property coverage comes in one of two options: [actual cash value or replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

  **Typical amount:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Loss of use

  [Loss of use coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage), sometimes known as additional living expenses coverage, helps pay temporary living expenses while your home is being repaired. This can cover hotel stays, home rentals and meals.

  **Typical amount**: 20% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal liability

  [Personal liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-liability-insurance-homeowners) pays if you injure someone or cause property damage unintentionally or through neglect.

* ### Medical payments

  [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners) pays to treat someone injured on your property, regardless of who’s at fault. It also pays if you, a family member or a pet injures someone away from your home.

  **Typical amount**: $1,000 to $5,000.

For more details, see [What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance)

USAA home insurance includes the coverage above, plus:

**Replacement cost coverage****.** If your belongings are damaged or stolen, USAA will generally pay the cost to replace them with new items rather than the depreciated value. USAA includes this coverage standard rather than charging extra for it, as many insurers do.

[**Identity theft coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance)**.** If you’re a victim of identity theft, USAA will cover up to $5,000 to pay expenses to restore your good name.

**Home-sharing coverage.** This coverage pays for damage that occurs when you rent out a room or your entire home on sites such as Airbnb.

**Military uniform coverage.** If your uniform is damaged or stolen during a covered event and you’ re on active or reserve duty, USAA will reimburse you without a deductible.

**Wildfire Response Program.** This program is free to homeowners in certain Western states at high risk of wildfires. If your home is under threat, firefighters from the program may take preventive measures or fight active fires on your property.

Not all coverage is available in all states.

### Optional USAA home insurance coverage

Depending on where you live, you may be able to customize your USAA home insurance policy with the following types of coverage:

**Extra insurance for valuables.** Items like jewelry, musical instruments and fine art may need additional coverage. Learn more about [jewelry insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/jewelry-insurance).

[**Flood insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance)**.** USAA can help you get a flood policy from the federally funded National Flood Insurance Program or through a private insurer. Learn the difference in our guide to the [best flood insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/best-flood-insurance).

[**Earthquake insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance)**.** This coverage may be worth adding if you live in an at-risk area.

**Home Protector coverage.** This upgrade includes extra coverage for debris removal and bringing your home up to the latest building codes after a claim. It also comes with additional dwelling coverage in case it costs more than expected to rebuild.

[**Water backup coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage)**.** If a drain backs up or your sump pump fails, this optional coverage can pay for the damage.

**Personal injury coverage.** This type of insurance can protect you financially if you’re accused of libel, slander or defamation.

### What’s not covered

Like other home insurers, USAA doesn’t cover damage from flooding or earthquakes in its standard policies. In certain high-risk areas, it may also exclude coverage for wind damage, requiring you to buy that insurance separately.

**» MORE:** [10 kinds of damage home insurance won’t cover](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-insurance-exclusions)

## More Nerdy Perspective

Construction costs often go up due to increased demand for labor and building supplies after a disaster. That could leave you underinsured if your dwelling coverage limit isn’t high enough. Adding [extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost) can offer a financial cushion.

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. USAA scores highly on this measure, drawing a low proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

**Third-party ratings:** USAA receives high ratings for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study.[1] Because of its limited availability, USAA is not eligible to be ranked, but it received the highest overall score out of all the insurers rated by J.D. Power. It also scored highly in J.D. Power’s 2025 Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[2]

* ### What Reddit users say about USAA home insurance

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like home insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  Reddit comments about USAA homeowners insurance tend to be negative, with many complaining about hefty premium increases. (As some posters note, home insurance prices have gone up across the board in recent years due to inflation and natural disasters.)

  Other people report problems getting homeowners insurance claims resolved, often due to a lack of communication from USAA representatives. Thanks to issues like these, some Redditors say they’ve left USAA after decades of membership. However, other USAA members speak up in the company’s defense, saying they’ve had good service and their rates are still reasonable.

## How to file a claim with USAA

You can file a claim on the USAA website, through the app or by calling 800-531-8722. You can track your claim through the site's claims center.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are USAA’s rates going up so much?

Various factors affect how much you pay for home insurance, including where you live, the size of your house, your credit and your claims history. Broader economic trends matter, too. For example, if an insurer loses money in a particular state due to [wildfires](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/wildfire-insurance), it may raise rates for everyone in that state. Inflation has also made it more expensive to repair or rebuild houses, and insurance rates have gone up in response.

See what to do if you [can’t afford your homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/cant-afford-homeowners-insurance).

### Does USAA home insurance cover mold?

USAA typically won’t pay for damage related to mold or dry rot, but you may have limited coverage if the cause of the mold is a disaster covered by your policy. Mold coverage differs from state to state and may depend on which endorsements, or add-ons, you have on your policy. Learn more about [homeowners insurance and mold](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold).

### Will I have trouble getting or keeping a USAA policy if I’ve filed multiple claims?

You might. The more claims you have on your record, the less appealing you are as a customer to insurance companies. Insurers may raise your rates or refuse to cover your home at all after multiple claims. To avoid this, consider paying for minor home damage yourself instead of filing smaller claims.

### Does USAA home insurance cover roof replacement?

USAA will pay to replace your roof if it has been damaged in a covered disaster, regardless of the roof’s age. The company will pay the full reconstruction cost after repairs have been made using similar materials and build quality to what’s already on your roof. Learn more about [homeowners insurance and roof leaks](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-leaks).

### Does USAA home insurance cover tree removal?

It depends. If a tree falls on your home, USAA will generally pay to remove the tree from the structure to make repairs. Coverage to get the tree off your property may be more limited — often up to $500 for one tree or $1,000 total.

### Does USAA home insurance have restrictions on dog breeds?

USAA doesn’t restrict the type of dog it will cover under the liability portion of your homeowners policy. But if the animal has a history of aggression or property destruction, it may not be eligible for coverage. Learn more about [homeowners coverage for dog bites](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-cover-dog-bites).

### Does USAA cover manufactured or mobile homes?

USAA works with a partner company, Foremost, to insure manufactured and mobile homes. Learn more about [mobile home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/mobile-home-insurance).

**Star rating methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts, claims process and website functionality. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or star ratings.

Here’s how we weighted each category to come up with our list of the best home insurance companies:

* Consumer experience (40%).
* Financial strength (30%).
* Coverage (25%).
* Discounts (5%).

**Homeowners insurance rates methodology**

NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from various insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each U.S. state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

In states where credit is a rating factor, we changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for homeowners with poor credit.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
