A real-world example of misleading consumer experiences in entertainment comes from a recent case involving**[pop icon Madonna.](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/03/madonnas-legal-nightmare-fans-sue-over-habitual-lateness-in-explosive-miami-concert-case/)** Fans sued the singer for habitual lateness at her concerts, arguing that the late shows amounted to false advertising. In the case of her Miami concert, attendees were left waiting over 90 minutes past the advertised start time, leading them to feel misled and deceived about the terms of their purchase. This case raises questions about whether consumers deserve protection from misleading advertising, even when it involves the entertainment industry.
