Compare Quotes

Allstate and State Farm have a lot in common. They’re two of the largest home insurers in the U.S., with policies available across most of the country, and they each offer a wide range of coverage options to choose from. They’ve been around for a while, too — State Farm was founded in 1922, while Allstate sold its first policy in 1931.

The main difference between Allstate and State Farm home insurance is how each company covers the structure of your home. State Farm generally includes an extra cushion above your dwelling limit in case rebuilding costs more than expected. Allstate offers similar coverage but charges extra for it.

Read on to learn about other differences between Allstate and State Farm homeowners insurance, including rates, consumer complaints and policy perks.

## Get home insurance quotes in minutes

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

## Availability

State Farm and Allstate homeowners policies are available across most of the U.S. However, Allstate isn’t selling new homeowners policies in California, Connecticut or Florida. State Farm isn’t offering new coverage in California, Massachusetts or Rhode Island.

## Coverage

State Farm and Allstate have many coverage options to choose from, but State Farm’s default policy tends to be a bit more generous; it includes an extra 20% of [dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) on top of the amount you select.

Dwelling coverage is the part of your policy that covers the structure of your home. It reflects how much it would cost to rebuild the house if it’s destroyed. So if you’ve chosen a dwelling limit of $300,000, having the extra 20% will give you an additional $60,000 to spend if rebuilding costs more than you expect. It’s a useful cushion, especially in times of high inflation.

Allstate also offers this coverage, but it costs a bit more than the basic policy.

Both companies cover your personal property on a [replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) basis. That’s a more generous type of insurance than [actual cash value coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value), which offers a smaller claim payout for older items that have lost value over time. With replacement cost coverage, you’ll receive enough money to buy brand-new versions of your damaged belongings.

### Optional coverage

Beyond what’s included, both companies offer a variety of ways to add coverage to your policy. Options depend on where you live, but Allstate and State Farm generally offer the following types of coverage:

* **[Water backup](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage)**, for sewers and drains that back up or sump pumps that fail.
* **[Identity theft](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance)**, for expenses associated with recovering your identity.
* **[Extra coverage for valuables](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/scheduled-personal-property)** such as jewelry, collectibles or musical instruments.
* **[Service line](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/service-line-coverage)**, in case of damage to an underground water, power or other utility line on your property.
* **Green/energy-efficient improvements**, to upgrade to more eco-friendly or efficient materials after a covered claim.

These are just a few of the many coverage options available. Some vary from one company to the next, but your exact choices depend on where you live and whether you get a quote online or through an agent.

For example, State Farm offers [equipment breakdown coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/equipment-breakdown-coverage-homeowners) to pay for failures of heating, cooling or other home systems — an option we didn’t see when getting quotes online from Allstate.

If you’re interested in a particular type of coverage, speaking directly with an agent may be your best bet.

### How to compare coverage

Each company has its own formula for estimating your home’s rebuilding cost, or dwelling coverage limit. In some cases, the difference in recommended coverage may be significant.

For instance, we got online quotes from Allstate and State Farm for the same house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Allstate recommended about $666,000 in dwelling coverage, while State Farm came up with a coverage limit of about $417,000, plus an extra 20% cushion (an additional $83,400 of coverage for the structure of the home). Added together, State Farm would give you about $500,000 in dwelling coverage for the same home.

When comparing prices, take differences like these into account. If you see wide discrepancies, consider getting a few more quotes or chatting with an independent agent to figure out the right amount of coverage you’d need to rebuild your home.

## Perks

Depending on where you live, you may be eligible for extra benefits from both companies. For example, in most states, State Farm offers Ting service to policyholders at no cost. Ting is a smart device that plugs into an outlet and alerts you to electrical problems that could lead to fires.

Allstate policyholders can also take advantage of useful benefits, though they’re available only in the company's more inclusive coverage packages. These include:

* **Claim RateGuard.** Your rate won’t go up if you file a claim.
* **Claim-Free Rewards.** Get 5% back for each year you go without filing a claim.
* **Deductible Rewards.** Get $100 toward your deductible when you sign up, plus an extra $100 for each year you go without a claim. The maximum reward is $500 off your deductible.

Did you know...

A [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible) is the amount of a claim you’re responsible for paying. Say you have a $1,000 deductible. If you file a claim for $5,000 worth of damage to your home, the insurer would pay $4,000, and you’d cover the rest.

## Discounts

State Farm and Allstate have a variety of ways for homeowners to save on their policies. Allstate lists more of them on its website, making it easier to figure out which ones you might be eligible for. No matter which company you choose, discounts vary by state.

Allstate homeowners may be able to save by:

* Having recently bought a home of any age.
* Setting up automatic payments.
* Installing devices that protect against theft or fire.
* Applying for a new policy at least seven days before the coverage starts.
* Strengthening their home against wind damage.

State Farm advertises only a few discounts on its website. However, others may be available to you when getting a quote online or from an agent. For example, you may be able to save by:

* Bundling home and car insurance.
* Installing home monitoring systems, such as fire, smoke or burglar alarms.
* Having a roof made of impact-resistant materials.
* Fortifying your home against wind or wildfire damage.

State Farm’s policies cost $2,185 per year, on average, while Allstate charges an average of $2,380. These sample rates assume dwelling coverage of $300,000, liability coverage of $300,000 and a $1,000 deductible. Our sample homeowner had good credit and no recent claims.

Even when we adjusted the dwelling coverage amount, State Farm was often cheaper than Allstate. Below are the average annual rates for each company for a variety of coverage amounts.

| --- | --- | --- |
| $200,000 | $1,745 | $1,770 |

| $400,000 | $2,895 | $2,560 |
| $500,000 | $3,455 | $3,100 |

We also checked how the companies’ rates stack up for several common scenarios. State Farm was the cheaper option for homeowners with a recent claim or a brand-new house (built in 2024). Meanwhile, Allstate was cheaper for those with poor credit.

Numbers below reflect average annual rates for $300,000 of dwelling coverage, $300,000 of liability coverage and a $1,000 deductible.

| Scenario | Allstate | State Farm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brand-new house | $1,520 | $1,040 |
| One recent claim | $2,685 | $2,385 |
| Poor credit | $3,920 | $5,185 |

Although State Farm was cheaper in most of our tests, Allstate offers more discounts — so it could end up being the more affordable option for you. We recommend getting quotes from at least three insurance companies to make sure you find the best deal for your home.

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Neither company has a clear advantage here. Both State Farm and Allstate draw an average rate of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**

**Websites:** State Farm and Allstate have robust websites where you can get a quote, pay your bill, learn insurance basics, and file or track claims. One nice feature of the Allstate site is a live chat, available 24/7. Meanwhile, State Farm has a virtual chatbot that can connect you to a live representative if you enter your policy information.

**Homeowners insurance star ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer experience, coverage and discounts. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [full ratings methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-home-insurance) for home insurance.

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Homeowners insurance rates methodology**

NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from various insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

We used the same assumptions for all other homeowner profiles, with the following exceptions:

* For homeowners with a claims history, we added a single wind damage claim.
* For homeowners with newer homes, we changed the year the house was built to 2024.
* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for homeowners with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good” credit.
* To see the effect of changing your dwelling coverage amount, we changed the limit to $200,000, $400,000 or $500,000. This also changed some of the other coverage limits that were tied to the dwelling coverage amount. For example, the other structures coverage limit is typically 10% of the dwelling coverage amount, so our sample policy with $200,000 of dwelling coverage had $20,000 of other structures coverage.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.
