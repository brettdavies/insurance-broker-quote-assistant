I used to work at an agency that sold [Auto Owners](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Auto+Owners+insurance&cId=65af1403-255a-4255-8bbb-11d7a8cc36af&iId=76bfac34-4a6c-4bcd-a19b-b0a7b8213cd2). They are an excellent company. They had strict eligibility guidelines, but if you qualified, they were hard to beat, similar to [Erie Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Erie+Insurance+comparison&cId=9b6b3997-d3fc-4049-ba77-654fefd3168a&iId=a86abe81-6a74-402f-a192-f4a3678e9089). Their sweet spot is middle-to-mature aged drivers so you sound like an ideal customer.

They really just want people over 30 pretty hard. They are heavily a preferred risk, 'affluent suburb' oriented company.
Great claims handling in my experience, I have almost my entire extended family with them for personal and business lines, (one is with Travelers because we don't have an appointment in his state for AO)

Agent here who also sells auto owners in Tennessee (mostly Commercial but I do Personal as well). Yes, their homeowners policies are top-tier if you fit their guidelines. They have a _ton_ of optional coverages offered, and one of the biggest selling points is the optional Guaranteed Replacement Cost coverage. They are an excellent company. Their claims handling is also excellent and they typically have claims offices in multiple locations in each state they write in.
Their auto coverage is very good and prices are very competitive if you fit their "type" of client.
Their umbrella is also very good. They are also one of the few standard carriers out there that will allow a different company's policy as underlying coverage for their umbrella, as long as underwriting approves the other carrier's coverage forms and your other policies have to meet their minimum liability limits.
The only thing - they are VERY particular about non-payment cancellations so _make absolutely sure_ you pay your bill on time. Automatic payments are highly recommended if you don't pay in full (which they also give you a decent discount for if you do). If you cancel for non-payment, in my experience they give you one chance for reinstatement if it's within a certain time frame, and if you non-pay cancel again, you'll be blacklisted from being rewritten to their company.

I am an independent agebt in Pennsylvania and Aut-Owners is far and away my favorite carrier to deal with. They have been around forever and I believe are A+ rated. This has been a hard insurance market and they have been very stable through tgis time. Its hard to tell how a claim will ne handled until it actually happens and honestly alot depends on the adjuster i really dont think one carrier handles claims better than others. The policy is as good as the contract you are signing and if the price is good its a no brainer. Ask your agent questions. Know what you are buying, dont let hypothetical claim handling hold you back.
Also, dont trust reviews of insurance carriers, nobody wrotes a good review because they did their job.

The mid-market insurers hire adjusters who have some stripes on their sleeve. They offer a more welcoming, happier place to work versus the intellectual sweat shops that are the big insurers. In doing so, they have a more experienced and generally happier corps of adjusters, and that translates in to better customer service.

I've had [Auto-Owners](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Auto-Owners+insurance+reviews&cId=f03fafbd-1080-4bc2-8ce8-5f8472faacfa&iId=899e2d4c-b258-4c11-b184-fb0276ba82cf) for almost 20 years and I love them. My rate increases have been very reasonable and the service fantastic.
I've had 1 total loss, 1 fire claim, and 1 at fault accident with my boyfriend driving and even then, my increase was minimal.
The adjusters have been friendly and efficient. I think my longest claim was the fire and that was because of vendors.
Their website is easy to navigate. Yes, having an agent can be a pain, but it is worth the peace of mind. I would highly recommend them.

By that, I meant not being able to call and talk to them directly. I love my agent, but he isn't available 24/7 like some insurance companies are.

My elderly mother had a horrible experience with Auto Owners after her Georgia home was destroyed by Hurricane Helene. We cut them some slack due to the scope of the disaster and them being busy, but they were a disaster in their own right: not returning calls, authorizing only band-aid fixes that didn't meet local building codes, disputing amounts they had previously approved, failing to show up for meetings with structural engineers. Thankfully, we had saved all correspondence and texts and held their feet to the fire. I've dealt with several claims of my own with another carrier, and those were a walk in the park compared to this fiasco. They are not licensed in my home state, and I can see why.

Auto Owners is a great company. Super easy to deal with and yes, great rates. I put a lot of business with AO. Most of my partners are with AO and most of our agency’s business is with them. It just simply sounds like you’re their target client. Also, I sell in NC too under a non-resident license and they’re very competitive there. So yes, very legit, and a good company. I’d move forward with it.

Independent agent here. Auto-Owners is hands down my favorite company and where I have my own home and auto insurance despite them not being the cheapest option for me. What I’ve seen of them is just that good. Highly recommend.
I would add that in cases where they beat the competitors by this much, it’s usually because you have an excellent insurance score. They rate heavier on insurance score than any other company I’m acquainted with. As mentioned above, they definitely have a demographic they pursue and you sound like you’re part of that. Take advantage of it.

5+ years with Auto's, just me, basic coverage, clean record, 58 years old, paid off coverage for year, they came back at renewal with almost $4K, went back to Geico, much lower & added renters insurance & STILL lower. Insurance agents get commission, mine was useless & on mute & not looking out for me, so I dropped them.

Did you go with it? I am having the same issue—Auto Owners’ quote for our five vehicles was literally half what we are currently paying. Suspiciously cheap indeed!

20+years and counting. No problems with them at all. Not sure why people don't understand that ALL insurance companies are about the same when it comes to rates. They all know what the competition gets. If you get a low quote, it won't last, believe me. Auto insurance is expensive because of several factors, not the least of which is numerous accidents due to overcrowded streets. There's just a lot more cars, expensive cars, on the road being driven by stupid people. We all have to pay for the intellectually challenged drivers out there.

Somebody can maybe provide some information on claims experience with the company, but I wouldn’t be skeptical of the rate being wrong and changing later because it is so much lower, if that’s a concern of yours.
Sometimes you just fit the favored demographic of a specific insurer, which is likely the case here.

Google the company's claims handling and financial stability. Check what type of loss settlement provisions auto-owners offers. I've never heard of that company, myself.

I love Auto Owners (I have them as my personal home insurer although my auto is with travelers) and they are my favorite company to write with. If your rates are this good, after the huge rate increases we have already went through, you are good.
