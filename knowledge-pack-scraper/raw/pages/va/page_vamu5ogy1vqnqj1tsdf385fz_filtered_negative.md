##  What Is an Insurance Premium?
##  Understanding How Insurance Premiums Operate
When you sign up for an [insurance policy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/insurancecontracts.asp), your insurer will charge you a premium. This payment keeps your policy active. Policyholders may choose from several [options for paying their insurance premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fa-profession/091916/what-mode-premium.asp). Some insurers allow the policyholder to pay the insurance premium in installments—such as monthly or annually—while others may require an upfront payment for each full year before any coverage starts.1
##  Factors Influencing the Calculation of Insurance Premiums
###  Determining Auto Insurance Premiums
For example, the likelihood of a claim being made against a teenage driver living in an urban area may be higher than a teenage driver in a suburban area. Similarly, younger and newer drivers carry a greater risk of being involved in an accident than older, more experienced drivers. In general, the greater the [risk ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/082616/elements-insurable-risks-quick-guide.asp)associated, the more expensive the insurance premiums.
###  Calculating Life Insurance Premiums
In the case of a life insurance policy, the major factors the company looks at in pricing coverage are an insured's risk of [mortality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortality-table.asp), the interest it expects to earn by investing your premium, and the expenses it will incur.3 The age at which you begin coverage will determine your premium amount, along with other risk factors (such as your current health). The younger you are, the lower your premiums will generally be. Conversely, the older you get, the more you pay in premiums to your insurance company. High-value policies will also carry a higher permium.
###  Understanding Health Insurance Premiums Under the ACA
The [Affordable Care Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp) (ACA) of 2010 spelled out a number of rules that regulate how insurance company can set determine the premiums they charge. For companies that offer coverage through the [ACA Health Insurance Marketplace](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/health-insurance-marketplace.asp), there are five major factors that insurances can use to set rates: age, category of insurance plan, your geographic location, tobacco use, and whether the enrollment covers an individual or a family. Marketplace plans must also charge men and women the same rates, and cannot take your health history into account.4
##  Insights Into the Premium-Setting Process
Once premiums are determined, insurers use this revenue from their customers to cover liabilities associated with the policies they underwrite. They may also invest premiums to generate higher returns. This can offset some costs of providing insurance coverage and help an insurer keep its prices competitive in the marketplace.
While insurance companies may invest in assets with varying levels of [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and returns, they are required to maintain a certain level of liquidity at all times. State insurance regulators set the number of liquid assets necessary to ensure insurers can pay claims.
##  Strategies for Finding Economical Insurance Premiums
An actuary assesses and manages the risks of financial investments, insurance policies, and other potentially risky ventures. Actuaries assess particular situations' financial risks, primarily using probability, economic theory, and computer science. Most actuaries work at insurance companies, where their risk-management capabilities are particularly applicable in determining risk levels and premium prices for a given insurance policy.
