| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auto | $1,500 | $375 | 25% |

| Total premium; pre-discount | $2,500 | – | – |
| Premium with discount | $1,935 | $565 | 23% |

The best deals are for safe and accident-free drivers, but many don't even consider your driving record and are granted for simply paying in advance or online.
* **Compare home and auto insurance quotes annually**. Be sure to compare home and auto insurance quotes from at least three companies for the same insurance coverage at least once a year.
