# Additional options for customers in need of a rental or replacement vehicle

State Farm is fortunate to have relationships with vendors who help our customers recover after devastating events such as the recent wildfire activity.\*  To support our customers:

* A special Enterprise Rent-A-Car rental rate is available at certain Southern California neighborhood locations on select cars and SUVs through the following [link](https://partners.rentalcar.com/state-farm).
* In need of a truck or van? Enterprise Truck Rental is offering a special rental rate that is available at certain Southern California neighborhood locations on select vehicle types through the following [link](https://www.enterprisetrucks.com/truckrental/en_US/promotions/state-farm-policyholders.html?mcid=response:45079454&CID=SFCAFRL.).
* For these rentals, Enterprise is waiving its young renter fee, additional driver fee and one-way drop fee. Renter must meet standard Enterprise rental requirements for each vehicle type.
* Enterprise Car Sales is offering $500 off the purchase of a vehicle at certain Southern California dealerships.

Participants will be asked to provide insurance policy number at point of purchase.
* California customers with questions about this opportunity should contact their State Farm agent.

\*Enterprise benefits are available independent of the State Farm Car Policy benefits and the availability of the Enterprise benefits do not impact insurance coverage under the State Farm Car Policy.
