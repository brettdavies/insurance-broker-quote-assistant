[ Regulatory  ](https://saifr.ai/blog/tag/regulatory)
Each state’s laws cover essentially the same topics, with varying language and details on the specifics. To assist state regulators and encourage more state-by-state uniformity, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) creates and publishes [Model regulations](https://content.naic.org/model-laws) on common issues. The NAIC is a non-governmental organization made up of the chief insurance regulators from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.[](https://content.naic.org/model-laws)
* This does not prevent an insurer from advertising that a consumer can get a “free” quote or download information at “no cost.”
* This would prohibit an insurer from including in an advertisement negative information about a competitor.
* This limits an advertisement from claiming that their agents will assist a consumer with a complete financial plan, including life insurance.
* This is particularly relevant in advertising Medicare Supplemental insurance policies.
How does an insurer know if an advertisement contains a misrepresentation? Although consumer products can freely claim to be ‘best,’ ‘five star,’ or ‘new and improved,’ in the regulated world of insurance advertisements, superlatives can be a misrepresentation. Instead, insurance advertisements need to be precise. Each statement should be verified for accuracy, and references that involve statistics or ratings should include information about the source.
