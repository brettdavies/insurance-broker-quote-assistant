When you are constructing a commercial building, it's important to choose the right type of construction based on your needs. Joisted Masonry, which uses durable masonry walls and wood or steel for floors and roofs, offers cost efficiency and moderate fire resistance. This makes it suitable for a range of buildings like schools and shops.

On the other hand, Masonry Non-Combustible construction uses materials like concrete and metal throughout, providing higher fire resistance and greater durability. This is a very good option if you prioritize safety and long-term savings on maintenance and insurance. Understanding these differences helps you make a strategic decision that aligns with your business needs and improves the safety and longevity of your property.

  

## Joisted Masonry Construction

Joisted Masonry construction is defined by its use of masonry materials such as:

* Adobe
* [Brick](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/masonry/brickwork/philadelphia/)
* [Concrete](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/concrete/philadelphia/)
* Gypsum block
* Hollow concrete block
* Stone
* Tile

A notable feature of this construction type is the combination of masonry elements with combustible materials for exterior walls of masonry and floors and roofs made of combustible materials like wood. Adding a degree of fire resistance also introduces combustible elements into the structure.

Although masonry elements enhance fire resistance and structural stability, combustible materials can accelerate the spread of fire and heat during an incident, which may lead to building instability. Hence, it is crucial to comprehend the effects of these combustible elements when contemplating Joisted Masonry construction for your commercial property.

## Masonry Non-Combustible Construction

On the other hand, Masonry Non-Combustible construction is characterized by using slow-burning or non-combustible materials for floors and roofs supported by load-bearing masonry exterior walls. This makes masonry non-Combustible buildings particularly resilient, offering enhanced protection against fires and ensuring overall safety for structures and inhabitants.

Buildings with exterior walls classified as Type 2 and Type 3 require non-combustible exterior walls constructed of:

* Brick
* [Masonry](/services/contractor/masonry/philadelphia/)
* Concrete block
* Precast panels

This style of construction, marked by its exceptional fire resistance and structural stability, provides a sturdy solution for commercial properties across diverse sectors.

## Comparing Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible Buildings

Choosing between Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible construction types comes down to understanding their differences in fire resistance, structural stability, and insurance implications.

#### **Fire Resistance and Structural Stability**

Joisted Masonry buildings feature exterior masonry walls with floors and roofs made of combustible materials, offering moderate fire resistance, typically around one hour. In contrast, Masonry Non-Combustible constructions use non-combustible materials like concrete and metal throughout, resulting in higher fire resistance and increased safety. This makes Masonry Non-Combustible a better choice for businesses that prioritize fire safety and structural durability.

#### **Insurance Implications**

The construction type of a building significantly impacts insurance rates and coverage. Masonry Non-Combustible buildings often benefit from lower insurance premiums due to their reduced fire risk and greater durability. On the other hand, Joisted Masonry buildings, with their mixed use of materials, may face higher premiums depending on factors like building use, location, and implemented safety measures.

#### **Summary of Insurance Coverage**

While both construction types offer various insurance options, Masonry Non-Combustible buildings align well with policies such as property and business interruption insurance due to their high safety profile. Joisted Masonry buildings might require broader insurance coverage due to their use of combustible materials.
