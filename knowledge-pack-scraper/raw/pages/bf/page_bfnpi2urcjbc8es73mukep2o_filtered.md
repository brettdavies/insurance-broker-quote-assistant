United Financial Casualty Company is a good option for small business owners who need specialized vehicle insurance coverage. We don't recommend it for personal use, even if you sometimes earn money driving your car. For instance, if you drive your vehicle part-time for Uber or Lyft, you might be able to get coverage through your personal auto insurance company at an additional cost that could be lower than a separate policy.

You might consider a policy with United Financial Casualty Company if your vehicle is used only for business purposes — i.e., you wouldn't drive your limousine to your kids' soccer practice after conducting your business or use the company delivery truck to run errands.

United Financial Casualty Company is also a good choice if you have employees driving your vehicles or need additional business coverage, such as general liability and workers' compensation. We only consider the company's commercial auto insurance for this review.

## United Financial Casualty Company pros and cons

Pros

* Customize your insurance coverage for your business needs with different add-on policies
* Smart Haul program allows truck customers to save through driving data sharing
* Free fleet management software for businesses with over three vehicles covered

Cons

* Hard to pull a quote if you don't have an established business
* Can't be chosen as your specific underwriter on a Progressive commercial policy

## How much does United Financial Casualty Company cost?

If you run a small business, such as a hauling company or food truck, standard auto insurance companies won't have the necessary policies to protect you, your employees, and your business.

Trying to pull a sample quote from United Financial Casualty Company is difficult without an established business since Progressive needs to determine risk to build a policy. You'll need to request a quote over the phone to get an idea of how much your insurance will cost.

You can start by getting a [free quote](https://www.progressivecommercial.com/commercial-auto-insurance/) from the Progressive Commercial website (since the United Financial Casualty Company is a subsidiary). Once you see your rates, you'll be able to make a payment and complete the sign-up process online.

Keep in mind that you can't select United Financial Casualty Company as your underwriter — Progressive works with more than one subsidiary for its policies.

In addition to your payment information, you should have the following information on hand to get an accurate quote:

* Your USDOT number, if you have one
* Information about:

+ Your business, such as how it's structured
+ The business owner, such as name, address, and date of birth
+ Each vehicle covered in the policy, such as the VIN, make, and model
+ Each driver covered in the policy, such as driver's license number

It's also possible to complete this process by phone by calling 1-888-806-9598.

According to Progressive, these were the national average costs for its commercial customers in 2023, the most recent year for which data is provided by the insurer:

* $257 per month for commercial auto insurance for contractors, landscapers, and painters
* $270 per month for commercial auto insurance for business customers (e.g., cleaning services, restaurants, and shops)
* $767 per month for specialty tow truckers to $1,041 per month for transport truckers

Compare these numbers to the national averages below to get a rough idea of how expensive commercial auto insurance through United Financial Casualty is in comparison to standard, liability-only personal car insurance.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **National average liability-only monthly premium** | **National average full coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $105 | $192 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $141 | $265 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $146 | $274 |
| DUI on driving record | $166 | $313 |
| Teen driver | $194 | $364 |
| Senior driver | $85 | $160 |

## Is United Financial Casualty car insurance good?

**Company ratings:**

* AM Best: A+
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: Not ranked
* BBB: Not rated
* NAIC complaints: 0.58 (commercial auto)

United Financial Casualty gets an A+ for financial strength from AM Best. The subsidiary is not rated independent of its parent company Progressive by either J.D. Power or the Better Business Bureau, but it does register at 0.58 on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index.

The NAIC complaint index compares insurance providers based on how many complaints they receive relative to a given year's study average across the industry. The NAIC calculates this by dividing the company's share of complaints by the total countrywide, with the national index set at 1.00, which means that a company with an index of 2.00 would have twice the expected number of complaints.

United Financial Casualty's 0.58 index for commercial auto is therefore a solid indicator of a positive customer service experience. However, its parent company, Progressive, doesn't have the best customer reputation on platforms like Trustpilot and the BBB. This is important to consider since you'll indirectly be doing business with Progressive if you get insurance with United Financial Casualty Company.

## Discounts

It's tough to confirm whether or not you can get discounts on policies underwritten by United Financial Casualty and for what, but it's always worth working with a representative from your insurer to see if there are any ways you can save on your auto insurance policy.

[Progressive](https://financebuzz.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review) itself offers a range of discounts to personal auto insurance customers, so it can't hurt to ask if you're interested in pursuing a commercial policy.

### Snapshot ProView and Smart Haul

One possible way to save on your policy, though, is by enrolling in Progressive's commercial telematics program, Snapshot Proview. According to Progressive, business owners can save, at minimum, 5% on their policy when they sign up for Snapshot ProView, which uses a device plugged into the diagnostic port to track a vehicle's speed, location, and other metrics.

All commercial auto policyholders are eligible for the program, but business owners are not eligible to use Snapshot ProView on trucks with an Electronic Logging Device. Businesses that enroll three or more vehicles in Snapshot ProView get access to complimentary fleet management tools. Businesses with only one or two vehicles enrolled receive monthly safety scorecard emails.

For trucks that do have an Electronic Logging Device, Progressive's Smart Haul program offers business owners a chance to save on insuring vehicles in their fleet. Progressive claims that new truck customers save an average of $1,056 on their policy using Smart Haul.

## United Financial Casualty vs. competitors

Progressive isn't the only major insurance provider that also offers commercial policies. But as with policies underwritten by United Financial Casualty, it can be difficult to tell how much a commercial policy from a company like GEICO or Liberty Mutual will end up costing you without going through the quote process.

That being said, let's look at what other major insurers offer to prospective commercial auto insurance customers to get an idea of how they stack up.

[GEICO](https://financebuzz.com/geico-auto-insurance-review) also offers a commercial telematics program called DriveEasy Pro that uses a plug-in device to monitor fleet efficiency and a road-facing dashcam to record any incidents. GEICO doesn't offer any savings estimates for enrolling in DriveEasy Pro.

### United Financial Casualty vs. Liberty Mutual

[Liberty Mutual](https://financebuzz.com/liberty-mutual-auto-insurance-review) offers commercial auto insurance for small businesses that use one or more company-owned, personal, or leased vehicles for business purposes. They don't provide much info on their specific offerings, but note that policies typically include coverage for liability, medical expenses, collision coverage, comprehensive coverage, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.

## United Financial Casualty Company specialty coverage
