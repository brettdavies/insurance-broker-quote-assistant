Renters insurance can be easy to forget. Unlike car insurance, it’s not required by any state laws. And it may seem like just another monthly bill you’d rather not pay.
But if you want insurance for problems like fire and theft, you’ll want renters insurance. We crunched more than 29,000 renters insurance rates and found that you can often buy coverage for about $13 a month.

## How Much Does Renters Insurance Cost?
**Renters insurance costs an average of $153 a year** for a policy with $15,000 of personal property coverage. The average cost of renters insurance for a policy with $30,000 is $202 annually, and a $50,000 policy costs an average of $269 a year.
## How Much Is Renters Insurance in Your State?
The average annual renters insurance cost by state varies—as little as $89 a year for $15,000 of personal property coverage in Wyoming to $349 a year for the same coverage in Rhode Island, based on our analysis.
How much you pay for renters insurance depends on several factors, including where you live, past claims you’ve made and your credit (in states that allow credit as a pricing factor). For example, if you live in an area that is prone to severe weather or has high crime, you’ll typically pay higher rates.

## Factors Affecting Renters Insurance Rates
There are multiple factors that dictate your renters insurance cost, including your location, coverage limits, deductible and claims history.
### Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value Coverage for Personal Property
Whether your renters insurance policy uses [replacement cost or actual cash value (ACV)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost-vs-actual-cash-value/) coverage affects your premiums.
If your belongings are stolen or damaged, ACV coverage takes into account depreciation and will pay you only the current value of the items. Replacement cost coverage is a more expensive option, but it will pay to replace your items with similar, new items.
### Your Coverage Amount
The amount of personal property coverage you choose influences your rates. This coverage limit typically begins at $15,000. That might be enough, but if the cost of replacing your possessions exceeds that amount, you can buy more coverage.
Coverage amount  |  Average annual cost  |  Average monthly cost
---|---|---
$15,000 |  $153 |  $13
$30,000 |  $202 |  $17
$50,000 |  $269 |  $22

Source: Quadrant Information Services. Rates include a $500 deductible, $100,000 in liability coverage and $1,000 in medical payments coverage.
*USAA renters insurance is available only to the military, veterans and their families.
See More See Less
### Your Deductible
An [insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/insurance/insurance-deductible/) is the amount of money deducted from the insurance check if you file a claim. For example, if you have a $500 deductible and your claim is $5,000, you’ll get an insurance payment for $4,500.
Renters insurance deductibles commonly range from $250 to $2,000. The higher your deductible, the less you’ll pay in premiums. That’s because your insurance company will pay out less if you file a claim.
### Your Claims History
A renters insurance company will take a look at your recent claims history when setting your rates. If you’ve filed claims in the past, expect higher premiums.
### Your Credit
Insurance companies make a correlation between credit and the likelihood that people will make insurance claims. The higher your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-insurance-score/), the lower your chances are of filing a claim, which means lower rates (except in states that ban the practice).
Credit-based insurance scores are similar to other credit scores and look at:
* Past payment history
* Current levels of debt
* Length of credit history
* New credit/pursuit of new credit
* Types of credit used
Credit tier  |  Average annual cost for $30,000 in renters insurance
---|---
Poor |  $623
Below fair |  $377
Fair |  $271
Good |  $202

Rates are for policies with a $500 deductible, $100,000 in liability coverage and $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

### Dog Ownership
Some renters insurance companies will exclude certain dogs from coverage or tack on a surcharge. This could happen to you if you have a:
* Trained attack dog
* Dog with a history of biting
* Unneutered male dog
Specific dog breeds, including Doberman pinschers, pit bulls, Rottweilers and wolf hybrids, are also often among the [dog breeds banned by insurance companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/banned-dog-breed-lists/). Not all insurers have lists of banned dog breeds.
### Coverage Limits for Renters Insurance
One of the biggest factors that will affect your renters insurance cost is how much coverage you buy. Renters insurance can be broken down into three main components.
### Types of Coverage Within a Renters Insurance Policy
Component of renters insurance  |  What it covers  |  How to determine how much coverage you need
---|---|---
[Personal property coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-coverage/) |  Damage or theft of your belongings, such as furniture, clothes and other items. |  A [home inventory](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/home-inventory/) can help you estimate your coverage needs.
Liability insurance |  Property damage and injuries you accidentally cause to others, and your legal defense if you are sued. |  The default coverage might be $100,000, but you can typically buy more.
Additional living expenses |  Extra expenses (such as hotel bills) if you can’t live in your apartment due to a problem covered by the policy. |  May be a flat amount or a percentage of your personal property limit, but you can typically buy more.
Medical payments |  Smaller medical bills for people who blame you for an accidental injury, such as a dog bite. |  Policy limits are typically between $1,000 and $5,000.

## How Much Renters Insurance Do I Need?
To determine how much renters insurance to buy, estimate how much coverage you need for your belongings and how much you could lose in a lawsuit. Here’s how to figure out [how much renters insurance you need](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/how-much-renters-insurance-do-i-need/).
### Take Inventory of Your Possessions
Estimate the total value of your belongings to determine how much personal property coverage to buy. You can do this by taking a [home inventory](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/home-inventory/) of all your possessions, including electronics, furniture, clothes and jewelry. Include the estimated price or current value of the items, if possible, age, purchase date and serial number if applicable. Gather any receipts.
### Figure Out a Sufficient Liability Insurance Amount
The liability portion of a renters insurance policy covers accidental property damage and injuries you cause to others. A renters policy may default to $100,000 in liability coverage, but if you need more, you can typically buy more. Make sure you buy enough liability insurance to cover what could be taken from you in a lawsuit.

## Other Renters Insurance Coverage Types to Consider
A standard renters insurance policy includes coverage for personal property, liability, additional living expenses and medical payments to others. But you may want other types of renters insurance coverage to fill any gaps in your policy. Here are some to consider:
* **Bed bug endorsement.** A standard [renters insurance policy won’t cover bed bugs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/bed-bugs/), but your renters insurance company might sell a bed bug endorsement.
* **Cyber insurance.** You may be able to add [personal cyber insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/personal-cyber-insurance/) to your renters policy to cover expenses related to data recovery and system restoration, credit card fraud, cyber extortion and identity theft.
* **Earthquake insurance.** A standard renters policy won’t cover earthquake damage. If you live in a quake prone area, you’ll need to get [earthquake insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/).
* **Flood insurance.** A standard renters policy doesn’t cover flood-related damage. If you want coverage you’ll need to get flood insurance for renters from the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer.
* **Schedule personal property.** A standard renters insurance has “special limits” for the theft of high-value items such as jewelry. If you have valuable items, it’s a good idea to [schedule personal property](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/scheduled-personal-property/) so it’s fully insured for what it’s worth.
## How to Lower Your Renters Insurance Cost
There are many potential ways to save on your premium. Here’s [how to find cheap renters insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/cheap-renters-insurance/).
* **Shop around:** Get quotes from multiple renters insurance companies. Request quotes for the same level of coverage and see which insurer will give you the best renters insurance rates. We found that renters insurance rates can span nearly $300 a year between the cheapest and most expensive policies, based on $50,000 in coverage.
* **Get renters insurance discounts:** You can often shave some money off your renters insurance bill with discounts, such as home safety discounts, payment discounts and loyalty discounts.
* **Bundle renters and auto insurance:** Bundling insurance saves you money when you buy two or more policies from the same company. This is also called a multi-policy discount. An [auto and renters insurance bundle](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/auto-and-renters-insurance-bundle/) will often result in a discount.
* **Increase your deductible:** Renters insurance deductibles often start at $250, but increasing it to $1,000 or more can save you money. Ask the insurer how much you would save by increasing the deductible to see if it’s worth it. If you decide to increase your deductible, try to set aside enough money to have the deductible amount on hand if you need to file a damage claim later.
* **Improve your credit score:** Most states allow insurance companies to use a person’s credit history to set rates. While the use of credit as a pricing factor is controversial, insurance companies often cite a correlation between low credit scores and a higher likelihood that someone will file an insurance claim.
## How Do I Buy Renters Insurance?
When you’re looking to buy renters insurance, your first step is to figure out how much personal property and liability coverage you need. Renters insurance liability coverage often starts at $100,000, but you can increase it if needed.
Once you know what you need, see which insurance companies offer renters insurance in your state. If you have car insurance, check with that company to see if it also offers renters insurance. See how much you can save by bundling the two policies.
You can also request [renters insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/renters-insurance-quotes/) from multiple insurers that offer coverage in your state. Ask for quotes for the same level of coverage and make sure you maximize discounts. You can contact each insurance company, use an online tool that lets you compare prices, or use an independent insurance agent to provide you with quotes from multiple companies.
## Methodology
Average renters insurance rates were calculated using data from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a policy for a 40-year-old single female with good credit and no past claims. Rates are for policies with $15,000, $30,000 or $50,000 in personal property coverage, liability coverage of $100,000 and a $500 deductible.
