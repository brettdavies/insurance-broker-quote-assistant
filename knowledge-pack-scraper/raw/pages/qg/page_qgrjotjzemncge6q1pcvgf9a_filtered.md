## Statutory Basis

Florida’s primary law governing unfair trade practices is the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), codified in Chapter 501, Part II of the Florida Statutes. Modeled after the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), FDUTPA provides broader protections at the state level. It applies to virtually all commercial transactions involving goods, services, or property, whether conducted by individuals or corporations.

Unlike some consumer protection laws that require proof of intent, FDUTPA does not necessitate fraudulent intent, making it easier for plaintiffs to establish violations. The law defines “unfair” practices as those that offend public policy or are unethical, oppressive, or substantially injurious to consumers. “Deceptive” practices involve representations, omissions, or actions likely to mislead a reasonable consumer. Florida courts have interpreted these terms broadly, often relying on Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance.

In PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Property Management, Inc., 842 So. 2d 773 (Fla. 2003), the Florida Supreme Court reinforced that FDUTPA applies to both private and business-to-business transactions. Amendments, such as the 2001 revision, clarified that only actual damages—not consequential or punitive damages—can be awarded. This distinction was highlighted in Rollins, Inc. v. Butland, 951 So. 2d 860 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006), where the court ruled that speculative or indirect losses do not qualify for compensation.

## Prohibited Conduct

FDUTPA prohibits a wide range of deceptive and unfair business practices that could mislead or harm consumers. Courts evaluate whether a practice is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer, often relying on FTC standards and prior case law.

#### False or Misleading Statements

Businesses in Florida cannot make false or misleading statements about their products or services, including misrepresentations about quality, benefits, pricing, or endorsements. A statement is considered deceptive if it is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer, even without intent to deceive.

In Davis v. Powertel, Inc., 776 So. 2d 971 (Fla. 1st DCA 2000), a wireless provider was found liable for failing to disclose that its advertised phones were locked to a specific network. Similarly, businesses cannot falsely claim government approval or misrepresent product quality.

The Florida Attorney General’s Office actively prosecutes deceptive advertising. In 2023, the state reached a $1.25 million settlement with a dietary supplement company that falsely claimed its products could prevent or cure COVID-19.

#### Deceptive Pricing

FDUTPA prohibits deceptive pricing practices such as false discounts, hidden fees, and bait-and-switch tactics. A common violation involves advertising a product at a low price to attract customers, only to claim it is unavailable and push a more expensive alternative.

In State v. Beach Blvd Automotive, Inc., 139 So. 3d 380 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014), a car dealership violated FDUTPA by advertising vehicles at prices that did not include mandatory dealer fees, misleading consumers about the actual cost. Florida law requires that all advertised prices include non-optional fees.

Retailers must also be cautious when using terms like “limited-time offer” or “clearance sale.” If a business advertises a discount but continues selling the product at the same price after the promotion ends, it may be considered deceptive.

#### Other Unfair Methods

Beyond false statements and deceptive pricing, FDUTPA covers a broad range of unfair business practices, including high-pressure sales tactics, unauthorized billing, and failure to honor warranties. A practice is deemed unfair if it is unethical, oppressive, or substantially injurious to consumers.

In Orkin Exterminating Co. v. DelGuidice, 790 So. 2d 1158 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001), a pest control company was held liable for charging customers for services it failed to provide. Similarly, businesses that enroll consumers in subscription services without clear disclosure or make cancellation difficult may face FDUTPA claims.

## Enforcement Authority

The Florida Attorney General’s Office, through its Consumer Protection Division, enforces FDUTPA. It has broad investigatory powers, including civil investigative demands (CIDs), which compel businesses to produce documents, testimony, or other evidence.

If a violation is found, the Attorney General can file a civil lawsuit seeking injunctive relief to stop the unlawful practice. The state can also request restitution for affected consumers and seek civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation—rising to $15,000 if the violation targets senior citizens or disabled individuals.

The Florida Department of Legal Affairs collaborates with federal agencies like the FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to address multi-state deceptive practices. Florida has frequently joined national lawsuits against corporations engaging in deceptive conduct, such as the 2021 settlement with a major pharmaceutical company over misleading opioid marketing.

Local state attorneys also have enforcement authority, particularly in cases affecting their jurisdictions. Some county consumer protection offices, such as those in Miami-Dade and Broward, have actively pursued FDUTPA claims.

## Private Remedies

FDUTPA allows individuals and businesses to file lawsuits when they suffer losses due to deceptive or unfair business conduct. Plaintiffs do not need to prove intent to deceive—only that the practice was likely to mislead a reasonable consumer and caused actual damages.

A successful claim permits plaintiffs to recover actual damages, defined as the difference between the value of what was promised and what was received. Courts have consistently ruled that consequential damages, such as lost profits or emotional distress, are not recoverable. In Rollins, Inc. v. Butland, 951 So. 2d 860 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006), the court clarified that speculative damages or those based on indirect financial harm cannot be awarded.

Plaintiffs may also seek injunctive relief to stop ongoing deceptive practices. If successful, they can recover reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs under Florida law, encouraging consumers to pursue claims even when individual losses are small.

FDUTPA applies broadly to both consumer and business-to-business transactions, as reaffirmed in PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Property Management, Inc., 842 So. 2d 773 (Fla. 2003). This means that commercial entities harmed by deceptive practices can also seek relief.

## Exemptions

While FDUTPA applies broadly, certain industries are exempt to avoid regulatory overlap. Under Florida law, entities regulated by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation and the Public Service Commission, including insurance companies, telecommunications providers, and certain utilities, are generally not subject to FDUTPA claims.

Banks, credit unions, and financial institutions regulated by state or federal agencies are also excluded. These entities are already monitored by agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the CFPB.

Businesses acting in compliance with federal or state law cannot be deemed unfair or deceptive under FDUTPA. In State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Performance Orthopaedics & Neurosurgery, LLC, 278 So. 3d 98 (Fla. 4th DCA 2019), the court ruled that a business following statutory pricing regulations could not be liable.

## When to Seek Legal Counsel

FDUTPA claims can be complex, and consumers or businesses affected by deceptive practices should seek legal counsel early to assess the strength of their claims. Attorneys can help gather necessary evidence, such as misleading advertisements, financial records, or witness testimony.

Businesses accused of violating FDUTPA should also consult attorneys to understand their legal exposure and potential defenses. Some defenses include arguing that the alleged conduct was not misleading or that it complied with existing laws. In some cases, disputes can be resolved through settlements or corrective actions rather than litigation.

Given the potential financial consequences of FDUTPA violations, including restitution and civil penalties, both consumers and businesses benefit from informed legal guidance when dealing with these claims.
