Since then, the U.S. has imposed [**several rounds of tariffs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/insights/tariff-projections-by-model/) that raise the cost of auto parts, thus increasing the cost of repair claims for insurers. Inflation, which was falling early in the year, has ticked up since April.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-1) For insurers, that means the same volume of claims now costs more money to cover. Car insurance companies could raise premiums to align their rates with this additional financial risk.

**Source:** *Insurify analysis of car insurance data and tariffs. Alaska is excluded due to low quote volume.
Extreme weather is also fueling high insurance premiums. Los Angeles County fires in January destroyed as many as 6,300 vehicles, according to estimates.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-2) In 2024, Florida hurricanes led to more than 100,000 auto insurance claims. Hail, prevalent in the Midwest, accounts for about 12% of comprehensive car insurance claims.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-3)
In an optimistic sign for drivers, insurers secured 646 rate cuts in the first half of the year, on track to outpace 2024’s total.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-4) But they still secured more increases than decreases, which is consistent with Insurify’s projections of an average increase by year’s end. The size of that increase will depend in part on the extent to which tariffs influence premiums.

The White House has imposed 25% tariffs on foreign automobiles and auto parts, with certain exemptions, including carve-outs for vehicle content from Canada and Mexico.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-5) In late July and early August, the administration [**announced**](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/business/japan-trade-agreement-us) agreements with Japanese, South Korean, and EU officials to lower the tariff rate on cars and car parts sent to the U.S. from 25% to 15%. Japan is the [**fourth-largest exporter**](https://automotiveaftermarket.org/automotive-parts-imports-country/) of auto parts to the U.S., South Korea is the fifth, and Germany is the sixth.
Insurers, inherently risk-sensitive, are bracing for a hit. In an earnings call, Allstate CEO Tom Wilson said, “If we need to raise prices, we will raise prices just like we did in the pandemic because with our margins, we don’t have a lot of room to absorb [the cost].”[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-6)
In a first-quarter report, Progressive said tariffs and other retaliatory actions could result in “higher-than-currently-anticipated rate increases throughout 2025 and 2026.”[[7]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-7) Since then, however, Progressive [**reported**](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/progressive-reports-profits-rise-in-second-quarter-542901.aspx) a healthy second quarter, supported by improved margins, which could keep premiums stable.

*Due to rounding, the first-half percentage increase and the second-half projected increase may not equal the projected full year-over-year percentage increase in certain states.

Many drivers already felt squeezed by high prices following two years of rapid rate hikes. An [**Insurify survey from May**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/insights/financial-survey-2025/) found that 38% of Americans consider car insurance unaffordable. Looking ahead, Northeastern states like Maryland and New York are likely to start 2026 with the highest car insurance rates in the country.
In mid-2024, Maryland surpassed New York as the most expensive state for car insurance premiums. In the past 12 months, Maryland’s premiums have jumped 20% while the U.S. average has declined by 1%. Much of that increase took place in late 2024 after the state began requiring insurers to provide enhanced underinsured motorist coverage for new policies.[[8]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-8)
Car insurance rates rose rapidly in New York in the second half of 2024, before slowing in early 2025. The average cost peaked at $3,804 in December 2024, with rates dropping by 2% since. New York is a no-fault insurance state, meaning drivers have to pay for personal injury protection on top of liability coverage. [**No-fault states**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/no-fault-insurance/) are also more susceptible to staged accidents and other forms of insurance fraud, which increases insurer losses and drives up premiums.
Frequent vehicle thefts tend to raise car insurance premiums, and the capital has higher vehicle theft rates than any state. In D.C., the vehicle theft rate was 842.4 per 100,000 people in 2024 — nearly double the next entry on the list.[[9]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-9)
Delaware’s rates are already higher than the national average. It has one of the five highest insurer loss ratios in the country.[[10]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-10) The state doesn’t limit the amount of pain and suffering damages a plaintiff can seek in an accident case, which can increase insurer losses and influence rates.[[11]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-11)
South Carolina is one of the most expensive states for drivers because insurers there absorb above-average losses. The state has the third-highest rate of vehicle fatalities per mile driven.[[12]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-12) Heightened hurricane and flood risks also cause insurers to pay out additional claims, which they may try to recover through higher premiums.
[**Auto insurance rates in Rhode Island**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/rhode-island/) have been noticeably volatile lately. The average cost of car insurance rose 17% in the first half of 2025 — the largest increase of any state — from $2,839 to $3,331. That followed a 37% increase in fatal crashes from 2022 to 2023.[[13]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-13)
[**Nevada saw average car insurance rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/nevada/)rise 6% in the first half of 2025 and is likely to see further cost increases as the year continues. Nevada has the fourth-highest loss ratio of any state, as auto insurers pay out about $72 in claims for every $100 they make in premiums. A healthy loss ratio typically falls between $40 and $60 in claims for every $100 made in premiums. Vehicle theft claims can increase insurance costs, and Nevada ranks fifth nationwide with 394 thefts per 100,000 people.[[9]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-9)
The average annual cost of[**car insurance in Michigan**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/michigan/) rose 14% in the first half of 2025 — the second-biggest jump of any state — from $2,742 to $3,131. Michigan is a no-fault state, meaning drivers carry additional protection to pay for their own medical expenses in the event of a collision, which often leads to higher insurance rates. Additionally, Michigan auto insurers have the eighth-highest loss ratio of any state, paying out about $70 in claims for every $100 they make in premiums.
[**Georgia car insurance costs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/georgia/) exceed the national average by about $700 per year. The state has one of the highest estimated rates of uninsured motorists, which can increase risk and raise premiums for drivers with coverage.[[14]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-14) Insurance rates in the state rose 8% in the first half of 2025, and Insurify projects a 4% increase for the second half of the year. Though that projection could go up to 7% depending on how insurers deal with tariffs.

Additionally, Wyoming [**doesn’t require drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/) to carry uninsured motorist or personal injury protection coverage, which can add financial exposure for drivers but contribute to lower rates. The average cost of car insurance has declined 20% since the start of 2025, but Insurify projects prices will increase again later in the year.
[**North Carolina**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/north-carolina/) remains one of the most affordable states for car insurance, with costs declining an additional 12% over the past 12 months. North Carolina is one of the hardest states for insurers to raise rates in, as state regulators have been known to negotiate down proposals for rate increases.[[15]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-15)
[**Maine**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/maine/) has some of the lowest car insurance rates nationwide, but prices have recently trended upward. The average cost of full coverage is up 13% since the start of the year — the third-biggest leap of any state. But premiums in Maine are still relatively affordable. Drivers benefit from the fact that fatal crashes are relatively infrequent in Maine. In 2023, Maine averaged 0.91 deaths per 100 million miles driven — 38% below the national average (1.26 per 100 million miles driven).[[12]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-12)
[**Car insurance rates in Idaho**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/idaho/) have leveled off in recent months, declining 6% since the start of 2025. As of June, the typical cost of full coverage is $910 below the national average. Idaho has the fifth-lowest auto insurance loss ratio of any state, meaning insurance companies don’t feel as much financial pressure to raise rates compared to the average state. It also has the third-lowest rate of uninsured motorists, as of 2022 estimates.[[14]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-14)
[**Hawaii’s rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/hawaii/)[**2024 analysis from R Street**](https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/REVISEDFINAL-r-street-policy-study-no-314.pdf), which can keep costs on the lower end for drivers.
The average cost of [**car insurance in Vermont**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vermont/) has risen 16% in the past 12 months, but drivers there still pay about $700 below the national average for full coverage. Auto insurers in Vermont pay about $59 in claims for every $100 they make in premiums — the lowest loss ratio nationwide. Vermont also has the 10th-lowest rate of fatal vehicle crashes per mile driven.[[12]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-12)
![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/1600x1600/a2f2242662/projection-where-car-insurance-costs-could-rise-most-in-the-second-half-of-2025.png/m/1600x1600/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The average annual cost of insurance in Florida
Severe weather has long plagued the state’s home insurance market, and storm damage also influences auto insurer losses. Drivers filed more than 100,000 auto insurance claims following two major 2024 hurricanes, Milton and Helene.[[16]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-16)
Inflation explains some of the projected increase, but weather also plays a part in auto insurance pricing. In August 2024, a supercell storm near Devil’s Tower caused extensive damage to vehicles and buildings.[[17]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-17) In January 2025, severe winds blew over at least nine semitrucks across the state.[[18]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-18)
The state experiences severe weather, which can increase insurer losses and, consequently, car insurance premiums. In 2024, the state saw 186 hail events and 47 tornadoes, the most tornadoes in a year since 2011.[[19]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-19)
New York is likely to see insurance rates rise 6% by year’s end, and up to 9% if insurers adjust premiums to address tariffs. Severe weather, which increases claims, is one factor contributing to higher cost projections. In July, flash floods submerged roads and vehicles in the New York City area. Central Park saw more than 2.6 inches of rain in one hour, the second-highest figure in the city’s history.[[20]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-20)
Insurify projects that costs in South Carolina could jump 5%, or $160, by year’s end. Insurers received more than 15,300 auto insurance claims following Hurricane Helene in September 2024, paying out about $93 million.[[21]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-21) Tariffs could add a further increase, causing rates to rise an average of 8% rather than 5%.
[**Minnesota car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/minnesota/) rates rose a staggering 58% in 2024, following a year in which meteorologists reported 421 hail events in the state.[[19]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-19) Insurers somewhat backed off from that pricing in the first half of 2025, with the average rate declining 7% from the end of 2024 to June. But extreme weather risks, along with inflation, could cause rates to rise 5% in the second half of the year.
[**Texas**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/) has managed to keep rates steady over the past few months, with premiums sliding 1% since the end of 2024. But the second half of 2025 could throw a wrench in that trend, in part due to hail and floods. Catastrophic flooding in July caused more than 100 deaths, sweeping away homes and vehicles.[[22]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-22)
The state has seen a 93% increase in hail events in the past three years, which can lead to expensive car roof repairs.[[23]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-23) Texas also has the [**second-highest odds of any state**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/insights/hurricane-season-projections/) of facing a major hurricane this season.
By February, car insurance companies had already paid out $73 million in claims in response to those fires.[[24]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-24)
The average cost of [**car insurance in Louisiana**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/louisiana/) fell 5%, or $140, in the first six months of 2025. That trend could flip in the second half of the year. Louisiana is one of the states most vulnerable to hurricanes, which bring storm surge and flooded cars. Hurricane Francine in 2024 caused an estimated $1.3 billion in damage to homes, vehicles, and businesses.[[25]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/#cite-25)
At least twice each year, drivers should review their policies to ensure they have adequate coverage. People living in flood-prone areas, for example, may want to carry comprehensive coverage in addition to liability coverage. Once they know what they need out of their coverage, drivers can use [**insurance-comparison websites**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) to get quotes from various insurance companies.
Beyond that, [**insurers often offer discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) for paying in full at renewal, bundling policies, using paperless communications, or enrolling in telematics programs that track driving behavior.
