That's because 23-year-olds usually have more driving experience than younger drivers, which means they're less likely to get into accidents. Because 23-year-olds aren't as likely to [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim") as younger drivers, insurance companies charge them less.

That's because men are  more likely than women to do risky things while driving, like speeding or driving drunk.
But by age 23, the difference in rates between genders is smaller than it is for [younger drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs"). The older you get, the more even the rates become between men and women.

Every insurance company has its own way of setting rates, which means costs can vary by hundreds of dollars each month for the same coverage. It's a good idea to [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies to see which one has the best price for the coverage you need.
Nearly every car insurance company has at least a few [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") that might help lower your rate. Common discounts for young drivers include [bundling your car and renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or home insurance, having a car with safety features like an alarm and anti-lock brakes, and paying your full annual or six-month rate at once.
