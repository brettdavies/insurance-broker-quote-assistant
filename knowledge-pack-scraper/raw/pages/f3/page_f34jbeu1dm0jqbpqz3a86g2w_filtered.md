## Why Compare Renters Insurance Quotes

### Price & Value Can Vary

Two renters with similar profiles can see different rates and coverage packages from different carriers. Comparing lets you align **price**, **coverage**, and **deductible** with your budget.

### Coverage Fit Matters

From **replacement cost** on personal property to **liability limits** and **loss of use**, matching features to your needs can make a big difference at claim time.

Typical inclusions and limitations

**Often included:** personal property (ACV or replacement cost if endorsed), liability, medical payments, and additional living expenses (ALE).

**Common exclusions/limits:** flood, earthquake, wear-and-tear, and certain high-value items unless scheduled. Availability varies by state and carrier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Can I compare my existing GEICO renters quote with other carriers?

Yes. Use our online tool to compare your GEICO quote against other top-rated carriers side by side. We’ll help you match coverage and limits to get an apples-to-apples view.

Does renters insurance cover roommates?

Policies are typically per named insured(s). Roommates usually need separate policies unless your carrier allows adding them. Check your declarations and ask us first.

Replacement cost vs. actual cash value—what’s the difference?

**Replacement cost (RCV)** pays to replace items new; **ACV** deducts depreciation. Adding RCV can improve claim outcomes on personal property.

How much liability coverage should I choose?

Many renters select $300k–$500k where available. Consider your risk exposure (hosting, pets, etc.) and budget.

How do I get fast proof of insurance for my lease?

Bind via our quote link, then request a **COI** and add your landlord as an *Interested Party* for notices. We’ll send proof promptly.
