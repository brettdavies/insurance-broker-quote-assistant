## Cost of car insurance for 23-year-olds vs. other ages
On average, 23-year-olds pay almost $100 less each month for full coverage compared to 20-year-olds.
That's because 23-year-olds usually have more driving experience than younger drivers, which means they're less likely to get into accidents. Because 23-year-olds aren't as likely to [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim") as younger drivers, insurance companies charge them less.
### Full coverage car insurance rates by age
Age | Monthly rate  
---|---  
[16](https://www.valuepenguin.com/16-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance for 16-Year-Olds") | $714  
[18](https://www.valuepenguin.com/18-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance for 18-Year-Olds") | $532

Full coverage rates are for an individual policy for drivers living in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, four of the most populated states in the U.S.

### Does car insurance go down at age 23?
Car insurance is usually cheaper at age 23 than it is at younger ages. However, if you get your license for the first time when you turn 23, then you'll pay more than others your age because you don't have the same level of experience on the road as more established drivers.
The good news is that rates will continue to drop each year, assuming you don't have any accidents or tickets on your record, until they start to slightly increase again in your 70s and 80s.
## Cost of car insurance for 23-year-olds males vs. females
On average, 23-year-old men pay about 4% more for full coverage car insurance compared to 23-year-old women.
That's because men are  more likely than women to do risky things while driving, like speeding or driving drunk.
But by age 23, the difference in rates between genders is smaller than it is for [younger drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs"). The older you get, the more even the rates become between men and women.
Age | Male monthly rate | Female monthly rate | Difference  
---|---|---|---  
16 | $742 | $685 | 8%  
18 | $556 | $507 | 10%  
**23** | **$264** | **$254** | **4%**  
25 | $223 | $219 | 2%

But if you live in one of these states, your gender won't be used to set your car insurance rates.

  * Hawaii

## Average cost of car insurance for 23-year-olds by state
Car insurance rates change depending on where you live.
In Pennsylvania, a 23-year-old pays an average of $227 per month for full coverage. But in Texas, the same type of coverage costs $286 per month, on average. Variables like cost of living and accident rates in your local area and state will influence whether your car insurance rate will be lower or higher than average.
State | Average rate  
---|---  
[Illinois](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-illinois "/best-cheap-car-insurance-illinois") | $253

## How to get cheap car insurance as a 23-year-old
Rates for 23-year-olds are cheaper than rates for younger drivers, but you can get an even more affordable policy by following a few key tactics. For starters, shopping around for rates and looking for discounts can help lower your bill immediately. Then once you're on the road, driving safely will help keep your rates low over time.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/compare-2)
### Compare rates
Every insurance company has its own way of setting rates, which means costs can vary by hundreds of dollars each month for the same coverage. It's a good idea to [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies to see which one has the best price for the coverage you need.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/piggy-bank)
### Use discounts
Nearly every car insurance company has at least a few [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") that might help lower your rate. Common discounts for young drivers include [bundling your car and renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or home insurance, having a car with safety features like an alarm and anti-lock brakes, and paying your full annual or six-month rate at once.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/car)
### Drive safely
Driving safely doesn't immediately lower your rates, but it helps you keep lower rates over time. If you don't get into accidents and don't get tickets, you won't get charged for being a risky driver. You might also get a safe driving or claim-free discount.
