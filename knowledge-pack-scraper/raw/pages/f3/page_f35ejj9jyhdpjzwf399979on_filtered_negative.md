**Bankrate’s take:** Insurance companies often consider gender when determining car insurance rates. Statistically, certain age groups — particularly younger male drivers — have higher incidences of speeding, accidents and DUIs, which insurers perceive as a heightened risk. These statistics can lead to men typically receiving higher quotes than women. However, as drivers age and their driving records start to outweigh gender-based trends, this gap in rates usually decreases.

**Bankrate’s take:** In South Carolina, [an SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) is a certificate of financial responsibility that proves a driver carries the minimum required liability insurance. It is not an insurance policy itself but rather a form filed by your insurance company with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you have the necessary coverage to drive legally in the state. It might be required if you have a DUI or other serious infraction or infractions on your driving record. Note that some insurers will not write policies for individuals with a DUI, and if this is the case for you, you will need to [shop around](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates/) for another insurer to cover you.
