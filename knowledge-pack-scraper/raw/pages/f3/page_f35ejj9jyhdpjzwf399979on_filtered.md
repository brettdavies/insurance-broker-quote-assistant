## How much is car insurance in South Carolina?

South Carolina drivers pay an annual average of $671 for minimum coverage car insurance and $2,023 for full coverage, which typically includes collision and comprehensive insurance. These rates are below the [national averages](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of $806 and $2,671, respectively. However, [your own rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-calculator/) is based on data that is specific to you, including your ZIP code, driving record and credit history, so your rate is likely to differ.

### Key takeaways

* In South Carolina, drivers pay an average of $169 per month for full coverage car insurance and $56 per month for minimum coverage.
* Young drivers tend to pay higher rates than older drivers, with 18-year-old males having the highest average premium at $6,376 per year for full coverage.
* A DUI conviction in South Carolina can nearly double full coverage premiums.
* Drivers with excellent credit pay around 19 percent less annually for full coverage than those with poor credit.

## South Carolina car insurance rates by city

South Carolina car insurance rates [vary by city](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/), too.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in South Carolina

[Age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) also plays a role in car insurance rates in SC, with younger, less experienced drivers paying the most. Drivers in their 50s and 60s pay the least per year, on average. Gender matters, too. Males tend to pay higher premiums than females due to their increased [statistical likelihood](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of getting into an accident.

The table below shows the average costs for male and female drivers across a range of ages. Note that 16-year-old driver rates reflect adding a teen driver to their married parents’ policy since minors can’t enter into binding contracts.

* Male

**Bankrate’s take:**
Insurance companies often consider gender when determining car insurance rates. Statistically, certain age groups — particularly younger male drivers — have higher incidences of speeding, accidents and DUIs, which insurers perceive as a heightened risk. These statistics can lead to men typically receiving higher quotes than women. However, as drivers age and their driving records start to outweigh gender-based trends, this gap in rates usually decreases.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in South Carolina

If you’re under the age of 18, you’re not legally an adult and can’t buy your own car insurance in most cases. You’ll likely have to be added to your parents’ or guardians’ policy. Older teens and young adults can buy their own policy, but if they’re still members of their parents’ households, it usually makes more financial sense to stay on the family policy (if able). Doing so generally results in a [cheaper car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) premium than if the young driver were to buy their own coverage.

**Bankrate’s take:**
In South Carolina, [an SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) is a certificate of financial responsibility that proves a driver carries the minimum required liability insurance. It is not an insurance policy itself but rather a form filed by your insurance company with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you have the necessary coverage to drive legally in the state. It might be required if you have a DUI or other serious infraction or infractions on your driving record. Note that some insurers will not write policies for individuals with a DUI, and if this is the case for you, you will need to [shop around](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates/) for another insurer to cover you.

## Car insurance rates in South Carolina by credit score

Like most states, South Carolina allows insurers to use your credit rating to help determine your car insurance premiums. Statistically, [drivers with lower credit ratings](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) tend to file more claims, which makes them a higher risk for insurers and results in higher premiums. For example, drivers with poor credit pay 102 percent more than drivers with good credit, while drivers with excellent credit pay 19 percent less.

## How to save on car insurance in South Carolina

When shopping for car insurance in South Carolina, there are a few ways you may be able to save on costs. Finding affordable auto insurance rates may be harder if you have a ticket, accident or DUI on your record, but using these tips may help you get cheaper coverage:

* **Do an annual review:** If it’s been a while since you purchased your policy, you may want to check what coverage types and amounts you’re currently paying for. If your insurance needs have changed, adjusting your coverage types or limits may help you save on your premium. For instance, if your car has significantly lost value over the years, you might switch to minimum coverage and save on your premium.
* **Get multiple quotes:** If you do not want to change coverage but want more affordable car insurance rates, shopping around for quotes and [switching carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/switching-carriers/) may be the way to go. Compare the same coverage types and limits to know which car insurance company offers the best rates for the coverage you need.
* **Increase one or both of your deductibles:** Full coverage car insurance has [two deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/): one for comprehensive and one for collision. The higher your deductibles are, the lower your car insurance rate will likely be — but that does not mean it is the best option for everyone. If you choose to go with a higher deductible, make sure you can pay the full amount out of pocket in case you have to file a claim.
* **Know rates before you buy a car:** One mistake people can make when purchasing a new (or new-to-them) car is focusing only on the monthly [car loan payment](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/auto-loan-calculator/) and not factoring in the cost of car insurance. When shopping for cars, get quotes to compare different makes and models to determine what you can truly afford.
* **Take advantage of discounts:** Most [car insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) are stackable so the savings can really add up if you qualify for several. By bundling auto and home, allowing the insurance company to track your driving habits with a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) or paying your premium up front and in full, you may be able to reduce your car insurance rates.
