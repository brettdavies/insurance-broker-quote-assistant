## Cost of car insurance for 23-year-olds vs. other ages

On average, 23-year-olds pay almost $100 less each month for full coverage compared to 20-year-olds.

That's because 23-year-olds usually have more driving experience than younger drivers, which means they're less likely to get into accidents. Because 23-year-olds aren't as likely to [file a claim](/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim") as younger drivers, insurance companies charge them less.

### Does car insurance go down at age 23?

Car insurance is usually cheaper at age 23 than it is at younger ages. However, if you get your license for the first time when you turn 23, then you'll pay more than others your age because you don't have the same level of experience on the road as more established drivers.

The good news is that rates will continue to drop each year, assuming you don't have any accidents or tickets on your record, until they start to slightly increase again in your 70s and 80s.

## Cost of car insurance for 23-year-olds males vs. females

On average, 23-year-old men pay about 4% more for full coverage car insurance compared to 23-year-old women.

That's because men are 
more likely than women to do risky things
while driving, like speeding or driving drunk.

But by age 23, the difference in rates between genders is smaller than it is for [younger drivers](/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs"). The older you get, the more even the rates become between men and women.

| Age | Male monthly rate | Female monthly rate | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | $742 | $685 | 8% |
| 18 | $556 | $507 | 10% |
