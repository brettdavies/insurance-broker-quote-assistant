[Renters Insurance](https://www.lemonade.com/renters) > [Explained](https://www.lemonade.com/renters/explained/) > How Much Does Renters Insurance Cost
The average cost of Lemonade renters insurance across the U.S. is around $16/month with prices starting as low as $5/month, as of August 2025.*
Meanwhile, the average cost of renters insurance in the U.S. is around $23/month* as of 2025.
![](https://www.lemonade.com/content-hub/car/wp-content/uploads/tldr.svg) TL;DR
Here are some average renters insurance prices across the U.S., as of 2025. These include rates from various insurers, not Lemonade specifically.
---|---
Montana  | $16
Tennessee  | $24
An insurance deductible is the part of the claim that the policyholder retains responsibility for that will be subtracted from any future claims payouts. So if your $1,000 watch were stolen, and you had a $250 deductible, your insurance company would pay you $750.
At Lemonade, a basic renters insurance policy starts at $5/month and includes $10,000 of personal property coverage. However, the $5 minimum will vary depending on the state and risk characteristics where you live. But if, for instance, you decide that your personal belongings are worth closer to $30,000, then you’ll pay more than if your stuff were worth just $10,000.
Different providers will offer different coverages, deductibles and rates, so it’s best to shop around and compare quotes before settling on a policy. While it might be tempting to go with the lowest rate, you also want to pick a provider that meets all of your unique coverage needs. Here are some tips for finding the best renters insurance for your circumstances _and_ your budget:
Min | Max
---|---|---
As you tally, think about the value of your stuff in increments of $10,000 since those are the increments of our coverage limits. So, if you have $18,000 worth of items, you should pick around $20,000 of personal property coverage.
Keep in mind too that if you have any high-ticket items, like a diamond ring or a Sony a7S III camera, you might want to purchase additional coverage for each item. This is known as scheduled personal property coverage, or ‘[Extra Coverage](https://www.lemonade.com/renters/explained/scheduled-personal-property-coverage/),’ as we call it at Lemonade.
_But let’s be clear: Affordable doesn’t have to mean cheap or unreliable._ We’re able to offer such reasonable rates at Lemonade because we use AI and machine learning. AI Maya handles all of our basic customer inquiries, which means we have lowered overhead. But our use of AI doesn’t mean we’ve lost the human touch or forgotten the value of personalized interactions. With Maya taking the lead on the easy stuff, our (human) support team is free to handle your trickier insurance questions, like how to replace a lost engagement ring.
[ GET COVERED WITH LEMONADE ](https://www.lemonade.com/onboarding/start?p=home_us_renters)
Yes, because they require higher coverage limits to fully protect them. Adding Extra Coverage (aka scheduling personal property) for these valuable items will raise your premium to ensure they are adequately covered.
