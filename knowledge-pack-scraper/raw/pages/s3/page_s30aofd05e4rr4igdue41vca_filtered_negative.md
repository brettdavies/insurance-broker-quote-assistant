Full coverage adds [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/), which covers needed repairs if the vehicle is damaged in a crash or by another event.
The cost of car insurance in California can vary widely depending on [factors](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/factors-that-determine-your-car-insurance-rates/) such as:
While our averages are good general guidelines, the actual price you pay for car insurance in California could differ. Before buying an auto insurance policy, take some time to [compare insurance quotes](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/california/) from several insurers.
Two things that won't affect your car insurance premiums in California: your gender and your credit history. California law prohibits insurance companies from considering your gender, your [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/which-states-prohibit-or-restrict-the-use-of-credit-based-insurance-scores/) or your credit history when you apply for car insurance.
As of January 2025, California doubled its minimum liability insurance requirements from their previous amounts ($15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident for bodily injuries and $15,000 for property damage). This has increased the cost of car insurance in California. The state also has a high proportion of [electric vehicles (EVs)](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/electric-car-insurance/), which are typically more expensive to repair and replace—and therefore to insure—than gas-powered cars.
If you're not satisfied with how much you're paying for car insurance in California, comparing car insurance quotes from other providers might help you find the same coverage for less. Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) is a convenient way to gather quotes from multiple top insurance carriers at once.
Even within California, your [location](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/will-car-insurance-change-when-you-move/) affects how much you'll pay for car insurance. Different areas of California have different risks. For example, congested urban areas may have more crime, longer average commutes or heavier traffic, potentially increasing the likelihood of claims. Medical care and car repairs cost more in some cities than others, which can mean higher car insurance costs.

Although California law prohibits insurance carriers from considering [gender](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-gender-impact-car-insurance-premiums/) when setting auto insurance premiums, on average, premiums still differ slightly by gender. The average cost of car insurance for men in California is $2,116 annually or $176 per month. By comparison, women in California pay an average of $2,105 annually or $175 per month for car insurance.

Safe drivers are generally less likely to be involved in [accidents](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-a-car-accident-can-impact-your-car-insurance-rate/) or receive [traffic citations](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/), which typically translates into lower insurance premiums. California drivers with a "clean" driving record that shows no incidents or violations pay an average of $1,954 annually for auto insurance. One moving violation can bring the cost of California car insurance to an average of $2,429. Multiple [car accidents](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-a-car-accident-can-impact-your-car-insurance-rate/) or [serious infractions](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/) like DUIs will have a bigger impact on your auto insurance premiums and could even cause your insurer to cancel your coverage.
The chart below shows how the number and severity of infractions may impact your California car insurance costs. _Incidents_ include things like traffic accidents or insurance claims; _violations_ include moving violations, such as speeding tickets.

Whether you're paying more or less than the average price for car insurance in California, there are several things you can do to [save money on car insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs-now/)—without moving out of state.
Your deductible is the amount you're responsible for paying when you file a car insurance claim. Typically, insurance companies let you choose a deductible between $250 and $2,000. Increasing your [deductible](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-does-car-insurance-deductible-work/) usually reduces your premiums. However, it's important to make sure you can afford to cover the higher deductible in case of a claim. Evaluate the state of your [emergency fund](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-an-emergency-fund/) and other financial resources, and check with your insurance carrier to see how various deductibles would affect your premiums.
Ask your current car insurance company if they offer any discounts you aren't using; then check other providers' websites to see what discounts are available. You might be surprised what savings are available. For instance, you might save money by [bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/), paying your premium upfront, going paperless or setting up automatic payments.
Add-on insurance such as rental car reimbursement, windshield replacement or [roadside assistance coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/is-roadside-assistance-worth-it/) can be nice to have, but isn't always necessary. When you're looking to save money, dropping these extras could lower your car insurance premiums. For instance, if your family has several cars, you may not need coverage for a rental car while your car is in the shop due to a claim.
You may also want to consider dropping [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/) if your car is paid off and isn't worth very much. Collision and comprehensive coverage won't pay out more than the vehicle's value; if that's only a few thousand dollars, the coverage may not be worth the cost. Just make sure you could afford to replace or repair your vehicle out of pocket if it's totaled.
The more miles you drive, the greater your risk of being involved in an accident. California allows insurance companies to consider your [annual mileage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-mileage-affect-car-insurance/) as one of the three main factors determining your car insurance premiums, so reducing your mileage could also reduce your insurance bill.
Look for ways to [cut your mileage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-drive-less-and-lower-car-insurance-costs/), such as carpooling, biking or switching to remote work if your employer allows. Driving fewer than 12,000 miles annually could qualify you for low-mileage car insurance discounts, which track your mileage through self-reported or third-party odometer readings or devices installed in your car. You can also explore [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-pay-per-mile-auto-insurance/), which charges a monthly base rate plus a per-mile charge for each additional mile.
Insurance companies that sell policies in California can evaluate your driving record as one of the top three factors in setting your premiums. However, California law prohibits insurers from using telematics to track your [driving habits](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/can-i-lower-car-insurance-rates-with-safe-driving-apps/) and monitor how safely you drive. Instead, you'll want to focus on maintaining a clean driving record. Going without citations or accidents can help lower your insurance costs. Taking a defensive driving or safe driving course could earn you a discount on car insurance too.
[Comparing quotes](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-compare-car-insurance-rates/) from a variety of insurance carriers could uncover lower rates on auto insurance. Make it a habit to shop around at least once a year. You can get car insurance quotes by visiting insurance company websites or by contacting insurance companies directly. If you'd like an easier way to explore your options, you can use Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). It collects car insurance quotes from multiple top insurance companies in California so you can see which carrier offers the lowest rates.
