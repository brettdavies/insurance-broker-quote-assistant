The main Nationwide NAIC number is 23779. Nationwide’s NAIC number is the five-digit code given by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which assigns numbers to authorized insurance providers in order to track customer complaints and ethics violations across state lines.

With Nationwide’s NAIC number, anyone can learn more about the company’s financial data, the kinds of complaints that have been filed by customers, and any enforcement actions taken against the company. Customers will need Nationwide’s NAIC number to report fraud or file an insurance claim, as well.

Although the main Nationwide NAIC number is 23779, the NAIC has assigned a separate code for each of Nationwide’s affiliate companies, which are listed below. You can find the number that applies to your particular policy on your Nationwide insurance card.

Keep in mind that Nationwide's NAIC insurance codes are not the same as the three-digit numbers assigned to Nationwide by the department of motor vehicles in each state. These numbers are codes issued by a state’s insurance commissioner to companies that are authorized to sell policies in that state. They aren’t standardized nationwide like NAIC codes.
