## Home insurance requirements in New York

In New York, there is no state law that requires homeowners to purchase home insurance. However, if you have a mortgage on your home, your mortgage lender will almost certainly require that you have a homeowners insurance policy.

This requirement allows the lender to protect their investment. What’s more, if you stop making payments on your homeowners insurance or drop your coverage altogether, mortgage lenders can take action against you to recover the amount that they loaned you.

Law or no law, purchasing home insurance always makes a lot of sense. Even if your New York home is paid in full, you can be protected against potential damage to your property or belongings from events like [fire](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/home-fire-safety-tips), [theft](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-home-insurance-cover-theft) and severe weather.

### **How does winter weather in New York** **affect my rate?**

Your state’s exposure to weather plays a significant role in how much your homeowners insurance costs. Anyone who calls New York home knows that winter weather can be tough on a house, especially in upstate areas. Heavy snowfall, [ice storms](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-ice-storms) and [freezing temperatures](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/look-temp-drops) can lead to hazards such as [frozen pipes](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/prevent-frozen-pipes) and [ice dams](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/ice-dam-prevention). As a result, homeowners insurance in New York can cost a little more than it does in other states.

### **Does home insurance cover ice-related damage?**

Generally speaking, a standard homeowners insurance policy will cover a loss if it cannot be prevented, or if it occurs suddenly and accidentally.

Another example is if a guest injures themselves on your icy driveway. The personal liability part of your homeowners insurance could cover the cost of their medical bills and any lost wages, if you were responsible for the incident. Even if you weren’t responsible, your medical payments insurance could cover costs related to their injuries.

Additionally, the dwelling coverage portion of your homeowners policy may cover the cost to repair damage caused by ice dams and frozen pipes.
