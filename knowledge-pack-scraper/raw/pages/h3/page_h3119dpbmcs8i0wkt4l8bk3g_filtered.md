Progressive car insurance customers pay an average of $549 per year for coverage. Progressive's car insurance rates are based on your driving record and experience, along with factors like the type of car you drive, your ZIP code, your insurance history, and more.

Progressive is so cheap because it offers a wide variety of discounts and gives consumers tools to acheive the best rates possible, such as Progressive's price comparison tool and their Name Your Price program. A minimum coverage policy from Progressive costs an average of $86 per month, and Progressive premiums can be made even cheaper by taking advantage of discounts such as continuous insurance discount and paperless discount. Plus, Progressive rewards customer loyalty with discounts...

@candacebaker

Yes, Progressive has a grace period of 10 to 20 days. During the grace period, you can pay your past-due premium in order to avoid a lapse in coverage, but if the grace period ends without the necessary payment being made, Progressive will cancel the policy. Even if you pay the balance within the grace period, Progressive will still charge you a $10 late fee, though the amount may vary by state.

Progressive insurance goes up by an average of 101% after an at-fault accident, according to the company. If the accident was not your fault or only your car was involved, you may not see your rates go up at all. If your premiums do go up, it won't be as significant as after an at-fault claim. The amount your rate increases depends on your location, the total cost of the claim, your prior driving history,...

To cancel Progressive insurance, you must call customer service at (888) 671-4405. You will need to provide basic information about yourself, your Progressive policy number, and the date you would like your policy to end. Progressive may also ask for the details of your new car insurance policy to verify you won't be [driving without insurance](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/driving-without-insurance/14425). If you've already paid your premium for the policy period in full, Progressive will refund the unused portion, minus any cancellation...

@candacebaker

Progressive is so expensive because car insurance is expensive in general, due to rising costs for insurers. The price of a Progressive policy may also reflect the cost of staffing, marketing campaigns, and maintaining sales centers. But at $549 per year, the average Progressive car insurance policy is actually less expensive than coverage from most competitors. In fact, Progressive is one of the 10 cheapest insurers nationally, according to [WalletHub's analysis](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance).

Even though Progressive offers cheaper-than-average rates,...
