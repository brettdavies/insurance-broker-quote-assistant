##  Progressive Customer Service & Reviews
**Category Rating:** **42%**(12.5 out of 30)
* **Reviews on WalletHub:** 2.4/5
* **J.D. Power:** 3.1/5
Progressive’s customer reviews on WalletHub are a mixed bag of positive and negative comments, and its NAIC score reflects a higher-than-average number of consumer complaints. Many of the negative customer reviews about Progressive focus on unexplained premium increases, delays in payments and unsatisfactory settlements. Progressive’s reputation for poor customer service lost the company points in this category.
##  Progressive’s Financial Stability
**Category Rating:** **100%**(10 out of 10)
* **Standard & Poor’s: **AA
* **Moody’s:** Aa2
Progressive is on great financial footing, earning an A+ rating from AM Best, one of the leading credit rating agencies for the insurance industry. Progressive has also earned an AA rating from Standard & Poor’s plus an Aa2 from Moody’s. Such good ratings from these companies mean that Progressive is very strong financially and has the capability to pay out claims.
##  Progressive Insurance Claims
**Category Rating:** **100%**(15 out of 15)
With Progressive, you can file a claim any time online or via the Progressive mobile app, and there’s 24/7 claims support available by phone. Progressive’s accessibility has earned it full marks in this category, per [WalletHub’s grading criteria](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/insurance-review-methodology/78657).

* **Progressive Classic Car Insurance** for individuals who own antique or collector vehicles. The policy is provided by a third-party insurer (Hagerty).
* **Progressive Mexico Auto Insurance** for individuals who plan to drive in Mexico. There are three coverage options – basic, standard, and extended. This policy is offered by a third-party insurer (MexPro).
Progressive can also help provide peace of mind when you want to walk on the wild side, offering insurance policies for motorcycles, boats, trailers, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, and more.
##  Progressive Discounts
**Category Rating:** **60%**(3 out of 5)
* Multi-policy discount
* Multi car discount
* Continuous insurance discount
* Accident Forgiveness
* Safe driver discount
* Teen driver discount
* Good student discount
* Distant student discount
* Homeowners discount
* Online quote discount
* Sign online discount
* Paperless discount
* Pay in full auto discount
* Automatic payment discount
* Loyalty rewards benefits (priority call routing, lifetime renewal guarantee)
* Name Your Price® tool savings
* Deductible savings bank discount
* Avoiding tickets and accidents discount
Progressive has many of the same discounts offered by its industry peers, providing the potential for some significant savings. But its discount list isn’t quite as long as some of its top competitors, so it didn’t get the highest score possible in this category.
In addition to these discounts, some of which may not be available in all states, Progressive’s accident forgiveness benefit can deliver even more savings. If you have a small accident, Progressive promises not to raise your rates for a claim of less than $500 as soon as you become a customer. Also, if you have been with Progressive for at least 5 years and have had no accidents in the past 3 years, Progressive’s large accident forgiveness promises not to increase your rate if you get into an accident. The amount large accident forgiveness covers varies by state.
##  Progressive Insurance Transparency
**Category Rating:** **100%**(5 out of 5)
Key information is easy to find on Progressive’s website and mobile app, so it gets a good score in the transparency department. You can also chat with an agent online or call a live representative for more information at 800-776-4737.
## Bottom Line
Progressive is a very good insurance company overall. Progressive scores well in terms of the types of insurance policies it offers as well as the savings opportunities it affords safe drivers, teen drivers and people who bundle multiple policies with the company. The company’s claims process is also well regarded, and it’s backed up by a 24/7 claims support phone line. There is room for improvement in the customer service department, though.

## Video: Progressive Insurance Review
## Methodology
In order to provide fair, helpful reviews of insurance companies such as Progressive that can lead consumers to the best insurance coverage for their needs, WalletHub rates each insurance company in seven major categories: Cost, Insurance Types, Customer Service & Reviews, Discounts, Claims, Financial Stability and Transparency. Below, you can find an overview of what each section in our scoring rubric entails.
1. The “Cost” section includes information about how expensive the insurance policies are. Progressive's average premiums and quartile rankings are based on data from California, the largest state Progressive operates in. Rate information is provided by Quadrant Information Services. Individual rates will be different.
2. The “Insurance Types” section examines what types of insurance policies the company offers.
3. The “Customer Service & Reviews” section measures the insurance company’s reputation as well as user reviews and information from watchdog organizations.
4. The “Discounts” section examines how many and what types of discounts the company offers. It also takes into consideration whether or not there are discounts for bundling policies.
5. The “Claims” section examines the ways in which customers can make claims with the policy. It considers whether or not customers can make claims by phone or online, as well as whether or not the company has a 24/7 support line.
6. The “Financial Stability” section considers the company’s status with credit rating agencies AM Best, S&P and Moody’s.
7. The “Transparency” section measures how clearly the insurer discloses key information on its website.
The final score takes these seven categories into account and reflects how close an insurance company is to WalletHub’s definition of a 5-star insurer.

###  [Why is Progressive so expensive?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/why-is-progressive-so-expensive-1000297-2140760967/)
Progressive is so expensive because car insurance is expensive in general, due to rising costs for insurers. The price of a Progressive policy may also reflect the cost of staffing, marketing campaigns, and maintaining sales centers. But at $549 per year, the average Progressive car insurance policy is actually less expensive than coverage from most competitors. In fact, Progressive is one of the 10 cheapest insurers nationally, according to [WalletHub's analysis](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance).
