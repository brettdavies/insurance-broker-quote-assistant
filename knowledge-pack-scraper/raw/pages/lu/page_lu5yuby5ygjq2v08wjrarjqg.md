# Brick Vs Steel Frames
![Brick Vs Steel Frames](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c0d96f4f793922fb7a0c278/1682489892819-UTI9T9KYY6R9LYAX25KD/double-vs-preforated-brick.jpg)
## Both steel frame and double brick buildings have advantages and disadvantages. The choice between the two depends on various factors, such as location, intended use, budget, and personal preferences.   
  

**Here are some key considerations to keep in mind when comparing steel frame and brick buildings:**  
  

  1. **Cost:** Steel frame buildings are generally less expensive to construct than brick buildings, requiring fewer materials and labour to build. However, steel prices can fluctuate and impact the final cost. As a general guideline, the cost to build a brick house in Australia can range from around $1,500 to $3,000 per square meter compared to $1300 to $200 for a steel-framed house.
  2. **Durability:** Both steel and brick buildings can be durable, but steel buildings are more resistant to pests, moisture, and fire. Brick buildings can suffer from moisture damage and need regular maintenance.
  3. **Construction time:** Steel frame buildings can be constructed much quicker than brick buildings, as the components are prefabricated off-site and assembled on-site. Brick buildings require more time for construction, as the bricks need to be laid by hand.
  4. **Design flexibility:** Steel frame buildings offer more design flexibility than brick buildings, as they can be easily modified and expanded. Brick buildings are more challenging to change and expand and require skilled labour to maintain structural integrity.
  5. **Aesthetics:** Brick buildings offer a classic, traditional look often preferred for certain types of architecture, such as historical buildings. Steel frame buildings offer a more modern look and can be customised to fit a wide range of styles.

Now, getting back to Bricks...
### **The drawbacks of constructing a double brick home**
While many people prefer using full masonry construction for new homes, there are some significant downsides to this type of building compared to a steel-framed home.
**Below are some common issues with double brick construction and how a**[**steel frame construction**](https://www.australiansteelframing.com.au/steel-wall-frames)**may provide advantages for homeowners over masonry.**
  

### HIGHER BUILDING COSTS
**Is steel frame cheaper than brick?** In most cases, yes — steel frame homes are generally more cost-effective than brick, particularly when comparing to double brick construction. Brick homes are more expensive to build due to the need for substantial foundations capable of supporting their weight, which often involves large volumes of concrete and reinforcing steel. Beyond materials, there are added expenses such as extended site administration, supervision, scaffolding, utilities, and site amenities — often over a seven-month period instead of the typical 14-week timeline for a steel frame build. These factors contribute to higher labour and construction costs, with many builders charging a premium to compensate for the complexity and duration of brick projects.  
  

### SLOW COMPLETION TIMES
New homeowners voiced one of the most concerning grievances: their homes' prolonged completion time. Double brick construction can take up to 30 weeks to complete, resulting in added expenses such as rent or extra interest on loans. In contrast, frame construction can be completed in just 14 weeks for a single-story home and 16 weeks for a double-story home.
Steel frames are pre-engineered to exact specifications, resulting in high accuracy and readiness for erection. Furthermore, steel frames are up to 50% lighter than timber frames and offer a stable surface for insulation and plasterboard. This can significantly expedite the construction process by reducing the number of workers and resources required.
  

### REDUCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Double brick homes have good thermal mass properties, which means they can absorb and store heat during the day and release it at night, helping to regulate temperature. However, without proper insulation, double-brick homes can lose significant heat during winter and gain heat during summer, resulting in increased energy usage for heating and cooling.
On the other hand, steel-framed homes can also be energy efficient if designed and constructed with appropriate insulation and glazing. Steel frames can provide a solid surface for insulation and plasterboard, helping to improve thermal performance. Additionally, steel frames can be engineered to precise specifications, minimising material waste during construction.
  

### LESS USABLE LIVING SPACES
Compared to a steel-framed wall, a double brick wall is 60% wider, resulting in less usable living space in a full masonry build. As the size of lots in Australia continues to decrease, you either have to build up to the boundary or have a smaller building footprint. In either case, a double brick construction will result in smaller living spaces compared to a steel-frame home.
  

### LIMITED OPTIONS
Brick comes in limited colours since it is made from natural materials. The colour options usually consist of brown, red, and grey shades. While it's possible to paint brick, it's a labour-intensive process. Repainting is also required every few years to maintain the brick's appearance and prevent chipping and fading.
  

### MAINTENANCE
Periodic replacement of pointing, the mortar that binds bricks together, may be necessary for homeowners. Despite regular maintenance, repointing can still be costly and require significant time and effort.
  

### SUMMARY
Finally, it's essential to prioritise quality regarding construction materials. Cheap and poorly made bricks can result in moisture damage, mould growth, and cracks. Builders must choose high-quality materials to prevent these issues and ensure long-lasting durability for their constructions.
If your heart is set on brick, using steel frames with a brick veneer (a single layer of bricks applied to the exterior of a building, but the bricks are not used as the primary structural material) can get the best of both worlds. In fact, using steel frames with brick veneer is a common practice in construction. The steel frames are used as the building's structural support, and the brick veneer is attached to the outside of the steel frame. This construction method can be more cost-effective and efficient than traditional masonry walls. The steel frame provides a strong and durable structure, while the brick veneer gives the building a classic and attractive appearance. Additionally, using a steel frame can offer more design flexibility and allow larger open spaces in the building.
However, it is essential to ensure that the steel frame is designed and installed correctly to support the weight of the brick veneer. This requires careful consideration of the structural design and the use of appropriate materials and techniques during construction.
**Ultimately, deciding between**[**steel frame**](https://www.australiansteelframing.com.au/product-range)**and brick construction will hinge on your individual requirements and priorities. If speed, affordability, and resilience are paramount, a steel frame structure might be the optimal solution. On the other hand, if you place greater value on traditional appearance and durability, brick may be the more suitable option.**
