### Average Annual Rates in New York
New York drivers pay a little less than the national average for full coverage, but just over double for minimum coverage (in part due to [New York’s PIP requirement](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/pip-insurance/)).

Drivers with low credit


**Name-Your-Price Tool**
Car insurance in New York isn’t cheap, and if you have a [speeding ticket in New York](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/how-speeding-ticket-impacts-insurance/), it’s even more expensive. Those with poor driving records in particular will appreciate Progressive’s Name-Your-Price tool. In a nutshell, when we got our online quotes from Progressive, we had the option to “name our price,” meaning tell Progressive how much we wanted to pay per month, and see what it could offer us. While some amounts are too low to qualify for coverage at all, like $25 a month, we found that we could get affordable minimum coverage through Progressive by using this easy online tool.
Check out Progressive’s average full coverage monthly rates for various driving records in New York:
**Category** | **Clean record** | **Speeding ticket** | **At-fault accident** | **DUI**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Progressive | $107 | $120 | $155 | $131  
USAA | $138 | $152 | $154 | $192  
GEICO | $168 | $208 | $258 | $515  
State Farm | $188 | $195 | $205 | $355  
Travelers | $244 | $276 | $301 | $299  
Statewide average | $188 | $204 | $217 | $273  
**Student Discounts**
New York state has a total of 730 school districts, 2.4 million public school students, and 1.1 million postsecondary students, meaning college or higher.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-2) Whether it’s an average discount of 10 percent for full-time students with B averages or higher, or a discount for full-time students ages 22 or younger who live more than 100 miles away from home, Progressive offers multiple ways to save for families with students. Student discounts are a great way for families to save, as the [cost of car insurance for teens](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/teens/) is much higher than for any other group due to their higher likelihood of at-fault accidents and thus, costly claims.
FACT:  

In 2023, 127 drivers between the ages of 15 and 20 and 130 drivers between the ages of 21 and 24 caused fatal crashes in New York, accounting for a total of 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-3)
**Bundling Home and Auto**
It’s no secret that living in New York is expensive, which may explain why, as of the first quarter of 2025, only 51 percent of residents own homes, the second-lowest rate in the U.S. after Washington, D.C.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-4) But that’s not an issue with Progressive, which lets you save by bundling your auto insurance with homeowners, renters, condo, or even mobile home insurance.
### 2. Best for Safe Drivers - State Farm

New customers looking for accident forgiveness


**Safe Driving Discounts**
[State Farm’s prices](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/) are lower if you have a safe driving history and if you drive safely while you’re insured with the company. It offers six discounts that have to do with safe driving:
  * **Accident-free:** You can get this discount once you’ve been insured with State Farm for three years in a row with an accident. The more years you go without an accident, the more you’ll save.
  * **Defensive driver:** If you’ve voluntarily taken a New York DMV-approved defensive driver course in the past three years, you could get up to 10 percent off.
  * **Drive Safe & Save:** [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) is State Farm’s usage-based insurance program. The app pairs with a Bluetooth beacon to collect your driving data and give you a discount for driving safely, up to 30 percent off.
  * **Driver training:** Young drivers earn this discount for completing an approved driver education course. All household drivers under age 21 must complete the course.
  * **Good driving:** For those with multiple drivers on their policy, this discount could apply if no drivers have moving violations or at-fault accidents in the past three years.
  * **Steer Clear:** Finally, Steer Clear is for drivers under the age of 25 with no moving violations or at-fault accidents in the past three years. They must also complete the Steer Clear program, an app-based safe driving training program.


State Farm also offers the following discounts in New York:[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-5)
  * Anti-Lock Brake Discount
  * Anti-Theft Device Discount
  * Daytime Running Lights Discount
  * Good Student Discount
  * Multiple Automobiles Discount
  * Multiple Line (Bundling) Discount
  * Passive Restraint Discount
  * Student Away at School Discount
  * Vehicle Safety Discount


**Good Students**
New York is home to hundreds of high schools, colleges, and universities, and if you’re a student under age 25, you could save money due to your good grades. Here are the qualifications:
  * Rank in the upper 20 percent of your class
  * GPA of B or higher, or, if out of 4.0, 3.0 or higher
  * Made the Honor Roll or Dean’s List


Whether you’re earning an Associate’s Degree at city college or a Bachelor’s at a SUNY campus, or even if you are homeschooled, you could qualify.
**Great Customer Service**
In J.D. Power’s 2025 Auto Insurance Satisfaction study, car insurance customers in New York gave State Farm the third-highest ranking overall, placing after Travelers and New York Central. (USAA also received a top score, but technically does not qualify to rank due to its limited availability). Out of 1,000 points, State Farm received 646, above the state’s average score of 636. Customers were also satisfied with the claims process, according to another national study from J.D. Power. State Farm had a score of 710 out of 1,000, higher than the study’s average score of 697.
DID YOU KNOW?  

State Farm is the number one private passenger auto insurer in the U.S., with over 18 percent of the market share.[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-6)
### 3. Best for Drivers with Low Credit - GEICO

In New York, [drivers with low credit](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/low-credit/) pay more than twice the average for full coverage as drivers with good credit. However, GEICO’s rates for drivers with low credit are significantly lower. If you have low credit and you’re looking for cheap car insurance in New York, GEICO is worth a look.

Drivers with at-fault accidents


**Good for Low Credit**
While Progressive’s rates are the cheapest in New York for most driver profiles, GEICO comes out as the least expensive for drivers with low credit. Its average rates are about half the average for low credit in New York.
**Company** | **Full Coverage Avg. With Low Credit in NY (Monthly)** | **Full Coverage Avg. With Low Credit in NY (Annual)**  
---|---|---  
GEICO | $234 | $2,811  
USAA | $259 | $3,106  
State Farm | $388 | $4,653  
Progressive | $782 | $9,379  
Statewide average | $373 | $4,478

**Wide Range of Coverages**
One way to find [cheap car insurance in New York](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/cheap-car-insurance/) is to get the bare minimum, just liability coverage, uninsured/underinsured motorist, and personal injury protection. But having these requirements will leave you financially responsible for your property damage, not to mention the cost of a roadside breakdown, the cost of a rental car, and the cost of rideshare insurance, if you drive for [Uber, Lyft, or Doordash](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/insurance-for-uber-doordash/). We recommend taking advantage of GEICO’s wide range of coverages, which includes roadside assistance, rental reimbursement, and rideshare coverage in addition to collision and comprehensive coverage.
**Financially Stable**
When it comes to car insurance, you want to work with a company that’s financially stable and can actually pay out your claims when the need arises. GEICO has strong financial strength ratings from third parties like AM Best, which gave it an A++, or Superior Grade,[7](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-7) along with Moody’s, which gave it an Aa1, or stable financial outlook.[8](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-8) Although its commercials may be silly and absurdist, when it comes to fulfilling its promises, GEICO delivers.
### 4. Best for Military and Veterans - USAA

If you’re part of New York’s 28,373 active-duty service members, 40,837 National Guard and reserve members, and their spouses and children,[9](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-9) it’s worth getting a quote with USAA. The company that caters to military members, veterans, and their families exclusively. After Progressive, USAA has some of the cheapest average rates in New York. And like State Farm and Progressive, USAA has a good discount for bundling home and auto—expect savings of up to 10 percent.[10](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-10)

Non-military members and veterans, or their families 


**Military-Specific Coverages**
Active-duty military members have different needs when it comes to car insurance, but that’s the benefit of going with USAA. It’ll give you a 15 percent discount on comprehensive insurance when you park your car on a military installation (like Fort Drum or West Point), or another discount for driving fewer miles per year. If you’re deployed, you can save up to 60 percent on comprehensive coverage.
**24/7 Roadside Assistance**
Especially if you’re deployed and can’t always be there to help your family, you’ll appreciate the option to add 24/7 roadside assistance to your USAA policy. It covers services such as:
  * Battery jumpstarts
  * Flat tire (does not include cost of spare)
  * Fuel delivery (does not include the cost of fuel)
  * Lockout services
  * Towing
  * Winching out of mud or snow


You’ll pay nothing for a stuck vehicle, jumpstart, lockout services, or a flat tire, and a contracted rate for fuel delivery. It’s easy to contact roadside assistance from the USAA app, and they typically show up in less than an hour. Whether you’re stuck on a rural road upstate or on a busy street in the middle of Manhattan, you’ll appreciate having this service when you need it.
**Legacy Discounts for Military Children**
In the state of New York, there are 14,112 active-duty children and 21,266 National Guard and reserve children, according to 2024 data from the Defense Manpower Data Center. Of course, not all these children are of driving age, but if you fall into this category and need car insurance, you can save money if your parents have USAA. Children of USAA members get up to 10 percent off their own policies. To be eligible, you must be under the age of 25, with no major violations within the past three years.

There were over 9 million privately and commercially registered vehicles in New York, according to the latest data from the Federal Highway Administration. At the same time, there were over 12 million licensed drivers in the state, which averages out to about 1.33 cars per person.[11](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/#citation-11) If you are one of the people in the state who [owns more than one car](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/discounts-multiple-cars/), you can save with Farmers by insuring them both at the same time.

Drivers with DUIs or other violations


**Multiple Discounts**
Car ownership is expensive, but if you own multiple vehicles, you can save on your insurance by insuring them both with Farmers. In addition, Farmers offers a discount for bundling auto insurance with life, small business, specialty, or umbrella, as well as a discount for young drivers in your household under the age of 25. The youthful driver discount only applies if your policy has been in force for at least a year, and the young driver is the primary named insurer’s (PNI) child or grandchild.
**Specialty Vehicle Insurance**
You may want insurance for a regular car or truck, or you may want it for your:
  * ATV
  * Boat or watercraft
  * Classic car
  * Fifth-wheel
  * Motorcycle
  * Motor home
  * Off-road vehicle
  * RV
  * Travel trailer


Fortunately, Farmers is flexible when it comes to the types of vehicles it will cover, whether you need to insure your RV for a cross-state road trip or the classic car you want to show off on Fifth Avenue.
**Personal Umbrella Insurance**
You carry an umbrella on a rainy day, so why not add personal umbrella coverage to your auto insurance? If any of your limits aren’t high enough to cover your losses, umbrella insurance will add more coverage to your liability insurance. For example, if you hit someone else’s car and your property damage liability only covers half the damages, your personal umbrella insurance can kick in to cover the rest.
## Methodology 
To determine the best auto insurance companies in New York, we evaluated major insurers across four key categories—pricing, claims handling, customer experience, and coverage options. Here’s a breakdown of how each category was assessed:
  * **Pricing (40% weight):** We analyzed average annual premiums for full and minimum coverage for a good driver profile; average rates for high-risk driver profiles, including those with an accident, speeding ticket, or poor credit; available discounts and whether major opportunities like bundling, good student, and telematics discounts are offered. Minimum coverage averages use New York minimum state limits; full coverage averages use the following limits: 
    * Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
    * Property damage liability: $100,000 per accident
    * PIP: State-required limits
    * Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
    * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
  * **Claims Handling (25% weight):** A company’s ability to handle claims efficiently and fairly is paramount. We considered third-party evaluations from sources like J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report; financial strength ratings from AM Best and Moody’s, which indicate an insurer’s ability to pay claims; real-life customer experiences with the claims process, when available.
  * **Customer Experience (25% weight):** The overall experience of obtaining a quote, purchasing a policy, and interacting with the insurer was evaluated based on: ease of online quote and purchase process and regional customer satisfaction scores (J.D. Power U.S. Auto Insurance Study and Digital Experience Study); complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and Better Business Bureau (BBB) ratings; and first-hand customer experiences, when available.
  * **Coverage Options (10% weight):** We value insurers that provide additional protection beyond legally-required coverage, through optional endorsements like: gap insurance, rideshare coverage, accident forgiveness, and other offerings.


By evaluating these key areas and weighing them according to their importance, we aimed to provide a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the best auto insurance options for drivers in New York.

Why is car insurance so expensive in New York? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
One of the reasons why car insurance is so expensive in New York is because it is a no-fault insurance state, meaning that in an accident, each driver is responsible for their own injuries under personal injury protection. Insurance tends to cost more in no-fault states compared to at-fault states, in which the at-fault driver is responsible for injuries. In addition, car insurance will always be more expensive in high-density, urban areas like New York City compared to the rest of the state.
