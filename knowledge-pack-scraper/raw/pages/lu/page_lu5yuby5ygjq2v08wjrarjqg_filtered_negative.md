1. **Cost:** Steel frame buildings are generally less expensive to construct than brick buildings, requiring fewer materials and labour to build. However, steel prices can fluctuate and impact the final cost. As a general guideline, the cost to build a brick house in Australia can range from around $1,500 to $3,000 per square meter compared to $1300 to $200 for a steel-framed house.
2. **Durability:** Both steel and brick buildings can be durable, but steel buildings are more resistant to pests, moisture, and fire. Brick buildings can suffer from moisture damage and need regular maintenance.
3. **Construction time:** Steel frame buildings can be constructed much quicker than brick buildings, as the components are prefabricated off-site and assembled on-site. Brick buildings require more time for construction, as the bricks need to be laid by hand.
4. **Design flexibility:** Steel frame buildings offer more design flexibility than brick buildings, as they can be easily modified and expanded. Brick buildings are more challenging to change and expand and require skilled labour to maintain structural integrity.
5. **Aesthetics:** Brick buildings offer a classic, traditional look often preferred for certain types of architecture, such as historical buildings. Steel frame buildings offer a more modern look and can be customised to fit a wide range of styles.

**Ultimately, deciding between**[**steel frame**](https://www.australiansteelframing.com.au/product-range)**and brick construction will hinge on your individual requirements and priorities. If speed, affordability, and resilience are paramount, a steel frame structure might be the optimal solution. On the other hand, if you place greater value on traditional appearance and durability, brick may be the more suitable option.**
