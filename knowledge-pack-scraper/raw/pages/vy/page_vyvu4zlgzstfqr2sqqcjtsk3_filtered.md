## Cheap renters insurance for those with poor credit

In most states, insurers use [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/credit-based-insurance-score), which are similar but not identical to traditional credit scores, to help set renters insurance rates. Those with poor credit tend to pay more for renters insurance — often significantly more.

Using credit to set homeowners, renters, condo and mobile home insurance prices is not allowed in California, Maryland and Massachusetts.

Below, see which widely available insurance companies offer the most affordable renters insurance for people with poor credit, on average.

| Company | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [State Farm](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/renters/state-farm-renters-insurance-review) | $225 | $19 |
| [Allstate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/renters/allstate-renters-insurance-review) | $231 | $19 |

## Cheap renters insurance for those with claims

Once you have one renters insurance claim on your record, you’ll typically pay more because insurers see you as more likely to file another claim. Below are the cheapest widely available companies for renters who’ve filed a theft claim.

| Company | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [State Farm](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/renters/state-farm-renters-insurance-review) | $130 | $11 |

## Why is renters insurance so cheap?

Renters insurance is significantly cheaper than [homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-insurance-companies), which costs more than $2,100 a year on average. That's because renters insurance covers only the stuff inside your house or apartment, not the cost of rebuilding the entire structure.

## How to get cheap renters insurance

Follow these tips to save money on your renters insurance policy:

1. **Shop around.** The cheapest insurer in this analysis might not be the cheapest for you. Get [renters insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/renters-insurance-quotes) from at least three companies, and make sure you’re comparing the same levels of coverage from each.
2. **Bundle your policies.** Many insurers offer a bundling discount when you buy more than one policy, such as renters and auto insurance. See the [best auto and renters insurance bundles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-auto-renters-insurance-bundles).
3. **Add safety or security devices to your home.** An insurer may lower your premium if your home has smoke detectors, burglar alarms, sprinkler systems or other devices that reduce your risk of fire or theft.
4. **Ask about other discounts.** Depending on which insurance company you choose, you might save money by setting up autopay for your premiums, receiving your bills electronically or being a nonsmoker or retiree.
5. **Choose a higher deductible.** If you’re willing to pay more out of your own pocket for a property claim, you’ll generally save money on your premium. For example, raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can save you an average of nearly 9%, according to our analysis. Just make sure you’ll have access to enough cash to cover the [deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/insurance-deductible) you choose.

#### METHODOLOGY

NerdWallet averaged rates for 30-year-old tenants from multiple insurance companies in every ZIP code across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. We also averaged rates by city. Sample tenants were nonsmokers with good credit living in a two-bedroom apartment. They had a $500 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $30,000 in personal property coverage.
* $100,000 in liability coverage.
* $10,000 in additional living expenses coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

We used the same assumptions for all other renter profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for renters with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we used only rates for “good” credit.
* For renters with a higher deductible, we raised the deductible from $500 to $1,000.
* For renters with a history of claims, we added a single theft claim to their record.

Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.
