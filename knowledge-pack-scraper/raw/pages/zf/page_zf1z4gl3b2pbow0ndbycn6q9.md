# Does homeowners insurance cover trampolines?
Liability coverage under your homeowners insurance policy may cover you up to your policy's limits if you're liable for someone's injuries from the use of your trampoline. Your policy's personal property coverage may pay to repair or replace your trampoline if it's damaged by a covered peril, up to your coverage limits and minus your deductible. Notify your homeowners insurance company if you have a trampoline to find out if and how you're covered.

## What happens if you're liable for a trampoline accident?
One of the risks of having a trampoline on your property is that someone who isn't a member of your household may get injured while using it. If that happens, you could be held liable for their resulting medical bills. [Personal liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-liability-insurance/) may help pay for the injuries you're found legally responsible for and cover legal fees, up to your coverage limit.
Some policies may only cover injuries if you take certain safety precautions, such as limiting the number of people who can use the trampoline at the same time or putting netting around the trampoline to help prevent falls. You may not be covered if you don't comply with the insurance company's requirements and someone gets hurt.
### Umbrella policies provide additional liability coverage
You may be responsible for injuries or damages that aren't covered by your policy or exceed your liability coverage limit. If you need more than a $500,000 liability limit, which is the maximum offered on most standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) policies, [umbrella insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/umbrella-insurance/) can increase your liability coverage. If you're liable for injuries from the use of your trampoline, and the cost of the lawsuit exceeds the amount of liability coverage you have on your homeowner's policy, your umbrella policy may cover the difference, up to your policy's limit.

## More ways homeowners insurance may cover trampolines
Homeowners insurance may provide other coverage related to trampolines, depending on the incident:
### Your trampoline is damaged
If your trampoline is damaged or destroyed by a [covered peril](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/) like vandalism or a windstorm, [personal property coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/contents-insurance/) may pay to repair or replace it, up to your coverage limits and minus your deductible.
### Your trampoline causes damage to your home
If high winds launch your trampoline into the side of your house, causing damage, [dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling-coverage/) may cover the cost of repairing or replacing your window or siding. If the trampoline hits a fence or gazebo instead, [other structures coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/other-structures-coverage/) may pay for the damage.
## Does having a trampoline affect homeowners insurance?
A trampoline is often considered to be an "[attractive nuisance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-an-attractive-nuisance/)" — an item on a homeowner's property that can entice and, potentially, endanger children. Because a trampoline increases the risk of someone filing a liability claim against you and adds to the amount of personal property covered by your insurer, your policy may not provide coverage or your policy's premium may increase when you notify your insurer of a trampoline on your property. Learn more about [homeowners insurance cost factors](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-homeowners-insurance-cost/).
Some insurance companies don't allow trampolines and will exclude coverage for them. If you purchase or obtain one, your insurer may not offer coverage for trampoline-related injuries and damages and they may cancel or non-renew your policy.
## Should you let your homeowners insurance company know if you get a trampoline?
Yes. Ideally, you should notify your insurer before you get a trampoline to find out whether it, and any damage or injuries from it, will be covered and what safety precautions — if any — you must take. If you fail to notify your insurer that you have a trampoline on your property, they could cancel or non-renew your policy. They may also deny any trampoline-related claims.
