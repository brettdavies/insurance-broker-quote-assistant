View common insurance rates by credit level for Safeco and Farmers.
##### CREDIT SCORE INSURANCE RATE COMPARISON: SAFECO VS. FARMERS
**Credit level** | **Farmers avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $2,633 | $5,308  
Fair (580-669) | $1,736 | $2,716

### Farmers vs. Safeco: rates for high-risk drivers
If you are saddled with an at-fault collision or [ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), Farmers could be a better choice than Safeco. However, those with a reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) in your rearview mirror should look to Safeco. Every car insurance company has different post-violation pricing structures, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurance company suits you.
##### RATES BY VIOLATION: SAFECO VS. FARMERS
**Citation** | **Farmers avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,334 | $2,546  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,699 | $1,969  
DUI/DWI | $3,239 | $2,796

Speeding ticket | $2,045 | $2,512  
### Farmers vs. Safeco: rates by age bracket
Auto insurance companies rely on a driver's age to outline risk potential, assigning rates accordingly. A car insurance policy is typically expensive for drivers younger than 25 — due to their inexperience — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every auto insurance company rates age brackets uniquely, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose Farmers over Safeco: the former's average annual rates are $1,247 less.
##### COMPARING AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY AGE: SAFECO VS. FARMERS
**Age** | **Farmers avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $6,518 | $7,765  
**20s** | $2,020 | $2,566  
**30s** | $2,020 | $2,566  
**40s** | $1,511 | $2,128  
**50s** | $1,507 | $1,745  
**60s** | $1,402 | $1,687  
Affordability aside, Farmers and Safeco each have pros and cons, including their discounts, perks, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to shop around before settling on an option.

### Farmers vs. Safeco: home insurance rate comparison
[Homeowners insurance rates](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance/) can vary widely depending on the location of the home, the claims history of the homeowner and the [insurer](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/homeowners/). Farmers' average yearly home insurance rate is $1,455, coming out to roughly $121 per month. Safeco is marginally cheaper at $108 per month.

Cheapest average rates
Both companies provide affordable coverage, with Safeco coming in slightly cheaper on average at $108 per month.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).
