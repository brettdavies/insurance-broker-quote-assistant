##  Frequently Asked Questions
##  Common NAICS Questions 
[ l Can a Business Have More than One NAICS Code?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
The U.S. Census Bureau assigns and maintains only one NAICS code for each establishment based on its primary activity (generally the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment). Since other federal government agencies, trade associations, and regulation boards maintain their own lists of business establishments and assign classification codes based on their own programmatic needs, this will vary by agency.
**Yes, some agencies assign more than one NAICS codes to one establishment.** For instance, the SAM (System for Award Management _formerly CCR_), where businesses register to become federal contractors, will accept up to 5 or 10 classification codes per establishment. You will need to contact the other agencies to find out what their policies are. For access to a list of federal government agencies, [click here](https://www.firstgov.gov/Agencies/Federal/All_Agencies/index.shtml).

[ l Do NAICS Codes Change Over Time?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
NAICS will be reviewed every five years (in the years ending in ‘2’ or ‘7’) for potential revisions so that the classification system can keep pace with the changing economy.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), will solicit public comments through a notice published in the Federal Register. The notice will provide details of the format in which comments should be submitted, to whom they should be submitted, and the deadline for submission. Generally, the comment period will close 90 days after publication of the notice.
During that time, suggestions for new and emerging industries can be submitted to the ECPC. This committee will review each comment submitted to determine its feasibility and adherence to the underlying principles of NAICS, consult with the NAICS counterparts in Canada and Mexico to determine if they can accept the proposed changes that would impact 3-country comparability, and then make final recommendations to OMB for additions and changes to the NAICS manual.
This process is now completed for the 2022 revision of NAICS. The next scheduled review of NAICS will be for a potential 2027 revision.

[ l How Can I Determine the Correct NAICS Code for My Business?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
NAICS was designed and documented in such a way to allow business establishments to self-code. There are a number of tools and references available to help you to determine the most appropriate NAICS code for your business:
You can use our [Powerful Search Tool](https://www.naics.com/search) to find any NAICS code quickly and easily. Enter a keyword that describes your kind of business. A list of primary business activities containing that keyword and the corresponding NAICS codes will appear. Choose the one that most closely corresponds to your primary business activity, or refine your search to obtain other choices.
Rather than searching through a list of primary business activities you may also browse the [NAICS Codes and Titles to find your code. ](https://www.naics.com/naics-drilldown-table/)You can select the category that applies to your business, and drill down through the more detailed levels until you find the appropriate 6-digit code.
If you know your old SIC code, you can use our [Powerful Search Tool](https://www.naics.com/search/) to locate the corresponding NAICS code. Simply enter the SIC code and the corresponding NAICS code(s) will appear.
To see the NAICS code associated with a specific business listing, use our [US Business Directory Company Lookup Tool.](https://www.naics.com/company-lookup-tool/)

[ l How can I determine the correct NAICS code for my business?[using the naics manual]  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
To determine the correct NAICS code for your establishment, first identify the primary business activity. Then refer either to: 1) the NAICS United States Structure to search the titles from the 2-digit level down through the 6-digit, more detailed level, to find the appropriate code; or 2) the Alphabetic Index to search alphabetically for the primary activity and its corresponding code. Next, read the full description of the industry (including the narrative, cross-references, and illustrative examples), and determine if that description fits the primary business activity of your establishment.

NAICS is scheduled to be reviewed every 5 years for potential revisions, so that the classification system can keep pace with the changing economy. This is the only time that new NAICS codes can be considered.
The [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/), through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), will solicit public comments regarding changes to NAICS through a notice published in the Federal Register.

[ l How Can I Have My Company’s NAICS Code Changed?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
There is no “official” way to have a company’s SIC or NAICS code changed. Various Federal government agencies maintain their own lists of business establishments, and assign classification codes based on their own programmatic needs.
Generally, the classification codes are derived from information that the business establishment has provided on administrative, survey, or census reports. **For this reason, we recommend that you contact the agency that has assigned the code that you believe should be changed.**
For example, if you question the SIC or NAICS code contained on a form received from OSHA, you should contact the Department of Labor. For access to a list of Federal government agencies, [visit this site.](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index)

[ l How do the NAICS Codes affect Federal Procurement and Regulatory Activities, such as those carried out by the EPA, OSHA, the DoD, and the GSA?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
NAICS was developed specifically for the collection and publication of statistical data to show the economic status of the United States.
The NAICS categories and definitions were not developed to meet the needs of procurement and/or regulatory applications.
However, other federal agencies trade associations, and regulation boards have adopted NAICS to use for procurement and regulatory purposes even though it does not entirely fit their specific needs.
The U.S. Census Bureau has no formal role as an arbitrator of statistical classification. For questions regarding other agencies’ use of the NAICS system, contact the specific agency. For access to a list of Federal government agencies, [visit this site.](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index)

Of course, some will have alternate preferences, but we have found the most popular pronunciations for these codes are as follows:
NAICS is said “NAKES” and Rhymes with SNAKES.
SIC is said “Ess-Eye-Sea” or S-I-C.*
*You will notice throughout this site that a single SIC Code will be referred to as ‘AN’ SIC code as opposed to ‘A’ SIC Code for this reason.

Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
There were 1,175 industries in 2007 NAICS United States and in 2012 NAICS United States there are 1,065 industries. For 2012, revisions were made to address changes in the economy. These included content revisions for selected areas, several title changes, and clarification of a few industry definitions. Specifically, the changes include: (1) collapsing detail in the Manufacturing sector to reduce statistical product production costs and respondent burden; (2) adding new and emerging industries; (3) the classification of distribution centers, publishers’ sales offices, and logistics service providers; (4) the classification of units that outsource all transformation activities.
Noticeable changes were made to six of the twenty NAICS sectors during the 2012 revision of NAICS. These sectors are listed below:

[ l How Does NAICS Handle Market-Based Rather than Production-Based Statistical Classifications?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
A new [North American Product Classification System](https://www.census.gov/naics/napcs/) (NAPCS) is under development, starting in nine service sectors. Whereas NAICS focuses on the input and production processes of industries, NAPCS will classify all the output of the industries of NAICS.
The long-term objective of NAPCS is to develop a market-oriented, or demand-based, classification system for products that (a) is not industry-of-origin based but can be linked to the NAICS industry structure, (b) is consistent across the three NAICS countries, and (c) promotes improvements in the identification and classification of service products across international classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification System of the United Nations.

[ l I Have Seen NAICS Codes with More than 6 Digits. What are These?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
Industries in the United States are identified by a six-digit code. Each manufacturing and mining product or service is identified by a ten-digit product code. The product coding structure represents an extension, by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, of the six-digit industry classification of the manufacturing and mining sectors. The product classification system operates so that the industrial coverage is progressively narrower with the successive addition of digits.

[ l What is an Establishment and what is an Enterprise?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
An establishment is generally a business or industrial unit at a single, physical location that produces or distributes goods or performs services (e.g., store, factory, farm, etc.).
An enterprise, on the other hand, may consist of more than one location performing the same or different types of economic activities. **Each establishment of that enterprise is assigned a NAICS code** based on its own primary activity.

[ l What is NAICS and How is it Used?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, pronounced Nakes) was developed as the standard for use by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the business economy of the U.S.
NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the old Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system.
It was also developed in cooperation with the statistical agencies of Canada and Mexico to establish a 3-country standard that allows for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the three countries.
NAICS is the first economic classification system to be constructed based on a single economic concept. [Click here to learn more about the background, the development and the difference between NAICS and the SIC.](https://www.naics.com/history-naics-code/)

[ l What is Title 13?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
Title 13, U.S. Code, Section 9 (a) prohibits the U.S. Census Bureau from disclosing individual company activities including NAICS and SIC codes. The Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 of the United States Code. These laws not only provide authority for the work the census does, but also provides strong protection for the information collected from individuals and businesses.  
Title 13 provides the following protections to individuals and businesses:  
Private information is never published. It is against the law to disclose or publish any private information that identifies an individual or business such, including names, addresses (including GPS coordinates), Social Security Numbers, and telephone numbers.  
The Census Bureau collects information to produce statistics. Personal information cannot be used against respondents by any government agency or court.  
Census Bureau employees are sworn to protect confidentiality. People sworn to uphold Title 13 are legally required to maintain the confidentiality of your data. Every person with access to your data is sworn for life to protect your information and understands that the penalties for violating this law are applicable for a lifetime.  
Violating the law is a serious federal crime. Anyone who violates this law will face severe penalties, including a federal prison sentence of up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.  
Title 13, U.S. Code is available to download from the Government Printing Office [here ](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2007-title13/pdf/USCODE-2007-title13.pdf)[PDF 311KB].

[ l Who Assigns NAICS Codes to Businesses and How?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
There is no central government agency with the role of assigning, monitoring, or approving NAICS codes for establishments.
NAICS Codes are self-assigned based on the establishment’s primary activity (the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment)
Individual establishments are assigned NAICS codes by various agencies for various purposes using a variety of methods. The U.S. Census Bureau has no formal role as an arbitrator of NAICS classification.
The U.S. Census Bureau assigns one NAICS code to each establishment based on its primary activity (the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment) to collect, tabulate, analyze, and disseminate statistical data describing the economy of the United States.
Generally, the U.S. Census Bureau’s NAICS classification codes are derived from information that the business establishment provided on administrative, survey, or census reports. (e.g. when a company applies for an Employer Identification Number (EIN), information about the type of activity in which that business is engaged is requested in order to assign a NAICS code).
Various other government agencies, trade associations, and regulation boards adopted the NAICS classification system to assign codes to their own lists of establishments for their own programmatic needs. **If you question the SIC or NAICS code contained on a form received from an agency other than the U.S. Census Bureau, you should contact that agency directly.**

[ l Who assigns NAICS codes to businesses and how?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
There is no central government agency with the role of assigning, monitoring, or approving NAICS codes for establishments. Different agencies maintain their own lists of business establishments to meet their own programmatic needs. These different agencies use their own methods for assigning NAICS codes to the establishments on their lists. Statistical agencies assign one NAICS code to each establishment based on its primary activity. For example, the Social Security Administration assigns a NAICS code to new businesses based on information provided on their application for an Employer Identification Number. The Census Bureau generally assigns NAICS codes to businesses on its list of establishments based on information provided by the business on a survey or census report form. The Bureau of Labor Statistics initially assigns NAICS codes based on business activity information provided on an application for unemployment insurance. [SOURCE: US NAICS MANUAL]

[ l Why are Some NAICS Codes Only 5-digits long?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
NAICS is a two-through-six-digit hierarchical classification code system, offering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a series of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in the code signify greater classification detail. The first two digits designate the economic sector, the third digit designates the subsector, the fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit designates the NAICS industry, and the sixth digit designates the national industry.
**A complete and valid NAICS code contains six digits.**
In developing NAICS, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed that the **5-digit codes would represent the level at which the system is comparable among the three countries.** The sixth digit allows for each of the countries to have additional detail (i.e., subdivisions of a 5-digit category). In cases where the U.S. did not choose to create additional detail, the 5- and 6-digit categories within U.S. NAICS are the same, and the 6-digit US NAICS code ends in zero. In some hierarchical presentations, the 6-digit code is omitted where it is the same as the 5-digit category.

[ l Will U.S. International Trade Data be Available on a NAICS Basis?  ](https://www.naics.com/search/)
Category: [Common NAICS Questions](https://www.naics.com/search/?include_category=naics)
Data on international trade in goods are necessarily collected on a commodity basis, whereas NAICS and SIC, data are on an establishment basis.
Commodity groups approximating the NAICS categories were developed, however, and published for the years 1997 through 1999. (These overlap with series for groups using SIC commodity group classifications in the year 1997.)
It should be noted that some of the kinds of distinctions made in NAICS and other industry classifications cannot be made in commodity trade data. A notable example is printing and publishing.
NAICS places publishing in the new Information industry and retains only printing in manufacturing. In commodity trade data, however, the entire value of imported and exported publications is included in the goods classification “Printing, publishing and similar products.”

##  [ History of the NAICS Code ](https://www.naics.com/history-naics-code/ "History of the NAICS Code")
The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was originally developed in the 1930’s to classify establishments by the type of activity in which they are primarily engaged and to promote the comparability of establishment data describing various facets of the U.S. economy.
The SIC covers the entire field of economic activities by defining industries in accordance with the composition and structure of the economy. Over the years, it was revised periodically to reflect the economy’s changing industry composition and organization. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last updated the SIC in 1987.
Before long, the rapid changes in both the U.S. and world economies brought the SIC under increasing criticism. The 1991 International Conference on the Classification of Economic Activities provided a forum for exploring the issues and for considering new approaches to classifying economic activity. In July 1992, the OMB established the Economic Classification Policy Committee chaired by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, with representatives from the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. The OMB charged the ECPC with conducting a “fresh slate” examination of economic classifications for statistical purposes and determining the desirability of developing a new industry classification system for the United States based on a single economic concept. A March 31, 1993, Federal Register notice (pp. 16990-17004) announced OMB’s intention to revise the SIC for 1997, the establishment of the Economic Classification Policy Committee, and the process for revising the SIC.
