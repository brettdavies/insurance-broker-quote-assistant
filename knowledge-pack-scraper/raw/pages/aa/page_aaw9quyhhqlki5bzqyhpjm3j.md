ASSISTANCE IS IN 4 DAYS, JANUARY 7TH. >> SOME FLORIDA LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING AT A WAY TO DECREASE OUR RISING HOME INSURANCE COSTS. YOU MAY KNOW FLORIDA RATES ARE SOME OF THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION MORE THAN DOUBLE OTHER STATES IN THE SOUTH. THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR CHANGING THE WAY WE ENSURE OUR HOMES AGAINST HURRICANES. NBC TWO'S DAVE ELIAS IS HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WOULD WORK IF A NEW BILL PASSES. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OVER HALF OF OUR HOME INSURANCE POLICY COVERS WIND STORM DAMAGE MANY PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GET SO SOME STATE LAWMAKERS WANT STATE RUN CITIZENS INSURANCE TO OFFER WIND INSURANCE COVERAGE TO EVERYONE. >> OUR CLOTHES TOOK A DIRECT HIT FOR ME AND STUFF HAD MAJOR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF RECENT HURRICANE DAMAGE. DAVE RODWELL, HE'S SEEN HIS HOME INSURANCE RATES SKYROCKET. WE'VE INCREASED THE DEDUCTIBLE ORDER POLICY THAT KEEPS THE PRICE INSURANCE DOWN. THAT MEANS THAT HE PAYS MORE TO REPAIR DAMAGE IS WHAT IT MEANS TO US. IS THAT BECAUSE IT A RESERVE FUND HAS GOTTEN USED UP BECAUSE OF THE HURRICANES FOR KAREN AND ONCE WERE AS IT SIMPLY MEANS LESS MONEY TO LIVE ON SINCE WE'VE PURCHASED THE HOUSE. IT HAS TRIPLED. >> AND IT HAS DEFINITELY MADE AN IMPACT ON OUR THE WAY WE LIVE. DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS THAT USED HOUSE BILL 13 WOULD TURN STATE RUN CITIZENS. >> INTO A WIND INSURANCE PROVIDER, FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE SPENCER ROACH SPONSORED THE BILL LAST YEAR, BUT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE. WE COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE FLORIDA SENATE WITH THE COURAGE TO FILE A COMPANION BILL. AND AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMPANION BILL. >> FOR THIS TO MOVE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, ROACH BELIEVES THE BILL COULD PICK UP STEAM NOW THAT THE BILL SPONSOR HILLARY CAN SELL BECAME VICE CHAIR OF THE STATE'S INSURANCE COMMITTEE. WE SHOULD ALLOW EVERY FLORIDIAN WHO WANTS TO TO PURCHASE A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY FROM CITIZENS, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE WIND COVERAGE AND THAT WOULD LOWER THE RATES FOR EVERYONE IF DONE PROPERLY. WE COULD EASILY SEE DOUBLE-DIGIT DECREASES IN THE COST OF WINDSTORM INSURANCE AND INSURANCE AGENT DOUG MELONS BELIEVES THE BILL. WE'VE HELPED THOUSANDS WITH OLDER HOMES IN HIGH-RISK AREAS. OLDER HOMES ARE NOT UP TO THE SAME BUILDING CODES THE NEWER HOMES ARE. AND AS A RESULT, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR WINDSTORM INSURANCE. AN IDEA THAT IS GROWING IN POPULARITY WITH HOMEOWNERS. A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD USE THE BREAK. DEFINITELY. NOW IMPORTANT POINT OUT HERE THAT AS OF TODAY, THERE IS STILL NOT A SINGLE STATE SEN THAT'S WILLING TO SPONSOR THAT BILL IN THE SENATE AND IT MAY TAKE PHONE CALLS FROM VOTERS TO ACTUALLY GET THEM MOVING THE 60 DAY LEGISLATIVE SESSION BEGINS O
