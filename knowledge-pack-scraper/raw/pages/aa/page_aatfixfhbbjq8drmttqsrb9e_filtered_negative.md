![Mom helping son move into dorm.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/277-common-car-insurance-questions-college-students.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
You have plenty of big things to worry about when [heading off to college](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/college/things-to-do-before-going-to-college) — room and board, textbook purchases and the frequency of late-night pizza orders — so you probably haven't given much thought to your [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto). However, learning how your auto insurance works when attending a university or college away from home is important to consider. If you've worked on being a [safe driver as a teen](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/ways-to-help-your-teen-driver-stay-safe), then you might be ready for a car, and of course car insurance, at college.
Depending on the situation, college students commonly [stay on the parent’s car insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/ways-to-help-your-teen-driver-stay-safe). However, there are many factors to consider.
If you are an international student studying in the U.S., you will need [your own driver’s license](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/international-drivers-license) and auto insurance to drive. Check [your state’s requirements](https://www.usa.gov/state-motor-vehicle-services) for new drivers and consider the [car insurance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/auto-insurance-foreign-drivers) that works for you.
With many changes happening in your household, this may be a perfect time to implement [auto insurance discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts) if you haven’t already.
Students with solid grades may qualify for a [good student discount](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-teens). Specifically for high school or college drivers, this discount rewards students who study hard and get good grades.
You can explore how [telematics](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-telematics) (technology that uses cellular, GPS and onboard diagnostics) can help you match price to risk when looking for car insurance. Check out [Drive Safe & Save®](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) from State Farm.
If you are purchasing more than one policy, consider [bundling discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/bundle-insurance). Multi-policy discounts are a simple and effective way to save by [bundling your auto and homeowners or renters policy.](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/bundling)[footnote 1](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-for-college-students#footnote-1)
You can get an [auto insurance quote](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto "Auto Insurance Quote") now, or [give us a few details](https://www.statefarm.com/lead/contact?event=SimpleInsights-auto "Contact Agent for a Quote") and a State Farm® agent will reach out to you.
[return to reference 1](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-for-college-students#footnote-ref-1)Customers may always choose to purchase only one policy but the discount for two or more purchases of different lines of insurance will not then apply. Savings, discount names, percentages, availability and eligibility may vary by state.
