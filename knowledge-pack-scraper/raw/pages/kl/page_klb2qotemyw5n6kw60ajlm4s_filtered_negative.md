Our analysis shows the average car insurance cost for a college student on their own policy is $4,694 a year, based on the 14 auto insurers we evaluated. College students can look for student discounts to reduce rates, but the final cost is what really matters.
To identify the best car insurance for college students, we analyzed over 320,000 auto insurance rates for drivers ages 18 to 25. We also reviewed customer sentiment and feedback on each company’s affordability, coverage options, quality of service and claims handling. Companies offering good student discounts coupled with good overall rates top our rankings. Browse our list for a company that fits your budget and policy needs.

Our Expert Take
USAA impressed us by having affordable car insurance for college students among the companies we analyzed. We also found that USAA’s rates for college students with a speeding ticket or causing an accident with injury are the cheapest among the insurers we evaluated. Beyond these excellent base rates, USAA also has a terrific average discount of 18% for students who are more than 100 miles away at school without a car.
Among USAA customers surveyed, we found:
* They are extremely likely to recommend USAA car insurance to a friend or family member
* They are extremely satisfied with their purchase
* They were satisfied overall with the claims process

We like that Westfield offers a family discount. This provides a driver 18 or younger a discount on a household policy and a “next generation” discount for drivers 22 to 29 who leave their parents’ Westfield auto policy to buy their own. We also like Westfield’s student-related discounts, particularly its student away from home, which is 24% on average, and its average good student discount at 12%.
Among the Westfield customers surveyed, we found:
* They are satisfied with their purchase
* They are likely to recommend Westfield car insurance to a friend or family member
* They were very satisfied overall with the claims process

## Cheapest Car Insurance for College Students
****USAA, Erie and Nationwide offer the most affordable car insurance for college students**** added to a parent’s policy and students who are buying their own policy. USAA car insurance is the cheapest all around but is only available to members of the military, veterans and their families.
If you’re not eligible with USAA, the next cheapest [car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) company is Nationwide for:
* Parents who add an 18- to 22-year-old college student to their policy
* Young adults 22 to 25 years of age buying their own policy
Erie is the third cheapest for parents adding a college student to their policy and the second cheapest for students 18 to 21 buying their own auto policy.
### Cheapest Car Insurance for College Students on a Parent Policy
The most affordable auto insurance for college students is USAA, with an average cost of $184 a month to add an 18- to 22-year-old college student to a parent’s policy.

## Car Insurance Discounts for College Students
Ask your insurance agent about discounts like these if you think you might be eligible. Qualification rules and availability can vary by company and state.
* **Good student discount:** Full-time students ages 16 to 24 usually qualify for a good student discount by maintaining a B average or some other academic achievement, such as being on the dean’s list or honor roll. You may have to show proof of academic performance. The discount is typically available for undergraduate or graduate students, as long as you’re under age 25.
* **Student away at school discount:** Sometimes called a distant student or student away from home discount. Typically, drivers under age 25 must reside at a school more than 100 miles from home without a car and only use a family car when home and away from campus on school breaks.
* **Student affiliation or alumni association discount:** Similar to a membership discount, this discount may be applied if the student is enrolled in or an alum of a school with which the insurer has a relationship.
If your child moves away for a short-term assignment, for instance an out-of-state or international internship, it’s worth asking your insurance company about any student-friendly discounts that may apply in this situation. If discounts don’t apply, ask about other low-cost options.
These other discounts or programs may also apply to your situation and help you save:
* **Driver training program discount:** For young adults who successfully complete an approved driver training program. [Travelers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/travelers-car-insurance-review/) offers it if you’re under 21 and [State Farm’s](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state-farm-car-insurance-review/) Steer Clear young driver discount program is open to drivers under 25.
* **Good driver discount:** Normally given to those with a clean driving record (one free of accidents and traffic violations) for at least the last three years. Your university student may have enough time behind the wheel now to qualify.
* **Multivehicle discount:** Insuring multiple cars under one auto insurance policy usually gets you a discount. It should be automatically applied if you add a car for your college student.
## How Much Is Car Insurance for College Students?
The national average for an 18-year-old added to a parent’s policy is $4,312 per year, but the average cost of college student auto insurance varies by company and age. You’ll find the cheapest auto insurance by adding a college student to a parent’s auto insurance policy.
Parents should see the cost drop during the college years as their child ages. See the auto insurance costs for college students ages 18 to 25 who remain as drivers on their parent’s policy.

## Factors That Affect College Student Car Insurance Cost
Age is one of the [rating factors auto insurers consider](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/factors-in-rates/) when calculating car insurance costs for college kids, but it’s not the only one. Many variables impact rates and each insurance company weighs them differently.
Here are some common rating factors that will affect college students.
---|---
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Cake@2x.svg) |  **Age** Younger drivers pay more because they’ve spent less time on the road, which increases their risk for accidents and insurance claims. Young adults should see rates start to decrease around age 25.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Driving-Record@2x.svg) |  **Limits Chosen** You choose the limits for your [liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/liability-insurance/), which pays for damage or injuries you cause others. Low insurance limits cost less but expose you financially if you cause an expensive accident. We recommend higher limits for young drivers.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Car-insurance-policy-1.svg) |  **Coverage Types Purchased** Paying for better coverage can be worth it, especially if you end up in an accident. Buying [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance/) is usually required if you lease or finance your car.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Driving-Record@2x.svg) |  **Driving Record** A clean driving record (one without traffic violations or accidents) will lower your insurance costs.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Male-and-Female@2x.svg) |  **Gender** Because insurers base prices on risk, [gender can affect car insurance rates](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rates-age-and-gender/). Auto insurers find young male drivers more likely than females to exhibit riskier driving habits and, thus, tend to pay more. Several states forbid insurers from using gender to determine a driver’s car insurance rates, including California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Location@2x.svg) |  **Location** Drivers in major metropolitan areas generally pay more for coverage than those in suburban areas. Theft, car accidents, vandalism, the cost of medical care and other factors contribute to these higher rates.

### Compare Quotes
[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) is my top tip for saving money on a policy. I recommend getting quotes from at least three companies. Look at both national and regional companies if you can to see which allows you to save the most on car insurance costs.

### Increase Your Deductibles
Comprehensive and collision coverage each have a deductible, an amount subtracted from a claim payout. [Car insurance deductibles](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-car-insurance-deductible/) generally range from $250 to $2,500. You can save money by choosing a higher deductible. My analysis shows that increasing a deductible from $250 to $1,000 can save you about $440 a year.

Most insurers offer [car insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/) specifically tailored to the collegiate demographic to reduce their insurance costs.

### Avoid Having the College Student on a Separate Policy
Adding a college student to a parent policy can lead to significant savings. I found that an [18-year-old driver](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-18-year-olds/) on their own policy pays an average of $6,192 a year, but a parent’s policy with an 18-year-old driver added costs only $4,312 a year on average. That’s 30% a year cheaper.

## Methodology
To identify the best car insurance companies for college students, we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of driver ages, discounts available to college students, the availability of accident forgiveness, complaints against the company, collision repair grades from auto body professionals, our consumer sentiment index findings and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for drivers ages 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 with good driving records and also for parents adding a college-aged driver of 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 to their policy.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on insuring a new Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
* $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
* Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
* Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.
Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Satisfaction with customer service and price; satisfaction with claims process (15% of score):** For customer satisfaction, we surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company. This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11-29, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.5 point with 95% confidence. This survey was overseen by Talker Research, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society (MRS) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).

**Consumer Sentiment Index (5% of score):** The Consumer Sentiment Index from Forbes Advisor uses a proprietary weighting system designed by our subject matter experts and it evaluates thousands of consumer insights and reviews from leading online forums to determine customer satisfaction at scale, including claims process, customer service, coverage options and pricing and premiums.
**Complaints (5% of score):** We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and denials.
Source: [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
**Collision repair (5% of score):** We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
Source: CRASH Network’s [Insurer Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.
**Digital experience (5% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated car insurers on:
* Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple
* If there’s a useful website search function
* If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information
* If there’s a Spanish-language version of the website
* If you can get a quote online

##  College Student Car Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### Can college students stay on a parent’s insurance?
A college student can usually stay on a parent’s policy as long as they are still considered a resident at the parent’s home. Once a college student permanently moves from the parent’s house, they must purchase their own policy.
College students who have moved out permanently may be able to save by getting car insurance with their parent’s insurer. Some insurance companies, such as [American Family](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/american-family-car-insurance-review/) and [Westfield](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/review/westfield-car-insurance-review/), offer discounts if you’re buying your own policy and a parent is already a customer.
### Why is car insurance more expensive for college students?
The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) is higher for young drivers, including college students, because they have less experience on the road and are at a higher risk for accidents. Per mile driven, 16- to [19-year-old](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-19-year-olds/) drivers are nearly three times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than [20-year-olds](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-20-year-olds/) or older to be involved in a fatal crash, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
### What GPA is required to receive a good student discount?
Most auto insurance companies require your teen, undergrad or graduate student to have at least a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale, though eligibility requirements may vary. In addition to maintaining good grades, students also typically must be enrolled full time at a high school, college, university or trade school.
If you’re a full-time college student and younger than 25 or have young adults in your house that may qualify for the good student car insurance discount, contact your insurer to find out its eligibility requirements.
### How do I get a student-away-at-school discount for car insurance?
Eligibility rules can vary among insurers, but typically, to get a student-away-at-school discount the student must be under 25, reside at a school more than 100 miles from home without a car and only drive the household car when home on school breaks.
The average student away discount is 11%, but we found it as high as 30% with Geico. Contact your insurance agent about getting this discount if your young driver is going away to college.
_*Advertised rate is based on the minimum amount of auto insurance required for a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and a clean driving record. Rates vary by driver and state, some drivers may not qualify for the advertised rate._
