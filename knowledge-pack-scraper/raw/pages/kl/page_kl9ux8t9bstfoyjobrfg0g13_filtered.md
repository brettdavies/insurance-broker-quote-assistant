Some cities in California have cheaper car insurance premiums than others because insurance companies take a driver's ZIP code into account when calculating their premium, alongside other factors. For example, drivers who live in dense urban areas typically pay more for coverage than drivers in rural areas because they're more likely to get into an accident.
