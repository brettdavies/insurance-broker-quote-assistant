Formerly known as Ameriprise Auto and Home Insurance, the Wisconsin-based company was acquired by American Family Insurance in 2019 and renamed Connect in 2020.

**Why you can trust NerdWallet:** Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) to ensure fairness and accuracy in our coverage so you can choose the insurance policy that works best for you.

* ### How we review auto insurance companies

  In our auto insurance reviews, our editorial team considers both the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength.** We use A.M. Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints.** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use.** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts.** We look at both the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Connect auto insurance coverage

When you're shopping for car insurance coverage, it's important to understand what car insurance coverage you want and what you’re required to buy. For instance, most states require a minimum amount of car insurance to drive a vehicle. Alternatively, if you want extra protection, you may be interested in full coverage insurance. Read about the most [common types of car insurance coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/types-of-car-insurance) to see how they work.

In addition to the usual car insurance coverages, Connect sells:

* [**Gap insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/gap-insurance)**,** which pays the difference between the actual cash value of your car and the amount you owe on your car loan if your vehicle is totaled. Connect offers gap coverage for the first three years you own your vehicle, capped at 120% of the car’s value.
* [**New car replacement insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/new-car-replacement-car-insurance)**,** which covers the cost of a brand-new car in the same make and model if yours is totaled in a covered loss. Connect provides coverage for the first year or the first 15,000 miles after you buy a new car.

If you’re an executive Costco member, you may also qualify for the following coverage benefits:

* **Roadside assistance****,** which generally covers up to $75 of your expenses if you get a flat tire, run out of gas or have a dead battery.
* **Lifetime renewability****,** which guarantees Connect won’t cancel your car insurance policy, even if you have multiple accidents. (Some exceptions apply, and this benefit isn’t available in all states.)

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) and full [ratings methodology for auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).
