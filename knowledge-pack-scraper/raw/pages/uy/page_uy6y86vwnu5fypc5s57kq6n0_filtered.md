# Florida Sinkholes: What Homeowners Need to Know

Sinkholes in Florida can make the ground beneath your feet can shift—sometimes literally. But not every dip, crack, or collapse in your yard is a sinkhole, and understanding the difference matters when it comes to your homeowners insurance. In this guide, we’ll break down what sinkholes are, how they differ from other ground collapses, and what you can do to protect your home.

## What Is a Sinkhole?

A sinkhole forms when Florida’s limestone bedrock dissolves over time due to water erosion, creating underground voids that can suddenly collapse and pull the surface down. Florida’s karst terrain makes the state highly susceptible to sinkholes.

These events can be expensive. According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/), the average Florida sinkhole claim in 2020 exceeded $140,000. Hundreds of claims are still filed each year.

## Not All Ground Collapses Are Sinkholes

It’s important to know the differences:

* **Sinkholes:** Caused by natural underground erosion; can occur suddenly or gradually.
* **Catastrophic Ground Cover Collapse (CGCC):** A Florida-specific term for extreme cases. The ground must visibly collapse, the structure must be damaged, and local officials must declare the home uninhabitable.
* **Subsidence:** Gradual sinking of the ground, often due to groundwater loss—usually not covered under standard sinkhole definitions.
* **Landslides:** Less common in Florida but involve soil or rock sliding downhill.

Understanding these distinctions helps you know what your policy covers.

## Do Homeowners Insurance Policies Cover Sinkholes?

Most standard homeowners policies exclude sinkhole damage under “earth movement.” In Florida, however, insurers are required to offer optional sinkhole coverage. CGCC coverage is automatically included but only applies to extreme cases.

At Security First Insurance, all homeowners policies include CGCC. **Optional Sinkhole coverage is available on most policy types (except renters/HO4).** To see if you qualify, schedule a sinkhole inspection with [SDII,](https://sdii-global.com/) a third-party inspection company. The current inspection fee is $200, and you’d be responsible to pay 50% of the cost. Eligiblity is determined by inspection results, not zip code.

## Warning Signs of a Potential Sinkhole

Sinkholes don’t always appear overnight. Watch for:

* Cracks in walls, driveways, or foundations
* Sticking doors or windows
* Depressions or soft spots in the yard
* Leaning trees, fence posts, or sheds

If you notice any of these, call a structural engineer or geologist immediately. Acting early can save significant repair costs.

## How to Protect Your Property from Sinkholes

Here’s what you can do today:

1. **Check your risk:** Ask your county about known sinkhole activity.
2. **Review your coverage:** Understand your policy and consider adding optional sinkhole protection.
3. **Schedule an inspection:** Required for adding optional sinkhole coverage.
4. **Stay alert:** Monitor your property for warning signs and act quickly.
