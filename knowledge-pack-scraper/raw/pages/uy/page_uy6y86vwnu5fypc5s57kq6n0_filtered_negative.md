At Security First Insurance, all homeowners policies include CGCC.**Optional Sinkhole coverage is available on most policy types (except renters/HO4).** To see if you qualify, schedule a sinkhole inspection with [SDII,](https://sdii-global.com/) a third-party inspection company. The current inspection fee is $200, and you’d be responsible to pay 50% of the cost. Eligiblity is determined by inspection results, not zip code.
