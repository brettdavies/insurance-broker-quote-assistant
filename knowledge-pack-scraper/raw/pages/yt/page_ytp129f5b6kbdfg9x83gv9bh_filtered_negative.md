An ongoing trade war with other countries could [push insurance rates even higher](https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/products-more-expensive-tariffs/ "products that are more expensive with tariffs"), “especially for foreign or electric vehicles,” says Laura Longero, executive editor at CarInsurance.com, an auto insurance comparison website, as these vehicles rely on more parts and batteries from overseas. According to a recent Insurify forecast, car insurance premiums are projected to rise 4 percent by the end of 2025 due to tariffs.
It’s a frustrating time for car owners, but there are ways to take action. Implementing these proven strategies can help you [pay less for car insurance](https://www.aarp.org/auto/car-buying/lower-raise-car-insurance/ "what can lower car insurance rate") in today’s market.
Some insurance companies also offer a discount of about 5 percent for [setting up automated payments](https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/autopay-bills-avoid-late-fees/ "how to autopay bills") depending on the carrier. “Carriers offer these discounts because automatic recurring payments can help you avoid missed or late payments,” says Katie Ekstrom, assistant vice president of auto product development at Travelers. If you have the cash, you might also be able to save money by paying premiums annually instead of in monthly installments.
**Policy bundle discounts.** Some insurers will give you a lower rate if you insure multiple vehicles with them, reducing premiums by about 10 percent to 25 percent. This includes cars, [boats, RVs](https://www.aarp.org/money/retirement/purchases-retirees-often-regret/ "purchases retirees often regret") and motorcycles.
**Membership discounts.** AARP members may qualify for up to [10 percent off auto insurance premiums](https://www.aarp.org/membership/benefits/insurance/hartford-auto/ "auto insurance from The Hartford") from The Hartford. AAA members save 5 percent on premiums for buying AAA car insurance. Costco members receive a discount for buying insurance through its CONNECT program, supported by American Family Insurance. Insurers may also offer discounts to members of other groups, like professional organizations, unions and alumni associations.

If you haven’t tested the insurance market in a while, it could be worth shopping around for a new policy. “Not all insurers rate risk the same way. Rates can vary hundreds of dollars per year for the same driver, so getting quotes from at least three companies can help you find the best deal,” says Longero. Car owners who switched insurers in the past five years saved a median of $461 in annual costs, a 2024 _Consumer Reports_ survey found.

Consider working on boosting your score in the months before applying for a new car insurance policy to get a better offer. You can [raise your credit score](https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/improve-your-credit-score-tips/ "tips for raising your credit score") by making credit card payments on time, reducing your credit utilization ratio and reviewing your credit report for errors.
AARP offers its own defensive driving program, the [Smart Driver™ course](https://www.aarp.org/membership/benefits/auto/driver-safety/). The class teaches proven techniques to help keep you and your loved ones safe on the road.

[Keep tariff taxes in mind](https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/tariffs-raise-car-prices-how-to-save/ "how to save while car shopping amid tariffs") too. Generally, vehicles with domestic parts are cheaper to repair and, therefore, cheaper to insure, says Longero.
