## Understanding Personal Injury Insurance in Florida

Personal injury insurance in Florida refers to the required coverage in your [auto insurance policy](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/). Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is meant to cover the costs of your medical expenses, lost wages and services if you become injured in a car accident.

### Consequences for Not Having Personal Injury Insurance in Florida

If you don’t have personal injury insurance in Florida, you can be held liable for another person’s medical expenses if you are at fault for a car accident. However, Florida doesn’t consider not carrying this insurance illegal, so you won’t be punished criminally for it.

## What to Do if Involved a Car Accident Without Insurance in Florida When You’re Not at Fault

Car accidents are always devastating situations, especially if you sustain an injury. If you are involved in one in Florida, [lack insurance and are not at fault](https://getjerry.com/car-insurance/car-accident-without-insurance-but-not-at-fault-in-florida), it can be challenging to know what to do. The best action you can take is to consult with a personal injury [attorney who has experience in handling car accident](https://www.andrewpickettlaw.com/car-accident-lawyers/) cases so they can determine the right option for your situation. Depending on the circumstances, even if you lack insurance, your attorney may still be able to secure compensation for you if the case is successful.

### Understanding Fault in a Car Accident

The theory of fault applies in a car accident in states that have fault laws. Florida is a no-fault state for car accidents, requiring drivers to go through the responsible driver’s auto insurance policy to pay for the costs of their medical expenses, lost wages and property damage. However, if a person sustains serious injuries and has medical expenses that exceed the amount the insurance policy covers, they can choose to file a personal injury lawsuit directly against the driver at fault for the accident.

### What Happens if You Were at Fault?

If you are at fault for a car accident in Florida that results in personal injury, the other driver would be entitled to compensation for their medical expenses and other damages through your auto insurance coverage. However, if your insurance policy is not sufficient enough to cover the costs of the person’s damages, they can file a lawsuit against you directly.

### What Happens if the Other Party Was at Fault?

After a car accident leaves you injured and the other driver was the one at fault, you have the right to file a claim for compensation through their auto insurance policy. However, if the person’s coverage is not enough to cover the cost of your medical expenses and other damages, you can then file a personal injury lawsuit directly against them.

### Understanding What Happens if There Were Injuries

If someone suffers a personal injury after a car accident, they can file a claim through their auto insurance policy. PIP covers injuries [regardless of who’s at fault](https://www.floridainjurycenters.com/pip-insurance-in-florida/).

### Understanding What Happens if There Were No Injuries

After a car accident that renders damage to a person’s vehicle but doesn’t result in injuries, the situation is slightly different. In that scenario, instead of recovering compensation for medical expenses and lost wages through the at-fault driver’s auto insurance coverage, you can file a claim with the insurer to cover the costs of repairs to your vehicle.

## What to Expect if You Lack Insurance But the Other Driver Was at Fault

Getting into a car accident when you don’t have auto insurance is a terrifying situation; it’s fair to question whether you can get compensation for your medical expenses and other damages even if the other driver was at fault. Fortunately, by law, if someone else is responsible for an accident and you don’t have insurance, you are still entitled to hold them liable. At the same time, even as you hold the at-fault driver accountable, you might still face penalties due to not having insurance coverage.

### Understanding Whether You Can Get Insurance Coverage After a Car Accident

Of course, auto insurance is meant to cover you in the event of a car accident. If you don’t have insurance and then get into an accident, you will probably want to obtain coverage. While you can take out an auto insurance policy after a collision, it won’t cover you for that situation. Instead, auto insurance only covers future accidents.

### When the Car You’re Driving is Insured

It’s always wise to have auto insurance to cover potential damages if you’re involved in a car accident. You never know when an accident might occur or when it can be your fault or the fault of another driver. In the latter situation and the car you’re driving is insured, you have the right to file a claim with the at-fault driver’s insurance policy. If you are driving someone else’s car and the vehicle is insured, you can still recover compensation through the other driver’s insurance.

## Understanding What Happens if Neither Driver in an Accident Has Insurance

In some cases, two drivers might get into a car accident where both of them lack auto insurance coverage. Although this is rare, it’s important to speak with an attorney about your legal options. Florida requires drivers to have auto insurance with at least minimum personal injury protection (PIP) coverage and property damage liability (PDL) coverage amounting to $10,000. This is in place to protect drivers in the event of an accident that results in personal injury and property damage, respectively. In a situation where [neither driver has insurance](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/uninsured-drivers-in-both-cars-at-time-of-accident-what-happens-49218), one person can file a lawsuit against the one who was at fault to seek compensation to pay for their medical expenses and other damages. Unfortunately, it’s common for this to be a fruitless endeavor because many drivers without insurance can’t afford to pay; they might not have the financial means to pay the plaintiff if the lawsuit is successful.

## Consequences for Uninsured Drivers with the Florida DMV After a Car Accident

Again, Florida requires all drivers to have auto insurance and at least $10,000 in PIP and PDL coverage as part of their policy. However, some drivers choose to forgo having insurance at all.

Drivers who lack the required insurance can face fines and up to a three-year suspension of their driver’s license, license plates and registration.

### What Are the Financial Consequences of Uninsured Driving?

You can be charged fines and a fee of up to $500 to have your license reinstated.

## How Are Medical Bills and Other Expenses Handled After a Car Accident in Florida?

Usually, when a person suffers injuries in a car accident in Florida, they are compensated for their medical bills and other expenses through the at-fault driver’s auto insurance coverage. However, they can also go through their own PIP policy for compensation or file a lawsuit against the driver responsible for the accident if their injuries are severe, disabling or permanent. A person can also rely on their own auto insurance to cover the costs of their medical expenses and other damages if they are at fault for an accident.

### Understanding Who’s Responsible for Paying if You Are Uninsured

If you don’t have auto insurance and are involved in a car accident and suffer injuries, you may be daunted about what happens and who’s responsible for paying. If the accident was not your fault but the fault of the other driver, you would have to file a lawsuit against them to recover compensation. However, if you were at fault, your medical bills and other damages would be your responsibility.

### Covering Your Medical Expenses if You Lack Insurance Coverage

If you don’t have insurance, the best-case scenario for covering your medical expenses is to file a personal injury lawsuit directly against the other driver who was responsible for the accident.

## What Are the No-Fault Requirements in Florida?

As a no-fault state, Florida requires all drivers to have auto insurance to protect themselves and others in the event of a car accident. All drivers must have at least $10,000 in PIP and at least $10,000 in PDL coverage. PIP can cover up to 80% of medical expenses considered reasonable if a person sustains a personal injury regardless of who’s at fault. PDL covers the costs of damage to a vehicle.

### Understanding the Theory of No-Fault States

Florida is one of 12 states that follows the no-fault theory for car accidents. According to the law, when an accident occurs, regardless of who’s at fault, the drivers involved must go through their own auto insurance policy to cover the costs of their medical expenses, property damage and other damages. Filing a claim through one’s own insurer is the first step to getting compensation for the accident. However, depending on the circumstances and severity of the person’s injuries, another option is to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver.

### How Florida Handles Car Accident Claims

Because of Florida’s no-fault laws for car accidents, if a person needs to file a claim, it’s done with their auto insurance policy. This applies regardless of who’s at fault.

### What Is the Role of Personal Injury Protection (PIP) Coverage in a No-Fault State?

When an accident results in injuries, PIP coverage covers the individual’s medical expenses. Through no-fault laws, PIP is meant to protect all drivers in the event that they suffer injuries in a collision. Florida requires all drivers to carry at least the minimum in PIP coverage, which amounts of $10,000.

### What Are the Benefits and Limitations of PIP Coverage in Florida?

The benefits of [PIP coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/pip-insurance-florida) in Florida is that it can pay for an injured driver’s medical expenses and lost wages and cover accident victims who die in the form of death benefits to their survivors. However, PIP only pays up to 80% of medical expenses, 60% toward lost wages and services and only $5,000 in death benefits.

### Understanding Death Benefits Through Florida PIP

In Florida, PIP offers death benefits to the surviving family members of individuals who die as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident. The insurance coverage amounts to $5,000 and doesn’t count toward PIP’s $10,000 limit.

## What Legal Options Do Uninsured Drivers Have?

Drivers who don’t have insurance and get into accidents can consult with an attorney to discuss their legal options. If a driver suffers injuries and another person was at fault for the car accident, they can file a personal injury lawsuit against them. A lawyer can provide valuable advice on the best way to proceed.
