**Bankrate’s take:** Like all insurance, car insurance is priced based on risk. In order to predict customers’ risk factors, insurers turn to statistics, which show a higher rate of accidents for male drivers compared to female drivers, especially in younger age groups. In states that permit the use of age and gender in auto insurance pricing, young men are most likely to pay high rates for coverage compared to other groups.
