## Utah car insurance rates by city

Utah car insurance rates are not standardized across the entire state. The [city you live in](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/) and your ZIP code play a role in determining your rate. Insurers look at statistical data related to accident rates and property crime in a given ZIP code to understand the risk levels associated with car ownership there. If your area has a lot of dense traffic, a high rate of vehicle theft or other key risk factors, you could pay a higher rate for car insurance. The table below includes the average cost of car insurance in 10 Utah cities and how rates differ from the statewide average premium.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Utah

[Young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) in Utah, as in most states, pay some of the highest rates for car insurance due to their lack of experience on the road. [Statistics show](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) that teen drivers are more likely to be involved in accidents and may engage in risky behaviors behind the wheel, such as speeding or texting while driving. In fact, motor vehicle accidents were the leading cause of death for female teenagers between 13 and 19 years old in 2020.

Along with your age, your gender has the potential to impact your car insurance rate in Utah. That’s because statistics also show that male drivers have a higher rate of fatal accidents than females.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Like all insurance, car insurance is priced based on risk. In order to predict customers’ risk factors, insurers turn to statistics, which show a higher rate of accidents for male drivers compared to female drivers, especially in younger age groups. In states that permit the use of age and gender in auto insurance pricing, young men are most likely to pay high rates for coverage compared to other groups.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in Utah

While 16- and 17-year-olds cannot get their own car insurance policies in almost all situations, young drivers aged 18 and up can. Older teens often have the option to get their own policy or stay on their parents’ policy (as long as they still live in their parents’ household in most circumstances). Unless an 18 year old has a separate permanent address from their parents, it’s typically more affordable to stay on a family policy because older family members’ lower risk will offset the risk associated with the teen. As you can see from the average rates below, staying on your parents’ policy in Utah can shave a significant amount of money off your annual premium.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Utah?

One of the biggest factors that will impact your car insurance rate is your driving record. If you have any violations on your record within the last several years, you will probably pay a higher premium. Some incidents, like speeding tickets, may only result in a minor increase to your insurance premium. DUI convictions, on the other hand, are a serious matter for insurers. Utah drivers with one or more may see significant penalties, including the loss of their license, and they may have to find a car insurance company that specializes in providing coverage for [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/).

Below are average car insurance rates in Utah for drivers with one speeding ticket, one accident or one DUI, showing the impact each typically has on car insurance premiums.

## Car insurance rates in Utah by credit score

In all but three states, your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) can have a large impact on your car insurance rates, and Utah is no different. Studies have shown that drivers who have a poor credit history tend to file more claims, and average car insurance rates reflect that increased risk. In fact, drivers with poor credit in Utah might pay as much as 84 percent more for full coverage car insurance.

As this table shows, the Honda Odyssey and Ford F-150 have average insurance rates below the state average.

* ### Why do car insurance rates vary by state?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Auto insurance prices are based on risk calculations, which insurers use to estimate the potential costs a given policyholder might present to their finances. Risk factors vary between individuals, but also between geographic regions. In areas with high property crime rates, for instance, comprehensive coverage is likely to cost more due to the higher risk of a vandalism or theft claim. State regulation of the insurance industry can also account for differences in rates. In a recent study of state insurance regulation, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/08/climate/home-insurance-climate-change.html) identified Utah as a “high regulation” state, meaning that insurance companies in Utah receive tighter regulation of the rates they charge to consumers.
