# A month after closing State Farm tells me they won’t cover me because my roof is 20 years old.

Isn’t this something that is supposed to be vetted before an approval from my lenders and/or State Farm? They told me everything was okay but called me today to say it didn’t go through the underwriter. They said I can replace my roof or try to find someone else to get home insurance through, but if I can find it it will be expensive. What? Isn’t a loan contingent on ability to get it insured? It all feels very scummy and timing is poor, because if I needed a new roof, that would have been addressed in our offer and it would change the amount we paid for the house, I’m sure. If anyone has been through a similar scenario and can give me some guidance that would be great. Not sure how to proceed with my lender and everything else. Thank you in advance.
