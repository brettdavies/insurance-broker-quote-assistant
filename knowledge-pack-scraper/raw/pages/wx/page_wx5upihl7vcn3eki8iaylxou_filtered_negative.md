What is cheap for someone else may not be cheap for you.

Cheap (state liability) isn't worth it at all. You get in an accident, and you're screwed.

I've found Progressive to be cheap for me. I almost switched to Geico maybe 5 years ago. They quoted me a rate about 2/3 what I was paying with Progressive. Then like three days before the switch was supposed to happen, they mailed me that the rate would be about 4x the initial quote. I had to make lots of phone calls to end up blocking the switch and making sure my Progressive account remained active.
I've only ever gotten quotes from well-known companies like Progressive, Geico, State Farm, Amica, Plymouth Rock (dunno if they're still around - used them like 20 years ago), etc. Never called the ones that came across as "sketchy" to me - an example is one someone else mentioned, The General. Occasionally saw commercials from them but it just seemed to give me bad vibes.

I've used them for over 10 years and they've been great to me. Have had a few accidents with them in the past, and they didn't give me any problems. Been a while since I had anything like that happen. Of course my rates went up when I had issues, but they're back to being cheap because I've not had claims in years.

I’ve had Progressive for six months, and they just sent me a renewal policy that is 40% higher! So now I’m shopping around.

according to tiktok, if you respond that the renewal policy is simply out of your budget and you’ve got a new insurance policy you’re looking at, they will negotiate with you

That was not my experience last September. They have called a few times to try to rerun my info, but neither time was price where I could afford it.

What year was this? Pretty sure every company has paperless billing at this point. Who is still relying on the mail for this kind of thing?
I did almost get dropped before with AAA insurance because the agent we had ours with retired and we weren’t given a new agent. It didn’t renew and no one called or told us. So didn’t have insurance for a month and didn’t notice. They tried raising the rates because it’s lapsed but I gave them hell because it was their own fault. They finally conceded and renewed it.

Last year. State Farm is still relying on paper. They have digital access but send the access via paper. So you need the paper to set up paperless. I never got the paper because it kept going to the wrong address even though I kept trying to fix it over the phone.

State Farm is a joke. They had a computer error and refused to honor a claim for my roof.
