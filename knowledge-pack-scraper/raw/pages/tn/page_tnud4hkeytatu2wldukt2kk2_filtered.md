# How does RV depreciation work?

Like all vehicles, RVs depreciate over time. You can determine an RVs depreciation by the vehicle's age, mileage, wear and tear, and the type of RV you own. Class A and Class B vehicles depreciate similarly, while Class C RVs depreciate more slowly and hold value slightly better. Travel trailers and fifth wheels also depreciate over time. The best way to manage RV depreciation is to keep your vehicle clean and well-maintained.

## What factors impact RV depreciation?

RV depreciation depends on several factors, including:

* **Age**: RVs depreciate rapidly in the first year and continue to lose value steadily until they're five years old, according to [Camper Report](https://camperreport.com/rv-depreciation-everything-possibly-want-know/). After that, the rate of depreciation levels off before increasing again at 10 years old.
* **Mileage**: Higher mileage indicates greater use and accumulation of wear and tear.
* **RV type**: Larger RVs, like [Class A motorhomes](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/class-a-motorhome-insurance/), [Class B motorhomes](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/class-b-camper-van-insurance/), and [fifth wheels](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/fifth-wheel-trailer-insurance/), depreciate faster than smaller RVs, like travel trailers.
* **Condition**: The condition of the RV includes wear and tear, [delamination](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-delamination-repairs/), water damage, cosmetic appearance, and operational ability. A well-maintained RV depreciates at a slower rate than an RV that has been neglected, regardless of age or mileage.
* **Accessories**: RVs with added accessories, including entertainment systems, kitchen appliances, or shelves, depreciate faster than those without.

Pro tip:

If you're financing or leasing your motorhome or travel trailer, lenders typically require [RV comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-collision-comprehensive-coverage/). These coverages may cover up to the actual cash value of your RV if your motorhome or trailer is damaged, stolen, or totaled.

## What type of RV best holds its value?

Among the three main types of RVs, **Class C vehicles generally hold their value best**. Class A and Class B RVs tend to depreciate at a faster rate. Fifth-wheel campers generally depreciate more quickly than standard RVs, while truck campers depreciate at a slower rate than fifth-wheel campers. Some RV brands depreciate slower than others. A well-respected brand such as Winnebago is more likely to hold its value than a less established brand.

## How to slow your RVs depreciation

There are a few ways to slow the depreciation of your RV:

* Buy a used RV that's around five years old to avoid the biggest loss in value
* Keep up to date on the maintenance of your RV with a regular preventative maintenance schedule and [RV inspections](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-inspections/)
* Clean your RV thoroughly before and after each trip
* Check for leaks routinely

You can [check the value of your RV](https://www.nada.org/nada/consumer-vehicle-values) using the National Automobile Dealers Association website.
