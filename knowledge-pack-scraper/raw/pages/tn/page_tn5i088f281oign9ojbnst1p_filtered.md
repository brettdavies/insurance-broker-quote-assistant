  In our State Farm auto insurance review, our editorial team considers the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength:** We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints:** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use:** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts:** We look at the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Where State Farm car insurance stands out

## State Farm car insurance coverage

When you're shopping for car insurance coverage, it's important to understand what car insurance coverage you want and what you’re required to buy. For instance, most states require a minimum amount of car insurance to drive a vehicle. Alternatively, if you want extra protection, you may be interested in full coverage insurance. Read about the most [common types of car insurance coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/types-of-car-insurance) to see how they work.

**State Farm’s rental car and travel expenses coverage** is superior to what’s offered by its competitors. Not only does State Farm auto insurance pay for a rental car if yours is in the shop due to an issue covered by your collision or comprehensive coverage, but it also pays for meals, lodging and transportation if you’re stranded more than 50 miles from home. Coverage limits apply and vary by state, and you need to have comprehensive or collision coverage to opt in.

**The Steer Clear Driver Program** is a driver training refresher course available online, through an agent or via mobile app. State Farm offers savings for drivers under age 25 who complete the course and have had no at-fault accidents or moving violations within the past three years.

**Rideshare insurance:** If you drive for a company such as Uber or Lyft, this option allows you to have one policy that covers both personal and ridesharing use. This option is not available in all states.

**Do you know the different types of car insurance?** Reading State Farm insurance reviews won’t be much help if you’re not familiar with the types of car insurance and the coverage you need. Use the tool below to clear up any doubts.

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) and full [ratings methodology for auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

**Average rates methodology**

NerdWallet averaged rates based on public filings obtained by pricing analytics company Quadrant Information Services. We examined rates for men and women for all ZIP codes in any of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.

In our analysis, “good drivers” had no moving violations on record; a “good driving” discount was included for this profile. Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are average rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider.

Sample drivers had the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability coverage per crash.
* $50,000 property damage liability coverage per crash.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per crash.
* Collision coverage with $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with $1,000 deductible.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good credit.”
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash costing $10,000 in property damage.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken-driving violation.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE in all cases and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven. We analyzed rates for drivers of the following ages: 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 and 70.

**Auto insurance survey methodology**

The opt-in survey of 7,503 U.S. adults ages 18 and older was conducted online by Russell Research on behalf of NerdWallet in June and July 2024. Respondents were asked to rate one auto insurance brand they obtained or renewed a policy within the past 12 months, with at least some changes to the original policy. These brands were rated on overall satisfaction, overall value, online experience, trustworthiness, mobile app experience, claims experience and customer support on a scale of 1-100.

Only brands with 100 or more qualifying respondents are reported. Of those respondents: 300 were State Farm customers, 300 were Progressive customers, 300 were Allstate customers, 300 were GEICO customers, 100 were USAA customers, 157 were AAA customers, 100 were Liberty Mutual customers, 100 were American Family customers, 100 were Farmers customers, 100 were Travelers customers and 101 were Nationwide customers.
