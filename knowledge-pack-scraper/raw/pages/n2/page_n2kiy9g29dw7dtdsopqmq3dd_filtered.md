Drivers who are young and inexperienced are more likely to make a mistake and cause an accident. As a result, Los Angeles teens pay more than twice as much for minimum coverage insurance as a 30-year-old driver.

### How to save on teen car insurance

Outside of comparing quotes from multiple companies, you can also save money by doing the following:

* **[Ask about discounts](/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts").** Insurance companies typically have discounts for safe drivers and good students, and for installing safety features in your car. You may already be eligible for some of these discounts.
* **[Stay on your parents' insurance policy, if you can](/family-car-insurance "Cheapest Family Car Insurance").** If your older family members already have insurance, ask if you can join their policy. Sharing with a low-risk driver, like a parent, increases the cost of their policy, but it is likely cheaper than having two separate policies. Some insurance companies even offer discounts for adding cars to your policy.

## What's the best coverage for drivers in LA?

**Full coverage car insurance is the best choice for most LA drivers.**

Full coverage pays for repairs to your own car, as well as any damage you cause to another driver in a crash. A full coverage policy includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?").

* **Comprehensive coverage** helps pay for damage caused by events out of your control, like natural disasters, theft, vandalism, shattered windows, a crash with an animal, falling objects and fires.
* **Collision coverage** helps pay for damage caused by driving into another vehicle or object, including crashing into another car (or another car crashing into your car while it's parked), or driving into a ditch and your car flipping over.

Minimum liability coverage is the cheapest and lowest amount of coverage you can buy, but it won't pay to fix your own car. If you get into an expensive accident and don’t have enough insurance coverage, you could find yourself paying thousands of dollars to the other driver.
