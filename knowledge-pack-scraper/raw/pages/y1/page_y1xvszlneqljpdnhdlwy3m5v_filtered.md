### What Safe Driving Discounts Does Geico Offer?

Car insurance companies are all about risk, and drivers with accidents and tickets are more likely to cost the insurance company money. That’s why Geico offers significant [car insurance discounts](https://www.carinsurancecompanies.com/car-insurance-discounts-top-ways-to-save/) for drivers who practice safe driving.

For more information read our [What is included in the Geico defensive driving course?](https://www.carinsurancecompanies.com/what-is-included-in-the-geico-defensive-driving-course/)

You can also save with Geico’s safe driver discount app Geico DriveEasy. Telematics in the DriveEasy app monitors certain driving behaviors, such as distracted driving, mileage, and hard braking.

DriveEasy offers immediate feedback, allowing drivers to correct lousy driving in real time. Safe drivers also earn a discount based on how well they score, meaning drivers with poor safe driving skills may see rates increase.

## How does safe driving affect Geico car insurance rates?

Several factors affect car insurance rates, such as age, vehicle, credit score, and where you live. However, your driving history is the most significant factor that affects your rates.

![What Factors May Affect Your Car Insurance Premium? | Allstate Insurance]()![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg)

Car insurance companies look closely at your driving record to see how likely you will cost them money by causing an accident.

For example, the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/index.html) reports that over 2.5 million people went to the hospital in 2019 due to car crashes. Since hospital visits are expensive, car insurance companies pay massive amounts for accident claims.

Car insurance companies reward safe drivers with low rates and additional discounts because of high costs.

This table shows Geico’s average car insurance rates based on driving records. Drivers with accidents, tickets, and DUIs see much higher rates.

**Geico Average Monthly Car Insurance Rates Based on Driving Records**

| Driving Record | Average Monthly Rates |
| --- | --- |
| Clean | $178.83 |
| One Speeding Ticket | $220.45 |
| One Accident | $266.06 |
| One DUI | $406.32 |

* [How long does a ticket stay on your record?](https://www.CarInsuranceCompanies.com/how-long-does-a-ticket-stay-on-your-record/)
* [How many points on your license is a speeding ticket?](https://www.CarInsuranceCompanies.com/how-many-points-on-your-license-is-a-speeding-ticket/)

Although one speeding ticket raises rates by around $40 a month, one accident raises them about $90 a month. So the best way to keep car insurance rates low is to maintain a clean driving record.

Geico drivers that maintain a clean driving record and take advantage of safe driving discounts have low rates.

## What other discounts does Geico offer?

Don’t worry if you aren’t eligible for a Geico safe driving discount. Many other discounts may be available to you.

Sadly, there aren’t any hidden discounts to search out, but Geico offers many discounts based on the driver, vehicle, and policy.

For example, suppose you have an accident and don’t qualify for a good driver discount. In that case, you may be eligible for a multi-policy discount based on your car’s safety features.

This table shows Geico car insurance discounts, with the savings amount listed if it is available.
