# Home security gadgets to consider

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

Aside from a smoke detector, what safety and security devices are available for homeowners? We have a few suggestions for you to consider.

Many people may know about [basic household protection gadgets](/simple-insights/residence/fire-safety-equipment-for-home) like the smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector, but there are other home safety devices that can help make a difference in your home security.

## Peephole viewer

Traditional small peepholes are difficult to see through, making it easier for unannounced — and potentially dangerous — visitors to get you to open your door. LCD peephole viewers are handy home safety gadgets that can let residents view their visitors on screens that are about the size of a handheld digital camera. Features can include wide angle and zoom modes, low-light visibility and image-recording capability.

## TV simulator

Timed lights that come on at the same time each night may not discourage burglars, but the flickering light of a television might. Rather than leaving your TV on when you're [away from home](/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-protect-your-home-when-you-travel), consider looking into LED TV simulator units. These small devices use less energy than a TV and emit lights that flicker and change color and intensity, giving the appearance that a TV is on — and that someone is home.

## Water leak alarm

When a [sump pump](/simple-insights/residence/sump-pump-basics) overflows or a washing machine hose fails, you could be out thousands of dollars in repair bills. Instead, a wireless water leak alarm can alert you to a leak before it becomes a house-wide disaster. When they detect a leak, these devices send out a loud alarm. For added protection, think about installing a [water leak detection system](/simple-insights/residence/water-leak-detection) that can automatically shut off the entire water supply if a leak is detected.

## Talking smoke detector

You may think no one could sleep through the shrill alarm of a traditional smoke detector, but it can happen. As an alternative, you may want to consider its increasingly popular alternative: a voice evacuation system, or voice alarm. "Talking" smoke and carbon monoxide detectors can emit pre-recorded messages that can begin the process of waking family members and providing emergency instructions more immediately than a traditional fire alarm.

## Dryer vent pressure system sensor

Over time, lint from a [clothes dryer](/simple-insights/residence/how-to-care-for-your-clothes-dryer) can accumulate in the exhaust vent, clogging it and creating flammable conditions. Though annual cleanings of your exhaust vent are recommended, a pressure system sensor can let you know when a lint clog is inhibiting air movement. These systems send out an alarm when air movement is restricted in the vent, potentially giving you time to help [prevent a fire](/simple-insights/residence/protect-your-home-against-these-common-causes-of-house-fires) before it's too late.

## Smart door locks

A smart lock is a lock mechanism that operates electronically, replacing analog lock-and-key systems with what could be described as a lock-and-phone system. In place of a key turned inside a traditional lock, a smart lock can be unlocked by biometric features such as fingerprint scanners, numeric codes or by authorized users through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi applications connected to a smartphone. This can eliminate the need to carry a physical door key. In conjunction with [secure door hinges](/simple-insights/residence/safer-door-hinges-to-make-your-home-more-secure), home security gadgets, like smart locks, can help streamline and enhance the security of your home’s access points.

## Home security cameras (outdoor and indoor)

Security cameras can help provide enhanced visibility and security of the interior and exterior of your home. Over the past few years, the accessibility and availability of home security cameras has increased as companies offer more retail models than ever before. Many of these models offer app-based integration, allowing users to check security camera footage from their smartphones, use cloud storage to store recorded video and more.

## Smart plugs

Smart plugs can offer an easy way to automate the functions of devices you plug into an outlet or socket. Typically, setup is as simple as inserting the smart plug into an outlet and following the directions on its corresponding mobile app to connect with your home’s Wi-Fi network. From there, you can connect an appliance’s power cord to your smart plug and control it from your phone. This can help save power, reduce your power bill and add convenient functional features to your home like automated lights or climate control. Smart plugs are a great starting point for those looking to create a smart home.

## Alerting devices

Effective smoke alarms are a crucial part of home fire preparedness and an effective [fire escape plan](/simple-insights/residence/prepare-a-home-fire-evacuation-plan-with-your-family). But traditional fire alarms rely on sound, which doesn't account for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Thankfully, there are special [alerting devices](https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/assistive-listening-devices/alerting-devices) specifically made to provide warnings for those with hearing impairments. Just remember, as with any smoke alarm, to regularly check the batteries and confirm that they're in good working order.

## Motion-activated outdoor lights

Motion-activated outdoor lights can be a strong addition to a home, especially when there are no additional sources of illumination, like nearby streetlights. Motion-sensor lights are triggered by movement, making them ideal for those seeking a greater sense of security and a potential deterrent for wandering wildlife.

The world of tech has a lot to offer a homeowner. If you’re considering making your home “smarter,” you may want to research ways to [secure smart home devices](/simple-insights/residence/how-to-secure-your-smart-home-devices).
