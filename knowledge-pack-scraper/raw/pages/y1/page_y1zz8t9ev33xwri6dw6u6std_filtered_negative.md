![Person's hand holding a smoke detector against a wooden wall.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/91-safety-gagets-wide.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Many people may know about [basic household protection gadgets](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/fire-safety-equipment-for-home) like the smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector, but there are other home safety devices that can help make a difference in your home security.
Timed lights that come on at the same time each night may not discourage burglars, but the flickering light of a television might. Rather than leaving your TV on when you're [away from home](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-protect-your-home-when-you-travel), consider looking into LED TV simulator units. These small devices use less energy than a TV and emit lights that flicker and change color and intensity, giving the appearance that a TV is on — and that someone is home.
When a [sump pump](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/sump-pump-basics) overflows or a washing machine hose fails, you could be out thousands of dollars in repair bills. Instead, a wireless water leak alarm can alert you to a leak before it becomes a house-wide disaster. When they detect a leak, these devices send out a loud alarm. For added protection, think about installing a [water leak detection system](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/water-leak-detection) that can automatically shut off the entire water supply if a leak is detected.
Over time, lint from a [clothes dryer](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-care-for-your-clothes-dryer) can accumulate in the exhaust vent, clogging it and creating flammable conditions. Though annual cleanings of your exhaust vent are recommended, a pressure system sensor can let you know when a lint clog is inhibiting air movement. These systems send out an alarm when air movement is restricted in the vent, potentially giving you time to help [prevent a fire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/protect-your-home-against-these-common-causes-of-house-fires) before it's too late.
A smart lock is a lock mechanism that operates electronically, replacing analog lock-and-key systems with what could be described as a lock-and-phone system. In place of a key turned inside a traditional lock, a smart lock can be unlocked by biometric features such as fingerprint scanners, numeric codes or by authorized users through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi applications connected to a smartphone. This can eliminate the need to carry a physical door key. In conjunction with [secure door hinges](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/safer-door-hinges-to-make-your-home-more-secure), home security gadgets, like smart locks, can help streamline and enhance the security of your home’s access points.
Effective smoke alarms are a crucial part of home fire preparedness and an effective [fire escape plan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/prepare-a-home-fire-evacuation-plan-with-your-family). But traditional fire alarms rely on sound, which doesn't account for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Thankfully, there are special [alerting devices](https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/assistive-listening-devices/alerting-devices) specifically made to provide warnings for those with hearing impairments. Just remember, as with any smoke alarm, to regularly check the batteries and confirm that they're in good working order.
The world of tech has a lot to offer a homeowner. If you’re considering making your home “smarter,” you may want to research ways to [secure smart home devices](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-secure-your-smart-home-devices).
