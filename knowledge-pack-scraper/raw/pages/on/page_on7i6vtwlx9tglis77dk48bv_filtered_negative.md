I actually got a notice of cancelation of coverage from State Farm over the summer – notifying us that coverage would not be renewed beyond our December policy renewal date. I was grateful that we had as much advance notice that we received. Through a friend of a friend we found a suitable replacement policy that went into effect in November. And it was less expensive!

I haven’t received such a notice (yet). After Hurricane Iniki I had my house retro-fitted with hurricane clips at the roof and bolting of the 4×4 supports and beams to each other and the concrete slab. State Farm agent saw them several times over the years when the agent came to inspect. Here’s hoping that’s why I haven’t received a notice. I know that State Farm has been mass canceling insurance in California so this may be an offshoot of that.

The issue cited in my cancellation notice was “single wall construction.” Not sure hurricane clips mitigate that.

Hurricane clips are supposed to keep the roof framing from separating from the wall’s top plate. In single wall construction only the siding holds the top plate whereas in double wall construction the studs add additional connectivity.

They bolted the posts and beams to each other and also bolted the posts to the concrete slab. I had my doubts and questioned the tech guy. He said it was the connecting of everything together with clips and bolts that strengthens the house overall. One of my friends got the concrete casements that hold nets to deploy over the roof corners to hold the roof down. They’ve deployed twice since Iniki, and it held in high winds that weren’t hurricane strength. Guess we’ll never really know if any of this works until there’s an actual hurricane.

My agent says I won’t receive a cancellation notice because even though my house is single-walled, it is not located near water nor in an area considered higher risk based on current maps.

Thanks for the heads-up notice, Ian. It is bad new for me because we now have State Farm for fire etc AND hurricane for our single-wall home. I have not, however received a notice from State Farm.

Hawaii’s governor is leading the pack in challenging the insurance industry over the Lahaina Wildfire. He is asking the courts to overturn the long-time practice of subrogation claims.

... failed to mention that in addition to policy cancellations, homeowner’s insurance rates are being exorbitantly increased.

Switched from two different carriers for two of my homes to State Farm. One policy premium was almost cut in half. Other one was about 20% less. This is on the Big Island with different hazard zones.

If insurance companies can make money, they will sell policies. If they cannot make money, they won’t sell policies. It is really that simple. It isn’t anything personal, just business. No conspiracies. They will not forgo a profit just to get back at someone because they don’t like them. For example. California. It is every major insurance company’s biggest market. Yet, they are all leaving or restricting coverage. If they were making billions and billions of dollars, does it make sense to do that? Also, if the potential or current losses were billions and billions of dollars would it make sense to continue to do business in certain areas at the risk of jeopardizing the premiums/coverage of ALL policyholders. Insurance, for the most part, is a free market exercise. A question to ask yourself is if YOU had to put up your all your own money to pay for the claim of someone else. Would you prefer to insure a single wall home for hurricane/wildfire/whatever? Or a concrete structure? Nothing personal. Just business.

Thank you for your comments. Yes, I failed to mention that it is not too difficult to strengthen single wall construction, but will the insurance industry accept that. They seem to lump everybody into a particular risk category.

Thank you for all the great info. At the time of Iniki, a builder friend essentially told me what you’ve said. He told me not to waste money on expensive hurricane insurance but put the money into strengthening the house instead. I never thought about consulting an engineer, but am thinking about it now. Thanks again.

Gerry, if you are attempting to sell a product or a service, I suggest you explain in layman terms. Too much technical jargon for most.

I know one person that had their single-wall construction house insurance cancelled by State Farm despite having hurricane clips and another person had to use a sketchy insurance company in order to close on their single-wall construction purchase. So many homes in the islands are single-wall, seems ridiculous that insurance companies are suddenly getting strict. TBH, if a hurricane hits, we will have much more problems than damaged homes.
