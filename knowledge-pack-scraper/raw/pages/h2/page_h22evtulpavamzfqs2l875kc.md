# Rideshare insurance: What to know
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
As a rideshare driver, it’s important to understand your rideshare insurance options and how it can help facilitate coverage protection. 
**_Overview:_**_If you're driving for a rideshare service, your personal car insurance policy might not cover you while you're working. Because standard policies often exclude carrying persons for a charge, specialized rideshare insurance may be necessary in order to help protect yourself from potentially significant financial risks. Understanding the difference and finding the right coverage for you can help keep you protected while earning income on the road._
[Rideshare driving](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/are-uber-and-lyft-safe) has become a popular way to earn extra income or build a full-time career. Transportation Network Companies (also known as TNCs) offer flexibility and convenience, which allows drivers to set their own schedules. However, many drivers are not fully aware of the unique insurance requirements that come with this role. Driving for TNCs could expose you to risks that aren't covered by personal auto insurance. [Rideshare insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/rideshare-coverage) can help bridge the coverage gap and offer coverage during the different periods of ridesharing.

## How is rideshare insurance different than auto insurance?
Your personal auto insurance is designed for private use, such as commuting, errands or leisure travel. While this generally includes standard coverages (such as [liability insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), [collision insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) and [comprehensive insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage)), it typically excludes commercial activities like "driving for hire."
This means that when you log into a rideshare app (even when waiting for a ride request), your personal auto insurance may not provide coverage. If you're in an accident or encounter unexpected damage while logged into the app, your insurer might not cover your claim.
Rideshare insurance can help fill these gaps between your personal auto policy and the rideshare company's coverage. It is designed specifically for drivers who use their personal vehicles for ridesharing.
## Periods of rideshare driving and potential coverage gaps
When logged into your rideshare app, your driving activity is usually divided into different periods. While TNCs often provide coverage throughout the periods, this insurance typically has periods where certain coverages may be unavailable that may leave drivers exposed. Rideshare insurance coverage is often different during each period:
  * If the app is off, rideshare insurance does not provide coverage.
  * If the app is on and you are available for a match, there's generally a small amount of liability coverage provided.
  * Once you're matched with a rider or giving a ride, your TNC may offer more coverage. However, it often doesn't extend to damages to your car, and policy limits may vary by state and company.


**Rideshare app period**
**Period description**
**Potential coverage (without rideshare insurance)**
**Potential of no coverage?**
App off
Rideshare app is off
Standard coverage from personal auto insurance policy
No — you will likely only be covered by your personal auto policy.
Period one
Rideshare app is active, but you haven’t accepted a ride yet
Limited liability coverage from TNC
Yes — TNCs may only offer limited liability coverage, which might not extend to your vehicle or sufficiently cover damages.
Period two & three
Driving to pick up a passenger or have a passenger in your vehicle
More liability coverage from TNC
Yes — TNCs may offer more liability coverage, but property damage or medical costs could leave you financially exposed as the insured.
**Note:** Any coverage mentioned above is subject to each policy’s specific terms, conditions, exclusions and may change over time.
## Risks of driving without rideshare insurance
Without rideshare insurance, you might be taking risks with important consequences, including:
  * **Denied claims** — during Period one, if you're in an accident, your personal auto insurance may not provide certain coverages and, in some cases, even the rideshare company’s policy may not cover certain damages.
  * **Policy cancellation** — if your personal auto insurance provider discovers that you’ve been engaging in ridesharing without their knowledge, they might cancel your policy. This could make it harder and more expensive for you to obtain insurance from other providers.
  * **Financial hardship** — with denied claims or policy cancellations, you could be required to pay for damage, lawsuits or [medical bills](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/medical-payments-coverage) out of pocket.


## How to choose the right rideshare insurance for you
Finding the right rideshare insurance doesn’t have to be complicated. Following these steps can help with your coverage protection:
  * **Talk to your insurance agent** — share your rideshare activities when [discussing coverage with your agent](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/insurance-questions-to-ask-your-agent).
  * **Ask about rideshare endorsements** — many insurance providers now offer specific rideshare endorsements, so ask if such an option is available with your current policy.
  * **Compare quotes** — if your insurer doesn’t offer rideshare policies, consider shopping around for quotes to help ensure you're receiving appropriate protection at a fair price.
  * **Read your new policy** — [read through your new policy](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-read-auto-insurance-quotes) to fully understand the terms, coverage limits and potential exclusions. Insurers may have different requirements depending on your state or the rideshare service you’re driving for.


Having rideshare insurance can help you focus on driving protected while earning income. To learn more about rideshare insurance options to help fit your needs, [contact a State Farm agent today](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) or [explore quotes online](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto).
