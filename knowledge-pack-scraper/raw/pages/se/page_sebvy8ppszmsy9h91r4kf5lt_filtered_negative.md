**For[more affordable rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens \(and Their Parents\)"), young drivers should consider joining their parents' car insurance policy.** Although your parents' rates will increase, joining a family policy is usually cheaper than buying a policy on your own.

State Farm offers [roadside assistance #roadside ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-aaa-vs-state-farm-car-insurance#roadside "#roadside") as an optional coverage add-on. You can buy State Farm's coverage instead of a AAA membership and will get most of the same benefits.
State Farm offers [roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance Program Comparisons") for about $1 extra per month. The State Farm emergency roadside assistance program pays for towing, tire changes and fuel delivery, and other issues you may have if your car breaks down on the side of the road.
State Farm and AAA offer many of the [same coverage features when it comes to roadside assistance #roadside ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-aaa-vs-state-farm-car-insurance#roadside "#roadside"). State Farm includes delivery of oil and tires, and AAA does not. On the other hand, AAA will send help if your car is stuck in mud or snow, which State Farm doesn't cover.
ValuePenguin used car insurance quotes from thousands of ZIP codes across  three states to compare pricing from AAA and State Farm. Rates are for a 30-year-old man with good credit who owns a 2015 Honda Civic EX.
