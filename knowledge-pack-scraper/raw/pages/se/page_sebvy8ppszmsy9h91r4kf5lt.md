**Unlike State Farm, which is a single company, AAA is actually many independent companies.** Which AAA company you buy a policy from depends on where you live.
Since State Farm has one customer service department, customers should have a similar customer service experience. But the service you get from AAA depends on the auto club's branch in your area.
AAA's coverage options and discounts also fluctuate quite a bit depending on where you live.

## State Farm vs. AAA car insurance coverage
AAA and State Farm both offer a few extra coverage options.
AAA may have more add-ons than State Farm in some states. However, you'll have to get a quote from AAA to see what's available near you.
### AAA vs. State Farm auto insurance coverage options
Coverage | AAA | State Farm  
---|---|---  
**Extra coverage options** |  |   
[Gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance: How Does It Work and Do I Need It?") |  |   
[Roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") |  |   
[Rental reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") |  |   
Accident forgiveness | In some states |  Limited availability  
[Nonowners insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-car-insurance-who-should-have-it "Non Owner Car Insurance: What Is It and Who Should Have It?") | In some states |   
[New car replacement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-car-replacement-insurance "New Car Replacement Insurance") | In some states |   
Show All Rows
Both AAA and State Farm offer [standard car insurance coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance") like property damage liability and medical payments coverage.
### AAA car insurance coverage options
AAA offers a few coverages not available at State Farm that you can use to customize your policy, like gap insurance and new car replacement. However, these options may not be available in every state.
Gap coverage
[Gap coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance: How Does It Work and Do I Need It?") ensures you won't owe money on a car you no longer have if you total your leased or financed vehicle.
For instance, if you have comprehensive coverage and a tree branch falls on your car, that's covered by your insurance.
If you don't have comprehensive coverage, the insurance company won't cover this situation. That means your gap insurance wouldn't apply. 
Enhanced exterior repair
This coverage guarantees AAA will fix the exterior of your car using original manufacturer parts after an accident. Without this coverage, insurance companies may pay for cheaper aftermarket parts that are of lower quality. 
Nonowners coverage
If you don't own a car, but regularly drive someone else's, you'll need [nonowners coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-car-insurance-who-should-have-it "Non-Owner Car Insurance: What Is It and Who Should Have It?") to drive legally. 
New car replacement
[New car replacement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-car-replacement-insurance "New Car Replacement Insurance") will replace your car with a brand new model after an accident. This coverage is typically only available for cars that are 1 or 2 years old. 
### State Farm car insurance coverage options
State Farm offers classic car coverage and rideshare coverage. AAA doesn't typically offer these coverage add-ons.
Rideshare coverage
[Rideshare coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "Rideshare Insurance: Why You Need It and What It Costs") helps bridge the gap between your personal auto insurance and the coverage provided by the rideshare company you drive for. 
Classic car coverage
[Classic car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/classic-car-insurance "Classic Car Insurance: What Is It? How Does It Work?") is typically for cars over 25 years old, exotic cars, muscle cars or highly customized vehicles. 
### State Farm roadside assistance vs. AAA
State Farm and AAA both offer roadside assistance programs as an add-on to your car insurance policy.
Both companies charge about $1 per month for this service.
**AAA's roadside assistance add-on is very limited.** It doesn't cover oil or tire delivery, which can be important if you're stranded on the side of the road.
However, AAA offers more comprehensive roadside assistance as part of its membership programs. Membership programs typically start at $59 per year. They can also include perks like travel planning and identity theft protection.
#### State Farm emergency road service vs. AAA
Coverage | AAA | State Farm  
---|---|---  
24/7 service |  |   
Delivery of batteries or gas |  |   
Delivery of oil or tires |  |   
Jump start |  |   
Labor |  |   
Show All Rows
Some of the main differences are:
  * **State Farm pays for oil and tire delivery** , while AAA doesn't. 
  * **AAA only replaces a flat tire with your own spare** since it doesn't deliver tires. 
  * **AAA will help move your car if it's stuck in mud, snow or ice** , and a tow truck can safely reach it from a main road. State Farm doesn't offer this service. 
  * **AAA makes minor repairs that don't require parts.** On the other hand, State Farm offers up to one hour of labor for fluid leaks (excluding fuel), electrical problems, transmission issues and other mechanical problems.

## AAA car insurance vs. State Farm auto insurance discounts
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90//icons/award)
State Farm typically offers more [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") than AAA.

### AAA auto insurance discounts
One of AAA's largest discounts is its low-mileage discount. You can save up to 19.1% off your auto insurance rate if you occasionally provide odometer readings to AAA. Drivers who belong to a professional organization or alumni association can save up to 7.4%, and a car club membership can save you up to 5%.
After having AAA insurance for one year, you're also eligible for its loyalty discount. This can save you up to 5.6%.

You must complete course training, practice driving and have an older driver mentor you. To qualify, you can't have any tickets or at-fault accidents for three years.

## AAA insurance vs. State Farm customer service ratings
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90//icons/award)
State Farm earned a better customer service score from our editors than AAA.
That's because drivers nationwide have a more reliable experience at State Farm.
  * **State Farm offers excellent customer service across the country.** State Farm's satisfied customers have also helped earn it an above-average score from J.D. Power. In addition, the company gets 22% fewer complaints than competitors of a similar size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
  * **AAA's customer service experience is harder to judge.** AAA is made up of over 40 independent companies. So a driver in California could have a vastly different experience dealing with AAA than one in Florida.
For example, J.D. Power included three of AAA's major subsidiaries in its most recent auto insurance study. Auto Club of Southern California earned a great score for claims satisfaction. AAA's other branches, CSAA Insurance Group and Automobile Club Group, earned some of the lowest scores.
