### Does Florida Allow Non-Owner Car Insurance?
If you drive a vehicle frequently but don't own it, Florida allows you to buy a non-owner policy to meet minimum coverage car insurance requirements.

![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)
FLORIDA MINIMUM INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
[Florida's minimum coverage requirements](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/) apply to non-owner car insurance policies. These limits include:
  * $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP)
  * $10,000 in property damage liability (PDL)


Minimum coverage insurance may not always provide enough protection for all policyholders. Consider [how much coverage you need](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) before buying a policy.
### Should You Get Non-Owner Car Insurance in Florida?
Non-owner car insurance is worth considering if you don't own a vehicle but drive one often. This type of insurance benefits those who rent cars, borrow cars from friends or family, need to keep their driver's licenses active or want to reinstate their driving privileges.
![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)
AVOID ONE-DAY CAR INSURANCE
Beware of providers claiming to offer "one-day insurance" in Florida. This product doesn’t exist in the state and may signal insurance fraud. For [temporary coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/temporary-car-insurance-florida/), like a move or road trip, buying insurance through a car rental company is safer.
#### Who Should Consider Non-Owner Car Insurance?
The following types of drivers should consider a non-owner policy:
![carColored icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_mfikug.svg)
Car borrowers
Non-owner car insurance is ideal for those who occasionally borrow a car from a friend or relative. This policy covers the car's owner in the event of an accident, so you won't have to worry about potential losses. It can also provide additional liability protection and peace of mind when borrowing another person's vehicle.
![ignition icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/ignition_rqjrdj.svg)
Occasional renters
A non-owner policy can provide coverage for rental vehicles, so the driver doesn't have to worry about purchasing insurance from the rental car company.
![seatbelt icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/seatbelt_ltgoph.svg)
Drivers between cars
This insurance is helpful for drivers without continuous coverage, such as during a transition between vehicles. It offers financial protection and helps maintain continuous coverage, which can lead to lower premiums when buying a standard policy later.
![driverLicense icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/driver-license_qzgm49.svg)
License reinstatement-seekers
Non-owner car insurance can be crucial for drivers trying to reinstate their licenses after a suspension. This type of policy can provide the necessary proof of insurance to get a license reinstated.


![carAccident icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car-accident_q9upxd.svg)
WHAT IS SR-22 INSURANCE?
An [SR-22](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/sr22-car-insurance-florida/), also known as an SR-22 Certificate of Financial Responsibility (CFR), is not a type of insurance but a document that insurance companies file with your state's DMV. This form proves your insurance meets your state's minimum coverage requirements. States may require an SR-22 if you’ve been cited for driving without insurance or convicted of a DUI or other major traffic offense.
