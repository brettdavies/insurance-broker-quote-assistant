You can get non-owner car insurance from most major insurers if you have a valid driver’s license, do not own a vehicle, and do not live with someone who owns a car. Getting non-owner car insurance is similar to getting normal car insurance, except that non-owner car insurance is cheaper. A non-owner policy also cannot include [collision](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/collision-insurance/7292) or [comprehensive](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/comprehensive-insurance/97768) insurance, since it does not cover a specific vehicle.

Non-owner car insurance provides New York's minimum car insurance coverage for people who don't own a car but drive often. In New York, non-owner insurance can pay for injuries and property damage that you cause others, but it won't pay for damage to the borrowed car. A non-owner policy can also satisfy an SR-22 requirement if you need insurance to get your license reinstated but don't own a car.

## Non-Owner Car Insurance Requirements in New York

* $25,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per person
* $50,000 in bodily injury liability coverage per accident
* $10,000 in property damage liability coverage
* $50,000 in PIP coverage

Certain other types of coverage—like collision, comprehensive, and rental reimbursement—are not available with non-owner car insurance policies because there isn't a specific vehicle for the policy to insure.

## Who Needs Non-Owner Car Insurance in New York?

You may need a non-owner policy **if you don't own a car** and you:

* **Want to avoid a lapse in coverage.** Canceling your car insurance policy creates a lapse in your insurance history, even if you don't have a car to cover. If you change to a non-owner policy instead of canceling, you can avoid lapses and be protected if you borrow a car.

* **Need insurance to satisfy a court order.** After major traffic violations, you may be required to maintain proof of insurance in order to regain your driving privileges, even if you don't own a car. This is common if you've been convicted of driving without insurance or DUI/DWI, for example.

* **Rent cars regularly.** A non-owner policy may be cheaper than paying for liability coverage from the rental company. Not all non-owner policies extend coverage to rental cars, though, so be sure to confirm your policy covers rentals.

* **Borrow cars regularly.** Non-owner insurance can supplement the owner's policy after an accident. If damages exceed the owner's limits, your non-owner policy will kick in as secondary coverage, so you don't have to cover the costs out of pocket.

A non-owner car insurance policy can protect you from financial hardships if you cause an accident while driving a borrowed car. Even though car insurance usually follows the car and not the driver, you could still be on the hook for expenses if damages exceed the owner's policy limits. Whether you're a regular renter or need affordable coverage while you're between vehicles to avoid a gap in your insurance history, the right non-owner policy can provide the coverage you need.

Still, a non-owner policy won't always be the right fit.

You should NOT get a non-owner policy if you:

* **Own a car.** In New York, you're required to carry personal injury protection, uninsured motorist and liability coverage if you own a car. You may also want to consider collision, comprehensive, and other coverage types, like, gap insurance, or roadside assistance.

* **Borrow the same car regularly.** If you have regular access to the same car, you should be listed on the owner's policy. If your spouse, parents, siblings, children, family members, friends, neighbors, etc. own a car that you use often, you should be a listed driver.

* **Cannot get a valid driver's license.** If you don't have a valid driver's license and cannot provide a valid driver's license number, you won't be able to finalize a policy.

* **Use a borrowed car for work.** A commercial non-owner policy might be better suited to this situation. If you drive a company car, the vehicle likely has enough coverage. You'll want to confirm primary coverage before making a decision about a secondary non-owner policy.

## How to Get Non-Owner Car Insurance in New York

To purchase a non-owner car insurance policy, you'll have to speak with an agent on the phone or in person. Not all insurance companies offer non-owner policies, and those that do have them don't give online quotes.

To purchase a non-owner policy, you'll need your driver's license number and a credit or debit card. It's also helpful to have a summary of your driving history, such as tickets, accidents, and license suspension information, so you can get the most accurate quote. In most cases, you can get proof of insurance the same day, and you're covered as soon as your payment goes through.

Non-owner coverage may not be as easy to find as a traditional policy, but below are some of the top companies that may offer non-owner insurance in New York.

## How Much Does Non-Owner Car Insurance Cost in New York?

The average cost of a non-owner auto insurance policy in New York is $576 per year. For comparison, an owner's policy with minimum liability coverage costs an average of $1,719 per year in New York. Your rate will change depending on the amount of liability coverage you want or if you want any additional coverage types, like uninsured motorist insurance.

Non-owner coverage is less expensive than policies covering a vehicle, but since there's no car to insure, you are the main factor that determines your rate. If you have less-than-perfect credit, a spotty driving record, or are a high-risk driver, you're still going to pay more than someone with a clean driving history and excellent credit looking for the same policy. Other factors, like your age, marital status, and neighborhood are also considered.
