Which Auto Insurance is Better?
## Progressive vs. State Farm Average Cost Comparison
Cost is naturally one of the most important factors when you’re choosing an auto insurance company. In this category, Progressive comes out on top for drivers with clean records, DUIs and low credit, as the company offers lower rates, on average, for standard full coverage. State Farm is cheaper for drivers with a speeding ticket or an accident on their record.
Company | Progressive | State Farm  
---|---|---  
Full coverage | $1,960 | $2,167  
Minimum coverage | $638 | $674  
25-year-old drivers | $2,067 | $2,073  
Senior drivers | $1,617 | $1,969  
Speeding ticket | $2,640 | $2,345  
Accident | $3,169 | $2,917  
DUI | $2,770 | $3,151  
Low credit | $3,414 | $6,814  
All of these rates are averages, so keep in mind that your quoted premiums may differ. It’s always wise to get rates from more than one company because a different one may be cheaper for your specific profile.
Having a violation on your record can make it harder to find car insurance coverage. Even though Progressive’s rates for a DUI are lower than State Farm’s, they’re still higher than rates for drivers with clean driving records. Drivers who are having trouble finding coverage should look at the [best auto insurers for high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/).
## Progressive vs. State Farm Coverage Options
Both Progressive and State Farm offer the standard coverage options, including [liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/liability/), [comprehensive, collision](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/), medical payments, personal injury protection, and uninsured/underinsured motorist.
Notably, State Farm does not offer accident forgiveness, which could be a dealbreaker if this is important to you
In addition, both offer optional add-on coverage options that can provide more robust financial protection based on your situation:
Coverage | Progressive | State Farm  
---|---|---  
Roadside assistance | Yes | Yes  
Rental car reimbursement | Yes | Yes  
Loan/lease payoff | Yes | No*  
Accident forgiveness | Yes | No  
Vehicle protection/mechanical breakdown insurance | Yes | No  
Custom parts and equipment value coverage | Yes | No  
Rideshare coverage | Yes | Yes  
_*Vehicle loans from State Farm Bank include Payoff Protector coverage, which is similar._
Coverage options can vary by state, so always check your quote and talk with an agent to confirm what’s available in your area.
## Progressive vs. State Farm Discounts
Both State Farm and Progressive offer various [auto insurance discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/). These include common discounts, such as those for bundling different types of policies with one insurer, as well as [teen-specific discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/discounts-for-teen-drivers/), such as good-student discounts.
However, certain discounts are offered by only one of the two companies. So if you can benefit from these, it may affect your rate and, therefore, your choice of insurer. For example, only Progressive offers discounts for online quotes and paperless billing, so if you prefer to manage your policy online, this is a plus.
State Farm offers discounts for having certain safety features and/or anti-theft devices in your vehicle, however. So if you have a newer car, these discounts are worth investigating.
Below is a full list of the main discounts offered by both companies. Keep in mind that discounts vary by state, so always confirm what’s available where you live.
Discount | Progressive | State Farm  
---|---|---  
Bundling | Yes | Yes  
Multicar | Yes | Yes  
Continuous insurance | Yes | No  
Homeowner | Yes | No  
Defensive driving course | Yes | Yes  
Good driver | Yes | Yes  
Pay in full | Yes | Yes  
Automatic payment | Yes | No  
Online quote | Yes | No  
Paperless | Yes | No  
Safety features | No | Yes  
Anti-theft | No | Yes  
Good student | Yes | Yes  
Distant student | Yes | Yes  
Low mileage | No | Yes  
### Progressive vs. State Farm Telematics Programs
In addition to their standard discounts, Progressive and State Farm offer telematics discount programs. Progressive has [Snapshot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/snapshot/), while State Farm has [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) and Steer Clear, the latter of which is specifically for new drivers. These programs use a Bluetooth or plug-in device that you put in your car, as well as the mobile app, to track your driving habits and reward you with a discount for good driving.
When you sign up for Drive Safe & Save, you can get a discount of 5 to 10 percent, and you may get up to 30 percent or more at your next renewal, depending on your state and driving habits. The program is not available in California, Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
Progressive doesn’t advertise the maximum percentage discount for Snapshot, but it claims that safe drivers save an average of $231 when they renew their policy and an average of $94 at sign-up. Snapshot is not available in California, and the sign-up discount is not offered in Hawaii or New York.
State Farm’s telematics program ranked slightly higher than Progressive’s in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, with a score of 820 compared with Progressive’s 816. Both fell slightly below the average score of 821.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive-vs-state-farm/#citation-2)
Category | Progressive Snapshot | State Farm Drive Safe & Save  
---|---|---  
Potential discount | $94 at sign-up, $231 at renewal (advertised average) | 5% to 10% at sign-up, 30% at renewal  
Usage-based insurance satisfaction score (J.D. Power) | 816 out of 1,000 | 820 out of 1,000  
State Farm’s telematics program will not raise your rates if it detects unsafe driving, but depending on your state, Progressive’s Snapshot may result in a rate increase. This is an important consideration before you decide to opt in to the program.
## Progressive vs. State Farm Customer Service
Overall, customers seem to be more satisfied with State Farm’s customer service than with Progressive’s. Here’s how they stack up in various customer experience areas.
### Claims Satisfaction
In the 2024 J.D.

However, in the 2025 CRASH Network Insurer Report Card, which tracks auto shops’ experiences dealing with insurers, Progressive received a slightly higher score than State Farm.
Study | Progressive | State Farm  
---|---|---  
2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study | 672 out of 1,000 | 710 out of 1,000  
2025 CRASH Network Insurer Report Card | 75 out of 97, C grade | 81 out of 97, C- grade  
### Customer Service
Meanwhile, J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, which measures overall customer satisfaction with insurers, ranked State Farm between first and fifth in most regions. Progressive ranked below average in every region.
Here is a breakdown of each company’s score (out of 1,000) by region:
Region | Progressive | State Farm  
---|---|---  
California | 635 | 658  
Central | 638 | 647  
Florida | 587 | 650  
Mid-Atlantic | 624 | 652  
New England | 620 | 664  
New York | 621 | 662

Northwest | 607 | 656

Southwest | 614 | 646  
Texas | 616 | 654  
In addition, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a group that logs customer complaints against insurers, both companies receive more complaints than average, but State Farm fares slightly better. As of 2023, State Farm had an NAIC Complaint Index score of 1.96,[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive-vs-state-farm/#citation-4) while Progressive’s was 2.13.[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive-vs-state-farm/#citation-5) A score of 1 is considered the expected amount of complaints for a company in the market.

### Shopping
When it comes to shopping around for and purchasing an insurance policy, customers are more satisfied with State Farm’s process than Progressive’s, on average. Both companies offer flexible options for getting a quote, including online and on the phone with an agent. However, only Progressive allows customers to purchase a policy online.
It’s notable, therefore, that State Farm ranked more highly for customer service in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Insurance Shopping Study despite not offering the ease of online purchasing. It ranked fourth in the study, while Progressive ranked ninth.[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive-vs-state-farm/#citation-6) The study evaluates insurers on factors such as the policy offerings, price, quote process and distribution channel. Therefore, State Farm’s ranking suggests customers are satisfied with aspects such as pricing and availability of agents.

---|---|---  
J.D. Power U.S. Insurance Shopping Study score | 678 out of 1,000 | 695 out of 1,000

In the shopping category, Progressive scored above average, with a score of 519 out of 1,000, while State Farm scored below average, with a score of 513. The scores likely reflect that Progressive offers online quotes, while State Farm relies more on in-person agent interactions.

## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we use four key factors to evaluate auto insurers:
  * **Price (40%):** We analyze average premiums for both full and minimum coverage for a standard driving profile of a good driver with good credit. We also look at rates for other driver profiles, including those with violations or low credit. We also consider available discounts. Full-coverage averages use the following limits: 
    * Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
    * Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
    * Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
    * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
  * **Claims handling (25%):** An auto insurer’s claims handling process should be quick, transparent and efficient, with clear communication, fair evaluation of damages, and timely payment or resolution. We assess claims practices using sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P. We also include real-life customer experiences when possible.
  * **Customer experience (25%):** We evaluate the ease of the customer journey, from getting a quote and purchasing a policy to making changes or accessing documents. We consider the availability and quality of both online and agent interactions, as well as the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC Complaint Index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
