[Sales Commission Rates Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](https://www.captivateiq.com/blog/sales-commission-rates-by-industry#sales-commission-rates-frequently-asked-questions-faqs)
**_TL;DR: Across industries, most sales commissions fall between 5–20% of the sale value. High-ticket industries (real estate, auto, SaaS) pay on the higher end, while retail and insurance are typically lower._**
For example, real estate agents and auto sales reps work entirely on commission due to the high sales prices of their products. An insurance agent salary might also be heavily focused on additional incentive.
---|---|---
Technology/SaaS |  5-20% | Often base + quota-based accelerators
Real Estate |  4–6% (residential), 4–8% (commercial) | Commission-only, varies by location
Insurance |  5-15% | Captive vs. independent agents
Finance |  0.25-10% | Depends on product (funds vs. annuities)
Auto Sales |  20-30% | Often commission-only
Pharma |  % varies; avg ~$45k/year commission | High base + travel demands
Travel |  1-20% | Flat fees or tiered by volume
Retail |  15% (high-ticket items) | Usually with quotas
Commission rates for technology and [SaaS salespeople typically start around 10%](https://www.captivateiq.com/blog/b2b-sales-commissions). However, it’s possible to see commission rates as low as 5% or as high as 20% in this industry. To qualify for commission, reps usually need to hit pre-defined sales targets or [sales quotas ](https://www.captivateiq.com/blog/sales-quotas)each quarter. It’s also common for tech sales representatives to receive a competitive base salary in addition to commission.
