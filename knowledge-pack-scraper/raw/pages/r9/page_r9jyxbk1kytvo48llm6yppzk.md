This company earned an A (Excellent) rating from AM Best and has a widespread network of agents scattered across California and within the Santa Clara Valley.

## How much is car insurance in San Jose, California?
In San Jose, the average rate for full coverage car insurance per year is $2,914, which is 7 percent less than the state’s average full coverage rate. For those San Jose motorists who opt for minimal insurance coverage, you're typically looking at an average annual cost of $832, which is 9 percent less than the average minimum in California. Keep in mind that car insurance is highly personalized. Factors such as your driving record, coverage selection and vehicle type, among others, will cause your San Jose car [insurance rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) to be higher or lower than the city average.
### San Jose rates for teens
[Teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/?_bypasscdn=b3a86258-8987-44a9-9d4a-f843f19c9210#:~:text=Male%20drivers%20make%20up%20about,19%20years%20old%20in%202020.), also referred to as “youthful operators” within the insurance industry, are typically seen as high-risk drivers in most states. Driving skills, like evading road obstacles and modifying driving techniques during varying weather conditions, requires time and practice to learn. Lack of driving experience and behaviors such as neglecting to use a seatbelt regularly or speeding increases the likelihood of more frequent and serious car crashes. This increased risk is why car insurance providers rate teen drivers higher. One way teenagers can cut down on these costs is by remaining on their parents' insurance policy for as long as feasible.

### San Jose rates for young drivers
[Car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) start to decline as they get older and gain more experience on the road.

### San Jose rates for adults
Motorists are categorized into different risk groups with other drives who share similar traits. After the age of 25, most drivers who have maintained a good driving record are moved into standard or preferred risk groups. While age isn't as strong of a rating factor at this point, it's important to remember that car insurance is a shared risk. If there's a significant increase or decrease in car accidents within a specific age group in San Jose, it could potentially affect the rates for everyone in that group.

### San Jose rates for senior drivers
With age, drivers can experience a decrease in depth perception and reaction time. These changes can increase the risk of causing a car crash, and insurance rates start to increase around the age of 60. Additionally, seniors can experience longer recovery times and complications related to car accident injuries, which is why the premiums associated with medical payments can also increase. [Car insurance for seniors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) can still be affordable, especially if policyholders take advantage of senior defensive driving courses and other discounts geared towards older drivers.

### Car insurance after a DUI in San Jose
[Driving under the influence](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) is considered a serious danger on the road, and not every insurance firm is willing to cover this risk. Drivers convicted of a DUI often require an [SR-22 filing](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-california/?_bypasscdn=c9d30271-6a50-4894-80ed-609461bb5ccc) for a period of three to five years post-incident. This form proves to the state that you maintain the required levels of car insurance.
In the event of a DUI, it's crucial to make sure that your insurance provider can renew your insurance policy and provide the California Department of Motor Vehicles with your SR-22. If they're unable to, it may be necessary to search for a provider who can. The average cost of car insurance in San Jose is $7,233 per year for full coverage after a DUI infraction. This is 6 percent less than the state's average rate for full coverage car insurance post DUI.

Minimum coverage requirements in San Jose
[California car insurance law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/) requires drivers to carry at least a [minimum amount of liability insurance](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) that includes the following coverages and limits:
  * $15,000 in bodily injury per person
  * $30,000 in bodily injury per accident
  * $5,000 for property damage


Most car insurance professionals recommend that drivers carry higher levels of liability coverage for better financial protection. For San Jose drivers, extreme weather conditions and population density might be worth thinking about when looking for the [best car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) coverage. Wildfires, flooding, wind, hail, theft and vandalism are all covered by [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) and are common losses in the Bay area.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in San Jose?
Caret Down Icon
There are often several ways to lower your rates, but how available and effective these tactics are will depend heavily on your specific carrier. The most extreme and perhaps intensive method is to find a cheaper car insurance company and purchase a policy through them. However, you may be able to lower your rates with your current carrier by pursuing discounts and reevaluating your coverage. Over time, driving safely and avoiding traffic infractions can also lead to lower rates, but there’s no way to speed that method up. Instead, you may want to see if your carrier offers any discounts that you are currently eligible or almost eligible for. Most companies offer bundling discounts for customers who purchase home and auto insurance together, but the home insurance market in California may make this more complicated than elsewhere. Alternatively, options like telematics coverage may help you save money if you drive less than others.
  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in San Jose?
Caret Down Icon
Full coverage car insurance in San Jose is 7 percent less than the average annual cost of full coverage car insurance in Califonia, however it is 8 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). The annual cost of full coverage car insurance in San Jose is $2,914 and minimal coverage is $832. Drivers in Santa Clara average $2,769 for full coverage and $817 for minimal coverage each year and Campbell drivers pay $2,693 for full coverage and $797 for minimal car insurance each year.
  * ###  How can I get car insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
Mobile apps and easy-to-navigate online websites make shopping for [car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-guide/) a faster and more efficient experience now than it used to be. When [comparing rates between carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) or buying new car insurance, you can get results in a manner of minutes, sometimes even seconds. To streamline getting quotes online, have pertinent information immediately available. This includes your vehicle identification number, your desired coverage levels and the full driver's license number of anyone listed as a driver on the policy.


## Methodology
Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze the latest rates in September 2025 for ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates include the most recent approved rate changes filed by insurance companies that affect our profile. These revised rates are then weighted based on the population density in each geographic region so that policyholders can see the impact rates have in their areas. Quoted rates are based on a 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:
  * $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $50,000 property damage liability per accident
  * $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
  * $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
  * $500 collision deductible
  * $500 comprehensive deductible


To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.
These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.
**Incidents** : Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.
**Age** : Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.
**Teens** : Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
