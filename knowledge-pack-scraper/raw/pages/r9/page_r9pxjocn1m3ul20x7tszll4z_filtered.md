Learn [how much car insurance you may need](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) based on your circumstances and preferences.

### Is Utah a no-fault state?

Yes. Utah has been a [no-fault state](https://www.progressive.com/answers/no-fault-state-meaning/) since 1974, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance). As a no-fault state, Utah requires drivers to carry PIP coverage so that their own insurance covers some or all of their medical expenses after a car accident, regardless of who's at fault. No-fault car insurance also restricts the right to sue only to lawsuits that involve severe injuries.

## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Utah's state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, gets stolen, or is otherwise damaged due to a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you can afford a new car or major repairs after an accident.
