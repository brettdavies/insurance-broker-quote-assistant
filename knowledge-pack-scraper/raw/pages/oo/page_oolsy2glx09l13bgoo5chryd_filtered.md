# Progressive "Policy Fee" on Auto Policy

I just discovered that my Progressive auto policy has a $50 every 6 months "policy fee" that my insurance agent is charging me for handling my policy, which he didn't tell me about. When I called Progressive to try to get rid of the agent and just deal directly with Progressive, I got all kinds of bad customer service. The third person I talked to wouldn't tell me how much the policy would be without an agent even though Progressive has access to my policy. I finally was able to get a Progressive quote online, and it was 50% higher than what I am paying with the agent. Usually, a policy without an agent should be cheaper. Does anyone know what is going on here? I would appreciate any guidance.
