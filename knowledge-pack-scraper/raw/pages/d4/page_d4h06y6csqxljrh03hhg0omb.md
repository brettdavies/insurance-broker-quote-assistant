## GEICO Pet Insurance Overview
GEICO is a well-known name in the insurance industry. However, GEICO doesn't provide its own pet insurance, instead using its name to direct pet owners to Embrace, a pet insurance provider.
The policies that [GEICO Pet Insurance](https://quote.petted.com/quote/ref=businessinsider?insurer=Geico) offers really stand out for its breadth of coverage offered. The accident and illness policy offers coverages that most competitors don't provide, like behavioral therapy, dental services, and prosthetic and mobility devices.

However, GEICO Pet Insurance, which is provided through Embrace, may not be the best fit if you're looking to enroll pets that are over 14 years old.

## How Much Does GEICO Pet Insurance Cost?
Your [GEICO Pet Insurance](https://quote.petted.com/quote/ref=businessinsider?insurer=Geico) cost depends on your pet's age, sex, species, and breed. It will also vary based on the deductible, reimbursement, and annual limit you choose.
To get a better idea of how much GEICO pet insurance costs, we'll look at how much a pet owner living in New York City would pay in pet insurance premiums. We chose New York City for our quotes because it is one of the most expensive places to receive vet care, which insurance premiums will reflect. Your premiums will likely be lower than the prices below.

Let's go over premiums for a New York City cat covered under a GEICO plan with a $500 deductible, 80% coinsurance, and $10,000 annual limit:

## How to Purchase and Manage a GEICO Pet Insurance Policy
Since GEICO partners with Embrace Pet Insurance, you'll be directed to Embrace's website to get a quote, select a plan, and complete your purchase. Embrace will ask you to provide details about your pet, such as breed, age, sex, and species, to generate a personalized quote.

## GEICO Pet Insurance Customer Reviews and Ratings
Since GEICO Pet Insurance is administered by Embrace, we reviewed third-party sites to gauge how the company handles customer support. Embrace has an average rating of 4 out of five stars on Trustpilot and a 2.3 on its Better Business Bureau page.
Many customers appreciated how easy and quick it is to submit claims with Embrace. However, we also noticed recurring complaints about unresponsive customer service, including unanswered emails and phone calls. Additionally, some customers reported having to submit medical records multiple times and experiencing long delays in receiving reimbursements. 
Let's look at some third-party rating of Embrace.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' complaint index rates insurance companies based on how many complaints they receive against its share of the market. A 1.00 means that a company has an expected number of complaints based on its size. A lower score indicates fewer complaints than expected and a higher number indicates more complaints than expected. 
Embrace's pet insurance plans are underwritten by American Modern Home Insurance Company, which scored 4.14, indicating that it has over four times the number of complaints than expected given its share of the market.
American Modern Home Insurance Company has an A+ (Superior) Financial Strength Rating from AM Best, indicating that it has the ability to meet its financial obligations, like paying out claims.
## GEICO Pet Insurance Alternatives
See how GEICO compares to these alternative options for pet insurance coverage: Lemonade and Spot. 
### GEICO Pet Insurance vs. Lemonade Pet Insurance
[Lemonade Pet Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/d6865db0edd4?s3=personal-finance%2Fpet-insurance%2Fgeico-pet-insurance-review_1b73ZiVlEoOiQ7VFNq67qb) is known for its cheap premiums and customizable service. It's specifically far cheaper than GEICO. 
That said, Lemonade's base policy is pretty bare, lacking some of the features found in GEICO's plan, like dental illness coverage and behavioral treatments. However, you can add these to your Lemonade plan for extra. Even with these add-ons, Lemonade policies still come out cheaper than GEICO.
Additionally, Lemonade offers several opportunities to bundle: 10% off if you bundle with its renters, homeowners, auto, condo, or co-op insurance; 5% if you pay annually instead of monthly; and 5% for enrolling multiple pets. So if you prefer to manage all your insurance policies in one place, Lemonade can be an option worth looking into. 
However, Lemonade Pet Insurance is only available in 37 states and Washington, DC, whereas GEICO is available in all 50 states.

### GEICO vs. Spot Pet Insurance 
If your pet is 15 years or older, [Spot Pet Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/y8e31f1cb894?s3=personal-finance%2Fpet-insurance%2Fgeico-pet-insurance-review_1bNNslPNbqEEopO2YEpA7o) might be a better choice for you. GEICO Pet Insurance has an age limit of 14 years for enrollment in its accident and illness plan, whereas Spot plans have no upper age limits for new enrollments. As long as your pet is at least eight weeks old, you're welcome to apply for coverage. 
Another reason you may want to consider Spot is that they cover microchip implantation in all their core plans, while Embrace only covers it in its Wellness Rewards Program. 
However, if your pet's dental care is a major concern for you, Embrace may be more suitable. While Embrace and Spot both offer dental coverage, Embrace's dental illness coverage is some of the best you'll find, covering issues like gingivitis, root canals, and periodontal disease. On the other hand, Spot's dental coverage is an accident-only plan and is not as comprehensive.
