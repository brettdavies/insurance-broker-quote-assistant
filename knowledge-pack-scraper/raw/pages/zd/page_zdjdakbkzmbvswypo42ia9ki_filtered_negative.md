Most umbrellas _do not_ include excess UM/UIM. I do not know whether SF's does so, but I rather doubt it. I am a bit concerned that your agent may not be up-to-speed here.

This!
State Farm, Allstate, Farmers and Progressive all do Not offer Excess UM/UIM coverage. They offer it on the auto only. Amica used to offer it up to $1m only, but they don’t anymore either.
You can purchase a standalone umbrella policy with a company like personalumbrella.com, who writes Markel umbrella policies. They will write an umbrella with excess UM/UIM of $1m, as long as your underlying policies are with a carrier rated A or better with A.M. Best.
Most of the carriers that do offer excess UM/UIM on their umbrella policies are High Net Worth carriers, like Chubb, AIG, Berkley One, Cincinnati, and PURE, most of which you likely haven’t even heard of. As well as some carriers that are geared toward both middle market and mass affluent clientele, like Travelers, Safeco, and Encompass, who is actually in the process of being absorbed by National General, so that may change.
My advice, for what it’s worth:
If you are a homeowner, which it sounds like you are, and you have a bit of money in the bank and maybe some investments, then you definitely need an umbrella policy. If you have anything to lose from being sued by one of those lawyers you see on late night and daytime television, then you need an umbrella policy. It covers a lot more, liability-wise, than you having only liability on your auto insurance and for less premium, comparatively speaking.
A couple of things, bullet point style, because I literally explain insurance to people and advise them for a living:
1. It sounds like you have a good handle on the liability portion, but for the sake of thoroughness:
Yes, the liability tacks onto the top of your underlying liability, so a $1m umbrella, would add to your underlying liability, whether it be a combined single limit, like $500k, or split limit, like $250/$500/$100. So in effect, you would have Bodily injury liability of either $1.25m per person/$1.5m per accident and $1.1m for property damage (keeping in mind, the limit is $1m, no matter how it is divvied up) or in the case of Combined Single Limit: $1.5m to divvy up however it needs to be. (I can explain more about CSL vs SL liability later, if you need it.)
2. UM/UIM is a totally different coverage, as you already know. This is the coverage you rely on if the person you have an accident with is at fault, and either uninsured, or underinsured, ie. State minimums, which in Florida are laughable, and worse than most states, at a flat $10k personal injury and $10k property damage. That isn’t going to pay for aspirin if you have to go to the ER, and the property damage.
On your auto policy, the general rule of thumb is your UM/UIM should match your liability, (with the exception of property damage, which is covered in most cases by your collision coverage) because you should protect yourself as much as anyone else.
When talking excess UM/UIM, it works the same as the liability does, but to cover you, rather than the other party. So essentially, if you have it, it adds to your underlying auto coverage after it’s been exhausted.
Now for some terrifying statistics:
As of the latest statistics (pulled from an article on the website for the Florida Justice Reform Institute published March 9, 2025), from 2023:
Roughly 20% of drivers on Florida are uninsured, and another 40% are underinsured, with state minimums or maybe slightly more.
So more than half the drivers on the road in Florida very likely will not have enough insurance to cover the expenses they may be responsible for in an accident.
I hope this is helpful. Sorry I didn’t see it when you first posted it.
One last bit of advice:
Call an insurance broker the next time you’re shopping your policy. They’re not just for the wealthy, and they have multiple carrier options, rather than “captive” agents who are restricted to their own carriers.

What state are you in? As far as I’m aware you wouldn’t even be able to get an umbrella policy to begin with unless you have some sort of renters or homeowners insurance. As far as the UM goes, you can add on the UM coverage option on the umbrella I’m not sure if it applies to other states but I know in Florida you can. Your auto liability/UM would kick in first to cover and if you have the umbrella then that extra million would be available for use

I’m in Florida. Yes definitely I can get an umbrella with just auto insurance. The State Farm agent, which is my current carrier confirmed that.
Let’s say we are talking about bodily liability. The $100k would apply first and then the rest would be covered under the umbrella policy.
It was just the uninsured coverage I was confused about. I read somewhere that State Farm does not offer excess umi even with umbrella. Some carriers do. Maybe I should have asked her does my policy have excess coverage, which some you can add on.

Well that’s news to me. I also do work over at State Farm and yes there is an option to add that UM coverage in the umbrella policy. Yes you would have to exhaust all your BI/UM limits to be able to use the umbrella. The only thing I’m not sure about would be if you are required to have the matching 250/500 UM coverage on the policy to be able to add the UM coverage on the umbrella.

I just changed my policy last week. She said she added UM/UIM to the umbrella. Im paying extra she said for that. Told her I’ve been reading State Farm does not offer it and she said that’s not true. I tried calling the 1800 number and they just say contact local agent.
Told her to please send me policy and I expect for that to be on the documents. I did $1mil umbrella. Had to raise my auto to $250/$500.
If that’s not the case I don’t know if I can and how but I will want to change agents.

Ask for the “full policy jacket,” not just the declarations. Most of the time they will need to request that, and it takes forever.
