# Filing a Geico Insurance Claim in California: What You Need to Know

Nov 16, 2024

Being involved in a car accident is a life-altering event. From dealing with injuries and vehicle damage to navigating the complex insurance claims process, the aftermath can feel overwhelming. If you’ve found yourself in a collision where the other driver is insured with Geico, you may quickly realize that their friendly TV commercials don’t quite match the reality of filing a claim. This guide walks you through the claims process, shares what to expect when dealing with Geico, and explains how to protect your rights to ensure fair compensation.

### Understanding California’s At-Fault Insurance System

California operates under an **at-fault system**, meaning the person responsible for the accident (and their insurance company) is responsible for covering the costs of damages. If you were involved in an accident that wasn’t your fault, you’ll need to file a **third-party claim** with the at-fault driver’s insurance company—in this case, Geico.

At the same time, you’ll also need to notify your own insurance company about the accident. Even if you’re not at fault, your insurer needs to be informed. This helps establish your side of the story and protects you in case unexpected complications arise, such as the at-fault driver being uninsured or underinsured.

### Steps for Filing a Claim With Geico

The process of filing an insurance claim with Geico can be daunting, especially if you’re not familiar with insurance law or how adjusters operate. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

#### **1. Gather All Relevant Information**

Before contacting Geico, make sure you’ve collected the following:

* **At-Fault Driver’s Details:** Name, phone number, policy number, and license plate number.
* **Accident Documentation:** Police report or accident report (if available).
* **Photos:** Take clear pictures of the accident scene, vehicle damage, and any visible injuries.
* **Medical Records:** Keep records of all medical treatment related to the accident, including hospital bills and follow-up visits.

#### **2. File the Claim**

You can file a third-party claim with Geico by contacting them online or by phone. If this process feels intimidating, you can have your own insurance company file on your behalf or hire an attorney to handle the claim.

#### **3. Understand What You’re Up Against**

Geico’s claims adjusters are highly trained negotiators. Their goal is to minimize payouts or deny claims altogether. This is why having a personal injury attorney on your side can make a significant difference in the outcome of your case.

#### **4. Notify the DMV**

California law requires filing an **SR-1 form** with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) within 10 days if the accident caused more than $1,000 in damages or any injuries.

### Common Challenges When Dealing With Geico

While Geico is one of the largest and most well-known insurance companies in the country, it’s important to remember that they are in the business of saving money—not making sure you’re compensated fairly. Here are some challenges you might face:

* **Lowball Settlement Offers:** Geico adjusters often present initial settlement offers that are far below the true value of your claim.
* **Delays in Processing:** Insurance companies may drag their feet, hoping you’ll accept a low offer out of frustration.
* **Disputing Liability:** Adjusters may try to argue that their policyholder wasn’t entirely at fault or that your injuries aren’t as severe as claimed.

### Why You Need an Attorney

If you’ve been seriously injured in a car accident, dealing with Geico’s adjusters can quickly become overwhelming. This is where a personal injury attorney can step in to help.

An experienced attorney will:

* **Negotiate on Your Behalf:** Attorneys know how to counter lowball offers and demand fair compensation.
* **Handle the Paperwork:** Filing a claim involves extensive paperwork that must be accurate and submitted on time.
* **Prove Liability:** Attorneys gather evidence to build a strong case showing the at-fault driver’s negligence.
* **Advocate for Your Rights:** Insurance companies often use intimidation tactics, but an attorney will stand up for you and ensure your claim is taken seriously.

---

### What Happens If the At-Fault Driver Is Uninsured or Underinsured?

California law requires drivers to carry **uninsured motorist coverage** (UM) and encourages **underinsured motorist coverage** (UIM).

* **Uninsured Motorist Coverage:** Protects you if the at-fault driver doesn’t have insurance. In this case, you would file a claim with your own insurance company.
* **Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** If the at-fault driver’s insurance doesn’t cover all your damages, UIM allows you to recover the difference from your own policy.

While this coverage is meant to provide a safety net, filing these claims can still be difficult without legal representation.

### Don’t Face Geico Alone

It’s important to remember that Geico’s adjusters handle claims every day, while this might be the first time you’ve had to navigate the insurance process. They know how to push back, delay, and minimize your claim, and they’re counting on you to accept their offer without question.

By hiring a personal injury attorney, you’re leveling the playing field. Attorneys are skilled negotiators who understand the tactics used by insurance companies and won’t back down until you receive the compensation you deserve for:

* Medical expenses
* Lost wages
* Pain and suffering
* Property damage
