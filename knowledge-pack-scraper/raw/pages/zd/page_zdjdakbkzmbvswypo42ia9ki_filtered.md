# Umbrella with State Farm

I’m looking at either raising my auto to a $1mil or getting an umbrella policy for $1mil. I am not a renter, home,rental or anything else.

I know the difference of what is an umbrella policy compared to an auto policy.

My question is when I search online I’m seeing that uninsured/underinsured only pays out on the auto limits, which mine being $250k. I’m reading that State Farm does not offer UIM/UI with umbrella and the $1mil would be for liability under the umbrella

The agent I spoke to today said that’s not true. She said if I was hospitalized and the other person had no insurance then the auto would pay first and then the umbrella would pay another $1mil. So there would be no cap until a $1mil.

I’m just little confused because I’m reading ui/umi is capped at auto and does not have umbrella coverage.

Any advice appreciated.
