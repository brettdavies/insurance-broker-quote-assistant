# How I learned to save $1,603 on home and auto insurance in 2025
## Insurance premiums don’t have to take such a big bite out of your budget.
Published Wed, Oct 1 2025

With insurance costs continuing to rise, lowering your rates has never been more important. Homeowners insurance alone has skyrocketed [nearly 70%](https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-september-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-5Bbzsj9QEEEa.pdf) in the past five-and-a-half years.
As a reporter who covers insurance every day, I’ve found one of the easiest ways to save is to buy your [homeowners](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) and [auto coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-companies/) from the same insurer, a strategy known as [bundling](https://www.cnbc.com/select/should-i-bundle-home-and-auto-insurance/). The [best bundling discount](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/)s can save you more than 25% on your combined

“On top of the savings, it just makes life easier,” said Beth Swanson, an analyst at insurance marketplace [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/). “You usually work with the same agent for all your policies, your renewal dates line up and you only have one bill to keep track of. For a lot of households, that combination of convenience and savings is where bundling really pays off.”
[Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/o6d4820c1bef), for example, has 22 car insurance discounts — including as much as 20% off your combined rates if you have [Farmers homeowners insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/w111bf99698d).

**Read our review of**[**Farmers car insurance**](https://www.cnbc.com/select/farmers-car-insurance-review/)
Bundling home and auto is relatively simple: Start by getting quotes from at least three providers that offer a bundling discount in your state. (That can include your current carrier.)
