With insurance costs continuing to rise, lowering your rates has never been more important. Homeowners insurance alone has skyrocketed [nearly 70%](https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-september-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-5Bbzsj9QEEEa.pdf) in the past five-and-a-half years.

As a reporter who covers insurance every day, I’ve found one of the easiest ways to save is to buy your [homeowners](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) and [auto coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-companies/) from the same insurer, a strategy known as [bundling](https://www.cnbc.com/select/should-i-bundle-home-and-auto-insurance/). The [best bundling discount](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/)s can save you more than 25% on your combinedpremiums.

“On top of the savings, it just makes life easier,” said Beth Swanson, an analyst at insurance marketplace [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/). “You usually work with the same agent for all your policies, your renewal dates line up and you only have one bill to keep track of. For a lot of households, that combination of convenience and savings is where bundling really pays off.”

Some companies offer bigger savings the more policy types you add: Enrolling with [Amica](https://secure.money.com/pr/f27899a0e617) for home, auto, life and [umbrella insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-umbrella-insurance/), for example, could lower your bill by as much as 30%.

Looking at Amica’s average rates in September 2025, that could save you $1,603 a year on home and auto insurance alone.

Even better, you can often combine a bundling discount with other discounts — including reductions for having multiple vehicles under the same policy, completing a defensive driving course and driving a newer car with advanced safety features.

[Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/o6d4820c1bef), for example, has 22 car insurance discounts — including as much as 20% off your combined rates if you have [Farmers homeowners insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/w111bf99698d).

Bundling home and auto is relatively simple: Start by getting quotes from at least three providers that offer a bundling discount in your state. (That can include your current carrier.)

Most insurance companies offer online quotes, although some may require a phone call to finalize the process. You can also work with a local insurance broker to sort through offers.

Bundling doesn’t automatically save you money, though — if your auto insurance is more expensive than your homeowners premiums, focusing on the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance/) you can find may ultimately lead to more savings.

“If a family member has a poor driving record or multiple claims, combining policies could actually raise your overall rate,” cautions Swanson.  
  
So, gather quotes for both bundled and separate policies. From there, you can do the math and pick the combination that saves you the most.

Once you’ve found the best deal, enroll and make sure they activate your bundling discount.

If you’re changing carriers, don’t cancel your existing policy until the new one takes effect. And if you have a mortgage, don’t forget to notify your lender about any change in your homeowners coverage.

## Bundling FAQs

### Does bundling insurance save money?

Yes, bundling insurance can substantially lower your insurance premiums, in some cases up to 30% or more. To find the best price, get quotes for your home, auto, renters and other insurance policies from the same insurer and with the same amounts of coverage. Then, compare them to see which brand offers the lowest premiums.

### What are the disadvantages of bundled insurance?

While bundled insurance can typically be cheaper on the whole, you might find that the company that offers you the best rates on homeowners insurance isn’t the same one that offers you the best price on car insurance. If this is the case, bundling insurance may not be worth the discount. Getting quotes and comparing them is the best way to understand if this is your situation or not.

### What insurance company has the best bundling discount?

The insurer with the best bundling discount depends on a variety of factors, including the type of driver you are, what kind of home you have, where you live and how much your base premiums are to start out with. We’ve found that [Amica](https://secure.money.com/pr/f27899a0e617), [Geico](https://www.cnbc.com/select/geico-auto-insurance-review/) and [Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/o6d4820c1bef) all have generous rate reductions for customers who take advantage of multi-policy discounts.
