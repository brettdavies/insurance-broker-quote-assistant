## What is title insurance?

Title insurance is a form of indemnity insurance that protects you (the [homebuyer](/homeowners-insurance/guide/first-time-homebuyers/)) and your [lender](/homeowners-insurance/guide/lender-requirements/) from financial loss if someone challenges your ownership rights.

When you buy a home, you're handed a **title**—the document that proves you own it. Before issuing a policy, the title insurance provider conducts a **title search**, reviewing decades of public records to find and fix potential problems like unpaid taxes, liens, or property disputes. But even the most careful search can miss hidden issues, which is why title insurance protects you if an issue arises at a later date.

🔎 **Why This Matters:**Title insurance can’t prevent someone from making a claim against your home, but it protects your investment by covering legal costs and financial losses if a hidden problem arises.

### Title insurance at a glance

* Provides peace of mind by confirming legitimacy of property ownership.
* Protects against unforeseen claims, liens, or disputes that may arise after the purchase.
* Costs a one-time, up-front charge that makes the title insurance policy last the life of your ownership.

Expert insight from Mark Friedlander

"Unlike other forms of insurance, which cover you for future losses, title insurance extends back in time for an indefinite period. It protects the homeowner against loss scenarios prior to the effective date of the title insurance policy, which is typically the closing date of your home purchase."

*-Mark Friedlander, Senior Director of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute*

## How much does title insurance cost?

Title insurance prices range depending on state regulations and property value, but you can expect costs to fall somewhere between 0.5% and 1% of the property's purchase price.[[1]](#footnote-1)

The up-front price can also include a variety of other fees: policy endorsement, settlement service, document preparation and notary fees, to name a few.

![document icon]()

Scenario: What can I expect to pay for title insurance?

Let's say you purchased your home for **$350,000**— if title insurance cost **0.75%** of the purchase price, you can expect to **pay $2,625 for title insurance**.

The equation above offers a solid benchmark for calculating title insurance costs. But like any insurance product, rating factors come into play. In the case of title insurance, the state you live in is the most important. The table below displays information on state-specific title insurance rules.

## Types of title insurance

There are two types of title insurance: **lender's** **policy** and **owner's policy.**These policies protect the lender and the owner if a third party claims to have partial ownership even after you purchased the property. Title insurance is included as part of your closing costs when purchasing a home— so both types are paid upfront, but each come with distinct characteristics. Let's dive in.

### Lender's title insurance

* **Required by lenders** for most [mortgages](/resources/personal-finance/what-is-a-mortgage/)
* **Protects the lender**, **not the buyer,** against future title disputes
* **Cost is based on your loan amount**, not the purchase price of the home
* **Typically paid as a one-time premium at closing**
* **You can choose the title insurance provider**, even if the lender recommends one
* Active until the loan is paid off

### Owner's title insurance

* **Protects the buyer** from future title-related liabilities
* **Optional**, but highly recommended for peace of mind
* **Cost is based on the home’s purchase price**
* **Covers legal costs and losses** from ownership disputes or claims
* **Typically purchased at closing**, alongside the lender’s policy
* Good for as long as you own the property

## How to shop for title insurance

You know what title insurance is now, but how do you get it? The best place to start is with your realtor, mortgage lender or a real estate attorney— they'll have recommendations for title insurance providers, but you are **not required** to pick one of their suggestions; the [Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/respa.pdf) (RESPA) made sure of that.[[2]](#footnote-2)

Our best advice? Use your real estate agent's recommendation as a starting point, and compare companies against it. This way, you have some autonomy in choosing and can see which company is right for you.

According to the American Title Land Association (ATLA), the top five providers of title insurance in the U.S. based on market share are[[3]](#footnote-3):

* First American Title Insurance Co.
* Old Republic National Title Insurance Co.
* Fidelity National Title Insurance Co.
* Chicago Title Insurance Co.
* Stewart Title Guaranty Co.

#### Finding title insurance: a step-by-step guide

1. **Inquire about recommendations** with your lender or realtor— they'll know of a company or two that offers title insurance.
2. Use their suggestions as a jumping off point and **compare with other providers**.
3. **Browse coverage plans**. Some lenders (like your own bank or credit partner) may offer benefits.
4. Once you've narrowed down your selections, **get in touch with a title insurance agent** to discuss the right plan for your needs. *Note: title insurance is a specialized type of insurance that is not sold by property and casualty insurers or agents.*

## Do I need title insurance?

If you have a mortgage, title insurance is typically mandatory— it's only optional for a cash buyer without a mortgage.

If you do have the choice, you may be weighing your options. We understand if adding yet another charge to the already high price tag of a home seems daunting, but the risks associated with not having title insurance happen more often than you think. The bottom line is that, without title insurance, you open yourself up to the possibility that another party can threaten your legal right to the property. Here's a handy guide for determining the benefits and risks of title insurance:

Benefits of having title insurance:

* Confirms your legal ownership is secure and protected from past issues tied to the property.
* Covers legal fees and potential losses if someone challenges your ownership.
* One-time cost, long-term coverage
* **Catches problems before closing** – A thorough title search can reveal issues like liens, errors, or conflicting claims before they become your problem.
* A clean, insured title makes selling your home smoother and less risky for future buyers.

Risks of going without:

* Previous owners may have unpaid debts (like property taxes or contractor bills) that become your responsibility.
* Mistakes in public records, like incorrect legal descriptions or misspelled names, can cause ownership disputes.
* A long-lost heir or prior owner could come forward with a legal claim to the property.
* Conflicting surveys or unclear property lines might result in legal battles with neighbors.
* **Without title insurance, you’d be responsible for paying legal fees to defend your ownership in court.**

## Keeping title insurance safe

Once you've purchased title insurance, it's essential to ensure its security, particularly against theft. Home title theft is a sneaky kind of fraud where someone illegally transfers your property ownership—often using forged documents—without you ever knowing. While title insurance is great for protecting against issues that happened before you bought your home, it won’t help much if someone commits fraud *after* you're already the rightful owner.

To safeguard your property, use strong online security practices, regularly monitor your property records, and consider enrolling in a title monitoring service. Taking these proactive steps can help you catch suspicious activity early and avoid costly legal issues.

Where can I find title insurance?
Chevron down icon

If you're shopping for title insurance for the first time, start with your mortgage lender, real estate agent, or a real estate attorney— they can point you in the right direction to start your search. You are not obligated to take their recommendation, so comparing quotes with a few providers is a good idea.

If you need to locate your title insurance later, contact your provider or reach out to your lender. Both entities will have a copy of your policy that you can access. You can also look in your closing documents; if you don’t remember the title insurance provider, these documents might help you determine the name of the title agency and figure out who to contact for more information.
