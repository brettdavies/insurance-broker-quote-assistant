#  How does using a "non-admitted" carrier affect us? 
I bought a home in California and we are using a non-admitted carrier. My understanding is, if that carrier can't pay due to too many claims from a disaster, the state won't do anything to help. Whereas, if we are using an admitted carrier, the state will offer assistance if the carrier cannot. 
The agents assure me it is fine but I am hoping for some other insight. Is using a non-admitted carrier in California too risky?

Correct, non-admitted carriers do not have backing by state guaranty funds. So if the insurer becomes insolvent and is unable to pay claims, you’re just kinda out of luck.

Certainly, you are generally safer with an admitted carrier. But a good thing to consider alongside this are the odds that such a non-admitted carrier goes insolvent. If the non-admitted offering is from a large, stable, reputable carrier then it is much less likely to go insolvent than a small, unstable, less-reputable one.

Without a non-admitted marketplace in CA, there would be no marketplace at all in CA.

Hi! California broker here, but not personal insurance. We like to say that 'non-admitted does not mean non-regulated' - and in some cases (~10% just a squishy number), the coverage from a non-admitted insurer is _better_ than what is available in the admitted market; but because the DOI is messy to deal with, they can't charge the premium they need to for their product so they go the non-admitted route. 
What you need to do is ask your broker for financial information of the non-admitted insurer you are being offered; and if they are a subsidiary of another insurer. Some of the largest non-admitted insurers have vastly more capital than admitted insurers. 
Ideally, you are looking for an "A.M. Best" rating of at least an A-, and a financial size rating of at least a VII (7), or even a X (10).

Using a non admitted carrier anywhere can be risky. 
You do not want to use one unless there are truly no admitted options available.

I think this is what we're running into. Even the larger carriers are using subsidiaries that are non-admitted.

Look up the ownership of some of these non-admitted companies; you'll find a bunch of them will be subsidiaries of large, legacy admitted carriers. 
Non-admitted carriers don't have to go through the state's approval process for rates and policy forms that their admitted parent company has to do.

Just remembered. California's first elected Insurance Commissioner vowed to "crack down on non-licensed out-of-state, unregulated insurance companies." 
Someone later told him the insurance for his election campaign was from a "non-licensed out-of-state, unregulated insurance company" based in Scottsdale, AZ.

Your understanding is correct, the only other major difference off the top of my head is that the Department of Insurance can't do anything about it if the non-admitted insurance company engages in bad faith. The DOI can only enforce laws on the wholesale and retail brokers who sold the policy. 
Generally speaking, admitted insurance is preferred but non-admitted insurance is still good to have, especially if that's all you can get. If you know the insurance company (not the wholesale or retail broker) you can look up their financial strength rating - A.M. Best is the authoritative one to look for here, sometimes you'll see Demotech which is less rigorous. Anything "A-" or better is very financially sound.

You can still sue them but the DOI can't make them do a market conduct review or anything along those lines. Good clarification!

The biggest favor you can do for yourself would be to read your policy, really read it to understand it, and ask your agent questions, in writing. Everybody should do this for every policy, but when you’re in that market, things can work differently than you’d expect.

I can't speak specifically for California, but using a non-admitted carrier can sometimes mean that you are not covered by guarantee funds in the event of insolvency. 
They also have different rules in regards to rate approvals.

You are correct that the state's insolvency guaranty fund (or whatever it might be called in CA) does not cover non-admitted carriers. Sure, admitted is preferable, but sometimes it simply is not available. Please name your carrier, and I am sure that myself and others can give you a better idea of whether you have much to worry about.

I'm with Knight Specialty Insurance Company now. I'm looking to move to Mercury (better rates) but I was referred to AU Gold as well. 
I know of Mercury so I feel more comfortable there. Progressive is using a subsidiary called Homesite.

Interesting. While I am licensed in CA, I am not active in the personal lines market. Knight Specialty is part of the Knight Insurance Group, located in Los Angeles. They have an "A-" (Excellent) rating from AM Best. I am not familiar with AU Gold, but I just searched and they write policies though Lloyd's of London, which has an "A" (Excellent) rating, though also non-admitted. Mercury and Progressive both write - at least primarily - coverage through an admitted insurance company. For obvious reasons, you may find that securing alternative coverage is going to be very tough right now. So, you are probably best off leaving things be, unless you are coming up for renewal.
