Here's what to know about [why and when to get pet insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/why-you-should-purchase-pet-insurance).
For many reasons, the best time to get pet insurance is sooner rather than later. Many pet owners get pet insurance within the first 6 months of [bringing home a pet](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/the-3-3-3-rule-when-bringing-home-an-adopted-dog). Protecting your pet early helps ensure you can get the most out of your pet insurance coverage.

Here are some reasons to consider [insuring your pet](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/what-does-pet-insurance-cover) from the very beginning:
Many pet insurance providers don't fully cover pre-existing conditions, so any health issues your pet has before getting insured won’t be covered. The older the pet, the more [pre-existing conditions](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/does-pet-insurance-cover-preexisting-conditions) they may likely have. Getting pet insurance while they’re young helps ensure that any future health problems your pet may face will likely be covered.
When Bulldozer, a 6-month-old puppy, became ill with pneumonia, the lifesaving treatment he needed was over $40,000. While such a large bill would shock most pet owners, Bulldozer was fortunate to have [Trupanion medical insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/pet?intcmpid=simple-insights:pet-insurance:when-to-buy-pet-insurance), which covered the critical care he needed.
There’s a lot to think about when bringing home a new dog or cat. Like any important decision, do your research, [ask questions](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/pet-insurance-questions-to-ask-while-shopping), consult with your veterinarian and weigh all your options so you can choose what’s best for your family.
