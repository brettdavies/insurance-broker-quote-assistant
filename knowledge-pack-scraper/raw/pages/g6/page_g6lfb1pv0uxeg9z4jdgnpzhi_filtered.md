# When to buy pet insurance for cats and dogs

##### Provided by Young dog and cat cuddling on bed.

When is considered the best time to get pet insurance? Is pet insurance worth it for older pets? Here’s what to know.

Bringing home a new dog or cat? You’ve probably got all the basics covered already, like a bed, food, treats and toys. Maybe you’ve even purchased a few books on training or pet behavior. While these things matter, consider pet insurance as one of the first things to get for your pet. It’s the one purchase that not only helps protect your pet’s well-being and longevity, but also your finances.

Here's what to know about [why and when to get pet insurance](/simple-insights/family/why-you-should-purchase-pet-insurance).

## When is the best time to buy pet insurance?

If you’re unfamiliar with pet insurance, you probably have some questions. At what age should you get pet insurance? Should you get pet insurance before the first vet visit, or after? How soon after getting pet insurance can you use it?

For many reasons, the best time to get pet insurance is sooner rather than later. Many pet owners get pet insurance within the first 6 months of [bringing home a pet](/simple-insights/family/the-3-3-3-rule-when-bringing-home-an-adopted-dog). Protecting your pet early helps ensure you can get the most out of your pet insurance coverage.

## Why to consider enrolling your pet sooner

Here are some reasons to consider [insuring your pet](/simple-insights/family/what-does-pet-insurance-cover) from the very beginning:

### Fewer pre-existing conditions

Many pet insurance providers don't fully cover pre-existing conditions, so any health issues your pet has before getting insured won’t be covered. The older the pet, the more [pre-existing conditions](/simple-insights/family/does-pet-insurance-cover-preexisting-conditions) they may likely have. Getting pet insurance while they’re young helps ensure that any future health problems your pet may face will likely be covered.

### Puppies and kittens need more emergency care

Contrary to popular belief, young pets are actually more likely to get sick or hurt than at any other age. Due to their natural curiosity and developing immune systems, puppies and kittens are prone to getting into trouble.

Not to mention, early health issues can lead to long-term problems requiring a lifetime of medical care. The health of a young pet sets the stage for their overall well-being and longevity. That’s why it might be crucial to get pet insurance from the start — even before the first vet visit!

### Puppies and kittens cost less to insure

Younger pets are generally cheaper to insure than older dogs and cats, but you can still insure an older pet. Just keep in mind that some providers have age limits on pets, which can range from 7 to 14 years.

Trupanion enrolls all dogs and cats under 14 years of age. But what truly sets them apart is that your pet’s price is always based on their age at enrollment.

Trupanion may adjust your monthly cost to keep up with inflation and rising veterinary costs, but never because your pet celebrated a birthday. As such, signing up for Trupanion while your pet is young can help save you more money in the long run.

### Waiting periods take time

With many pet insurance providers, you can’t use your coverage until all waiting periods are over. Illnesses and accidents usually have separate waiting periods, ranging between a few days to a few weeks. Other conditions, like hip dysplasia and cruciate ligament issues, commonly have longer waiting periods between 6 to 12 months.

Unlike other providers, though, Trupanion doesn’t have separate waiting periods for specific conditions. They just have a 5-day waiting period for injuries and a 30-day waiting period for illnesses. That’s it! So, the earlier you get pet insurance, the sooner you can get through any waiting periods and start using your coverage.

## Why do I need pet insurance?

The truth is, pets cost more than you might realize, and many pet owners underestimate how much they’ll spend on veterinary care over their pet’s lifetime. With pet insurance, you don’t have to stress about unexpected vet bills if your pet gets sick or hurt.

When Bulldozer, a 6-month-old puppy, became ill with pneumonia, the lifesaving treatment he needed was over $40,000. While such a large bill would shock most pet owners, Bulldozer was fortunate to have [Trupanion medical insurance](/insurance/pet?intcmpid=simple-insights:pet-insurance:when-to-buy-pet-insurance), which covered the critical care he needed.

But it’s not just big emergencies that can drain your savings. Something as common as allergies can add up quickly, costing thousands of dollars over a pet’s lifetime.

So, is pet insurance worth it? Not only can pet insurance help with the unexpected, but it can also help empower you to make medical decisions based on what’s best for your pet.

There’s a lot to think about when bringing home a new dog or cat. Like any important decision, do your research, [ask questions](/simple-insights/family/pet-insurance-questions-to-ask-while-shopping), consult with your veterinarian and weigh all your options so you can choose what’s best for your family.
