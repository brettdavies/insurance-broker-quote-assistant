* ### Minimum car insurance required in Michigan

  Michigan residents must carry liability insurance, personal property protection (known as PPI) and personal injury protection (known as PIP).

  You must select at least the following amounts:

  + $50,000 bodily injury liability per person.
  + $100,000 bodily injury liability per incident.
  + $1 million PPI for incidents that occur within Michigan.
  + $10,000 property damage liability per incident outside Michigan.
  + $250,000\* personal injury protection.

  \*Lower PIP limits available for certain Medicare and Medicaid recipients.

  [Liability car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) covers the cost of any damage, injuries or deaths you cause in a car accident, up to your policy’s predefined limits.

  Property protection insurance, or PPI, pays to fix damage you cause to others’ property, such as a fence or garage, while driving, or damage you cause to others’ parked cars. It will pay up to $1 million for repairs if you’re driving in Michigan and damage another resident’s property.

  [Personal injury protection](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-injury-protection) will cover your medical bills and expenses if you’re injured in a car crash, up to your policy limits, no matter whose fault it was. Depending on your state, PIP may also pay for:

  + Lost wages if you’re unable to work due to injuries from an accident.
  + Services you can no longer perform, like house cleaning or child care, because of your injuries.
  + Funeral costs if an accident-related injury leads to death.
  + A small death benefit as a cash payout.

  Experts recommend buying more than the bare minimum liability insurance to avoid having to pay out of pocket for damage that exceeds your policy’s limits.

  Check out NerdWallet’s guide to [car insurance requirements by state](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/minimum-car-insurance-requirements) to learn more about how the required and optional coverages of your Michigan auto policy work.

#### Risks of minimum car insurance

While it might seem like Michigan requires a lot of coverage, many drivers actually need more than the minimum amount. State requirements can be low and leave you on the hook for medical bills, damaged property and more if you’re in a serious accident. Unless you can pay those bills out of pocket, you’d benefit from full coverage.

Getting the least amount of car insurance possible might also mean missing out on optional coverage types that could help pay for damage in common situations. For example, full coverage would help cover damage to your car if it was vandalized, or if you slid off the road during a snowstorm.

Your location has a lot to do with your car insurance rates. While the cost of car insurance changes depending on where you live, it’s often more expensive in large cities.

OverviewPros & Cons

Discounts Great set of discounts

Ease of use Above average

NAIC complaints Fewer than expected

Pros

* High customer satisfaction ratings.
* One-stop shop for insurance as well as banking and investing products.
* Policies available in all states and Washington, D.C.

Cons

* Available to active military, veterans and their families only.

If you're an active member of the military or a veteran — or you have an immediate family member who is — chances are you'll get a relatively cheap rate with USAA, a company that isn't available to the general public.

Because of that restriction, USAA isn't ranked with the others, but it was among the cheapest three auto insurance options for 68 of the 70 driver profiles we examined. Read our [USAA auto insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/usaa-auto-insurance-review).

* ### See characteristics for other driver profiles

  For all other driver profiles, we used the same assumptions, with the following exceptions:

  + We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for drivers with poor credit. These rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.
  + For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
  + For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.
  + For drivers with a ticket, we added a single speeding violation for driving 16 mph over the speed limit.
  + For young drivers, we considered 20-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For millennial drivers, we considered 40-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For senior drivers, we considered 70-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.

These are median rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider. Sample drivers had the minimum required coverage by law in each state. Some policies include additional coverage at the insurer’s discretion.

Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.
