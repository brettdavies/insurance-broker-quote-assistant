Unlike hurricanes, earthquakes are a natural phenomenon that scientists cannot predict. They can, however, assess how frequently they occur, and data suggests that they occur surprisingly often. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that there are about[ 20,000 earthquakes per year worldwide](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-are-we-having-so-many-earthquakes-has-naturally-occurring-earthquake-activity-been?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) - approximately 55 per day-, and in the United States alone, there are about 2,000 earthquakes per year. Most of these quakes are of low magnitude and rarely felt, and the majority center around the western and central United States, but that doesn’t mean that all other states are safe from an earthquake.
So, how do we cover our losses if our home is hit by one? Enter earthquake insurance, a policy capable of helping with the repair and/or rebuilding of your home and your personal belongings. Usually offered only in states that are prone to seismic activity, companies all around the US offer the policy. It’s important to note that insurance companies offer earthquake insurance either as an add-on to homeowner’s insurance (termed rider or endorsement) or as a separate policy altogether and that these offerings vary from state to state. If you already have homeowners insurance but would like to get earthquake protection, ask your provider if they offer it as an add-on. However, if you don’t have homeowners insurance or are looking to switch, then look no further and read on!

A catchy jingle shouldn’t be the only thing that convinces you to get insurance from a company, which is why Farmers’ offers solid earthquake insurance options for states with recurring earthquakes, such as those in western and central United States. Farmer’s earthquake policy covers rebuilding, structural repairs, temporary housing due to loss of use, and personal property protection. Deductibles can be flexible depending on your home’s size and building material, ranging from 5 to 20%.
Farmers has a few discounts available, including multiple policy, non-smoking household, security system, and fire alarm discounts. Farmers also offers a unique feature called the “Mobile Claims Center”, where if your area is hit by a major catastrophe, the company can send their Mobile Claims Center buses to the area where they will not only help with claim services, they can also provide water, telephone, food, and other helpful services to customers and non-customers.

Allstate’s earthquake insurance offers flexible deductibles that range from five to 25%, making it so that you can choose how much you want to pay based on your budget. But what makes Allstate stand out is the wide variety of discounts you can get through their homeowners insurance, which can help you save on your earthquake insurance if you include it as an add-on. With more than 11 discounts available, you can save up to 5% from your homeowners and earthquake policy by setting up automatic payments, 20% when switching to Allstate without an insurance claim, up to 25% when bundling home and auto policies, and up to 10% for signing up for a new policy at least 7 days before the current one expires. Other discounts include protective device discounts if your home has theft or fire protection devices, loyalty discounts for remaining as an Allstate customer each year, homebuyer discount, and a discount for being at least 55 years old and retired.

State Farm stands out for two things: their superb customer service and the extra features that come with its earthquake policy. To evaluate State Farm’s customer support, we called them a total of ten times to inquire about their policies, and each time their representatives were very thorough explaining each policy feature carefully, always asking if we had any questions before proceeding further. Furthermore, they always asked if we wished for them to email us an immediate breakdown of the insurance quotes we requested, something that was hit or miss with many of the other companies we reviewed-in some occasions, companies took more than two hours to email a quote, or they reassured that they would email us back with the quote, but never did.
For extra features, State Farm offers deductibles as low as 5% as standard, and you can opt to add debris removal and broken glass cleanup to your earthquake policy if you believe you’ll need it. They also offer a limited number of discounts, including multi-policy, claims-free, and loyalty discounts.

#### Best for Personal Property and Loss of Use Coverage

_Screenshot Nationwide.com, August 2020_
When paying out personal property claims that result from earthquake damage, it’s typical for companies to cap them at $150,000 if you paid for this amount. Nationwide goes further, not only capping personal property insurance at $200,000 but also offering the same coverage amounts for loss of use. Typically, the coverage cap for personal property and loss of use is separate and varies, so you’d have to keep in mind how much the company offers for each. This isn’t an issue with Nationwide, however, since r your personal belongings and your out-of-home expenses are covered equally if you need them.
Discounts are lacking when compared to other companies, however, as their website only shows eight: multi-policy, protective device, claims-free, home renovation credit, roof rating, home purchase, prior insurance, and gated community discounts.

#### Best for Policy Transparency

As we researched companies and their earthquake insurance policies, we were disappointed to see that almost none of the big brand names explained their policies on their website, so we had to inquire about policy specifics by phone. GeoVera Insurance was the exception, as their website has enough information for you to get a thorough understanding of how their policies work. GeoVera’s earthquake insurance uses a single limit policy for earthquake insurance, which means that instead of assigning separate coverage limits for dwelling, personal property, and loss of use, they assign a single, combined limit for all coverages. The downside is that, in most areas, the lowest deductible you can get is 10%, which is fairly high compared to other companies.
There are two coverage options for earthquake insurance: comprehensive and standard. Comprehensive protection covers your home, detached structures, personal property, and loss of use expenses. Their standard coverage is cheaper but less thorough, offering full protection only for your home while limiting coverage for personal property and loss of use. If you choose comprehensive coverage, you have the option to increase your deductible from 10 to up to 25%, while standard coverage limits your deductible to up to 15%. Having the option to change your deductible is great since high deductibles translate to cheaper premiums and vice versa. The biggest drawback for GeoVera is that it only offers its earthquake policies to four states: California, Oregon, and Washington.

If you live in a state or an area with high earthquake probabilities, earthquake insurance is a must. Not only will it pay for your home when disaster strikes, but it will also give you peace of mind for years to come, as repairing or rebuilding your entire home might be a task you wouldn’t normally be able to afford out of pocket. Unfortunately, living in a state with a high risk of earthquakes also means that the premiums you’ll pay can be way higher than in states with lesser probabilities. For example, in California, one of the states with the[ highest history of earthquakes,](https://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/Pages/Earthquakes/earthquake-catalog.aspx) premiums range from $800 to $5,000 annually. With premiums so high in these places, getting earthquake insurance might seem like a fruitless endeavor, which is why [less than 10% of homeowners in](https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/pf/insurance/earthquake-insurance-cost/index.html) California have earthquake insurance. Is there a way to make earthquake insurance in these states cheaper? Well, through our research, we learned that the best way to reduce premium costs is to refrain from buying earthquake insurance as a separate policy, and instead opt to bundle it with your homeowners insurance. [Not only can you get a reduced quote overall](https://www.uphelp.org/does-bundling-your-insurance-policies-really-save-you-money), but you will also benefit from other discounts that the company might offer. Nonetheless, always remember to review these premium costs with your insurer to verify that you’re indeed saving money and not spending more. However, this shouldn’t demotivate you if you live in an earthquake-prone state, as the price is well worth the end result: if a disaster ever strikes, you’ll be sure that you, your family, and your home will be taken care of.
What about states that have lower chances of being struck by an earthquake? Well, if you live in a state with fewer probabilities of an earthquake, you could face two things: either your state won’t sell you earthquake insurance at all, or they will sell it to you at a more affordable price,[ at around $100 to $300 annually](https://www.usaa.com/inet/wc/advice-disaster-knowyourquake?akredirect=true#:~:text=According%20to%20Schirmers%2C%20for%20most,an%20average%20cost%20around%20%24800.). If you favor peace of mind, spending a little extra for earthquake insurance would be a great idea, as it only takes one rough earthquake to potentially damage your home.
What are the states with higher chances of an earthquake, you might ask? Well, according to the 2008 United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Seismic[ Hazard Map](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2014/1091/), none of the 50 states are safe from an earthquake, but there are at least 16 states that have higher probabilities: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Conversely, there are eight states that have a very low earthquake risk: Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.
Finally, if you live anywhere near a [fracking](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401) zone—even if you’re in a state that’s not naturally prone to seismic activity—you could experience an increased number of [induced earthquakes](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/induced-earthquakes?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con), and you should also consider getting insurance. Induced seismicity has increased the chances of earthquakes in states like[ Oklahoma](https://phys.org/news/2018-02-oklahoma-earthquakes-strongly-linked-wastewater.html), causing even the 5.8 magnitude[ Pawnee earthquake in 2016](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10006jxs/executive). The practice has increased throughout the years, so there is a chance that more earthquakes will be generated in the future due to fracking.
• The state you live in
• Your home’s location
• Age of your home
• Material that your home is constructed from
• Size of your home
• Your home’s foundation
• How much it costs to rebuild your home
• Your deductible(s)
You might wonder, then, how are the magnitude and the total damage of your home interrelated? It all comes down to four characteristics: oscillation caused by the earthquake, frequency, duration, and building type/size. Earthquakes produce oscillations or repeated vibrations that turn into waves, which spread through the earth, creating the shaking commonly experienced during the event. But these vibrations come in varying amplitudes and frequencies, and depending on the size of the structure and the ground which is built on, low amplitude/high-frequency waves and high amplitude/low-frequency waves will create different reactions. For small buildings, earthquakes with an oscillation that last less than a second per wave will cause high amounts of damage to the structure, while taller buildings won’t even feel it.[ The same applies to taller buildings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IJ99phNArM): higher oscillation periods will be catastrophic for taller buildings, but not for smaller homes.
