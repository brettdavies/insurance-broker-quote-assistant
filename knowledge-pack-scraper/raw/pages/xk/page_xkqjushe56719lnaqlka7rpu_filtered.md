# Progressive 1 time online e-sign discount

I’m shopping insurance and I was talking to a rep about the discounts and how they apply. They said that they can’t see how much I’m getting off for this particular discount and that I will find out once I pay.

Given that it’s one time I don’t mind at all, but what about after? Is this discount 50% off for the first 6 months then afterwards I need to pay 50% more? I have no idea.🤷‍♂️

Just wondering if anyone knows how much this discount is and what your experience with progressive auto insurance has been.

Decision: I went with progressive. In MA they allow 1 year payments although janky.
