If you’re in California, your monthly cost for full coverage car insurance is $251, which adds up to $3,010 per year. For minimum coverage, expect to pay an average of $63 monthly, or $751 a year.
Insurance companies calculate your premiums based partly on where you live. They consider factors such as traffic and accident rates, the number of car thefts in your area, and how expensive it is to repair your vehicle.
If you live in a busy city with heavy traffic and high theft rates, you’ll likely pay more for car insurance than someone in a rural area with fewer cars on the road and lower accident risks.
Other than location, your age, driving history, credit score and ZIP code also influence your insurance rates.

Methodology
Insure.com commissioned Quadrant Information Services to calculate average auto insurance rates for vehicles from 2006 to 2023.
Our hypothetical driver is a 40-year-old male who commutes 12 miles to work each day, with policy limits of 100/300/50 ($100,000 for injury liability for one person, $300,000 for all injuries and $50,000 for property damage in an accident) and a $500 deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage.
Rates for vehicles up until 2021 includes uninsured motorist coverage (since some states require it, we do it for all) and PIP or Medical Payments, if it is required by state law. This hypothetical driver has a clean record and good credit.
For liability 100/300 is rates the same hypothetical driver but with liability limits of 100/300/50, uninsured/underinsured motorist in matching amounts and PIP or MedPay, if required by state. We recommend limits this high, even if you have only liability coverage. A state-minimum policy includes only the basic state liability limits and any other state-required coverages, such as uninsured motorist or PIP.
Averages were calculated using data from six large carriers, such as Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, Nationwide, Progressive and State Farm. Rates were averaged across multiple ZIP codes and insurance companies. Average rates are for comparative purposes; your rate will depend on your personal factors.

## Average cost of car insurance by coverage levels in California
Your car insurance premium is determined by the coverage limits you choose.
If you purchase only the state’s minimum liability limits, you’ll pay $63 per month or $751 annually. While an affordable option, it only includes liability coverage. That means any damage to your own vehicle won’t be covered.
If you’re looking for more robust protection, consider choosing full coverage car insurance. It includes liability coverage, plus collision and comprehensive insurance. Collision coverage covers damage to your vehicle in an accident, no matter who’s at fault. Comprehensive insurance covers theft, vandalism or weather-related damage to your car.
In California, drivers typically pay $251 per month or $3,010 annually for full coverage car insurance.
Although it costs more than minimum coverage, full coverage can be a smart choice -particularly if you have a newer or financed vehicle.
Coverage limits | Average annual cost
---|---
State minimum liability-only | $751
Liability only | $1,016
Full coverage | $3,010
Non-owner state minimum liability | $394

## Average car insurance cost in California by city
Because car insurance rates vary by location, the city you live in also affects how much you pay. If you’re in cities like Los Angeles, Oakland or San Francisco, you’ll likely see higher premiums because of high traffic and accident rates, and greater risk of theft or damage.
On the other hand, drivers in cities like San Diego or San Jose pay significantly low insurance rates, on average between $2,835 and $2,918 a year. Insurers typically charge lower premiums in these cities due to fewer accidents, lower population density, vehicle theft and vandalism rates.
City | Average annual cost
---|---
San Diego | $2,835
San Jose | $2,918
Fresno | $2,936
Bakersfield | $3,053
Anaheim | $3,143
Long Beach | $3,279
Sacramento | $3,283
Oakland | $3,466
San Francisco | $3,466

## Average car insurance cost in California by age
Age is one of the most important factors insurers consider when pricing car insurance. Young drivers usually pay more because insurers see them as higher risk due to their limited experience behind the wheel.
Premiums are typically most expensive for teens, begin to decrease after age 25, and then rise again as drivers enter their 70s.
Here’s a breakdown of what you might pay for full coverage in California, based on age and gender.
### Average car insurance cost in California for young drivers
If you’re a younger driver, expect to pay higher premiums on your car insurance.
Insurers consider young drivers risky because of the increased risk that comes with limited driving experience.
For instance, a 20-year-old male driver in California pays an average of $5,120 annually for car insurance, compared to $5,120 for a female driver of the same age.
By age 25, car insurance premiums typically decrease to $3,629 per year for male drivers and $3,629 for female drivers. While still slightly above average, it’s a substantial drop from what drivers pay in their early 20s.
Age of driver | Average annual cost for Male drivers | Average annual cost for Female drivers
---|---|---
20 | $5,120 | $5,120

By 70, average rates go up to $3,022 for men and $3,022 for women. At age 75, costs increase further, reaching $3,190 for men and $3,190 for women each year. Insurers often raise rates for older drivers due to age-related risks like slower response times and declining vision.
