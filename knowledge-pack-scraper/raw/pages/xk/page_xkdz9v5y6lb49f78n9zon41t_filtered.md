## How Does No-Exam Life Insurance Work?

No-exam life insurance lets you get coverage without a medical exam. Instead of scheduling appointments with a nurse, you answer health questions online or over the phone. The insurer uses your answers plus data from prescription databases and driving records to assess risk and approve you in days instead of weeks. [Term life insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/best/term/) is the most common type of policy offered without an exam, but some companies also offer [whole life insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/best/whole-life/). No-exam policies aren't the [cheapest life insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/cheapest/), because companies are taking on greater perceived risk.

## No-Exam Life Insurance Pros and Cons

Consider the benefits and drawbacks of no-exam plans before purchasing. This information helps you manage the downsides while maximizing the advantages of your policy:

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| **Convenience**: You can apply online or over the phone, and the policy can be issued quickly, often within a few days, compared to several weeks. | **Higher Premiums:** No-exam life insurance policies are generally more expensive than fully underwritten policies, because the insurance company takes on more risk without knowing your complete health picture. |
| **Easy Approval:** No-exam policies don't require a medical exam, making it easier to get approved for coverage, even if you have a pre-existing medical condition. | **Lower Death Benefits**: No-exam life insurance policies generally have lower death benefits compared to fully underwritten policies. |
| **Coverage Options**: No-exam life insurance policies offer a range of coverage options to meet your specific needs and budget. | **Limited Coverage**: Guaranteed-issue policies often limit coverage amounts and may not offer the same level of coverage as a fully underwritten policy, with many capping coverage at $500,000 to $1 million. |

## How Much Does No-Medical-Exam Life Insurance Cost?

If you're budgeting for no-exam life insurance, several factors will influence your cost, including your age, gender, and coverage amount.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Understanding the differences between traditional life insurance policies and those that don't require a medical exam is challenging. Get answers to some of the most frequently asked questions to help you determine if a life insurance policy with no medical exam is right for you:

### What types of policies are offered with no medical exam?

The most common policies offered with no-medical-exam are term and whole life insurance. The rates and amount of coverage available vary by carrier, so we recommend getting several quotes for the type of no-exam life insurance you want to get the best rate.

### How long does a no-exam life insurance policy last?

The length of a no-exam life insurance policy depends on the type of policy you choose. Term policies last from five to 30 years, while permanent policies last as long as you continue to pay the premiums. The length of the policy is determined at the time of purchase and cannot be changed once the policy is in force.

### Can you borrow money from a no-exam life insurance policy?

No-exam term life insurance policies don't have a cash value component and don't allow policyholders to borrow money from the policy. However, some guaranteed issue whole life policies may accumulate cash value, which you can access through a withdrawal or loan.

### Can you get life insurance for seniors over 60 with no medical exam?

Yes, [seniors can get life insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/best/seniors/) with no medical exam. While these policies cost more than traditional policies, shopping around and comparing rates will help you find more affordable options.

### Do I need a medical exam to get life insurance?

It depends on the type of policy you choose. Some companies let you get coverage without a medical assessment, making them accessible for those wanting immediate life insurance with no medical questions or waiting periods. Traditional [term life insurance policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/best/term/) with medical exams generally offer higher coverage amounts at lower premiums for healthy individuals.

## Our Rating Methodology

No-medical-exam life insurance appeals to people who need coverage quickly or have health conditions that make traditional underwriting difficult, but higher premiums and coverage limits make choosing the right provider critical. We designed this research to identify which insurers offer the best combination of affordable rates, reliable service, and flexible coverage options for applicants skipping the medical exam.

We analyzed 30 insurance companies offering no-exam term life insurance and/or guaranteed acceptance whole life insurance to create our list. Our analysis included sourcing provider quotes, customer satisfaction data, financial stability reports, and product offerings to determine the best no-medical-exam life insurance companies for various needs. All provider information and coverage costs were updated in 2025 to ensure accuracy.

**Scoring System**

We assigned up to five points across three categories, then calculated overall scores out of five using these weightings:

* **Affordability (50%):** Premium competitiveness compared to other insurers offering no-exam policies
* **Customer Experience (30%):** Service quality, claims processing efficiency, and satisfaction based on customer feedback and industry ratings
* **Coverage Options (20%):** Variety and flexibility of products, including policy types, riders, and customization features

**Why These Weights?**

No-exam life insurance costs more than traditional policies, because insurers accept higher risk without medical underwriting. Affordability dominates our scoring, because premium differences compound over 10, 20, or 30 years. Customer experience carries substantial weight as well, because you need a company that processes claims efficiently when your beneficiaries depend on that payout. Coverage options matter because no-exam policies often have lower maximum coverage amounts and limited rider availability compared to traditional term life.
