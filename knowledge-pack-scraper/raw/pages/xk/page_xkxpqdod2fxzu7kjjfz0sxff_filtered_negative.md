## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Local Homeowners Insurance
To build our ratings, we researched 16 homeowners insurance companies and insurance agencies and analyzed data from a consumer survey with 1,125 responses, product features collected from company websites, and data on insurance costs provided by Quadrant Information Services. U.S. News worked with Quadrant to analyze a report of publicly available insurance rates using 34,595 ZIP codes across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the companies in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies that operate in that state. The insurance rates in our study are based on averages of sample rates for a 38-year-old and 56-year-old married applicant household with a 720 FICO credit score. The rates were obtained for an HO3 policy covering a wood-frame house with 10% Other Structures Coverage, 20% Loss of Use Coverage, 50% Personal Property Coverage, and a guest medical limit of $5,000.
