This is just one example of what you would learn in a defensive driving class. Each company will be different.
The good news is that just about every company offering these classes has taken to the Internet to offer an online version, but is an online course worth it? An online class means you can view the material and test yourself from the comfort of your own home and at your own pace.

Are driving schools worth it? We’re glad you asked. There are a few major points of note when deciding if the defensive driving class is for you. Put simply, here are two things to consider in order to be certain you are not wasting your time or money.
However, if you’ve got a teen that is eligible for the 5% discount for five years, it could make sense. And they’d potentially learn something to avoid an accident.

Tip: Verify your insurer offers a discount for defensive driving courses prior to taking one…as if anyone would do so for any other reason than to remove a violation! You will likely find they don’t offer a discount unless you’re under 21 or over 60.
[Enter your ZIP](https://www.thetruthaboutinsurance.com/defensive-driving-class-is-it-worth-it/#mdabottom) to compare quotes on car insurance after taking defensive driving classes to get the best discounts.
