#  Adding Driver to State Farm Policy 
Is State Farm really hard to work with, or is it just my agent? I’ve been trying to get my son added to our auto policy since February (like calling every month trying).

This might be state specific, but if the car is in his name they can’t add it to your policy. They have to write a new policy, and when that happens they need the dl# again it’s hidden on the current policy
