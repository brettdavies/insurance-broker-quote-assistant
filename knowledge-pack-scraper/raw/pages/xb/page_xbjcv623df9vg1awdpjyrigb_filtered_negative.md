State Farm complies with all applicable laws and remains committed to working with Illinois regulators. This Illinois taxpayer funded lawsuit is without merit and unrelated to State Farm’s Illinois rates or our Illinois customers.
* State Farm has provided the same type of information as other insurers provide in supporting rate filings in Illinois. Over the last three years, many insurers have raised Homeowners rates, citing deteriorating loss trends in Illinois; several of those increases in total exceed the State Farm increase.
Thank you for your trust in State Farm®. We understand no one likes to see their insurance rates increase, and we don’t take these decisions lightly. That’s why we want to provide you with some context around our approach in Illinois, where we are _**decreasing average auto insurance rates, and increasing average home insurance rates**_.
As a mutual company, State Farm is focused on serving its policyholders. Unlike companies with shareholders, _**our goal is not to maximize profits but to earn enough to maintain financial strength**_ that allows us to keep the promises we make and to support future growth.

**Illinois premiums are priced for the risk in this state** —not for losses in other states, including wildfires, earthquakes, or hurricanes.
One of the ways we are limiting rising premiums is through the introduction of a Wind/Hail Deductible. Illinois home insurance customers already choose deductibles related to loss perils. Illinois customers will now be required to have a minimum 1% Wind/Hail deductible as part of their home insurance policy. It will apply in instances where the cause of loss is deemed to be wind or hail. All other losses will be subject to the other deductible(s) stated within the policy.
