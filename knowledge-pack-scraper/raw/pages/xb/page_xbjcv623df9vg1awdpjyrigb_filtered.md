# Understanding the Issues in Illinois

## **Oct. 14 Update: Illinois AG Lawsuit**

State Farm complies with all applicable laws and remains committed to working with Illinois regulators. This Illinois taxpayer funded lawsuit is without merit and unrelated to State Farm’s Illinois rates or our Illinois customers.

State Farm has provided the Illinois Department of Insurance all data necessary to support its Illinois insurance rates.

State Farm will continue to proudly serve millions of people in Illinois and work with the Illinois Department of Insurance to benefit Illinois customers on behalf of the more than 21,000 agents, agent team members, and State Farm employees who call Illinois home.

## **Working with Illinois**

State Farm continues to work with regulators and legislators in Illinois to help our customers.

* State Farm made a rate filing in early June indicating a Homeowners rate increase in Illinois. That filing was more than 32-pages long and is available publicly on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) SERFF site. It includes detailed actuarial analysis supporting the rate filing.
* On June 23, State Farm also submitted a 5-page response to questions the Department asked about the filing. No additional questions were received and the filing was closed out by the Department of Insurance on June 27.
* State Farm first learned of concerns with the rate filing through the Governor's press release in July. Since then, State Farm met with both the Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance and a Deputy Governor. There were no additional requests for information in that meeting.
* State Farm has provided the same type of information as other insurers provide in supporting rate filings in Illinois. Over the last three years, many insurers have raised Homeowners rates, citing deteriorating loss trends in Illinois; several of those increases in total exceed the State Farm increase.
* State Farm's retained counsel on these issues submitted a letter on July 31 to the Director of the Illinois of Department of Insurance clarifying our position and once again indicating our continued willingness to work with state officials.
* Unrelated to the June rate filing, the Illinois Department of Insurance in March 2024 demanded nationwide data of State Farm. This demand exceeds the legal authority of the Illinois Department of Insurance. State Farm has, therefore, not provided this data, but has asked the Illinois DOI to engage in a process that would allow an independent third-party/judge to resolve this dispute. State Farm made that request of the Department nearly one year ago.

## **An update to auto insurance rates**

Auto insurance rates in Illinois will decrease an average of 5.7%, with some customers seeing reductions in premiums of up to 15%. Rate adjustments will apply to new and existing policies starting July 18, 2025. This decision is driven by trends projecting lower claims costs.

## **So, why are homeowner prices going up in Illinois?**

Thank you for your trust in State Farm®. We understand no one likes to see their insurance rates increase, and we don’t take these decisions lightly. That’s why we want to provide you with some context around our approach in Illinois, where we are ***decreasing average auto insurance rates, and increasing average home insurance rates***.   
  
As a mutual company, State Farm is focused on serving its policyholders. Unlike companies with shareholders, ***our goal is not to maximize profits but to earn enough to maintain financial strength*** that allows us to keep the promises we make and to support future growth.

As we continue to adapt to changing conditions, we remain committed to providing you with the best possible value, service, and support. Thank you for allowing us to protect what matters most to you.

Home insurance rates are on the rise in Illinois due to rising home replacement costs and more frequent severe weather events that are driving up the cost and frequency of claims. These changes reflect broader trends in loss patterns and repair costs and are necessary to help ensure we can continue providing reliable coverage to our policyholders.

**Home insurance claims costs are exceeding premiums collected.** The cost of covering Illinois homeowners’ losses is exceeding the premiums we’re earning—an indication we need to adjust prices. Last year, those total costs amounted to $1.26 for every dollar in premium we collected. The year before, it was $1.30. Such losses are unsustainable. 

**Inflation matters.** The costs of materials and labor have risen, affecting how much it costs to repair or rebuild homes. In the insurance business, the rates we charge are set in advance to cover potential future losses, including the costs to rebuild homes. As repair costs continue to rise, home insurance rates are as well.

**Severe weather—wind/hail and tornadoes—is increasing in Illinois.** Trends in recent years indicate damaging storms are more frequent here. In fact, Illinois had more hail damage claims than any other state except Texas in 2024.

**Illinois premiums are priced for the risk in this state**—not for losses in other states, including wildfires, earthquakes, or hurricanes.

## **Contact your agent to discuss coverage options**

State Farm is committed to being a responsible steward of the resources we manage, ensuring we can continue to provide the coverage you need in the face of increasing risks.   
  
We encourage you to reach out to your State Farm agent to discuss your coverage options. Our team is here to help you navigate these changes and find the solutions that work best for you.

## **Wind and hail deductible explained…**

One of the ways we are limiting rising premiums is through the introduction of a Wind/Hail Deductible. Illinois home insurance customers already choose deductibles related to loss perils. Illinois customers will now be required to have a minimum 1% Wind/Hail deductible as part of their home insurance policy. It will apply in instances where the cause of loss is deemed to be wind or hail. All other losses will be subject to the other deductible(s) stated within the policy.

Choosing a higher deductible is one way to reduce the premium you pay for insurance. Your State Farm agent can discuss options that are available.
