## Requirements for motorcycle insurance coverage by state

Almost all states require riders to carry [motorcycle insurance](https://www.progressive.com/motorcycle/). The types of coverage that the law requires vary by state, but the most common are:

### Liability insurance

Mandatory in nearly all states, motorcycle liability coverage is the most required coverage, paying for damages you cause others – both bodily injury and property damage – when you're at fault for an accident. Each state that requires liability coverage defines the minimum coverage limits you need for bodily injury and property damage.

### Uninsured motorist coverage

If you're hit by another driver who doesn't have insurance or has insufficient insurance to pay for the damage, uninsured motorist coverage can help cover the difference. Some states require this coverage while others don't. Learn more about [uninsured motorist coverage for motorcycles](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-coverage-for-motorcycles/).

### Personal injury protection

Covers your medical bills and those of your passengers if you're involved in an accident, no matter who caused it. [Personal injury protection](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-injury-protection/) (PIP), which varies in the states where it is available, may also cover lost wages and other benefits. It's a more common requirement in no-fault states (defined below).

### Medical payments

Covers medical bills if you or your passengers are injured in an accident. Unlike PIP, [medical payments coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/medical-payments-coverage/) doesn't cover other benefits like lost wages.

Other common coverages, like [motorcycle collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-collision-coverage/) and [motorcycle comprehensive coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-comprehensive-insurance/), aren't required by law but usually are required by lenders. If you don't own your bike outright, you'll probably need to carry these coverages as well. Whether you need them to comply with the terms of your loan or lease, they can provide helpful protection against loss due to natural disasters, theft, vandalism, collisions, and more.

It's a good idea to be familiar with your state's minimum coverage laws. Whether your state mandates motorcycle insurance by default, you may be required to carry a policy that meets certain minimums if you're deemed at fault for an accident. You may also be subject to extra penalties following an accident when you ride uninsured, even if you're legally allowed to do so.

## At-fault states versus no-fault states

Most states are considered "[at-fault](https://www.progressive.com/answers/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/)" states or "tort" states, meaning at least one of the drivers involved in a crash is determined to be at fault for the accident and responsible for the medical bills and damages of those involved. In these states, there are fewer restrictions on lawsuits related to auto accidents. However, the no-fault states require each driver to carry some amount of medical or PIP coverage. Medical bills are handled by each driver's insurance, regardless of who caused the accident.

## What states don't require motorcycle insurance?

Almost all states require motorcyclists to carry some amount of insurance on their bikes. Some states also allow alternatives to insurance, like filing a certificate of financial responsibility that demonstrates assets equal to or greater than the minimum required coverage limits. For most people, though, an insurance policy is the best and most practical way to satisfy the law, even when alternatives are available.
