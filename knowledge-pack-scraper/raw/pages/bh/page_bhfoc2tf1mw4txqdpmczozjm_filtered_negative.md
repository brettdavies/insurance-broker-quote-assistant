**New York is a no-fault insurance state, meaning that insureds generally must pursue reimbursement from their insurance company for certain damages after an[automobile accident](https://www.leverecker.com/white-plains/car-accident-lawyer/), regardless of who was at fault.**
[ Free Case Evaluation ](https://www.leverecker.com/contact/)
No-fault insurance systems aim to restore individuals hurt in car crashes to health and productivity as quickly as possible. No-fault insurance speeds up the claims process since it does not require an investigation into fault. New Yorkers generally must first file a no-fault claim under their own policy, for which personal injury protection coverage will apply, to pursue compensation and damages after an accident. However, if you were a [pedestrian struck by a vehicle](https://www.leverecker.com/white-plains/pedestrian-accident-lawyer/), you file a no-fault claim with the insurer of the car that struck you.
Importantly, no-fault insurance does not compensate for non-monetary damages, such as [pain and suffering](https://www.leverecker.com/blog/can-you-sue-for-pain-and-suffering-after-a-car-accident-in-new-york/). If the victim suffers a serious injury as defined by [Section 5102 of the Insurance Law of the State of New York](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ISC/5102), they can pursue a claim against the at-fault party if their economic losses exceed their no-fault coverage. For example, you may be able to recover compensation for:
**According to the[New York Department of Financial Services](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements), personal injury protection benefits cover the driver or [passengers injured](https://www.leverecker.com/blog/can-injured-passengers-pursue-compensation-after-car-accident-new-york/) in your car, or any pedestrian injured by your car. These benefits protect you and your relatives residing in your household against economic losses from car accident injuries.**
