## Buy Cheap Car Insurance in Illinois
Pinpointing low-cost car insurance in Illinois involves using some basic strategies. A good car insurance policy should have both a good cost and the coverage features you need.
### Compare Rates from Multiple Auto Insurance Companies
Auto insurance rates can vary significantly among insurers in Illinois. That means comparing quotes from multiple companies is essential to finding cheap car insurance in Illinois.
### Consider Switching Companies If Your Driving Record Changes
Has your auto rate gone up because of a recent ticket or at-fault accident? If you feel like you’re no longer getting cheap car insurance, it might be time to consider [switching car insurance companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-to-switch-car-insurance/). The cheapest Illinois car insurance company for you can vary based on your driving record.
### Regularly Review Your Car Insurance Policy
You may be able to get savings by removing auto insurance coverage you no longer want, such as roadside assistance or new car replacement coverage. If you haven’t reviewed your car policy in a while, it may be a good time to assess your policy.
### Rethink Your Deductible
You may be able to find savings if you have [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance/). By raising your auto insurance deductible you can lower your premium. Simply contact your insurance agent to find out how much you can save at various deductible amounts.
### Look Into Car Insurance Discounts
Many [car insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/) are added to your policy automatically, but there may be other car insurance discounts your insurance company doesn’t know you’re eligible for. Ask your insurance agent for a review of possible discounts. For example, if you are working from home or retired and are driving fewer annual miles, you may be eligible for a better car insurance rate.
### Capture Savings by Bundling
You can usually get sizeable savings by [bundling auto insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/) with homeowners insurance, condo or renters insurance, our analysis found that the average price break for bundling is 14%.
### Get Savings for Your Insurance Payment Strategy
You may be able to get small price breaks based on the way you pay your car insurance bill. Some insurers offer discounts for:
* Going paperless for billing and policy documents.
* Using EFT payments if you’re paying monthly.
* Paying for the whole policy term in one lump sum.
## Methodology
Except where otherwise noted, average rates are based on a female driver insuring a new RAV4 with coverage of 100/300/100 ($100,000 of liability insurance for injuries to one person; $300,000 of liability insurance for injuries in one accident; $100,000 for property damage liability), uninsured motorist coverage, collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible, and any other insurance required in the state. Average rates for cities are based on a 40-year-old female good driver with the above coverage. Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
