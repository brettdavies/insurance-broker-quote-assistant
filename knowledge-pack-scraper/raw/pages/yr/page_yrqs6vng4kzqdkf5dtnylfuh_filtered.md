## How to Get Cheap Car Insurance as a College Student

[Your insurance needs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) depend on your living situation and driving habits while in school. If you attend college far from home, you may qualify for distance-based discounts that reduce your premiums by 10% to 30%.

Students attending institutions more than 100 miles from home might be eligible for savings if they don't have regular access to a car. Assess whether it makes more financial sense to remain on your family's policy or secure your own coverage based on your circumstances.

   Compare Quotes from Multiple Insurers

   Rate differences between insurers exceed $500 for identical coverage. College students switching from family to individual policies see the largest variations—State Farm charges $61 monthly for 18-year-olds, while some competitors charge $100+ for the same state minimum coverage.

   Use [MoneyGeek's car insurance quote tool](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-estimate-calculator/) to compare rates from leading providers. If you are attending school out-of-state, verify that your coverage extends across state lines before making the switch.

   Maximize Discounts for College Students

   Good grades save you money on insurance. Most insurers offer [good student discounts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/good-student-discounts/) of 10% to 25% if you maintain a B average or 3.0 GPA. State Farm, Allstate and USAA all provide these discounts for full-time students under 25.

### Best Car Insurance Discounts for College Students

While young drivers face higher insurance premiums, college students can access discount opportunities designed for their circumstances. Beyond the [good student discount](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/good-student-discounts/), several lesser-known discounts are suited to college life.

For a comprehensive overview of [auto insurance discounts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-discounts/), visit our complete guide.

| Student Discounts | Discount Eligibility |
| --- | --- |
| Good student discount | Maintain strong academics (usually a B average or 3.0 GPA or ranking in the top 20% of your class) and provide proof (transcript/report card). |
| Distant student/Student away discount | College students who live more than 100 miles from home without regular access to the family car qualify for distant student discounts. This saves 10% to 30% on premiums. |

## Best Car Insurance for College Students: Bottom Line

The best choice depends on your situation. Students staying on family policies should consider GEICO for consistent low rates, while those needing individual coverage often find State Farm most affordable.

### Cheap College Student Car Insurance: FAQ

### Why is car insurance expensive for college students?

Car insurance is expensive for college students because drivers under 25 have less experience and higher accident rates, which results in higher premiums. But college students can find more affordable coverage by maintaining clean driving records and qualifying for student discounts.

### Should college students stay on their parents' policy?

Most college students should remain on their parents' policy if possible because family plans often provide better rates and coverage. You can stay on your family's policy if your permanent address remains your parents' home, your car is titled in your parents' name or jointly with them, and you still depend on them financially.

### Can roommates or friends drive my car while at college?

Most insurance policies allow college students' roommates to use their car through permissive use coverage. But if a roommate frequently uses the vehicle, you'll need to add them to your policy. Check with your insurer for specific rules because coverage limits may be lower for drivers not listed on your policy.

### Do college students living out of state need to change their car insurance?

Out-of-state college students can keep their family coverage if their permanent residence remains at their parents' home.

### What happens to college students' insurance during summer breaks or when home from school??

College students don't need to change their car insurance during short breaks.

### How do I add a college student driver to a family policy?

To add a college student driver to a family policy, contact your insurer with the student's license information, enrollment proof and personal details.

### How much car insurance do college students need?

To find the best and cheapest policy for a college student, start by determining [how much coverage the student needs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/). The average annual rates provided are for [affordable full coverage policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-full-coverage-car-insurance/).

### Cheapest Auto Insurance for College Students: Methodology:

Students face some of the highest car insurance rates because insurers view young, inexperienced drivers as high-risk, making it critical to understand whether staying on a parent's policy or buying individual coverage saves you more money. We built this analysis to show you the actual cost differences between these options and identify the most affordable insurers for student drivers.

We analyzed car insurance quotes using student driver profiles and compared rates for individual policies versus family coverage. Our research reveals which approach costs less based on your age and whether you're in high school or college.

We collected data from state insurance departments and Quadrant Information Services, analyzing **19,516 quotes from six companies in 100 U.S. ZIP codes**. This sample provides accurate national averages while capturing regional pricing variations that affect what students actually pay.

We used a student driver operating a Toyota Camry LE with a clean driving record, logging 12,000 miles annually. We modified this profile by age to gather age-specific quote data for high school students (16-18) and college students (18-22), showing how rates change as young drivers gain experience.

Our analysis used **100/300/100 liability limits** with a **$1,000 deductible** for comprehensive and collision coverage under full coverage policies. This represents $100,000 bodily injury liability per person, $300,000 per accident, and $100,000 property damage liability per accident.

Understanding deductibles: A deductible is what you pay out-of-pocket before your insurer covers the remaining costs. Comprehensive coverage handles damage from noncollision events like theft, vandalism, fire, or falling objects. Collision coverage pays for damage from at-fault accidents with objects or other vehicles. Each coverage type has its own deductible, while liability coverage typically doesn't include deductibles.
