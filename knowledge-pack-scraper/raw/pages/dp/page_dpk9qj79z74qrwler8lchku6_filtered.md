## Why do I need insurance?

Insurance is a way to protect you and your loved ones from financial distress — and in many cases it's required by law or financial institutions. These situations commonly require insurance:

* **To legally drive in most states**: You're required to carry vehicle insurance (auto, motorcycle, or RV), usually a minimum amount of [liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/liability-insurance/) and sometimes [uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) and [personal injury protection](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-injury-protection/) or [medical payments coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/medical-payments-coverage/).
* **To get a car loan or lease**: Most car loans require you to carry [auto comprehensive coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) before you qualify for the loan. The same may go for buying an RV, boat, or motorcycle.
* **To get a mortgage**: Most home mortgage lenders require you to get homeowners insurance or [condo insurance](https://www.progressive.com/condo-insurance/).
* **To rent an apartment**: Many leasing companies and landlords require their tenants to carry renters insurance.
* **To get a business loan**: If you own a business and apply for a business loan, the lender may require you to get a [life insurance policy with collateral assignment](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-collateral-assignment/).

While not required, health insurance and life insurance are also often considered musts for protecting your family's financial security.

## How does insurance work?

Your policy will cover specific people, property or vehicles (if applicable), and circumstances, depending on your coverages. How each insurance policy works will be detailed in the [insurance declarations page](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-declaration-page/) or the terms and conditions provided when you purchase the policy. You can use this page to learn more about the cost and term length of your policy, the types of coverage you have, and any deductibles, limits, co-pays, and coverage exclusions.

## How do I choose a good insurance policy?

A good insurance policy is one that meets your coverage needs, fits in your budget, and is underwritten by a reputable and financially secure insurer.

Start by researching how much insurance you need, compare quotes and customer reviews, and make sure there's a knowledgeable customer service team ready to answer your questions. You can even check an insurer's financial security rating with independent agencies like A.M. Best and Fitch Ratings.
