State Farm has stated that they saw fewer accidents and less expensive losses during the pandemic, but today, they’re seeing increases in car accidents and injuries, causing car insurance rates to rise.

They also blame:

* High inflation affects prices of goods, cars and insurance rates.
* [Car repair](/car-repair/) costs increased due to supply chain issues and new technology.
* Increasing electric vehicle sales contributing to higher insurance rates.
* Distracted driving, especially texting, raises accident risks.
* 2023 weather catastrophes led to $1 billion in losses, impacting premiums moving forward.

## Why does my State Farm bill fluctuate?

[State Farm](/reviews/car-insurance/state-farm/) calculates your insurance bill according to the [factors](/car-insurance/how-is-car-insurance-calculated/) below. Changes in any of them will affect your rate.

Some factors are passive; for example, you might grow out of the “teen driver” age group. Other factors are more within your control, such as what vehicle you buy.

### Your vehicle

Higher priced, powerful, risk-prone and newer cars increase insurance rates. Safety features and anti-theft devices can lower them.

### Your coverage amounts

Your state’s minimum [required coverage](/car-insurance/is-car-insurance-required/) will be cheaper than [full coverage](/car-insurance/full-coverage-car-insurance/), which usually includes [comprehensive](/car-insurance/comprehensive-insurance/), [collision](/car-insurance/collision-insurance/) and [uninsured/underinsured motorist](/car-insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) (UIM) coverage.

### Frequency and mileage

Higher annual mileage and business use will increase rates. Leisure use and [low mileage drivers](/car-insurance/low-mileage-car-insurance/) will see decreased rates.

### Your driving record

Drivers with clean driving records will get lower [car insurance rates](/car-insurance/average-car-insurance/). Risky behaviors behind the wheel, [citations](/car-insurance/what-is-a-citation/) and other infractions will increase rates.

### Your location

Urban drivers usually pay more due to higher risks of vandalism, theft and accidents.

### Your background

Age, sex and marital status affect rates, with younger males and single individuals generally paying more.

### Your credit history

Where applicable, higher [credit scores](/car-insurance/credit-based-insurance-score/) lower rates, while lower credit scores increase rates.

## How to lower your State Farm car insurance rate

Notice your State Farm insurance rate went up recently? Don’t worry, there are a few things you can do to help lower your premiums.

### Review and remove things from your policy

Remove unnecessary coverages like comprehensive, rental and roadside assistance, and increase [deductibles](/car-insurance/car-insurance-deductible/) if your accident risk is low.

### Choose the right car

Research theft rates, safety ratings and insurance prices before buying to find cheaper, safer vehicles.

### Maintain a clean driving record

Avoid [at-fault accidents](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/) to benefit from State Farm’s accident-free savings for three years.

### Drive Safe & Save by State Farm

State Farm’s [telematics](/car-insurance/what-is-telematics/) tracking program uses your smartphone and a mobile beacon to judge your driving style. These app track behaviors such as quick acceleration, hard braking, fast cornering, speeding and distracted driving.

### Discounts

State Farm offers a number of [discounts](/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) to their customers, including the following:

* Accident-free discount.
* Student away discount (for students under 25 years old).
* Defensive driving course discount.
* Steer Clear discount (for people under 25 years old).
* Anti-theft equipment discount.
* Multi-car discount.
* Multi-policy discount.

### Shop around

If all else fails or if you’re simply interested in a better deal, go ahead and shop around to [compare quotes](/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from different insurers. Your best bet is to call three to five providers or use the Jerry app that compare coverages and pricing all at once.
