## How Defensive Driving Course Insurance Discounts Work
A defensive driving insurance [discount](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-discounts/) reduces your premium after you complete an approved safety course, which shows insurers you’re a lower-risk driver. Many insurers offer this discount to drivers who voluntarily take a course that teaches accident avoidance and safe driving techniques. 
Taking advantage of this discount can help many drivers, as auto insurance costs depend on several factors. Since [age](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/average-car-insurance-rates-by-age-and-gender/) and driving record commonly influence your premium rates, new drivers like [17-year-olds](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-cheap-car-insurance-for-17-year-olds/) often pay higher costs because insurers see them as riskier than experienced drivers (even when they can get cheap insurance deals). 
If you've completed a defensive driving course or are considering taking one, you can get a defensive driving discount that saves you money.
![An illustration of a woman who is qualified for a defensive driving discount. ](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy,w_780/v1649198079/qualifying_52a3dd7230.png)
### Defensive Driving Course Discount Requirements
Most drivers can get this discount, but each company has different requirements. The qualification requirements vary but almost always include taking a defensive driving course. How much you save depends on your driving history and age.
![highschoolStudent icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/highschoolStudent_z7nqq9.svg)
Age requirements
[Drivers under 25](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-young-adults/) and those over [55 to 60 years old](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-seniors/) are eligible for the discount in most states, though some states require insurers to offer this discount to drivers of all ages. The actual age that is eligible for discounts varies by provider. For instance, [GEICO](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/reviews/geico/) gives discounts to drivers over 50, while [Farmers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/reviews/farmers/) restricts discounts to drivers 65 or older.
![checkList icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/checkList_iwqocr.svg)
Driving record requirements
Most insurers require a clean driving record for a specific period, usually 12 to 36 months without at-fault accidents, claims, or moving violations. GEICO specifies that you can't have been involved in an at-fault accident to qualify for their defensive driving discount.
![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)
Course accreditation requirements
Each insurer has specific eligibility rules. Your course must be:
    * State-approved through your Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
    * Accepted by your specific insurance company
    * Completed voluntarily (not court-ordered)
    * From an accredited provider
Check with your insurer first about requirements. This step is important because taking a non-approved course will prevent you from getting the discount.
![building icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/building_iibc2e.svg)
State-specific requirements
States may have laws related to defensive driving discount eligibility. In some cases, insurers are required to offer this discount to all drivers regardless of age. For example, Minnesota drivers can save up to 12% on applicable coverages, while some states like Massachusetts and Michigan don't offer defensive driver discounts.


### Defensive Driving Discount Exclusions and Limitations
You must meet the age and course requirements to qualify for a defensive driving discount. Depending on the insurer, there may be other qualification rules. For instance, you may need a clean driving record for several years without violations.
Check with your insurer first about requirements to avoid paying for a course that's not accredited.
## How Much Does a Defensive Driving Course Lower Your Insurance?
Completing a defensive driving course can qualify you for a defensive driving discount. With this discount, you can receive 5% to 20% off your premium, depending on your location and insurance company.
### Defensive Driving Discount Cost Savings Example
We analyzed AARP survey data and found that New York drivers saved an average of $200 per year after completing defensive driving courses. For context, the [national average cost of car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-the-average-cost-of-car-insurance-month-year/) is $1,495 per year. Here are different scenarios:
**Basic scenario:**
  * Course cost: $50
  * 10% discount on $1,495/year = $149.50 annual savings
  * Three-year savings: $149.50 × 3 = $448.50
  * Net savings: $448.50 – $50 = $398.50


**High-value scenario:**
  * Course cost: $75
  * 15% discount on $2,000/year = $300 annual savings
  * Three-year savings: $300 × 3 = $900
  * Net savings: $900 – $75 = $825


**Example:**
If you’re a 45-year-old driver paying $1,200 annually, a 10% defensive driving discount saves you $120 per year. Over three years, that’s $360 in total savings for a $50 course.
![An illustration of a woman discussing defensive driving discounts with her auto insurance representative. ](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy,w_780/v1649198210/auto_Insurance_Companies_55480d45aa.png)
## How to Get a Defensive Driving Course Insurance Discount
Follow these steps to get the maximum savings:
  1. 1
Look for a policy from an insurer offering a defensive driving discount
Not all companies offer this discount. Research companies that do. Then, compare their rates and policy offers. Generally, the [best car insurance company](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies/) offers a balance of affordability and quality service. Once you choose an insurer, note its eligibility requirements for the discount.
  2. 2
Check state-approved courses and verify insurer acceptance
Your state probably has a list of certified courses you can take. Check with your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or similar agency. You must also contact your insurance company to confirm that they accept your chosen course provider.
Popular approved providers include:
     * National Safety Council
     * AARP Smart Driver
     * American Safety Council
     * Defensive Driving by IMPROV
     * AAA defensive driving courses
  3. 3
Take the course
Choose a defensive driving course accredited by the insurance company you've chosen and certified by the state. You can take a class online or in person. Online courses offer flexibility and can be completed at your own pace, while in-person courses provide immediate instructor feedback.
  4. 4
Complete the course
Most defensive driving courses cover risks, traffic laws and defensive driving techniques. Complete the training and pass the course. Most courses require a final quiz or test with a passing score of 70% to 80%.
  5. 5
Submit the necessary documents to your car insurance company
Once you get your certification, apply for the discount. Here's what you'll need to submit:
     * Certificate of completion (original or certified copy)
     * Completed discount application form
     * Proof of course payment (if required)
     * Driver's license information
Processing times vary by insurer. The discount will appear on your policy in two to four weeks. Contact your agent if you don't see the discount applied within 30 days.


![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)
MAINTAINING YOUR DISCOUNT
Your defensive driving discount expires every three years. To maintain the savings:
  * Mark your calendar two to three months before expiration
  * Retake an approved defensive driving course
  * Submit your new certificate before the discount expires
  * Maintain a clean driving record during the discount period


Some insurers will send renewal reminders, but you must maintain the discount.

MoneyGeek answers frequently asked questions to help you better understand defensive driving courses and discounts.
### Who should take defensive driving courses?
Providers view [16-year-olds](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-cheap-car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) and other young drivers as high-risk drivers and they face higher premiums. Taking advantage of this discount can lower insurance rates. Defensive driving programs can also help [teen drivers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheap-car-insurance-for-teen-drivers/) find cheaper coverage. Regardless of age, [new drivers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-new-drivers/) are seen as inexperienced and, therefore, high-risk.
### Is there an age limit for defensive driving programs?
No, anyone can take a defensive driving course. However, these programs target high-risk drivers, like teens and seniors. Experienced drivers can also take a driving course to get more insurance discounts. Insurance providers offer lower car insurance rates to good drivers with no claims or accidents on their record.
### Can teen drivers take a defensive driving course?
Yes, [18-year-olds](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-cheap-car-insurance-for-18-year-olds/) and other teen drivers can take a defensive driving course after passing a driver's education course. It can supplement their safe driving knowledge and help lower premiums.

If you do not qualify for a defensive driving discount, there are other discounts automatically applied to safe drivers such as a three year safe driver discount and accident free discount. Most Insurance companies will apply these automatically to the insurance policy after running the Motor Vehicle Report (MVR), if it comes back clean.
Other driving programs that can lead to extra savings are the programs such as SnapShot, Intelli Drive, Dynamic Drive, etc. Insurance companies are starting to push for drivers to use these driving apps to help personalize their insurance premiums and save additional money on their car insurance. The initial step in the program saves you 10% off of the premium and at your renewal offer you could earn up to 30% off depending on how well you did. These programs are the most beneficial, and money saving programs that Insurance companies are offering very great discounts for completing.
