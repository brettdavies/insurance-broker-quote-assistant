**State Farm General S &P Global Rating Update (**[**_Financial Strength Rating lowered; Stable Outlook_**](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/101638780)**)**
S&P Global Ratings (S&P) concluded a [ _previously announced_](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3368291) review of State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm General) to evaluate its standalone rating, separate from the State Farm Group rating. With this review, S&P lowered its financial strength rating (FSR) of State Farm General from **‘A+’** to **‘A-’** with a **‘stable’** outlook and removed the **"CreditWatch - Negative"** from the rating.
The recent emergency interim rate approval by the Commissioner and receipt of a $400 million investment from State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company®, through the issuance of a surplus note in June 2025, are critical steps in the process to continue serving our California customers.
The **‘A-’** rating meets Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac single family mortgage origination and servicing guidelines.
* In spite of the elevated risk and a unique regulatory environment, home insurance premiums in California have not matched price to risk and are [ _below the national average_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.iii.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/triple-i_trends_and_insights_california_homeowners_issues_brief_09212023.pdf__;!!KZXpRQ!TjCwCAykk5DCwRSHV8_f8AgGFSpPEEGslmIRNntHzLCNbxkan0EuANDD2ROncrcb6oXJyMeOxsO7De-pBJe7UeZxkPNvNweI$). In fact, over the last nine years, State Farm General paid $1.26 for every premium dollar collected, resulting in over $5 billion in cumulative losses.
* State Farm and each of its affiliates, including State Farm General in California, operate on an individual entity-by-entity basis without regard to the financial condition of any other affiliated entity. It is the expectation of State Farm that each affiliate will, on an individual basis over the long-term, generate and maintain capital sufficient to support itself. Such capital is not freely transferrable among affiliated entities. A key to making insurance work is that each customer pays premium in line with the risk they present. Customers outside California are not paying for risks in California and they should not be expected to.
Our claims force is the largest in the industry and we have brought the full scale and force of our catastrophe response teams to help our Southern California customers recover. Our claim handlers remain on the ground assisting customers. Customers should continue to directly reach out to us with claim questions or concerns. We actively work with each of our customers to understand the facts of their loss, identify the damages and applicable coverage, and ultimately resolve their claim.
For the latest our response to the California wildfires, information can be found here: [ _State Farm® is here to help California customers impacted by wildfires_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-is-here-to-help-california-customers-impacted-by-wildfires/).
**State Farm General S &P Global Rating action (**[**_Financial Strength Rating remains on CreditWatch – Negative_**](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3368291)**)**
We remain deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General, as it is difficult to match price to risk in California. As we continue to emphasize in our ongoing interim rate filing, we need immediate rate increases to help stabilize State Farm General’s financial condition to be able to serve our California customers for the long-term. S&P’s decision today regarding changing its assessment of the status of State Farm General within the State Farm group from “Core” to**"Strategically Important** ", resulted in SF General no longer receiving the ‘AA’ financial strength rating (FSR) assigned to State Farm Mutual and its core subsidiaries by S&P. Also, S&P lowering of its FSR on State Farm General to **"A+"** rating and continuing the **"CreditWatch - Negative"** reinforces the need for urgency.
It’s time for certainty in the California insurance market for our customers. The provisional nature of[ _today’s decision_](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release026-2025.cfm)
State Farm General has worked openly and honestly with all parties in this process. In addition, State Farm General will continue to monitor capacity to support its risks and build sufficient capital for the future.
**State Farm General S &P Global Rating action (**[**_Financial Strength Rating placed on CreditWatch - Negative_**](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3328722)**)**
Representatives from State Farm General Insurance Company (SFG) will attend a meeting tomorrow with Commissioner Lara about SFG’s emergency interim rate request. SFG submitted a [ _letter_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/download/3867bd51-fce0-4abd-9a96-cf2da05152d5/sfgtolara2.25.25.pdf) to the Commissioner today.
As SFG said in its [ _February 3 letter_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/download/90ab44d3-54d6-42b7-8d69-0d883fa5de78/february32025lettersenttocadepartmentofinsurance.pdf) to the Commissioner, approval is needed to help avert a dire situation for the more than 2.8 million policies issued by SFG, including 1 million State Farm General homeowners customers, and the insurance market in the state of California.
Last year, one rating agency downgraded SFG’s financial strength rating due to its capital position. With further capital deterioration as a result of the wildfires, additional downgrades could follow. If that were to happen, customers with a mortgage might not be able to use SFG insurance on the collateral backing for their mortgage.
We have gone to great lengths to clearly answer the questions outlined by the Commissioner. While we’re positioned to handle all of the claims associated with the most recent wildfires, State Farm General must seriously consider its options within the California insurance market going forward.
[**_Commissioner’s Response_**](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/upload/nr018CommissionerLetterEmergencyInterimRateApproval.pdf)
* **State Farm has served the customers of California for nearly 100 years and our intention is to continue serving them for many more.** State Farm has more customers in California than any other insurer. State Farm General Insurance Company is the state’s largest provider of Fire insurance, with more than 2.8 million policies in California. State Farm General protects more than 1 million homeowners customers.
* **State Farm helps people recover from the unexpected. That is what we are doing in the wake of the wildfires.** Thousands of State Farm agents, agent team members and employees are on the ground in California and are assisting customers virtually in the wake of this tragedy. As of February 1st, State Farm General (Fire only) has received more than 8,700 claims and has already paid more than $1 billion to customers. State Farm General will ultimately pay out significantly more, as collectively these fires will be the costliest disasters in the history of State Farm General. Reinsurance will assist us in paying what we owe to customers.
* **The costs of the January 2025 wildfires will further deplete capital from State Farm General.** Capital is necessary so an insurance company can pay for any future claims for the risks it insures.
* Last year, one rating agency downgraded State Farm General’s financial strength rating due to its capital position. With further capital deterioration as a result of the wildfires, additional downgrades could follow. If that were to happen, customers with a mortgage might not be able to use State Farm General insurance on the collateral backing for their mortgage.
* **State Farm General asked the California Department of Insurance today to immediately approve interim rate increases** to help avert a dire situation for the more than 2.8 million policies issued by State Farm General, including 1 million State Farm General homeowners customers, and the insurance market in the state of California.
* **Insurance will cost more for customers in California going forward because the risk is greater in California.** Immediate emergency interim approval of additional rate is essential to more closely align cost and risk and enable State Farm General to rebuild capital.
* We must appropriately match price to risk. That is foundational to how insurance works. Higher risks should pay more for insurance than lower risks.
* Over the last 9 years, the lack of alignment between price and risk means that for every $1.00 collected in premium, State Farm General paid $1.26, resulting in over $5 billion in cumulative underwriting losses.
* State Farm General’s attempts over that same period to both raise rates and restrict growth, in order to keep our risk profile in line with available surplus, were constrained by regulatory considerations and met with limited success. This was due in no small part to intervenors in the rate review process, whose efforts to delay and decrease needed rate adjustments prevented State Farm General from maintaining a capital position supportive of its risk profile and impaired its ability to support continued underwriting of California properties.
* Even before the January wildfires, at year-end 2024, State Farm General’s Policyholder Protection Fund – or capital available to pay future claims – was approximately a quarter of what it was in 2016.
* State Farm General has had an outstanding filed rate increase pending since June 2024.
* The magnitude of expected claims payments for the recent wildfires, along with its share of FAIR Plan losses, puts even more pressure on State Farm General’s capital position.
* **State Farm General has made difficult decisions to attempt to responsibly limit overexposure in high-risk areas, while allowing for targeted growth in lower risk areas of the state.**
* In [ _May 2023, State Farm General made the difficult decision_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-general-insurance-company-california-new-business-update/) to stop writing any new policies.
* In a detailed letter to the CDI in March 2024, State Farm General said, “The swift capital depletion of State Farm General is an alarm signaling the grave need for rapid and transformational action, including the critical need for rapid review and approval of currently pending and future rate filings.”
* In [ _March 2024, another difficult decision_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/update-on-california/) was made to non-renew 30,000 homeowners policies, representing the company’s greatest catastrophe risk. That non-renewal process is ongoing. Following the recent wildfires, homeowners non-renewals in Los Angeles County were paused. Any of these homeowner policies which had pending non-renewals in Los Angeles County that were on the books on January 7th will have an option to renew with State Farm General.
* State Farm General still insures high concentrations of risk in California that could generate financial losses multiple times larger than the company’s surplus. A smaller capital base will further constrain State Farm General’s ability to provide ongoing coverage.
* **We look forward to working alongside regulators, policymakers and industry leaders on creating a sustainable insurance environment in California –** one that balances risk and increased rates, ensures long-term market stability and availability and allows insurers like State Farm General to remain a vital part of California’s future.
