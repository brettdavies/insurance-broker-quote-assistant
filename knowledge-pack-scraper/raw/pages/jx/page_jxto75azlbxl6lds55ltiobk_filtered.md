# The Benefits of Texas Windstorm Insurance

![The Value of Guaranteed Replacement Cost](https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F87a865fc472c4b69863d5e7f8aa60d5c%2F6cfaa2eb396d44c79c6107393b19df83)

As a Gulf Coast state, Texas has seen its fair share of tropical storms and hurricanes over the years. These windy and rainy events can cause significant damage to homes along the coastline, but they aren’t the only types of Texas windstorms wreaking havoc across the Lone Star State.

In fact, according to data gathered by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), Texas has seen more billion-dollar weather and climate disasters than any other state between 1980 and 2024 — not only do these storms happen more often, but they are more costly when they do. A large portion of those storms are wind-related, too, including everything from hurricanes to tornadoes and hailstorms.

If you own a home deep in the heart of Texas, you may want to consider whether your standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.hippo.com/homeowners-insurance) is enough to protect your property adequately. In some cases, buying added coverage — like [catastrophe insurance](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/catastrophe-insurance) or flood coverage — can give you peace of mind when heavy winds hit. Here’s everything you need to know.

## Key takeaways

* The Lone Star State is home to five of the ten windiest cities in the United States.
* In Texas, wind and hail insurance is often a standard part of homeowners insurance coverage unless you live in high-risk counties.
* To protect against damage from windstorms, Texas homeowners in certain areas may need to purchase special wind insurance, either as an add-on to their homeowners policy or through a special state coverage program like TWIA.
* Texas wind insurance coverage is available to homeowners in high-risk areas through the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) at an average cost of $1,700 per year.
* TWIA coverage does not protect against any non-wind perils, such as fire or theft.

## Is windstorm insurance required in Texas?

There is no state or federal law requiring you to purchase [windstorm insurance](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/windstorm-insurance) in the state of Texas. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t be forced to buy a policy from your mortgage lender if you have a home loan on your property.

Windstorm damage is usually covered by [homeowners insurance in Texas](https://www.hippo.com/homeowners-insurance/texas), so your everyday standard coverage may suffice. However, if you live in a storm-prone area, your requirements could differ. For example, you may need to buy hurricane insurance to fully protect your home if you live near the coast, a flood insurance policy if you live in a flood plain, or wind insurance if you live in north Texas, where tornadoes are more frequent.

If you live in an area of Texas plagued by windstorms, you may need to also know what TWIA coverage is.

## What is a TWIA insurance policy?

The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association provides windstorm and hail insurance to homeowners when these types of damage are excluded by their homeowners insurance policy. TWIA coverage is intended primarily for coastal residents whose homes are prone to hurricane damage and, therefore, are excluded from standard homeowners coverage.

### What does Texas windstorm insurance cover?

TWIA insurance coverage bridges the gap for homeowners who would otherwise have costly exclusions to their home insurance in case of a severe storm. It’s designed to cover the cost of repairing, rebuilding, or even replacing your home if it is damaged or destroyed by wind or hail damage. These policies are intended for coastal homeowners whose basic policies exclude these perils.

TWIA coverage doesn’t replace homeowners insurance, as it only provides coverage as wind and hail insurance (Texas homes are excluded from damages by other perils, like fire and theft, with TWIA policies). It can, however, replace a typical [hurricane insurance](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/hurricane-insurance) policy, as it provides the same added protections to the same target homeowners.

## How much is windstorm insurance in Texas?

An average TWIA policy costs approximately $1,700 per year on top of your standard homeowners insurance premiums. However, the cost of windstorm insurance in Texas can vary widely and depends on personal factors as well as the policy options you choose.

Some important factors that affect your insurance premiums include the following:

* The [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/homeowners-insurance-deductible) you choose
* How much your home is worth
* Exactly where you live (and how at-risk your property really is)
* The level of coverage you want to buy
* Whether you’re buying standalone windstorm insurance or adding this coverage as an [endorsement](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/insurance-endorsement) (rider) to your existing homeowners policy
* Any previous insurance claims history

If you’re shopping around for new coverage, first check your existing policy’s declarations page to match and compare your courage options. This will also tell you what sort of exclusions exist on your homeowners policy (if any) so you can get a comparable Texas windstorm insurance quote and purchase the right protection for your home. *You can learn more here if you aren’t exactly sure* [*what an insurance declaration page is*](https://www.hippo.com/learn-center/insurance-declaration-page)*.*

## Tips on how to get Texas windstorm insurance and prepare for severe weather

With Texas leading the nation in climate-related home damage, many residents are unfortunately all too familiar with severe storms and the destruction they leave behind.

One important part of preparing for severe weather is ensuring that your home is adequately protected by a combination of insurance coverage. Your standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.hippo.com/homeowners-insurance) policy may exclude certain damages, like wind or flooding, especially if you live in an area prone to certain types of storms. It’s important to read your policy carefully to see what’s covered, what’s excluded, and what sort of coverage you need to purchase elsewhere.

## Still have questions?

Want to know even more about Texas wind insurance, what it covers, and why it might be necessary for your property? Here are some of the most frequently asked questions.

### Where is the windstorm region in Texas?

Whether you live along the Gulf of Mexico or in Houston, windstorm insurance is key for your area. According to the Texas Windstorm Insurance Agency (TWIA), residential and commercial coverage areas include Harris County (the Houston area) east of Highway 146, along with 14 directly coastal counties. TWIA-eligible counties are Aransas, Brazoria, Calhoun, Cameron, Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Kenedy, Kleberg, Matagorda, Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio, and Willacy.

### Why is it so windy in Texas?

Texas is a surprisingly windy state and is home to a number of the windiest cities in the country. Texas is a relatively windy state due to three factors: the Marfa Dry Line, the west-to-east jet stream, and pressure gradients. The Marfa Dry Line is particularly unique as it is where the Rocky Mountains' cold, dry desert air collides with moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, creating notable wind.

### What is the most windy city in Texas?

The windiest city in Texas is Amarillo, which has an average wind speed of 13 mph. Amarillo is located in the panhandle of the state and is actually the windiest city in the entire United States. In addition to Amarillo, Texas is home to four more of the top 10 windiest cities in the U.S.: Lubbock, Corpus Christi, Wichita Falls, and Abilene. However, shopping around for the best windstorm insurance in Texas can help protect you from wind damage in these cities and beyond.

### What are some Texas windstorm insurance providers?

Not all carriers are classified as windstorm insurance companies in Texas. Providers currently participating in the TWIA program include American Capital Assurance Corp, Cypress Texas Insurance Company, State National Insurance Company, Inc., USAA, and Weston Property and Casualty Insurance Company.

### Is my car covered by windstorm insurance?

Home insurance coverage, including windstorm insurance, always excludes damages to vehicles. Instead, weather-related car damages need to be claimed against a comprehensive auto insurance policy.
