# Adding a 16y/o male to my auto insurance....YIKES

In North Carolina, received a quote that is 4X my current policy price by adding my teenager through Allstate, about fell out of my chair. We have NO tickets or accidents in the last 17 years and that was minor ($2k of damage).

I can get a better rate at other companies but other insurance companies will not insure my home because my roof is over 10 years old (even though I have a 50 year warranty roof) so I lose the combined discounts. Insurance is beginning to seem like a mob racket rather than true insurance.

Any suggestions for adding a new teen driver or just pay the price? I also can't assess if he waits to 18 to get his license if that helps at all, just extend his permit driving with adult.
