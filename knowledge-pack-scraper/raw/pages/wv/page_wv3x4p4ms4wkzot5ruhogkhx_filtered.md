# State Farm-Teen Driver-No More Discounts?! New Norm?

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

Currently have State Farm (been with them for 12+ years), and just learned that the defensive driving and good grades no longer available for teen drivers. Just the defensive driving and steer clear.

Is that the new norm for insurance companies?

Trying to obtain as many discounts for my teen driver that he could be available for. Didn't know if it was time to shop around!?!?

ETA: Next best option to shop around to? State Farm was pretty reasonable when I added him, and has been good to work with. Bummed about the news.
