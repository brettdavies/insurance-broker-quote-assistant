# Is it better to insure second car outside of State Farm bundle with a different insurer?

Hello, all you insurance wizards out there! Here's my insurance question of the day! I currently have a bundle (umbrella/auto/home) policy with state farm. Last year, I sold my second car yet my policy premiums didn't adjust to save me money. When I asked for a breakdown of premiums of each policy within the bundle, My agent told me they just asessed my bundle and allocated a premium fee to each type of insurance found in the bundle so that the car insurance on the single vehicle went up and the resulting bundle rate remained the same price. So, as a result, my 15 year old Toyota car insurance is costing me a higher premium than my home insurance in the same bundle. Wow. Thus, my question(s) are as follows: Should I insure my latest car adding it on this bundle? Can I insure this specific second car with a different company? I tried to shop my policy around to other insurance companies but they couldn't come close to the rate I was getting for my current bundle with the umbrella policy. I also worried at the age of 59 that if I cancel my bundle/umbrella policy, I might not be able to get another umbrella policy at my age. What should I do? Does all this look like normal insurance rates and practices?
