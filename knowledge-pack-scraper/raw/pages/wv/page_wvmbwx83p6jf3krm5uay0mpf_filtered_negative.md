He is the one of the highest risk drivers you can insure, it is going to be expensive. Waiting until 18 probably does not change it that much as he is still a male who would just be getting his license.

When our kids got their licenses (at 17), they were automatically added to our auto policies since they were licensed drivers living in our home. I don't recall it ever mentioned that we could exclude them from our policies (not that we would have done so anyways). We just bit the bullet and paid the higher premiums until they got older and got more driving experience.
Now that they are older, insurance really isn't that much more different than it was over 20 years ago when our kids were all under the age of 5. We paid about $300 a month for two cars back then. We are now paying about $650 a month for four cars and one motorcycle.

If you wait until he’s 18 to get his license, you’re just gonna prolong the inevitable. He would still be considered a new driver at 18 years of age so your insurance is still going to drastically increase. You might as well get it over with right now, pay the premium and give him the experience so eventually, his insurance will start to decrease.

> Any suggestions for adding a new teen driver or just pay the price?
Have him get a job and pay the increased premiums. Driving is a privilege, not a right. When he had skin in the game he's more likely to be careful about doing anything that will take more money out of his pocket.

A retired Insurance Claims Manager here. Gosh, I do feel your pain, but in all honesty, the statistics of "at-cause" auto accidents clearly show that young drivers are indeed the highest rated risk for a reason. Just 1 month ago as I was leaving church after Mass at 9:30 am on a bright clear Sunday morning in a small residential town, didn't a 17 year old driver blow past the stop sign and t-boned a car with a middle aged driver, pushing the car up into the church's steps striking a church bystander who just left church. sending both the driver & pedestrian to the hospital in ambulances. The 17 year old had no injuries. Since there were a lot of witnesses to this (myself included), I can assure you that the parents insurance carrier will most likely be paying out their policy limits on this.
There really isn't any escaping the high surcharges for teen drivers I am sad to say.

Licensed agent (not active in sales anymore) currently in Ohio, formerly WA. How many vehicles do you have? Make sure he's rated as a part time driver and if more drivers than vehicles ask that he's not assigned to one. Many carriers will rate the highest risk driver to the higher replacement cost vehicle (symbol) which will jump the overall rate Good student? Bs or better? Carrier may have a good student discount. Traffic safety course? Carrier may offer a discount. Does your carrier offer a driver feedback discount? Via app or computer port, drivers speed, breaking habits, etc are monitored and discounts applied when within their "good" ranges (Progressive calls theirs snapshot, Safeco had "Teensurance") Caveat to this one: you may need to do it with all drivers. Good luck on this! I know it's a tough time. If it helps, boys and girls are no longer rated as differently as they used to be...studies and data show they're both just as risky with boys having aggression & speed issues & girls aggression & distracted driving issues. Lastly, you may want an independent agent to review all your policies and see if you aren't better taken care of elsewhere. Allstate agents work for Allstate, not you. Look for an agency that is part of "the Big I" or "Trusted Choice" networks and find someone with your best interests in mind.

Part time doesn't exist in his state -- NC Bureau requires Inexperienced Operators to be rated on the vehicle they drive the most. (not up to the company to decide), and can't have them as "secondary" (unless there are more drivers than vehicles, but then the secondary class still has the surcharge).

When we added our first teenage driver, Progressive was by far and away the cheapest price and they stayed that way right through our second teenage driver - we just switched off of them this year (my youngest is 21 and other companies have finally started being competitive again). We have always had different companies for home and auto - as people have said, you might be better off paying the increase in your home premium and going with Progressive for your auto because one of their main selling points is cheap rates for young drivers.
That said, I feel your pain on the roof - I just shopped my home (with a 19 year old roof but, like yours, with 50 year shingles) and while I was told "no luck" by several independent agents, on my own I found several companies that were willing to take our roof. I'm in PA, so your mileage may vary, but I got pretty decent home insurance quotes with my 19-year-old roof from American Family through Costco, AAA, and Erie. We ultimately went with Erie, but I don't know if they write in NC - they're only in a few states. If you're a Costco member, I recommend checking out their offerings as for me they were the next-best price to Erie for the homeowners. If you're not a costco member, it might be worth joining depending on how much they'd save you over allstate. <https://www.costco.com/auto-home-insurance-services.html>
Shopping for insurance is a huge pain in the butt and I spent hours on the phone collecting quotes, but overall between our home, auto, and umbrella, we are going to save almost $1500 this year from switching so it's definitely worth the effort. Good luck!

current insurance broker living in + licensed in NC, so all of this is based off my personal experience the last few months:
1: definitely shop your auto insurance, allstate is one of the higher rates going right now (if i get 200 calls in a day, at least 75 of those people are coming from allstate) and i can almost guarantee you’ll find a better rate elsewhere (progressive and geico would be where i personally shop first)
ETA: don’t wait to get him licensed. get him licensed, have him take a safe driving course and get proof of completion, and (if he is one,) get proof of him being a good student (normally 3.0 GPA or higher) - these are discounts you can get to help him not be so expensive for his first three years of driving. you don’t want to wait because regardless of when he is licensed, he is going to be expensive for the first three years he has his license because of the surcharge new/inexperienced drivers receive. he will cost less being on your policy than he will being on his own policy
2: check around for home insurance, but a lot of companies have closed new business in NC due to the hurricanes/floods/wildfires, it’s just so high risk that their prices are more than 300% of NCRB and they cant sell it (specifically talking about progressive here, can’t verify it’s the same for other companies) - if your roof is 10-20 years old, i’d try out safeco, statefarm, and maybe farmers bureau. if it’s older than that, you may not have luck finding another or a cheaper company, but in my opinion it is always worth getting a quote to compare!

Unfortunately young drivers are considered incredibly high risk and will skyrocket your insurance price, especially if you have higher liability limits and nicer cars with full coverage. Insurance companies will assume implied consent and that your kid will drive your cars, and will therefore charge accordingly.
Assuming he is driving your cars as a permit driver, there's not much you can do except pay the premium.

Allstate is getting pummeled in the State at the present moment. I would definitely shop around. He's going to be expensive due to the Inexperienced Operator Surcharge regardless but you can save $$ for sure. It's going to be painful for about three years but the good news is that the first is the worst and it gets easier from there.

> I also can't assess if he waits to 18 to get his license if that helps at all, just extend his permit driving with adult.
That will result in him (or you as the case may be) paying the "inexperienced operator surcharge" for two more years as an adult. (No one will know nor does it legally matter that he actually had two years experience driving with you during that time.)
Actually, the law will change for drivers who do not have a license as of July 1 of this year from three year to EIGHT years of surcharges. You would be making a huge mistake not to get his license before that date if he is old enough.
If you want to use another company, one option would be to get a cheap car for him, then you can get liability only wherever its cheapest, and keep your full coverage bundled with your homeowner.

16 year olds do stupid things.
16 year old girls do stupid things that usually don't get people killed. 16 year old boys do stupid things that can get people killed. Insurance companies charge you for your son's youthful stupidity. I used to be a 16 year old boy a long time ago. Why I didn't die was just pure chance.
The way to pay less for your son's auto-insurance is to celebrate his 26th birthday.
As for now, show him the bill and make him get a weekend job to pay the difference. He'll respect the car more. Good luck.
