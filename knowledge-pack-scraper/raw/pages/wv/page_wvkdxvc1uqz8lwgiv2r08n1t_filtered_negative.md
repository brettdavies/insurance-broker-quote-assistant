The average cost of home insurance in the U.S. is $1,951 annually for $350,000 dwelling coverage. That’s a 16% increase over the previous year’s average home insurance rates, based on our analysis.
Our research found that lower coverage limits saw a slightly higher rate increase this year than higher limits.
## How Much Is Homeowners Insurance?
**The average homeowners insurance costs range between $1,348 and $3,496 per year** depending on the amount of [dwelling insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage/), according to Forbes Advisor’s analysis.
We analyzed rates across the nation to find the average cost of homeowners insurance. Your exact price will depend on specific personal details, such as the location and age of your house and the coverage limits you choose. However, our analysis can give you an idea of what you might expect to pay.
When figuring out the [best homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) for you, make sure to properly cover your biggest assets—your home and belongings.
Your dwelling coverage limit should match the amount it would cost to rebuild your house. The higher your rebuilding costs, the higher your limit and the cost of your homeowners insurance.

## Average Cost of Homeowners Insurance by Deductible Amount
**The average cost of home insurance is $1,949 per year for a $350,000 dwelling limit with a $500 deductible,** according to our analysis. Home insurance costs vary depending on the deductible that you choose. Home insurance deductible options typically range from $250 to $2,500.
A [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible/) is the amount your insurance company subtracts from a claim payment.

A homeowners insurance deductible applies when you make a home insurance claim for property damage. The deductible does not apply if someone makes a liability home insurance claim against you.
## Why Have Home Insurance Premiums Gone Up?
Inflation, rising building costs and severe weather have led to cost hikes in recent years as the cost of repairing and replacing homes has increased.
The cost to rebuild a home has a direct impact on home insurance rates. If building costs increase, insurance companies pay more to rebuild homes and they pass those higher costs onto customers.
This can happen when there’s high inflation, which increases the cost for materials. It may also happen in times of higher building costs. This could happen following major storms like a hurricane. Greater demand to rebuild homes in an area can result in higher building costs and insurance rates.
## Will Home Insurance Rates Go Up in the Future?
Homeowners insurance rates have been on the rise and there’s no reason to believe that’s going to change.
In addition to higher building costs and inflation in recent years, tariffs are another potential cost driver that may result in higher home insurance rates. Building materials and equipment purchased from other countries may have higher price tags than before. Customers will wind up paying higher rates to help offset those costs.
## Factors Affecting Home Insurance Rates
There are many factors insurance companies usually use to determine home insurance rates, including:
---|---
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Documents@2x.svg)
### **Claims History for Property and You**
Both your claims history and the property’s history affect costs. That includes claims filed even before you bought the house.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/money@2x-1.svg)
### **Cost To Rebuild Home**
The cost to rebuild your home decides on how much dwelling coverage you need, which helps dictate your homeowners insurance costs.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Review-policy@2x-1.svg)
### **Coverage and Policy Limits**
Your dwelling coverage limit and other limits you choose for liability and your possessions influence how much you pay for home insurance.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Deductible.svg)
### **Deductible**
The deductible is the amount subtracted from your claims payment if you file a claim. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. If you choose a higher deductible, make sure you have enough in savings to cover that amount.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/House-on-fire@2x.svg)
### **Fire Rating**
There are some factors that you can’t do anything about, such as fire rating. A home’s fire rating is related to the location, such as how close your home is to a fire hydrant and a fire department.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house@2x.svg)
### **House’s Age and Materials**
Older homes generally cost more to insure than new construction. The home’s building materials, such as wood, stone or brick, may also play a role in costs.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Location@2x.svg)
### **Location**
Your location and the claims history of the area affect your costs. Many claims, including fire and theft, influence the home insurance costs for the area.
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Credit-score@2x.svg)
### **Your Credit**
Nearly all states allow home insurers to use your credit history when setting rates. The only states that don’t allow it are California, Maryland and Massachusetts.

### Bundle Auto and Home Policies
Try to save by bundling both auto and homeowners/property insurance. That also gives you greater protection from being dropped because the insurance company would lose both policies.

### Look for Savings But Maintain Enough Dwelling Coverage
Consider reducing or eliminating coverage other than dwelling coverage, if absolutely necessary. I do not encourage homeowners to ever consider reducing their dwelling coverage, but if a homeowner is truly pinched by price, and the insurer is willing to consider reducing or eliminating anything other than dwelling, then that is a discussion that (reluctantly) may be necessary.

### Raise Your Deductible
Raising your deductible is one change you can make to save money. Our analysis of home insurance deductibles found that if you bump up your deductible from $500 to $1,000 or higher it will lower your rates by over $100 annually on average, so you get a lower [home insurance premium](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-is-a-homeowners-insurance-premium/). But you also take on more of the financial burden if you file a claim.

### Ask About Home Insurance Discounts
Don’t assume your home insurance company is automatically giving you all the discounts you qualify for. I’ve seen that asking for a review of [home insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/find-discounts/) is an excellent way to possibly reduce your home insurance costs. For example, adding smart home technologies or a home security system can earn a discount.
