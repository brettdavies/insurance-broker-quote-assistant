#  Is it better to insure second car outside of State Farm bundle with a different insurer? 
Hello, all you insurance wizards out there! Here's my insurance question of the day! I currently have a bundle (umbrella/auto/home) policy with state farm. Last year, I sold my second car yet my policy premiums didn't adjust to save me money. When I asked for a breakdown of premiums of each policy within the bundle, My agent told me they just asessed my bundle and allocated a premium fee to each type of insurance found in the bundle so that the car insurance on the single vehicle went up and the resulting bundle rate remained the same price. So, as a result, my 15 year old Toyota car insurance is costing me a higher premium than my home insurance in the same bundle. Wow. Thus, my question(s) are as follows: Should I insure my latest car adding it on this bundle? Can I insure this specific second car with a different company? I tried to shop my policy around to other insurance companies but they couldn't come close to the rate I was getting for my current bundle with the umbrella policy. I also worried at the age of 59 that if I cancel my bundle/umbrella policy, I might not be able to get another umbrella policy at my age. What should I do? Does all this look like normal insurance rates and practices?

Pissing away the multi car discount is purely a personal preference.

You'll usually get a better rate bundling everything together due to multi policy discounts. Some companies may not even write your auto(s) unless you insure your home with them as well, or vice versa. Your umbrella might require it as well. Not sure why you think turning 59 is going to affect your eligibility for an umbrella.

If you insured the second car with a different company your umbrella will increase. There is a 50% surcharge if all autos are not with SF

There are a lot of questions here. First thing, we you removed the second car, you most likely lost the discount for having more than one vehicle, so if you add a new car on, you should receive that discount again for having more than one vehicle. As for insuring the second vehicle with a policy separate from State Farm, you can do that, but there is a possibility that your current umbrella policy would not extend to a vehicle outside of State Farm. It could be possible to list the outside State Farm policy on the umbrella, but they also might charge an additional surcharge for the policy outside the company or decline to cover it. Only way to know for sure is to ask. 
Not sure why you think you would not be able to get a new umbrella because of your age, it is not a life insurance policy, rates are based on the risk of household members and the underlying policies. 
From your description, yes, this all seems normal.

I've read that with any increase in age, there is a greater likelyhood of accidents or negligence. So the risk assessment advises them not offer me a policy as my age increases. Also, I read that once you cancel, they might not let you back in on a policy. Is that some paranoid crap or what?

Risks can change with age sure, but they take that into account when determining the rate. Personally I have only had an application for an umbrella declined because of claim history with too many claims in the past 5 years.

Lawyer here (not your lawyer). I have sued every auto carrier. Insure every vehicle you own with the same carrier on the same policy. State Farm is in my opinion an awful carrier. Go elsewhere. If you are seriously injured by an uninsured driver you will wish you can Geico, progressive or Liberty Mutual.

Most other insurers won't insure just one of your vehicles. One of the underwriting questions for all of my companies is "are all vehicles owned by the insured covered under this policy?" if the answer is no you aren't eligible (barring the other vehicle is like a classic or antique). 
State Farm is goofy how they do separate policies for different vehicles. 
as for eligibility you would be eligible even if you cancelled your policies as long as your loss history isn't bad. Your rates will typically go up but they can't deny you a policy just because your older.
