## How much is home insurance?
The national average cost of home insurance is $2,408 per year for a policy with a $300,000 dwelling limit. This comes out to about $201 per month. But these are just average figures — what _you_ pay for your policy will likely be different. Just as coverage needs vary across individual homeowners, so will costs. Factors like the location, age and square footage of your home, the deductibles and policy limits you choose and the cost of building materials (to name just a few) are also part of the equation. If you have a loan on your home, your mortgage lender may also get a say in what home insurance coverage is required and [whether or not you need a flood policy](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-much-flood-insurance-do-i-need/).
### Key insights from Bankrate's 2025 home insurance rates analysis
  * On average, the most expensive states for homeowners insurance are Nebraska, Louisiana and Florida, while the least expensive states are Vermont, Delaware and Alaska.
  * While inflation has slowed down since its peak, insurance rates are reactionary. The cost of home insurance is still increasing due to the impact inflation has had on the previous losses experienced by the insurance company, the elevated cost of building materials and the high likelihood of future extreme weather-related losses.
  * According to our research, Selective, CSE and NYCM offer some of the lowest average home insurance rates for $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
  * On average, homeowners with poor credit histories pay 137 percent more for home insurance than homeowners with excellent credit.

### What are the five most expensive states for homeowners insurance? 
The states with the most expensive average annual home insurance premiums are Nebraska, Louisiana, Florida, Oklahoma and Kansas. In each of these states, the average price of home insurance exceeds $4,000 per year, and in the two most expensive states — Nebraska and Louisiana — homeowners pay over $5,000 per year, on average. The higher rates are likely due to a higher risk of widespread home damage from natural disasters.

Bankrate insight
The threat of natural disasters plays a significant role in determining your home insurance cost. Think about it this way: after a severe weather event, it’s likely that many homeowners will file a claim for storm-related damage. To make sure there is enough money in reserve to handle a large volume of claims, insurers tend to charge more expensive rates to homeowners in high-risk weather areas. Knowing the weather-related risks associated with your state and ZIP code can help you make informed home insurance decisions.

Other location-specific rate factors
Geographic location typically impacts your insurance rates because every area of the country has a different risk level for damage. Some areas may have a higher risk of wind damage, while other areas often sustain damage from fires. According to the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I), structure fires caused approximately $48.88 million in residential property damage in 2023.
There have been a significant number of wildfires thus far in 2025, most notably leaving a devastating impact on tens of thousands of acres in California. Insurance companies assess these location-specific risks when determining premiums. Homes in areas prone to wildfires may face higher insurance costs or difficulty obtaining coverage.
Additional location-specific rate factors include:
  * **Weather- and location-related risks:** Standard homeowners policies generally [do not cover flood damage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) or damage from earthquakes. In fact, some insurance companies do not cover homes in flood zones at all. Other insurance companies sell private flood insurance or offer earthquake coverage as standalone policies or optional endorsements.
  * **Property crime risk:** If your home is in a neighborhood prone to frequent crime, like vandalism and break-ins, it could be considered [high risk](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/), which can negatively impact your insurance rates. Depending on the discounts available from your insurance carrier, installing additional safety features in your home, such as deadbolts and a security alarm system, may help you offset the higher premium.


## How much does home insurance cost by company?
By and large, home insurance companies all look at the same factors, like location, claim history and square footage to price your policy. It's how companies weigh those factors that varies, which is why it's so important to compare quotes.
For instance, some home insurance companies may use the age of your roof as a strong rating factor while others are more concerned with your home's proximity to the fire department.
Below, our insurance editorial team has listed average rates from some of the most prominent insurance companies. To help you pinpoint the [cheapest home insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/) for your coverage needs, our table includes average insurance rates for policies with a $300K, $350K and $450K dwelling coverage limit.

## Home insurance rating factors
The purpose of insurance is to transfer the bulk of financial risk to another entity (an insurance company) to make a potential loss more manageable for the policyholder. In simpler terms, it’s cheaper to pay insurance premiums than it is to rebuild your home from the ground up. Factors that increase or decrease the amount of risk the insurance company assumes can heavily influence insurance premiums. Understanding the most influential [factors that impact your home insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/) may help you save money when purchasing a new home or starting a policy with a new insurance provider.

### Average home insurance cost by dwelling coverage amount
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage/) — also known as coverage A — is the limit your insurance company will pay to repair or rebuild your home’s physical structure when damaged by a [covered peril](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-an-insurance-peril/). Having the appropriate level of coverage may help financially protect one of your biggest financial assets. If you have a mortgage on your home, your financial lender may have certain minimum dwelling coverage requirements you must fulfill as a condition of your loan.
It is also important to note that other [parts of your insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-read-a-home-insurance-policy/), such as other structures, personal property and loss of use — typically listed as coverage B, C and D, respectively — are usually based on percentages of the dwelling coverage. For example, if you have $200,000 worth of insurance for dwelling coverage, you probably have $20,000 or 10 percent of coverage A allotted for other structures coverage. Depending on your state, you may also have separate deductibles for wind or other storm damage. That additional deductible will also likely be calculated as a percentage of your dwelling coverage.
While selecting lower coverage limits may save you some money on your policy premium, it may undercut the coverage you need throughout the rest of your policy. The proprietary rate data below highlights how dwelling coverage limits affect average homeowners premiums.

Bankrate’s take: Check your dwelling coverage limit before your policy renews
The amount of dwelling coverage you need may change from year to year. In a high-inflation environment, the cost of construction materials usually becomes more expensive. You could find that your dwelling coverage limit is not enough to fully rebuild your home when you account for the newer, [higher cost of rebuild materials](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/rising-construction-costs-leaving-you-uninsured/). You can consult with a licensed agent when your policy comes up for renewal to ensure you are fully protected. Depending on your insurance company, it could be more cost-effective to add an inflation guard or extended dwelling endorsement to your policy in lieu of raising your coverage limits.
### Average home insurance cost by credit tier
In most states, your credit history could be used as an insurance rating factor. Depending on where you live, home insurance companies will generally review your credit history when you apply for a quote. This is because credit can be an indicator of risk — insurance actuarial data show that those with lower credit scores tend to file more claims compared to those with higher credit scores. As a result, [home insurance for people with bad credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/bad-credit/) is generally more expensive compared to those with average, good and excellent credit. If you own your home with a partner, their credit history may also impact your rates.
Not all states factor in credit, however. California, Hawaii, Maryland and Massachusetts do not allow the use of credit for insurance rating purposes.

Does marital status impact home insurance rates?
For both home and auto insurance, carriers usually place shoppers who are married or in a recognized domestic partnership in a lower-risk group. This is because married couples tend to file fewer claims. Therefore, may receive slightly lower premiums. 
However, if your spouse has other personal rating factors that may negatively impact your rates, like a poor credit history, owning and insuring a home together may increase your premium. If homeowners divorce and update their policies, their insurance rates may change for several reasons, including individual rating factors and the change in marital status itself. If the change in marital status impacts the premium, you likely won’t see any changes until your policy renews.
### Average home insurance cost by claims history
Damaging events can happen to even the most responsible homeowner. If your home was damaged by an event covered by your policy, like wind, fire or theft, or someone sues you for injuries sustained at your residence, your home insurance policy could step in to cover the damages. However, when you file a claim, you can usually expect your insurance premium to increase when your policy renews.
Sometimes, you don't even need to be the one who filed the claim for it to affect your insurance policy. Home insurance companies consider a property's loss history when pricing a policy, and those with recurring issues will likely be more expensive to insure. You can check your home's claim history with a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, or [CLUE](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/clue-report/), report. That way, you can address any issues before they become an insurance claim.

Wind |  $13,511 |  $2,548

Why claims prior owners filed matter
A [Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/clue-report/), or CLUE, report can tell you about claims filed by previous owners of your home. Knowing that your guest room sink is prone to leaking or that your backyard shed has been broken into can help you stay one step ahead of potential claims-causing incidents.
### Average home insurance cost by deductible amount
Your [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/) is another factor that can impact the cost of your home insurance. Generally, the higher your deductible, the lower your rate. When you set a high deductible, you take on more of the risk that would otherwise be transferred to your homeowners insurance company. In turn, your carrier will usually offer you a cheaper premium.
A high deductible usually means higher out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a covered claim, so choosing a deductible you can comfortably pay with no warning is essential. While selecting a high deductible can be a valid cost-saving measure for some homeowners, others might experience financial hardship if they need to file a claim and can’t afford their deductible. Additionally, your lender may issue maximum deductible limits under the terms of your loan.
To provide a baseline, below you’ll find average rates for some of the most common home insurance deductible amounts:

### Average home insurance cost by home age
The age of your home is also a factor that home insurance companies consider when determining your premium. Older homes might be more expensive to build back after a loss, especially if you need to bring them up to modern safety and building codes. Plus, an older home is more likely to be built with harder-to-source materials, which can also make repairs more expensive. Below is a look at how much an average home insurance policy might cost depending on the age of a home.

### Average home insurance cost by home characteristics
Every home is different, which means insurance companies rate each home on a case-by-case basis. Your home’s specific characteristics will play a role in determining your homeowners insurance costs.
  * **Roof condition** : The age and condition of a home's roof impact the cost of home insurance rates. Insurance companies can charge more for a home with an older roof since it is more susceptible to windstorms and hail damage than a newer one. Some providers have age restrictions and only offer insurance to homeowners with roofs under a certain age, usually between 15 and 20 years old or newer. Roofs beyond 20 years old can typically qualify for actual cash value coverage, which is more affordable but has a lower claim payout.
  * **Construction****materials** : Roofs and exterior walls constructed of materials with higher fire ratings or are more wind resistant, like metal roofs or brick structures, may qualify the policy for additional discounts. On the other hand, special features, like a cedar shingle roof, marble tile or antique woodwork can have higher replacement value due to the cost of materials, availability and the skilled labor needed for repairs.
  * **Increased liability concerns** : Attractive nuisances like [swimming pools](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/pools-insurance/), trampolines and even playground equipment can increase your liability as a homeowner. If you have any of these features, your insurance company can raise your rate to account for the additional risk and require additional safety measures, such as a fence with a lock. Certain [dog breeds](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dog-breed-restrictions/) can also be a liability risk that results in a higher premium. Some insurance providers require dogs to complete a certified training course to lower the risk of a dog bite lawsuit.


## How to estimate the cost of insurance
Ultimately, the goal of home insurance is to restore your home and property to a pre-loss state. The best way to [estimate your home insurance cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-calculator/) is by getting an accurate account of how much coverage you need in the event of a total loss and evaluating your level of risk. To calculate how much coverage you need, you will need the following information:
  * The [replacement cost value (RCV)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rcv-vs-acv/) of your home
  * The replacement cost of any detached structures on your property, such as sheds, fences and garages
  * The cost to replace your personal property, including any items not permanently attached to your home (e.g., clothing, furniture, appliances, electronics and so on. Creating a [home inventory](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/creating-home-inventory/) can help with this.


Next, consider other risks like liability concerns or potential physical hazards. Reviewing coverage concerns with your agent, along with estimates of the values noted above, will help an insurer produce a more accurate estimate for you when requesting quotes.
Lightbulb Icon
Keep in mind
Here are some talking points you can keep in mind when speaking with your agent. Having specific questions ready ahead of time will help your agent quickly identify the appropriate endorsements and liability limits. 
  * Do you have a dog?
  * Do you have a swimming pool, trampoline or any other attractive nuisance on your property?
  * Do you frequently entertain guests in your home?
  * Do you have a home-based business?
  * Do you have any personal items or collections that need special coverage, such as jewelry, art, furs or valuable stamps?
  * Do you live in a moderate- to high-risk area prone to floods, earthquakes or wildfires?
  * Have you upgraded or replaced your roof recently?

## Home insurance industry trends
Generally, home and auto insurance premiums have been increasing post-pandemic, partly due to inflation. As building material prices and labor costs [continue to rise](https://www.us.jll.com/en/newsroom/us-and-canada-construction-industry-poised-for-growth), home insurance carriers must raise premiums to cover increased claims expenses.
Also, according to Triple-I, the effects of climate change may [directly impact home insurance costs](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-climate-change-and-insurance-issues). Damage from wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods costs more each year, causing some insurance companies to limit their coverage in high-risk areas or [raise rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rising-cost-extreme-weather/). The [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/) recorded 60 natural disasters over the past three years that caused over $1 billion in damage each. After adjusting for inflation, damage from billion-dollar disasters from the past three years averages out to $149.2 billion per year.

Recent news:
Bankrate's insurance editorial team closely tracks news events and industry trends in the insurance market. Here are some of our recent learnings:
  * The outlook for 2025 points to continued challenges in the homeowners insurance market, with premiums expected to rise further due to inflation, increasing claims costs and escalating natural disasters. High-risk states like California, Florida and parts of the Southeast will likely face even steeper rates as insurers adjust to the growing impact of natural disasters and rising reinsurance costs. Emerging technologies and regulatory efforts may offer some relief, but the industry’s evolving landscape will require homeowners to remain proactive about their coverage.
  * Before diving deeper into 2025, let’s take a quick look at how we got here. Between 2020 and 2022, replacement costs for homes soared by 55 percent, fueled by post-pandemic inflation and supply chain disruptions. In addition, natural disaster losses have increased tenfold since the 1980s. Showcasing the impact of these issues, in 2023 the [industry's underwriting ratio](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/5/us-homeowners-insurers-net-combined-ratio-surges-past-110-81711947) was 110.5 percent, meaning that for every $1 insurance companies earned, they paid out about $1.11 in claims and expenses. This marked the worst year for underwriting since 2011.
  * The effects of these trends became more pronounced in 2024, with property insurers nationwide raising rates to compensate for the increased claims. North Carolina, for example, had to reach a [settlement to increase premiums by 15 percent over two years](https://www.ncdoi.gov/news/press-releases/2025/01/17/commissioner-causey-negotiates-settlement-rate-bureaus-homeowners-insurance-request) (7.5 percent each year), while other states saw insurers reduce or withdraw coverage entirely from high-risk areas. These compounding factors have left many homeowners underinsured or turning to high-cost, high-risk insurance pools, which could set the stage for an unpredictable and costly year ahead.
  * The [U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2791) released a report on Jan. 16, 2025, highlighting that homeowners insurance is becoming more expensive and less accessible nationwide due to escalating climate-related events. Analyzing data from over 246 million policies between 2018 and 2022, the report found that average premiums increased 8.7 percent faster than inflation. Notably, homeowners in the top 20 percent of ZIP codes at highest risk for climate-related perils paid 82 percent more in premiums compared to those in the lowest-risk areas. The report also indicated higher policy nonrenewal rates and increased insurer costs in high-risk regions. The recent devastating wildfires in Los Angeles underscore the urgency of addressing these challenges. Former Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen emphasized the pressing need for policymakers to understand and mitigate the financial impacts of such natural disasters on American homeowners.​


## **Industry experts weigh in**

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  Is home insurance cheaper if you pay monthly?
Caret Down Icon
While this can vary between insurance companies, homeowners insurance can be cheaper when paid in full at the time of purchase and each renewal instead of monthly installments. When insurance payments are broken down into installments, most companies apply monthly service fees ranging from $5 to over $10 more. However, many insurance companies offer paid-in-full discounts and eliminate service fees when the entire amount is paid in full. Keep in mind that if your homeowners insurance is [escrowed with your mortgage](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/what-is-mortgage-escrow/#:~:text=Once%20you%20become%20a%20homeowner,must%20manage%20the%20escrow%20account.), your insurance is likely being paid in full each year. 
  * ###  Why did my home insurance go up?
Caret Down Icon
Home insurance premiums can change for a number of reasons. If you change your coverage, like adding an endorsement or increasing a coverage limit, your premium will likely change. Endorsements can cost anywhere from a few dozen dollars to hundreds of dollars per year, depending on the coverage type and limits you buy. If you [file a claim](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-go-up-after-a-claim/) during your policy term, you could see an increase in your premium at your renewal. Depending on the severity of your claim, the cause of the damage and the underlying factors on your policy, you may see anywhere from a modest to a substantial increase in premium after a claim.
You may see premium increases at your policy renewal even when you haven’t changed your coverage. Insurance companies often adjust your coverage limits to keep pace with inflation, which helps to ensure your home is still properly covered when things get more expensive. This can increase your premium. Your company may also have filed a rate change with your state’s Department of Insurance, which could then affect the price you pay for coverage.
  * ###  Does my home insurance cost affect my mortgage payment?
Caret Down Icon
Probably. Most mortgages are set up with an escrow account, which means that the mortgage company collects a portion of your home insurance premiums (and your property taxes) in your monthly payment. These amounts will be saved in your escrow account and the mortgage company will then pay your home insurance and property taxes when they come due. Mortgage escrow accounts are very common. A more expensive home insurance policy will mean that your mortgage company needs to collect more money from you monthly, so your mortgage payment could be higher. However, keep in mind that the portion of your [monthly mortgage payment](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator/) that is earmarked for home insurance doesn't affect the principal or interest on your mortgage loan.
  * ###  What is the 80 percent rule in homeowners insurance?
Caret Down Icon
The 80 percent rule, also known as the 80/20 home insurance rule and the coinsurance clause,
If a home experiences a loss and is insured for less than 80 percent, insurance companies only pay the claim based on the percentage of coverage held, divided by the amount needed to be covered at 80 percent. Some home insurance companies require carrying more than 80 percent to qualify for a policy. 
**Here is the 80 percent rule equation:**_Amount of loss X (coverage you have / coverage you should have) = claim amount – deductible = claim payout_
  * ###  What is inflation guard coverage?
Caret Down Icon
Many home insurance companies have inflation guard coverage built into policies or policyholders may have the option to purchase it as an endorsement. Upon each renewal, the inflation guard coverage ensures that the replacement cost of the dwelling increases to account for rising labor and building material costs. While this coverage can be highly beneficial, it does cause the premium to increase since it provides more coverage. But, it could prevent you from becoming underinsured.
  * ###  What should I do if my home insurance was nonrenewed?
Caret Down Icon
[Home insurance nonrenewals](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-canceled/) happen for many reasons. Perhaps your homeowners insurance company decides it will not renew your policy unless you make certain home repairs. Or, maybe your company can no longer offer you a policy due to a change in your claims history. If you live in a state with a struggling homeowners insurance market, your current carrier could even be facing insolvency, resulting in a nonrenewal. Regardless of the reason, it’s important to maintain a line of communication between you and your agent. A meeting with your agent could help you understand the reasons for your nonrenewal (and mitigate it, if possible). Additionally, your agent may be able to give you advice about finding [homeowners insurance after a nonrenewal](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/get-home-insurance-after-non-renewal/), if your nonrenewal is inevitable.
