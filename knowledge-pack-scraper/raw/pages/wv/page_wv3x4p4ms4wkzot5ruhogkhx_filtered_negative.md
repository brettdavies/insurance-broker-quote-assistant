Their new auto product no longer has a [good student discount](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+good+student+discount&cId=6b299916-02ce-4a06-966a-8de52df76747&iId=e3f1ba37-7b6d-4be1-9c17-1c040116dde6). It isn't out in all states yet, but it'll get to everyone eventually.
They are basically eliminating almost any discount that has administative upkeep or needs agents to follow up and verify. If they can't pull it in a third party vendor report, they aren't using it.

Does this mean at renewal there could be a price increase even though no changes (no tickets or accidents)?

In theory, yes. The new rating model is a giant black box, so it's hard to know how they're rating youthful drivers now.
Anecdotally, we've seen that in a lot of cases rates are going down, at least initially. They're going to identify a lot of teen drivers that parents or shady agents were keeping off the policy, and that'll help them rate appropriately.
They're probably going to push telematics even harder, especially for teen drivers.

Maybe. Depends on the math but let’s say they need $10 in premium from 4 teens. Two had the discount and 2 didn’t. The two with the discount paid $2 and the other two paid $3. Now they still need $10. Could everyone pay $2.5 or do they weigh other factors and adjust accordingly? We will see.

I was told the same here in North Carolina. There are no discounts for teen drivers.

Schools started handing out good grades like candy, not a surprise insurers can't use them to differentiate students anymore.

All of my carriers still offer the good student discount. Surprised to see they no longer offer it, that's a big one. Wouldn't hurt to shop it.

Do you have a recommendation? State Farm was pretty reasonable when I added him so a bummer we can't do these other discounts.

I work for an agent at state farm and it is still here in PA. Every state could be different though so it’s tough to say. Are you sending them the report cards?

It's modernization/policy center. It's just getting to GA so we just had a crash course in the differences.
Most of the boss' book of business is MD/DC. We in the office are dreading it arriving. Policy holders are going to freak.

You might try Farmers. I'm in OK and just switched to them and the auto policy was significantly lower than my previous carrier.

As an agent I'd rather my clients save as much money as possible as to not look into [switching carriers](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+switching+carriers&cId=2602104e-68b3-41d7-add7-e7fd3a784568&iId=72d9a4a2-3ea7-4a1c-94ea-c816b20d05e3) than I am about getting an extra $100 off of someone. Any decent agent would think this way.
I mean an extra $100 in commission may only be like $7 more in my pocket depending on the carrier, could be even less. Not worth it.
