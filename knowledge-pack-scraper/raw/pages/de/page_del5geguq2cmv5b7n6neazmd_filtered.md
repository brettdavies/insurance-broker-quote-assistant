* Taking a defensive driving course may lead to a discount through some insurance companies.
* In addition to a potential discount, the knowledge learned through AARP’s Smart Driver course might help you stay safe on the road.
* Before signing up for a defensive driving course, make sure that your insurance company offers a discount for the particular course you want to take.

Many insurance companies offer discounts to drivers who take AARP or AAA courses. Depending on the insurer, you might save an average of 5% to 10% on your premiums.  Although you might tap into a discount, completing a defensive driving course has additional benefits.

“It’s actually always a good idea to take a defensive driving course, even if it doesn’t directly result in an insurance premium discount,” says Benjamin Bruinekool, principal at Western Michigan Insurance Agency, LLC. “A lot of accidents could have been avoided if one of the parties had reacted differently, even if it wasn’t their fault. A defensive driving course can help one prepare for these instances and avoid potential injury or damage to their vehicle and subsequent insurance claims.”

## Understanding the AARP Safe Driver Program

The AARP Safe Driver program is available to drivers looking to improve their defensive driving skills. As an AARP member, you can save 20% when taking the physical classroom course or 10% when you take the online course.

The program covers many details, including the following:

* Facts about the effects of medication on driving
* How to reduce distractions
* How to maintain an appropriate following distance
* Proper use of safety features in modern vehicles
* Savvy techniques for handling everyday situations
* How to handle age-related physical changes in relation to your driving

The goal is to help you stay safe on the road as you age.

### Eligibility for the AARP Safe Driver Program

The AARP discount is specifically designed for drivers aged 50 and older. Although you don’t have to be an AARP member to sign up for the course, AARP members get a discount on either the classroom or online experience.

## How the AARP Safe Driver Program can save you money

If you complete the AARP Safe Driver program, you can present your certificate of completion to your insurance company for a potential discount. Many insurers will honor your commitment to safe driving with a discounted premium.

According to the program, 92% of participants redeemed their course certificate for a discount.

### Is the AARP Safe Driver Program discount available for everyone?

Yes, anyone can sign up for the AARP Safe Driver program. However, AARP members receive a discount on course purchases.

Additionally, the course is geared toward drivers who are 50 or older. But, technically, anyone can sign up to take the course.

## GEICO discounts for defensive drivers

GEICO generally offers discounts to policyholders who successfully complete a driver improvement or defensive driver class and meet certain other requirements. In most states, you must be 50 or 55 before the discount can be applied for taking a driver safety class.

GEICO accepts AAA and AARP courses in some states for a discount. They are listed differently on the GEICO application as there are different qualifications to comply with for the discounts.

GEICO will apply a safe driver discount to your car insurance policy in many states if you meet all criteria required and successfully complete a driver improvement course. Here are a few examples from various states of the types of classes accepted and the discount you can get:

* If you live in California, GEICO says you could save up to 5% on applicable coverages by taking a defensive driving course. To be eligible for this discount in California, you must have voluntarily completed a defensive driving course meeting the standards established by the National Safety Council (NSC).
* Florida drivers can save up to 10% on applicable coverages by voluntarily completing a defensive driving course that meets the standards established by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Online defensive driving courses offered by the National Safety Council and the American Safety Council (United Safety Council) will work in Florida.
* In Texas, you can save up to 10% if you have voluntarily completed a Defensive Driver Course, Professional Driver Course, or Instructor’s Course approved by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), including the State Board of Education or the Commissioner of Education, the National Safety Council and/or the American Safety Council.
* In Pennsylvania, to get up to a 10% discount, you have to voluntarily complete a defensive driving course meeting the standards established by the PA Department of Transportation.

Many auto insurance companies also offer a [good driver discount](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/good-driver-discount.aspx) that you might qualify for.

### Do all insurance companies offer discounts for completing the AARP Safe Driver Program?

Although most insurance companies offer a discount for taking a defensive driving course, it’s best to confirm a discount with your insurer before signing up.

“If an insured is interested in determining whether or not a defensive driver course will result in a premium discount, the best thing for them to do is reach out to their agent,” Bruinekool says. “Insurance providers are often adding new discounts, and it’s quite possible that completing a defensive driving course has been added to the list of available discounts.”
