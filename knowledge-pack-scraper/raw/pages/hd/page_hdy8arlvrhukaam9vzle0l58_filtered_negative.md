![False advertising is not just an annoyance; it undermines trust and creates real harm for consumers and competitors.](https://patentlawip.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Can-You-Sue-Someone-for-False-Advertising-in-California-scaled.jpg)
False advertising occurs when a business makes deceptive claims about its products or services, leading to consumer or competitor harm. In California, the law—particularly the [Unfair Competition Law (UCL)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=7.&chapter=5.&part=2.&lawCode=BPC) and the False Advertising Law (FAL)—prohibits businesses from misleading consumers through false or misleading statements. Particularly, [Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17500.&lawCode=BPC) prohibits from making any statement concerning the business’s products or services which is untrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading.
2. **Errors and Omissions (E &O) Insurance**: Covers professional liability, including misrepresentation claims.
