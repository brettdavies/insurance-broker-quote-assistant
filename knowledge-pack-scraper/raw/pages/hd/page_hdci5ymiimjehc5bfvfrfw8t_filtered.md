## Average home insurance cost by dwelling coverage amount

One of the biggest factors in how much your homeowners policy costs is how much dwelling coverage you need. [Dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) is the part of your policy that pays to rebuild the structure of your home if it’s damaged or destroyed.

If your house is large or has high-end features, it’ll cost more to rebuild and you’ll need more dwelling coverage. Below are average home insurance costs for four amounts of coverage.

| Dwelling coverage amount | Average annual insurance cost |
| --- | --- |
| $200,000 | $1,555 |
| $300,000 | $2,110 |
| $400,000 | $2,655 |
| $500,000 | $3,210 |

## Average homeowners insurance cost by home age

Older homes often cost more to insure than new ones because they typically don’t have the safety features that newer homes do, and repairs can be costly. See below to compare the average annual cost of insuring a new home versus an older home. (Coverage limits were the same for all three houses.)

| Year home was built | Average annual insurance cost |
| --- | --- |
| 1955 | $2,110 |
| 1984 | $2,110 |
| 2024 | $1,220 |

## Average homeowners insurance cost by deductible

A [home insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible) is the amount of a claim you pay before your insurance kicks in. Typically, a higher deductible leads to a lower home insurance rate.

| $1,000 deductible | $2,500 deductible | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $2,110 | $1,865 | -12% |

Back to top

## Average homeowners insurance cost by claims history

If you have previous [homeowners insurance claims](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims), insurers may see you as a higher risk and increase your premiums as a result. Here’s how filing a claim could affect your homeowners insurance costs.

| No claims | 1 claim | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $2,110 | $2,305 | 9% |

Back to top

## Average homeowners insurance cost by credit

Studies have shown that people with poor credit are more likely to file claims, so in most states, homeowners with poor credit are likely to pay more for home insurance. Read more about the impact of [credit scores on home insurance rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/credit-score-home-insurance-rates).

(Note that using credit to set homeowners insurance prices is not allowed in California, Maryland or Massachusetts.)

| Good credit | Poor credit | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $2,110 | $3,620 | 72% |

Back to top

## Other factors that impact the cost of home insurance

Your home insurance premiums will also be affected by these factors:

* Your location. Being closer to a fire station can lower your premiums, while living in a neighborhood with higher crime rates may increase them.
* Your risk of natural disasters. If you live in an area that’s vulnerable to [wildfire](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/wildfire-insurance), [tornadoes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-tornado-damage) or [hurricanes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/hurricane-insurance), home insurance may be more expensive.
* Extra features. Swimming pools and [trampolines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/trampoline-home-insurance) may be fun for the family, but some insurers see them as potential liability claims and may charge more to insure your home as a result.
* Your dog. Some insurers may charge extra for animal liability coverage, while others won't cover breeds they consider to be higher risk or dogs with a history of aggression. Read more about [dogs and home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-cover-dog-bites).

## Why is home insurance getting more expensive?

If your home insurance premiums have gone up in recent years, you’re not alone. A majority of U.S. homeowners (54%) report that their insurance premiums have increased in the past 12 months, according to a 2025 NerdWallet survey of more than 1,300 U.S. homeowners, conducted online by The Harris Poll. Premiums have been on the rise for several years, thanks to a combination of inflation and natural disasters.

Inflation doesn't just affect gas and food prices. Homeowners insurance rates are going up because it's gotten more expensive to repair and rebuild houses after they're damaged. That's why you may see a higher homeowners premium at your next renewal, even if you haven't filed any recent claims.

Homeowners insurance rates are rising especially quickly in certain parts of the country where disasters like tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires are growing more common. In 2024, more than 25 different disasters caused at least $1 billion each in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

## How to reduce the cost of homeowners insurance

### Shop around

Getting [home insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/home-insurance-quotes) annually is the best way to ensure you’re still getting the best possible deal. We recommend comparing rates from at least three companies. Make sure the coverage limits and deductibles are similar on all three policies to get a fair comparison. Read our guide on [how to shop for homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-to-shop-for-homeowners-insurance).

If you're not up for shopping around yourself, contact an independent agent or broker to get quotes on your behalf.

### Raise your deductible

A higher deductible will mean a lower rate. Raising your deductible from $1,000 to $2,500 can save you about 12% a year on average, according to NerdWallet’s rate analysis. Make sure you have enough cash tucked away to pay it if you need to file a claim.

### Ask about discounts

Many insurers offer discounts to help customers get [lower homeowners insurance rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/save-on-homeowners-insurance), such as:

* Multiple policies. If you bundle your homeowners insurance with another policy, such as car insurance, you could get a discount. See the [best home and auto bundles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles).
* Safety and security devices. You could save money by equipping your home with fire alarms, deadbolts, [security cameras and other protective devices](https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/best/home-security-systems). Some companies also offer discounts for certain [smart-home devices](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/smart-home-insurance-discount).
* Claims-free. Many insurers offer a discount to homeowners who haven’t filed a claim recently, typically in the past three to five years.

### Upgrade your home

Certain renovations — such as updating an electrical or plumbing system — could lower homeowners insurance costs. Getting a new roof could also net you a discount, especially if it’s resistant to wind and/or hail.

### Build your credit

In most states, insurers can use your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/credit-based-insurance-score) (similar to your [FICO score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/fico-score)) to set rates. Because some studies have shown a correlation between poor credit and filing claims, those with a checkered credit history may pay more for homeowners insurance. Though it may take time, building your credit could save you a lot on homeowners insurance over the long run.

Using credit to set homeowners, renters, condo and mobile home insurance prices is not allowed in California, Maryland and Massachusetts.

Frequently asked questions

Why is home insurance so expensive?

Your homeowners insurance might cost more than expected if your home is older, your region is at high risk for natural disasters or you have poor credit, among other factors. Insurers are also raising rates because climate change is making certain types of disasters more severe. But every insurance company prices policies a little differently. So if you’re unhappy with your rate, get quotes from at least three other companies to see whether you can find a better deal.

How can I save money on homeowners insurance?

Most carriers offer discounts if you buy more than one policy or you safeguard your home with a burglar alarm or sprinkler system. Opting for a higher deductible can also save you money, as long as it’s an amount you could cover in a disaster.

Is home insurance cheaper if you pay yearly?

Some companies offer discounts if you pay your premium in full upfront rather than in monthly installments.

Methodology

Homeowners insurance rates methodology

To find the average cost of homeowners insurance, NerdWallet calculated the median rate for 40-year-old homeowners from a variety of insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

We used the same assumptions for all other homeowner profiles, with the following exceptions:

* For homeowners with a claims history, we added a single wind damage claim.
* To see the effect of changing your deductible, we raised the deductible from $1,000 to $2,500.
* For homeowners with older homes, we changed the year the house was built to 1955.
* For homeowners with newer homes, we changed the year the house was built to 2024.
* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for homeowners with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good” credit.
* To see the effect of changing your dwelling coverage amount, we changed the limit to $200,000, $400,000 or $500,000. This also changed some of the other coverage limits that were tied to the dwelling coverage amount. For example, the other structures coverage limit is typically 10% of the dwelling coverage amount, so our sample policy with $200,000 of dwelling coverage had $20,000 of other structures coverage.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

Survey methodology

This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of NerdWallet from April 10-14, 2025, among 1,337 U.S. adults ages 18 and older who own a home. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within +/- 3.2 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.
