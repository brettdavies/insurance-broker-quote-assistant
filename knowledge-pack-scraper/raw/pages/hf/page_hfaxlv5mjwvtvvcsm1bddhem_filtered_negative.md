Most Mercedes-Benz drivers will need to purchase some of the following coverage options, at a minimum:[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/mercedes-benz/#cite-3)
If you get into an accident, [**collision coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) will pay to repair your vehicle from an at-fault accident with another vehicle or stationary object, like a tree or light pole. It also covers rollover accidents and pothole damage. Lenders also require it as part of a full-coverage policy if you have an auto loan or lease.
[**Comprehensive coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) pays for damage from non-collision incidents, such as theft, vandalism, fire, severe weather events, wildfire collisions, and cracked windshields.
Even safe drivers can injure someone, and [**bodily injury liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) ensures you can pay the medical bills for injuries you cause. Most states set a minimum level of liability insurance you’ll need to purchase to drive legally.
Similar to bodily injury liability, [**property damage liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) pays to repair or replace any property that you happen to damage while you’re driving. It’s legally required in all states (except New Hampshire) and Washington, D.C.
[**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) will pay for your medical bills and associated expenses if you get injured in an accident that an uninsured or underinsured driver causes.
