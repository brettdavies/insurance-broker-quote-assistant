##  –
_Please note: reports dated earlier than June 2020 were published under our previous names: the USC Program for Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE) or the USC Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration (CSII)._
PERE’s report, _Changing States: A Framework for Progressive Governance**,**_ offers a three-part framework— _conditions, arenas, and capacities—_ for determining pathways to progressive governance.
##  Download report
The  _Changing States_ framework maps out three dimensions that shape the pathways to progressive governance:
1. The **conditions** that set the context for social change efforts: demographic, economic, political, and geographic;
2. The **arenas** that define the broad terrain upon which changes are waged, won, implemented, and protected: electoral, legislative, judicial, administrative, communications, and corporate;
3. The **capacities** for change that must be in place to build enough power in the six arenas: organizational breadth and depth, networks and alliances, leadership ladders and lattices, and resource base.
_Changing States_ includes an analysis from applying the framework to five states—**Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington** —and offers ten recommendations for the field. In addition to this report, we will offer in-depth research briefs on each arena, on each of the five states, and a set of data and tools.
We hope  _Changing States_ helps to provoke new dialogue among funders, strategists, advocates, and organizers, and new collaborations to forge pathways toward sustained social change and transformation.

###  Immigrant Integration & Racial Justice
Our work on immigrant integration and racial justice brings together three emphases: **scholarship** that draws on academic theory and rigorous research, **data** that provides information structured to highlight the process of immigrant integration over time, and **engagement** that seeks to create new dialogues with government, community organizers, business and civic leaders, immigrants and the voting public to advance immigrant integration and racial equity.
###  Economic Inclusion & Climate Equity
In the area of economic inclusion, we at ERI **advance academic theory and practical applications** linking economic growth, environmental quality, and civic health with bridging of racial and other gaps; **produce accessible and actionable data and analysis** through the data tools; and **establish research partnerships** to deepen and advance the dialogue, planning, and actions around racial equity, environmental justice, and the built environment.
###  Social Movements & Governing Power
ERI’s work in the area of governing power includes: **conducting cross-disciplinary studies** of today’s social movements, **supporting learning and strategizing efforts** to advance dialogues among organizers, funders, intermediaries, evaluators, and academics, and**developing research-based social change frameworks and tools** to inform—and be informed by—real-world, real-time efforts towards a vision of deep change.
