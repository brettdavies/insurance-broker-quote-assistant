Amidst the flurry of this presidential election year, the attention on states is often more focused on short-term swings. This tends to narrow investments in states that may be “tipping”—ready to go in one political direction or another.

This can also lead to neglect of the in-depth infrastructure and capacities needed to develop and deploy the kind of power that leads to change that improves people’s lives.

PERE’s report, *Changing States: A Framework for Progressive Governance**,*** offers a three-part framework—*conditions, arenas, and capacities—*for determining pathways to progressive governance.

[Power and Possibilities: A Changing States Approach to Arizona, Georgia, and Minnesota](https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/publications/power-possibilities-changing-states-az-ga-mn/)

Based on two years of quantitative and qualitative analysis, field visits to five different states, and vetting and discussion with experts, this report emphasizes three main shifts in thinking:

* An attention to wielding—not just winning—power that aims to fundamentally change states so that we can change a nation;
* An approach to states as building blocks for progressive governance—not merely as stepping stones to federal policy change; and
* An assessment of states that looks beyond swaying an election or swinging a particular state but rather is part of a 50-state strategy that lifts up the dimensions for power building.

The *Changing States* framework maps out three dimensions that shape the pathways to progressive governance:

1. The **conditions** that set the context for social change efforts: demographic, economic, political, and geographic;
2. The **arenas** that define the broad terrain upon which changes are waged, won, implemented, and protected: electoral, legislative, judicial, administrative, communications, and corporate;
3. The **capacities** for change that must be in place to build enough power in the six arenas: organizational breadth and depth, networks and alliances, leadership ladders and lattices, and resource base.

*Changing States* includes an analysis from applying the framework to five states—**Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington**—and offers ten recommendations for the field. In addition to this report, we will offer in-depth research briefs on each arena, on each of the five states, and a set of data and tools.

We hope *Changing States* helps to provoke new dialogue among funders, strategists, advocates, and organizers, and new collaborations to forge pathways toward sustained social change and transformation.

### Immigrant Integration & Racial Justice

Our work on immigrant integration and racial justice brings together three emphases: **scholarship** that draws on academic theory and rigorous research, **data** that provides information structured to highlight the process of immigrant integration over time, and **engagement** that seeks to create new dialogues with government, community organizers, business and civic leaders, immigrants and the voting public to advance immigrant integration and racial equity.
