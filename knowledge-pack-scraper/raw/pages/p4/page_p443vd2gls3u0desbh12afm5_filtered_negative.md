#  Your Guide to Hurricane Insurance
11 Min Read | Jul 23, 2025

By [Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/hurricane-insurance#authorbio)
###  Key Takeaways
###  Here's A Tip
You’d think the [typical homeowners insurance policy](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/is-your-home-protected) would protect your house, belongings and property from hurricanes and flooding, but this just isn’t the case. Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover much of the damage from hurricanes.
And if you’re renting, your [renters insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-renters-insurance-cover) coverage is also spotty when it comes to hurricanes. It will likely cover wind damage to your stuff, but not flooding.
###  Here's A Tip
Here’s a summary of the types of hurricane damage that are typically [covered by your homeowners insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover) policy:
For states near the coast, wind insurance is a separate policy. You add a wind insurance rider to your homeowners policy to cover damage to your home from [weather events with gusty winds](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-hazard-insurance), like hurricanes and tornadoes. Damage covered will include:
Flooding can cause problems with your sewer or septic tank, which means you could end up with sewage water in your home. Pretty terrible to think about, we know. Even worse, regular [e](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-not-cover) it. A water backup rider will help cover the costs to clean up the damage if it does.
[![](https://cdn.ramseysolutions.net/media/b2c/ramsey-trusted/insurance/coverage-checkup/cc-placements/trusted-68682/trusted-68682-cc-visual-cta.png) ](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/coverage-checkup)
###  Are You Protected With the Right Insurance?
[ Take the Coverage Checkup ](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/coverage-checkup)
For wind-damage coverage, some insurance companies use what’s called a  _hurricane deductible_. It only applies to damage caused by a named storm. And it’s usually higher than your normal deductible.
Here’s the deal: Hurricanes are super expensive events for insurance companies. Hurricane deductibles are all about minimizing their losses. So, where you usually have a [typical flat-rate “dollar” deductible](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-insurance-deductible#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Deductible%3F,insurance%20claim%20being%20paid%20out.) for most claims, your hurricane deductible is based on a  _percentage_ of the insured value of your property.
Certain states do give you the option of paying a higher [premium](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-insurance-premium) for a traditional dollar deductible. But it can depend on how close your house is to the shore.
**Hurricane Deductible States**
---
Alabama |  Hawaii |  Mississippi |  Rhode Island
Connecticut |  Louisiana |  New Jersey |  South Carolina
Delaware |  Maine |  New York |  Texas
Florida |  Maryland |  North Carolina |  Virginia
Georgia |  Massachusetts |  Pennsylvania |  Washington, D.C.[1](https://content.naic.org/article/consumer-insight-what-are-named-storm-deductibles)
So it’s looking like this extra coverage might be necessary, but now you’re wondering,  _How much is hurricane insurance?_ Well, just to be extra clear, we’ll say it one more time: You can’t buy a hurricane insurance policy. Instead, hurricane insurance is a combo of flood insurance and wind coverage riders added to your existing homeowners or renters insurance policy.
So at this point, you probably want to know— _is there any way to lower my flood and wind insurance costs?_ You bet. Let’s take a look.
If you’re thinking _, That’s nice, but hurricanes are really rare and I can probably get by without insurance_, take a look at this hurricane stat: 9 out of the top 10 most expensive hurricanes for insurance to hit the U.S. happened within the last 20 years.[3](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-hurricane-and-windstorm-deductibles)
**Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale**
---
Category 1 |  Category 2 |  Category 3 (major) |  Category 4 (major) |  Category 5 (major)
74–95 mph sustained winds |  96–110 mph sustained winds |  111–129 mph sustained winds |  130–156 mph sustained winds |  157+ mph sustained winds
Solidly built home could suffer damage to roof, shingles, siding and gutters |  Well-built home could see major roof and siding damage. Small trees could be uprooted. |  Solid homes could see devastating damage. Trees will be uprooted. Electricity and water will be unavailable for days. |  Catastrophic damage to homes and landscape: Loss of roof and exteriors walls, trees uprooted. Power out for weeks up to months. |  Catastrophic damage to framed houses. Areas directly hit will be likely uninhabitable for weeks or longer.
_Data from NOAA[4](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php)_
Growing massive in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Harvey hit Texas as a Category 4 and still holds rainfall records. The highest recorded rainfall was over 60 inches in one town.[5](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092017_Harvey.pdf) Residents suffered $30 billion in insured losses.[6](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-hurricane-and-windstorm-deductibles)
The second-most expensive hurricane to hit the U.S. happened just several years ago. Hurricane Ian made landfall in Southwest Florida and then again in South Carolina, dumping over 10 inches of rain over 3,500 square miles and causing $54 billion in insured losses.[9](https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/by-the-numbers-hurricane-ian-catastrophic-damage), [10](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-hurricane-and-windstorm-deductibles)

2. Make sure you have [enough coverage](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need) to replace your house. Whether you’re just adding flood and wind insurance to your homeowners policy or you’re buying the whole shebang right now, you need enough coverage to keep you from getting into a financial bind if your whole house and all your stuff needs to be replaced. An [independent insurance agent](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-an-independent-insurance-agent) can help you figure out what that number looks like.
3. Consider buying ALE (Additional Living Expenses) coverage. This stuff may come with your [homeowners policy](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance-guide) or you may have to add it on as a rider. It pays for the extra cost of living in a hotel and eating out if your house becomes uninhabitable from a hurricane (or other problem)—a cost that could wipe out your savings.
Our final tip for buying hurricane insurance (by this time you know we mean flood and wind insurance) is to go through an independent insurance agent. If you’re not sure where to find a good one, start with a RamseyTrusted® local insurance pro. Our insurance agents are vetted experts in their fields and can help you navigate all the ins and outs of getting the right protection. They also do all the heavy lifting for you—shopping around so you can know you’re getting the best deal.

##  Frequently Asked Questions
###  What happens if your car is damaged in a hurricane?
If you have [comprehensive coverage](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-comprehensive-insurance), any damage to your car from a hurricane will be covered by your insurance. Flooding, a falling limb, hail—all of these hazards are [covered under comprehensive](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/collision-vs-comprehensive-car-insurance)—so make sure you get some.
###  Does renters insurance cover hurricane damage?
It’s hit and miss. [Renters insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/do-you-need-renters-insurance) will cover the cost to replace your personal property if it’s damaged by wind (including rain coming through the roof or broken window). But many [renters policies](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-renters-insurance) won’t cover flood damage. You can buy separate renters flood insurance if you live in a high-risk area.
###  Is hurricane insurance the same as flood insurance?
Hurricane insurance is what many people call the coverages you need to protect you financially from hurricane damage. Flood insurance is one of those coverages (also included under the banner “hurricane insurance” is wind insurance).
###  Does hurricane insurance cover flooding?
While flooding is something you need to get covered if you live in a hurricane-prone area, you can’t actually buy “hurricane insurance.” Hurricane insurance just refers to the separate coverages you need to get to be financially protected from hurricane damage, which generally are: [flood insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/need-flood-insurance) and wind insurance.
So the term _hurricane insurance_ does cover flooding, but you have to actually buy flood insurance.
###  How do I buy flood insurance?
You can buy [flood insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/flood-insurance-guide) through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or through a private insurer. Most flood insurance policies currently held are through NFIP. You can buy this federal flood insurance through non-federal, independent insurance agents.
