A proposed class action lawsuit claims GEICO has failed to honor its accident forgiveness policy, which promises customers that their insurance premiums will not increase as a result of their first at-fault accident.

The 14-page [GEICO lawsuit](https://www.classaction.org/media/cude-v-government-employees-insurance-company.pdf) alleges that instead of complying with its policy, the insurance company unlawfully disguises [premium increases](https://www.classaction.org/news/geico-facing-more-class-action-litigation-over-unconscionably-excessive-premiums-charged-during-covid-19-pandemic) for customers with accident forgiveness coverage as “surcharges” or other misleading terms following an insured’s first at-fault accident.

According to the suit, [GEICO](https://www.classaction.org/news/geico-hit-with-class-action-over-allegedly-unfair-and-deceptive-claims-processing) offers accident forgiveness coverage to customers who have been insured by the company for five years and have clean [driving records](https://www.classaction.org/news/category/automotive). The benefit can also be purchased alongside [auto insurance](https://www.classaction.org/blog/geico-preyed-on-consumers-by-selling-liability-only-policies-as-full-coverage-products-suit-says) or when renewing a policy, the case says.

The lawsuit was filed by a Dallas resident who claims he and his wife were covered by GEICO auto insurance that included accident forgiveness. The plaintiff says he received a policy renewal letter from GEICO one month after his wife got into a minor fender bender accident for which she was at fault—the couple’s first at-fault crash, according to the complaint.

Per the filing, the policy renewal letter notified the plaintiff that his [premium](https://www.classaction.org/news/lawsuit-claims-geico-issued-woefully-inadequate-premium-refunds-during-covid-19-pandemic) had risen from $1,392 to $2,663, an increase of 91.3 percent. After contacting GEICO for an explanation, the man was told that the company had not increased his premium but had “merely applied a surcharge,” the suit states.

The case alleges the insurer has engaged in an [unlawful scheme](https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-alleges-geico-unlawfully-withheld-employee-benefits-from-captive-insurance-agents) “designed to ensure GEICO’s customers would still pay higher premiums due to first at-fault accidents” despite representing otherwise.

The lawsuit looks to represent any person or entity in Texas insured by GEICO with accident forgiveness whose premiums increased following the first at-fault accident caused by an eligible driver on the policy.
