#  Auto Insurance Shopping Guide
###  Who Needs Auto Insurance?
Auto insurance helps protects you from financial losses such as vehicle repairs, medical bills, and legal services that could result from an auto accident. Illinois law [(625 ILCS 5/7-601)](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K7-601) requires all vehicle owners to have minimum amounts of auto liability insurance. In addition, lending institutions may require physical damage insurance (collision coverage) for a financed vehicle.
###  Helpful Tips When Shopping For Insurance
* Contact the Department to [find out if a company is **licensed** in Illinois](https://sbs.naic.org/solar-external-lookup/). Unlicensed companies are not required to comply with state insurance laws or participate in the [Insurance Guaranty Fund](https://www.iigf.org/) which protects policyholders if a company goes bankrupt.
* [Check a company’s **complaint ratio**](https://idoi.illinois.gov/reports/consumer-complaint.html). Our website lists complaint information for companies with ten or more auto insurance complaints.
* Check a company’s financial stability to ensure that it can pay its claims.
**Find a reliable insurance agent**. Some companies sell through local agents and some through direct marketing or group plans. Ask people you know and respect for their recommendations. Look for a licensed insurance agent (insurance producer) who is reliable and helpful in answering your questions. You can look up an agent’s license status at [NAIC - State Based Systems (SBS)](https://www.statebasedsystems.com/solar/index.html).
###  Required Auto Insurance Coverages
_**Note:** Consider buying higher limits. The state minimums may not be enough to fully protect you from lawsuits._
**Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury Coverage (UM)** – Covers you for your bodily injury caused by a hit-and-run driver or an at-fault driver who has no auto liability insurance. Currently, Illinois uninsured motorist bodily injury minimum limits are $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. For additional premium, you may buy higher limits to pay for claims that exceed those amounts.
###  Other Coverages That May Be Required
###  Optional Coverages for Additional Premium
**Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD)** – Covers damage to your vehicle caused by an identified, at-fault, uninsured driver. This optional coverage may be purchased with or without collision coverage. Currently, Illinois law requires that the company offer this coverage with a maximum $250 deductible.
###  Factors That May Affect The Premium
**Maintain good credit.** Many companies assess your [credit information](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/credit.html) and may charge higher premiums depending on your credit information.
###  Discounts That May Be Available
**Auto/home packages** – Given if you buy your auto and homeowners policies from the same company.
