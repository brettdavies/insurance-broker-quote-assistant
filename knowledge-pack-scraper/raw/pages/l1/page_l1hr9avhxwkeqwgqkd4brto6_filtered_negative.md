#  Do I Need Separate Windstorm or Hurricane Coverage?
* Your **roof**, **windows**, or **doors****

Standard **home insurance in Florida** often _excludes_ windstorm or hurricane damage—or it may offer only limited protection with a **high deductible**. In many coastal regions (including Destin and other Gulf Coast areas), insurance carriers may require a **separate windstorm policy** or a **named-storm deductible rider**.
* [**Business**](https://www.gcains.com/what-are-some-expenses-required-to-run-a-business/)**interruption**, if you own a commercial property
Your condo association may carry a **master policy**, but it likely only covers common areas or the exterior. You need a personal policy that includes **interior damage and contents** —including windstorm protection if your unit is exposed to high winds.
* **Builders Risk Insurance—A Smart Addition for Construction & Renovation Risks**
In addition to offering a broad selection of personal and commercial policies, Gulf Coast Affordable Insurance can also help you explore specialized solutions like **Builders Risk Insurance** —a short-term policy designed for structures under construction or renovation. Especially here in Florida, where weather threats like hurricanes, storms, and wind damage are real concerns, Builders Risk provides coverage against damage during the build phase, including fire, theft, weather events, and vandalism.
