State Farm offers a defensive driving discount that seniors can qualify for, though the discount is available to drivers of any age. Like most insurance companies, State Farm does not have a senior discount that automatically lowers rates for all older drivers.

In addition to the defensive driving discount, State Farm has other ways for senior drivers to save. For example, State Farm offers an accident free discount, which gives a discount to drivers who go at least three years without an accident.
