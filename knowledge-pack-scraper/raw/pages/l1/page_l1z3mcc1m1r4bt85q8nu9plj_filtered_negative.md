**Bankrate’s take:** Young drivers have less experience behind the wheel and are [statistically shown](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) to be more likely to engage in risky behavior, such as texting while driving. This makes them more likely to be involved in accidents than older drivers. Statistics also show that young male drivers are more often involved in accidents than female drivers of the same age — thus, their rates are usually higher. According to the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/teenagers) (IIHS), about two out of every three teens killed in crashes in 2021 were males.

**Bankrate’s take:** If you are convicted of a serious infraction such as a DUI in Missouri, you may be required by the state to file [an SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) with the DMV. This certificate states that you have the required amount of liability coverage to drive legally. It is filed by your insurer on your behalf, and there is generally a small charge involved. It's important to note that not all insurers will provide coverage to drivers if they have been convicted of a DUI. If that's your situation, you may need to shop around to find an insurance company that will write you a policy.
