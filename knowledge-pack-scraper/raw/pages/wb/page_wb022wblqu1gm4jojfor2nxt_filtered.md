Yes, Progressive Snapshot does track speed using a smartphone app or a plug-in device. Snapshot also raises rates for poor driving, so drivers who have a habit of speeding may want to reconsider using this telematics program.

## What Progressive Snapshot Tracks

* Speed
* Hard braking
* Mileage
* Phone use

In addition to raising your rates for speeding and engaging in other risky behaviors while using Snapshot, Progressive will increase your premiums for things like speeding tickets, at-fault accidents and moving violations since these activities are reported on your driving record and could classify you as high-risk. As a result, practicing safe driving is the best way to keep your premiums low.
