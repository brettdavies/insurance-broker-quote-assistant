## Coverages High-Risk Drivers Should Consider

For high-risk drivers, having the right auto insurance coverage is essential, not just to meet state requirements but to protect against the financial risks that come with a higher likelihood of accidents or claims.

#### High-risk drivers should start with required liability coverage, then consider adding collision and comprehensive if their vehicle is financed or hard to replace out of pocket.

Michelle Robbins
**Licensed Insurance Agent**

Because insurers view high-risk drivers as more likely to file claims, securing adequate coverage is a key part of regaining financial and legal stability on the road. Important types of coverage for high-risk drivers include:

* **Liability Insurance**: Required in nearly every state, this covers injuries and property damage you cause to others. It’s the minimum legal requirement, but often not enough on its own.
* **Collision Coverage**: [Collision auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/collision-auto-insurance/) pays for repairs to your own vehicle after an at-fault accident.
* **Comprehensive Coverage**: [Comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) covers damage from non-collision incidents like theft, vandalism, or weather.
* **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: Protects you if you’re hit by someone without enough insurance, which can be especially valuable when you’re already considered high-risk.
* **SR-22 or FR-44 Certification**: Not technically a coverage type, but a filing often required for high-risk drivers after a DUI or license suspension to prove financial responsibility.

Choosing the right combination of coverage ensures that high-risk drivers are protected from large out-of-pocket expenses and potential legal consequences. While it may cost more upfront, full coverage can provide peace of mind and financial protection that far outweighs the risk of going underinsured.

## How High-Risk Drivers Can Save on Car Insurance

High-risk drivers looking to cut their insurance costs have several effective options beyond standard discounts:

* **Complete a Defensive Driving Course:** This shows insurers you’re committed to safer driving and can reduce your risk profile.
* **Maintain Continuous Coverage:** Keeping an active policy helps avoid rate hikes due to insurance lapses.
* **Improve Your Credit Score:** Better credit can lead to lower premiums since many insurers consider credit history when pricing policies.
* **Choose a Low-Risk Vehicle:** Driving a car with strong safety ratings and lower repair costs can result in cheaper insurance.
* **Raise Your Deductible:** Increasing your deductible lowers your monthly premium if you’re confident in avoiding frequent claims.

By taking these proactive steps, high-risk drivers can begin rebuilding trust with insurers, lower their overall costs, and work toward qualifying for better rates in the future.
