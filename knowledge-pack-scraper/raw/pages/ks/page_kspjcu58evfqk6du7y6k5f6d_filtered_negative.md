Illinois law also requires [uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage). Uninsured motorist (UM) and underinsured motorist (UIM) are first-party coverages, meaning that the payout is for the insured drivers on the policy, not a third party. This additional insurance helps protect you against uninsured drivers and those who have insurance but not enough to cover your damages resulting from the accident. The minimum limits required in Illinois are:

You can take advantage of the [car insurance coverage](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages) options available from Elephant Insurance, including:
[Comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/comprehensive-and-collision-coverage) helps pay to repair or replace your car if it’s damaged, regardless of who is at fault. You select a deductible that you pay out of pocket and your insurance company pays for the remaining damage up to the limits you select. Comprehensive coverage can help cover the value of your vehicle if it’s stolen as well as cover expenses resulting from damage from a weather event such as hail. Collision insurance coverage helps pay to repair or replace your car if it’s damaged by colliding with another vehicle or object, such as a sign or fence.
When another person is at fault for an accident and does not have car insurance, [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.elephant.com/car-insurance/coverages/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage) can help cover your damages, medical treatment, and lost wages. If your injury expenses exceed the at-fault party’s liability limits, you may be able to use [underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage) to help pay towards the amount not covered by the at-fault person’s insurance.
[Rental reimbursement](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/rental-reimbursement-coverage) helps pay for your rental car if your car isn’t drivable for 24 hours or more because of a loss covered by your comprehensive or collision coverage.
[Roadside assistance](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/roadside-assistance) coverage saves you from being stranded on the side of the road when something goes wrong with your car. If purchased, roadside assistance is available for use when your car is disabled due to a covered emergency, such as:
* * *
Accident forgiveness is a policy feature that’s automatically earned after a customer goes 3 consecutive years without having an accident on their policy. Instead of waiting more than 3 years for an accident waiver, customers may be eligible to purchase [upgraded accident forgiveness](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/accident-forgiveness) that’ll start immediately once your policy starts.
[Diminishing deductible](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/coverages/diminishing-deductible), sometimes called a “disappearing” or a “vanishing” deductible, can be added onto a vehicle’s collision deductible to help lower the out-of-pocket costs in the event of an accident.
* * *
The type of vehicle you drive can impact your insurance rate. Cars that are older, smaller, have a lower safety rating, are more expensive to repair or replace, or are considered luxury vehicles often require higher premiums.

When people talk about [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.elephant.com/products/car-insurance/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance), they’re usually referring to a car insurance policy that is a collection of coverages to protect the policyholder in various situations. It’s not a specific type of insurance and the term can vary in meaning.
