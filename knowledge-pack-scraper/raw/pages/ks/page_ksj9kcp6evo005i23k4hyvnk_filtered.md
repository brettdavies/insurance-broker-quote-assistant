## **Take a defensive driving course**

GEICO offers a discount on car insurance for those who have completed a defensive driving course. The discount is available to any GEICO primary driver who meets the age requirement. The eligibility criteria may vary depending on the state and GEICO company. For instance, Idaho drivers can save up to 10% on applicable coverages, while Minnesota drivers can save up to 12%.

Defensive driving courses teach techniques for accident prevention and respectful driving in relation to other motorists. These techniques include maintaining a safe distance between cars and limiting the force of impact. By adopting these practices, drivers can make the roads a safer place.

The easiest way to take advantage of the defensive driver discount is by completing an online course offered by Defensive Driving by IMPROV, the National Safety Council, or the American Safety Council. These courses are typically self-paced and can be completed over a few days or weeks. The IMPROV course, for example, meets the New York time requirement of 6 hours but only takes 5.5 hours, with 30 minutes allowed for breaks. It consists of 10 chapters, each with a short quiz, and there is no final exam.

Upon completion of the course, drivers can notify GEICO and may be eligible for a discount on their car insurance. This discount can be applied for up to three years, after which the course must be taken again to secure further savings.

## **Pay your premium in full**

GEICO offers a number of flexible ways to pay your car insurance bill, including paying all at once or in installments. Paying your premium in full can often help lower your premium because GEICO offers discounts for those who pay their premium all at once. When you pay the entire premium at once, GEICO saves on administrative costs associated with processing multiple payments, and these savings are passed on to you. Paying in full also helps you avoid installment fees or interest charges that can add up over time.

GEICO offers a range of payment options, including online payments, the GEICO Mobile app, phone pay, bill payer service, and mail. If you pay your premium in installments, setting up automatic payments using your bank account can also save you money on installment fees. GEICO also accepts payments from the US Postal Service. You can mail your payment (check or money order), along with your paper bill stub, to the following address: GEICO Insurance Remittance Center, P.O. Box 70776, Philadelphia, PA 19176-0776.

To avoid a lapse in your insurance coverage, it is important to make your payments on time. GEICO provides payment reminders through text alerts, and you can also set up automatic payments to ensure your payments are made on time. Additionally, if you choose to pay in installments, each payment may be subject to an installment fee, which will be shown on your billing statement.

By choosing to pay your GEICO insurance premium in full, you can take advantage of the discount offered and save money on your overall insurance costs. This option can help lower your premium, avoid installment fees, and benefit from the administrative cost savings passed on by GEICO.

## **Buy a safer car**

When it comes to buying a car, safety should be a top priority. Not only will a safer car protect you better in the event of an accident, but it can also help lower your insurance costs. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing a safer car to reduce your GEICO insurance rate:

**Safety Ratings**

Cars with good safety ratings are often associated with lower insurance premiums. This is because they are considered to have a reduced risk of accidents and lower potential claim expenses for insurers. So, when shopping for a car, be sure to research the safety ratings of different makes and models. Look for vehicles with advanced safety features and a history of performing well in crash tests.

**Anti-Theft and Security Devices**

GEICO offers discounts to customers who install anti-theft and security devices in their vehicles. These devices reduce the risk of theft and can help lower your insurance costs. Consider installing an anti-theft alarm system, or even tracking devices, which can help deter thieves and improve your car's security.

**Airbags and Anti-Lock Brakes**

While airbags and anti-lock brakes are now required by law in the U.S. for all new cars, it's still important to ensure your insurer is aware of these safety features, especially if you have an older car. These features significantly reduce the risk of accidents and injuries, and their presence can lead to lower insurance premiums.

**Lower Repair Costs**

Vehicles with lower repair costs tend to have lower insurance premiums. This is because insurers consider the potential expenses associated with repairing a vehicle after an accident. So, when choosing a car, consider models that are known for their reliability and have a reputation for being inexpensive to repair.

**Engine Power**

Cars with less powerful engines often have lower insurance premiums. This is because they are associated with a lower risk of accidents and theft. More powerful engines can lead to higher speeds and an increased likelihood of accidents, which insurers take into account when calculating premiums.

Remember, when buying a car, safety should be a key consideration. By choosing a safer car, you not only protect yourself and others on the road, but you can also benefit from lower insurance rates with GEICO. Be sure to discuss these safety features with your insurer to ensure you're taking advantage of all possible discounts.

## **Get a multi-policy discount**

One way to lower your Geico insurance rate is to get a multi-policy discount. This involves bundling your auto coverage with other insurance policies such as home, renters, condo, or motorcycle insurance. By combining multiple policies under one provider, you can unlock significant savings and make managing your policies more convenient.

Geico offers a Multi-Policy Insurance Discount when you bundle your home and auto insurance policies. This allows you to save time and money while enjoying dependable coverage for both your car and home. You can also bundle other types of insurance, such as renters, condo, or motorcycle insurance, with your auto policy to qualify for discounts.

The process of bundling your policies is straightforward. You can shop on the Geico mobile app, visit their website to get a quote, or contact their customer service by phone or live chat. Geico will then do the shopping for you, comparing quotes from multiple trusted providers to help you find the best coverage at a competitive rate.

It's important to note that filing a claim on one policy in a bundle typically does not affect the other policies or the overall discount. However, this can vary by provider, so it's essential to discuss the specifics with them. Additionally, the discount amount may vary depending on your state.

By taking advantage of the multi-policy discount, you can save money on your insurance premiums and simplify the management of your policies. It's a great way to lower your overall insurance costs without compromising on the coverage you need.

## **Improve your credit score**

Improving your credit score can help you lower your GEICO insurance rates. A high credit score can help you get lower insurance rates, better credit cards, and good terms for a personal loan. A low credit score can drive up your insurance rate. According to a study by Bankrate, drivers with poor credit pay 97% more, on average, for full-coverage insurance premiums than drivers with exceptional credit.

GEICO uses your credit data to calculate your premium in states where it is legal. Having good credit makes you less of an insurance risk, which will reduce your rates over time. You can improve your overall credit-based insurance score by paying your bills on time and maintaining a low balance on your credit cards.

Insurance-related inquiries are not counted against your credit score. If you obtain your credit report from one of the major bureaus, you will be able to see the inquiry, but it will never lower your score or impact your ability to obtain credit. To protect your privacy, GEICO's sales and service agents do not have access to your credit information. However, you are entitled to one free report each year from each of the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. For the most accurate understanding of your credit, you should review the reports from all three bureaus annually.

How can I lower my GEICO insurance rate?

There are several ways to lower your GEICO insurance rate. Firstly, you can take advantage of the various discounts offered by GEICO, such as bundling your auto coverage with other insurance policies like home or renters insurance, or discounts for everyday things like being a homeowner, a good student, serving in the military, or previously having a car insurance policy with another company. Additionally, improving your driving record and practicing safe driving habits can help you qualify for lower rates.

How does bundling policies help lower my GEICO insurance rate?

By bundling your auto coverage with other insurance policies, you can take advantage of GEICO's bundling discounts. This means that you purchase multiple policies through GEICO, which makes you a loyal customer and can lead to lower rates.

How do safe driving habits help lower my GEICO insurance rate?

Practicing safe driving habits and avoiding moving violations demonstrates to insurers that you are a low-risk driver. GEICO may offer discounts to drivers who have completed defensive driving courses, as they showcase a commitment to safe driving and a reduced risk of accidents.

Are there any other ways to lower my GEICO insurance rate?

Yes, you can consider increasing your deductible, reducing your coverage, or choosing a vehicle with good safety ratings and lower repair costs. Additionally, paying your premium in full can often help lower your rate, as GEICO may offer discounts for full payments to minimize the risk of late or missed payments.
