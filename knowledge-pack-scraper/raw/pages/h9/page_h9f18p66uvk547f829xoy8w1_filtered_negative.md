[Progressive Insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/progressive-insurance/115985/) is the second-largest auto insurance company in the US as of 2024, trailing only industry giant [State Farm](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/state-farm/67041/). According to our research, Progressive’s market share in the auto insurance segment currently stands at 8.35 percent. Given its enviable position in the US auto insurance market, there is a higher chance that Progressive will be recommended by insurance professionals and sought after by consumers.
