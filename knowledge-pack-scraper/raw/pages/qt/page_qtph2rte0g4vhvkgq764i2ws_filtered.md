## Best car insurance companies in Oklahoma

Bankrate took a close look at average premiums provided by data analytics company Quadrant Information Services to find the best car insurance companies in Oklahoma. Our research found that a [full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/?tpt=b) policy in Oklahoma costs, on average, $2,797 per year, with minimum coverage averaging $560. On average, U.S. drivers pay $2,671 per year for full car insurance coverage and $806 per year for minimum coverage.

However, buying the [best car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) is typically about more than finding the cheapest rates. According to our proprietary Bankrate Scoring method, which includes results from the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), the best Oklahoma auto insurance might be found by getting quotes from Geico, USAA, Progressive, State Farm and Farmers.

  **Why Geico made our list:** Geico has a reputation for low rates and its Oklahoma averages are no exception to this, making it one of the [cheapest companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) on our list.  On top of this already low average premium, Geico also has an extensive list of potential discounts that might help further lower your rate. Although military members and government employees could earn the company’s Eagle discount, the company doesn’t have eligibility restrictions like military-focused USAA. Civilians might qualify for other savings opportunities, too, like the defensive driving or affiliation (which offers savings if you are a part of certain organizations) discounts or Drive Easy, Geico’s telematics program. The company was also a winner in the [2025 Bankrate Awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/), as Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers, so may be a good choice if you have a few marks on your driving record.

  **Who Geico may be good for:** Oklahomans looking for the cheapest coverage possible may want to ask Geico for a quote. The company's low average rates and extensive discount list make it a good starting point for many looking for an affordable policy.

  **Why Progressive made our list:** Although Progressive’s average rate in Oklahoma is only slightly below the state average, getting a quote from the company may be worth it for drivers looking for a streamlined car insurance shopping experience. Not only will Progressive’s Name Your Price tool curate a coverage package based on your desired budget, but the company will also present you rates from its competitors to help you compare. Additionally, although Geico won our 2025 Bankrate Award for it, Progressive gets some high marks from us for high-risk drivers as well, mainly due to its three optional types of accident forgiveness, which can save you from an increase if you are involved in an accident that results in a claim to your policy. Although Progressive earns top marks from J.D. Power for its [2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), it does not fare as well in its 2024 Auto Insurance Study or its [2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), so if customer service is your top priority, there may be better alternatives.

  **Who Progressive may be good for:** Drivers with a few dings on their driving records may find Progressive a good choice for its generous accident forgiveness options.

  **Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm may be known for its expansive network of neighborhood agencies, but it also scored highly in the service category in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study. Unlike some companies' mobile tools, State Farm’s app allows you to make policy changes as well as make payments and track claims. It’s also worth mentioning that State Farm won 2025’s Bankrate Award for Best Auto Insurance for Safe Drivers due to its many programs and discounts aimed at those who keep safe on the road. If customer service is important to you, you may also be interested to know that State Farm came in above average in both J.D. Power studies for claims and customer satisfaction in 2024.

  **Who State Farm may be good for:**Customers who want to manage their auto insurance policy on the go may want to give State Farm a try—especially if strong customer service and the option to talk to a local agent rank high on your list.

  **Why USAA made our list:** There are [six military bases](https://militarybases.com/oklahoma/) in Oklahoma, which means that USAA could be a good choice for a significant subset of the state’s population. This is because USAA is only available to active-duty members of the U.S. military, veterans and their qualifying family members. Eligible Oklahomans might enjoy top-notch customer service and unique, military-focused savings such as the military on-base discount or a discount for storing your vehicle (perhaps during deployment or training). Considering that USAA already offers lower-than-average rates in Oklahoma, these discounts could really add up. The company is also known for its customer service—just one reason we awarded it our top honor in the 2025 Bankrate Awards: Best Auto Insurance Company Overall (tied with Amica). J.D. Power agrees, and, although it can’t be officially ranked due to its eligibility restrictions, USAA cleaned up in terms of scoring in all three 2024 J.D. Power studies we looked at.

  **Who USAA may be good for:** Eligible drivers might want to check out USAA if they’re interested in doing business with a company in tune with the unique needs of military personnel.

  **Why Farmers made our list:** Drivers looking for auto insurance in Oklahoma with an extensive list of coverage add-ons may want to request a quote from Farmers. Along with some of the more standard coverage options like emergency road service and rental reimbursement, you could add coverage for loss of use, which could pay you a flat sum to use for public transportation when your car is repaired after a claim. Spare parts coverage is also available, which provides reimbursement for spare parts (up to $750) if yours are damaged or destroyed due to a claim. Typically, car insurance companies use after-market parts to repair your vehicle after a claim, but with Farmers’ original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coverage, the company will cover the additional cost of using factory-original parts instead. 2024 J.D. Power scores indicate a mixed bag in customer satisfaction; Farmers was ranked above average for digital satisfaction and claims satisfaction, but slightly below average in terms of customer satisfaction in the Central region.

  **Who Farmers may be good for:** Oklahoma drivers looking for robust coverage options and a face-to-face agent experience might want to consider contacting Farmers.

## How to find the best car insurance in Oklahoma

As an Oklahoma driver, you want a policy that abides by state insurance laws, but also one that includes the coverage you need to be protected from financial disaster following an accident. When looking for the best car insurance in Oklahoma, you'll want to consider the following factors to ensure that your coverage meets your needs at a price that is easy on your wallet.

* Number 1 Icon

  ### Consider minimum insurance requirements in Oklahoma

  Caret Down Icon 

  Nearly every state requires drivers to have at least minimum liability insurance. Most insurance experts recommend carrying more than the [minimum requirement](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) for a greater level of financial protection. [Oklahoma requires drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/oklahoma-car-insurance-laws/#liability-insurance-in-oklahoma) to carry a baseline amount of liability coverage of at least $25,000 in bodily injury liability per person, $50,000 total bodily injury liability per accident and $25,000 of property damage liability. Insurers are also required to offer you uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, but this can be rejected in writing.

Insurers are also required to offer you uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, but this can be rejected in writing.
* Number 2 Icon

  ### Consider lender requirements

  Caret Down Icon 

  If you have a car loan or lease, you may need to have more than the minimum amount of insurance coverage. Lenders and lienholders often require full coverage insurance for financed or leased vehicles. If the car is involved in an accident, they want to be sure funds are available to repair or replace it. [Gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/), a coverage type that pays the difference between what the car is worth and what you owe on it, may be something you want to consider if you owe a lot on your car.

* Number 3 Icon

  ### Consider your individual needs

  Caret Down Icon 

  The best car insurance company will depend on your circumstances and coverage needs. For example, if you're concerned about a future accident impacting your premium, you could consider looking for a car insurance company that offers [accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/). If you’re adding a [teen driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) to your car insurance policy, you may want to search for a car insurance company with competitive student discounts. Every insurer offers a slightly different range of endorsement options and discounts, so shopping around may save you money and earn you a policy that is better suited to your situation.

## How much is car insurance in Oklahoma?

Average car insurance rates [vary by state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/). The average cost of full coverage car insurance in Oklahoma is $2,797 per year, which is comparable to the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of $2,671. However, the state’s average minimum coverage rate is less than the national average. Nationally, a minimum coverage policy is $806 per year on average. In Oklahoma, this average is only $560.

* ###### Is car insurance expensive in Oklahoma?

  Caret Down Icon 

  While the state averages are typically comparable to national average rates, your own premiums are likely to differ, based on a range of factors that are unique to you. Insurers consider the level of risk they will assume when they determine rates, and if you are in a group that is generally higher risk, you may see a higher rate, regardless of your own characteristics. Young drivers, for example, generally pay more for their coverage, because [statistics show](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) that drivers with little experience behind the wheel have more accidents, resulting in a higher number of claims. Your driving record, regardless of your age, also plays a primary role, and you may earn a lower rate by going without accidents or moving infractions and having no marks on your driving record.
