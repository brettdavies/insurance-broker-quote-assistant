A safe driver discount is a perk that some insurance companies give to customers who maintain a clean driving record. That means if you go several years without an [accident](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/at-fault-collisions) or traffic violation, you could lower your insurance premiums by up to 40%.
Major [car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) like State Farm, Nationwide, and Allstate offer the discount, but the amount you can save varies. Learn how and where to get a safe driver discount and how to maximize your car insurance savings.
## **How Much You Can Save With a Safe Driver Discount**
![Driver holding onto steering wheel](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/4b787771a6/driver-with-both-hands-on-wheel.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The savings from a safe driver discount — also known as a good driving discount — can vary depending on your insurance company and the [state you live in](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state). Generally, discounts range from 10% to 30%, though certain insurers may offer more or less.
For example, Nationwide gives you an instant 10% discount when you sign up for its [SmartRide](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/nationwide/smartride) telematics program, which uses a smartphone app to track your driving. At the end of the tracking period, you could get a higher discount — up to 40% — if you’re a safe driver. That’s the highest discount we found in our research.
## **How to Get a Safe Driver Discount**
The requirements for a safe driver discount vary by insurance company. Some companies simply require you to have a clean driving record — meaning no [tickets](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/tickets) or accidents within a certain period, usually three to five years.
But other insurers have telematics-based safe driver discount programs. For example, Nationwide’s SmartRide, State Farm’s [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save), and American Family’s DriveMyWay track your driving habits, looking at things like speed, braking, cell phone usage, and mileage to reward you with additional savings for safe driving.
You can usually apply for a safe driver discount online through your insurance company’s website, a mobile app available on the App Store or Google Play, or by contacting your insurance agent or customer service.
## **Where to Get a Safe Driver Discount**
Nearly all major insurers offer some kind of safe driver discount, making it easy for responsible drivers to benefit from lower [auto insurance premiums](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium). Here’s a look at a few popular insurance companies that offer the discount and the potential savings you can earn, based on our research.

## **The Best Save Driving Discounts to Save You Money**
![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/f778687766/person-buckling-in-seatbelt.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
While most [auto insurers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) offer some kind of discount for safe driving, a few companies advertise especially generous discount percentages, making them ideal choices for safe drivers with clean records.
Below are details on three insurance companies that offer some of the largest safe driver discounts and how to qualify for them.
### **Nationwide**
**Advertised savings:** Up to 40%
Nationwide offers two ways to save money as a safe driver. You can qualify for a more affordable car insurance rate if you don’t get into any accidents or have any tickets for at least five years.
To save even more, you can sign up for the company’s SmartRide program, which uses a mobile app or telematics device to measure miles driven, hard braking and acceleration, idle time, and nighttime driving.
### **State Farm**
**Advertised savings:** Up to 30%
State Farm offers a good driver discount for new customers who’ve gone three years or more without moving violations or at-fault accidents. The company’s Drive Safe & Save program offers a discount of up to 30% if you download an app that tracks your driving behavior.
Your discount adjusts each policy renewal (typically every six months) based on driving data from the previous 12 months.
### **USAA**
**Advertised savings:** Up to 30%
USAA offers a safe driver discount if you maintain a good driving record for more than five years. In some states, you can enroll in the company’s [SafePilot](https://www.usaa.com/inet/wc/safedriving/) telematics program, allowing an app to track your braking and cell phone use while driving.
Enrolling in the program earns you a 10% discount, and, if you demonstrate safe driving habits, you can save up to 30% at renewal.
## **How to Maximize Your Safe Driver Discount Savings**
Maximizing your safe driver discount means taking proactive steps to maintain a clean driving record and practice safe driving habits. Here are some tips to help you get the largest discount possible:
  * **Enroll in a telematics program.** While some insurance companies offer discounts just for remaining free of tickets or accidents, signing up for a [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount) that tracks your driving behaviors tends to offer the largest discounts.
  * **Drive less.** The less you drive, the lower your accident risk. Some insurers have [usage-based insurance programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) that offer discounts for lower [annual mileage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/annual-mileage) — usually less than 7,000 miles per year.
  * **Stay accident-free.** The longer you avoid accidents and violations, the higher your discount potential. So keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel, drive at the speed limit, and obey all traffic laws and signs.

  * **Multi-policy** : [Bundling](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-policy-discount) your car insurance policy with other policies, such as homeowners, renters, or life insurance, can lead to additional savings.
  * **Vehicle safety features** : You may qualify for a [safety features discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/passive-restraint-discount) if you equip your car with anti-lock brakes, airbags, or an anti-theft device.
