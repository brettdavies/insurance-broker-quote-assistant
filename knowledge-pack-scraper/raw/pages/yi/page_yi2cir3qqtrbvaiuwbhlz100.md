### PEOPLE ASK
Is there any age limit for students to stay on their parents’ car insurance?
No. As long as you live with your parents, you can stay on their car insurance.
As you can see below, teens pay more for car insurance when they take out a solo policy than when added to a parent’s policy, in some cases by more than $1,000 a year.
## Methodology
National and state average rates are based on three coverage levels: state minimum, 50/100/50 liability-only, and full coverage with 100/300/100 liability and $500 deductibles. 
For college students, averages are based on our full coverage data set. This data set is based on:
  * Bodily injury liability of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident
  * Property damage liability of $100,000 per incident
  * Comprehensive and collision deductibles of $500
  * Drivers aged 18-21
  * Honda Accord LX
  * Good credit
  * A clean driving record
  * 12-mile commute, 10,000 annual mileage


Rates for college students are based on the cost of an individual policy, with the exception of rates for college students away from home, which are based on a college student on a parent's policy; the away from home discount only applies in this situation.
Rates are fielded by Quadrant Information Services from 170 insurance companies and from 34,588 ZIP codes in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
## FAQ: Car insurance for college student
### Can you be on your parents’ car insurance if you don’t live with them?
Yes, as long as you are temporarily away from home and their home address is your permanent residence, such as when you are away at college. However, once you have moved out entirely, you will need your own policy.
### What insurance company is best for college students that live away from home?
**There are several insurance companies that have student away from home discounts. Some of the best insurers, in this case, are USAA, Concord, and State Farm.** The first two have low average rates and offer student-away discounts.
But not all students will be able to sign up for USAA or Concord. In that case, State Farm is a good option. In addition to having a student away discount, it also offers a good student discount of up to 25%. Ultimately, the best car insurance for you as a college student or for your college student children will depend on your location, your insurance needs and which company can bring the most value to you at the best cost.
