## Resiliency and Recovery
#####  **State Farm sponsors American Red Cross Disaster Fleet Across the Country**
As part of our ongoing commitment to community safety and disaster response, State Farm has donated 15 vehicles totaling $1 Million to Red Cross regions around the country. These vehicles will be used to support disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts - specifically serving those impacted by devastating catastrophes.
The co-branded fleet – including four Emergency Response Vehicles – hit the streets in August, prepped for response at the start of peak hurricane season. The vehicles will be stationed for response in Red Cross regions spanning Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, Eastern New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, North Texas, Southeastern Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia.
State Farm support is funding four Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) as well as 11 Community Response Vehicles (CRVs). Emergency Response Vehicles, which are SUVs, deploy to large-scale disasters delivering supplies such as food, water, and emergency kits. They are designed for easy maneuvering over rough terrain.
The Red Cross utilizes CRVs to transport volunteers as well as life-giving emergency response supplies. Beyond providing critical relief items to disaster survivors, these vehicles also help Red Cross stock and support shelters, ensuring they are ready to care for displaced individuals.
The American Red Cross responds to more than 65,000 disasters annually, and these additional vehicles help enhance the organization’s capacity to assist individuals and families during emergencies. This effort reflects State Farm’s core mission to be good neighbors and provide meaningful community support. This initiative also strengthens our decades-long partnership with the American Red Cross, supporting critical disaster preparedness and recovery initiatives such as Sound the Alarm, Be Red Cross Ready, and the Emergency App.
