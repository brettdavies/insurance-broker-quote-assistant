Our in-house research team collects extensive information used in our evaluation process, although we may not cover all options available in the marketplace. See our full [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance#methodology).
## **Key Takeaways**
  * Some of the [most common discounts](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-discounts#common-discounts) on home insurance are for customers who bundle insurance policies, avoid filing claims, and install security measures.
  * Just because a provider has a lot of discounts doesn’t mean it will end up being the cheapest option, so compare quotes from several companies.
  * Discount offerings will vary by state, policy, and your specific circumstances. There may be limits on how much of a discount you can qualify for.


## Home Insurance Discounts Explained
Home insurance providers typically offer several ways to qualify for a discount on your [homeowners insurance premium](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/premiums), which is the amount you pay to keep your policy active. With home insurance rates on the rise nationwide, finding ways to make your coverage more affordable is increasingly important. Ask your provider or potential insurer about discounts you may be eligible for.

## Common Homeowners Insurance Discounts
Each company has different discount options and eligibility requirements, but there are some common discounts that many providers offer, such as savings for bundling policies, staying loss-free, and increasing your home security.
### **Multi-Policy Discounts**
Multi-policy or bundle discounts apply to customers who have more than one type of insurance policy with the same company. [Bundling your home and auto insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles) under one provider, for example, can typically get you a discount on one or both policies. You may also be able to bundle other policies with your home insurance for a discount, such as [life insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/life-insurance) or [pet insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance).
### **Claim-Free Discounts**
Staying claim-free – also known as loss-free – is one of the main ways to save on home insurance. If you have a home insurance policy for a certain amount of time without filing any claims for losses, your insurer may give you a discount on your premium. Filing claims, on the other hand, can cause your rate to increase.
### **New Customer Discount**
Companies often provide a discount for new customers as a reward for buying a home insurance policy. This type of discount will vary by provider; it may apply to homebuyers who are getting home insurance on a newly purchased house, policyholders who are switching from renters to home insurance, or customers who are switching from a different provider.
### **Loyalty Discount**
Not every insurer will provide a discount for long-term policyholders, but some may offer a loyalty discount based on the number of years you’ve held a home insurance policy with that provider.
### **Home Safety Discounts**
Most insurers will lower your premium if your home has certain protective, smart home, or security devices that decrease your risk of a loss. The qualifying devices may vary by provider, but these are some examples:  

  * Fire or smoke alarms
  * Fire extinguishers
  * Indoor sprinkler systems
  * Carbon monoxide detectors
  * Burglar alarm system
  * Motion detectors and security cameras
  * Deadbolts
  * Water or gas leak sensors
  * Temperature monitoring system


### **New and Renovated Home Discounts**
Many providers offer discounts for newly built or recently renovated homes, since they tend to be lower-risk. Some renovation discounts may apply only to specific home features: For example, companies may offer a roofing discount if you upgrade your roof with impact-resistant materials. If you meet certain standards for wind resistance in a hurricane-prone state like [Florida](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/local/florida), you may be eligible for a wind mitigation credit.
Select providers, such as [Travelers](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/travelers), provide green home discounts for homes that are certified “green” by a program like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.
### **Payment Discounts**
Payment-related discounts can take several forms. Depending on the insurance carrier, you may be provided a small discount for enabling automatic payments, paying your full annual premium yearly rather than monthly, enrolling in paperless billing, or consistently paying on time. Some companies also offer “quote in advance” discounts if you apply for a quote from a new provider within a specific time frame before your old policy ends.
### **Affinity Discounts**
Select insurers may have affinity discounts that reward homeowners for having a particular profession, degree, or membership in a qualifying organization. For example, a few insurers offer [military-related discounts](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-for-veterans). Senior customers over a certain age or retirees may also have access to a discount.
## What You Need To Know About Discounts
Discounts are a great way to get a cheaper premium, but there are a few things to keep in mind:  

  1. **Your discount may not be the maximum percentage.** If a home insurance company advertises a discount “up to 10%,” for example, that means the discount you qualify for may be lower than 10%.
  2. **There may be a cap on how many discounts you can qualify for.** Though you can usually apply multiple discounts to one policy, insurers may impose a limit on the total amount you can save on your premium, such as 40%.
  3. **Discount offerings vary by state and policy.** Even if a company advertises certain discounts, you may not be eligible for them if they’re not offered in your state of residence.
  4. **Discounts don’t guarantee the best deal.** A company that offers many discounts but charges higher rates may not end up being the cheapest option. You should [compare quotes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/quotes) from multiple providers.


## Other Ways To Save on Homeowners Insurance
Aside from discounts, consider a few other ways to [lower your home insurance rate](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-lower-home-insurance-costs).  

#### High Deductible
A higher [deductible](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible) means you’ll have to pay more out of pocket in the event of a loss, but you’ll also typically pay a lower premium as a result. You may save more in the long run with a high deductible if you don’t end up filing many claims, but make sure you choose a deductible amount that you could feasibly pay out of pocket if you needed to.
#### Clean Credit
Your credit score can affect your home insurance premium in most states. A [2025 report](https://consumerfed.org/reports/penalized/) by the Consumer Federation of America found that the typical homeowner was charged nearly $2,000 more per year just for having a low credit score. You can likely save money on your home insurance by improving your credit and maintaining a high credit score.
#### Shop Around
Even if you’ve had a policy under one company for a long time, you should still routinely shop around to see if you can get a cheaper policy elsewhere. It’s a good idea to compare quotes for similar coverage from at least three different providers before you renew your policy renewal each year.
## FAQ

Why is my home insurance premium going up?
