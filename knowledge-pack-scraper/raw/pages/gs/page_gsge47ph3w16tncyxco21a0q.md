Why Trust Us
Our rankings, ratings, and product reviews are unbiased. We do not rank or rate products or services based on our financial relationships with the companies that produce them. Our in-house research team collects extensive information used in our evaluation process, although we may not cover all options available in the marketplace. See our full [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance#methodology).

  * Neither Allstate nor State Farm is accepting new business in California. State Farm also doesn't write new policies in Rhode Island or Massachusetts.
  * Both companies offer bundling discounts for customers with multiple policies. 


## Allstate vs. State Farm
Allstate and State Farm are both good options for homeowners insurance, ranking No. 6 and No. 3, respectively, in our [best homeowners insurance companies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance) rating. However, according to our research, Allstate scored higher in most subcategories, including customer service, claims handling, customer loyalty, likely to be recommended, and likely to be renewed.
Standard policies with both companies are similar, with each insurer providing the basic coverages – dwelling, other structures, personal property, liability, medical payments to others, and loss of use. State Farm also includes identity theft protection, but Allstate does not.
While Allstate scored higher in most categories, State Farm is the cheaper option. Allstate’s monthly rate is $143.92, which is higher than State Farm's at $129 per month. The companies offer similar discounts; however, Allstate provides a new home credit discount, while State Farm does not. Also, keep in mind that rates vary significantly based on your location, claims history, and coverage details. Below are the average annual rates for Allstate and State Farm for several different levels of coverage:  

## Do Allstate and State Farm Cover Mold Damage or Removal?
With both Allstate and State Farm, coverage for [mold damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold) or removal varies based on the cause of the mold. If the mold is caused by a covered peril, like a burst pipe, they are more likely to cover the cost of removal or repair. However, mold resulting from poor maintenance or neglect is not covered by standard homeowners insurance policies.
Additionally, there may be limits on mold removal or remediation coverage, so check your policy carefully to find out how much (if any) coverage you have.
## Do Allstate and State Farm Cover Roof Leaks?
Both Allstate and State Farm cover roof leaks that are caused by a covered peril, but there are some restrictions. For example, neither company will cover a leak caused by improper maintenance.
## Do Allstate and State Farm Cover Termite Damage?
A standard homeowners insurance policy does not cover damage caused by [termites](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage) or other pests, no matter which insurance company you choose. If you think you might have termites, your best course of action is to call an exterminator to prevent any further damage.
## Do Allstate and State Farm Cover Water Damage?
Allstate and State Farm both cover water damage that occurs suddenly and accidentally, such as a burst pipe or appliance overflow. But water damage from flooding, slow leaks, wear and tear, or household negligence is typically excluded. People concerned about this damage should purchase a separate flood insurance policy.
## Do Allstate and State Farm Offer Homeowners Insurance Bundling?
Both Allstate and State Farm offer [bundling discounts](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles), which means you can save money if you purchase both home and auto (or another combination of coverages) from the same company.
