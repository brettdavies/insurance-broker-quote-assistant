### GEICO vs. State Farm: rates for high-risk drivers

If you have infractions like an [at-fault collision](/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/) in your driving history, finding cheap car insurance can prove more difficult. However, we found that GEICO could be more affordable than State Farm if you have recent violations. Each auto insurance company has different post-violation pricing structures, so always do your due diligence and compare quotes to understand which insurer suits you best.

##### RATES BY CITATION: STATE FARM VS. GEICO

| **Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $2,849 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $1,524 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $3,854 |
| Reckless driving | $2,238 | $2,895 |
| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $1,983 |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### GEICO vs. State Farm: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age to estimate potential risk and price premiums on a sliding scale. An auto insurance policy is commonly most expensive for teens — due to their inexperience — and relatively more affordable for drivers aged 25 or older. Since every insurance company evaluates age brackets differently, it's wise to compare rates and find great coverage.

As a general rule, teen drivers should choose GEICO before State Farm: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $2,312, compared to State Farm. GEICO was also cheaper for most drivers no matter their age.

##### RATES BY AGE: STATE FARM VS. GEICO

| **Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $3,508 | $5,820 |
| **20s** | $1,438 | $2,379 |
| **30s** | $1,218 | $2,379 |
| **40s** | $1,189 | $1,587 |
| **50s** | $1,160 | $1,558 |
| **60s** | $1,065 | $1,485 |

Costs aside, GEICO and State Farm both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Continue reading to learn more about these companies' ratings, and make an informed decision by getting quotes and [comparing rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before finalizing a policy.

## GEICO vs. State Farm: home insurance

Both State Farm and GEICO offer [homeowners coverage options](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/). These can be purchased as individual policies or bundled together with auto or other coverage types. Progressive has a much larger presence in the auto insurance space than it does homeowners, and some policyholders may find its policy options limiting. GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner.

While not as large a portion of its business as auto insurance, homeowners coverage remains an important part of GEICO's product offerings. The company partners with many insurers throughout the nation to provide home insurance. Customer service scores and third-party ratings remain high, though the company doesn't offer very many discount opportunities on home insurance.

State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making it a great option for customers looking for flexible or unique coverages. However, State Farm's average rates tend to be higher than average. The company also suffers from a lack of available homeowners discounts — only three discount options at present. State Farm's home insurance options enjoy good ratings from third-party agencies, and the company ranked fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Still, homeowners looking for basic insurance with not many bells or whistles may wish to look for an alternative.

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Tie

---

Both GEICO and State Farm can provide customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). If you go with GEICO, however, it's important to keep in mind that it doesn't actually underwrite its own policies.

---

### GEICO vs. State Farm: home insurance rate comparison

State Farm's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,356, or about $113 a month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates will vary from one company to another. This is because every insurance company has different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will weigh factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home differently. Learn more about these [rating factors](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/).

For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate. While cost is an important factor when shopping for homeowners insurance, it's most important to have good coverage from an insurer that you can trust.
