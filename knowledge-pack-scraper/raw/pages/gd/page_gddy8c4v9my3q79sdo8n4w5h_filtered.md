# Progressive Small / Large Accident Forgiveness

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

I have been with progressive now for a little over 10 years. My premium just next month is going down about $63.00. I feel like I pay a very good rate.

This past weekend I was driving on the highway and another vehicle while switching lanes side swiped my car. Unfortunately (or fortunately since nothing bad happened to anyone in the car) I didn't hear or feel anything during the point of impact it didnt feel like my car was dinged.

After driving another 3 hours north when exiting the vehicle, the damage was pretty concerning to the drivers side door and frame (the door is fine but the area right next to the tire is dinged). Two body shops have estimated about 2k in repairs while my deductible is $500.

Has anyone in the past used their large / small accident forgiveness and seen their rates stay the same ? I have read in different posts that while your rates won't go up due to the claim. You might loose certain discounts and that would then make your rates increase. So I am unsure on what to do at this point. I dont want my premium to double in 6 months.
