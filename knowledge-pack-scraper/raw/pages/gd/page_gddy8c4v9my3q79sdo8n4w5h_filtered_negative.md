Count on your rates going up no matter what you do.
Then do what you think is best for you now.
You paid extra for accident forgiveness. It's up to you whether you want to use it or not.

What would be scenarios that would cause my insurance to go up if I use the accident forgiveness?
If my premium has always trended downwards regardless of inflation... i guess i am trying to see if other people have had their premiums increase and specifically why.
Do they remove discounts or?

You might have a claim free discount which could be removed (regardless of fault) they are waving the surcharge of charging you an increase for an af accidental; however taking away the discount can cause your rate to rise even if you aren’t being surcharged for the accident itself. This is a tiny print thing that can change carrier to carrier and state to state. Yes it’s a very real possibility of a higher rate even with no accident surcharge.

There could be company wide rate increases where your discounts only make the increases smaller.
I had a situation with Progressive a couple of years ago where I used the Snapshot device, aced it, but got a $200 increase in my 6 month premium. Where's my promised discount? Oh, you got your discount. Without it your premium would have been $350 higher instead of $200.

We have/had large accident forgiveness listed on our policy as a “loyalty reward”. No at fault accidents or violations in over 5 years.
In December, my wife had an at fault accident that totaled her car. Our rates ate going up over $100/month on renewal. I called and asked about the accident forgiveness and they stated that I had a non at fault accident in 2023 as well as a comprehensive (hail damage) claim.
So, not sure which one ended my accident forgiveness, but something did.

My rates were the same after my very first accident under my own policy (I didn't have Progressive). Unfortunately, I had another accident three months after renewal (not my fault) that added $50-100 to my premium. The policy had really high coverages though.

The accident surcharge will be waived at your next renewal because of the accident forgiveness endorsement. However, please keep in mind that you will no longer qualify for the accident-free discount, which is typically around 35% with most carriers.
