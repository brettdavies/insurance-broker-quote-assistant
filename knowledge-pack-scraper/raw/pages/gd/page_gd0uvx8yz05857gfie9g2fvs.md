### Factors in auto insurance costs

## What does auto insurance cover?
What auto insurance will cover depends on the type of coverage you buy. Basic coverage, known as [liability coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/liability-car-insurance-211344549.html), pays for property damage and injuries to others if you cause an accident and can help pay your legal fees following an accident.
Full coverage includes liability as well as collision and comprehensive coverage. [Collision coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/collision-insurance-191301984.html) helps pay for damage to your car if you’re in an accident. [Comprehensive coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/comprehensive-car-insurance-182556677.html) helps pay for damage caused by weather, theft, vandalism, and collisions with animals.
## How to find the best auto insurance
These tips can help you find the best auto insurance for your needs and your budget.
  * **Assess your coverage needs.** At a minimum, you will need liability insurance, which is [required in every state](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/state-minimum-car-insurance-233457321.html) except New Hampshire. Adding collision and comprehensive coverage can pay off if your car is ever damaged — and might be required if you’re leasing or financing your car. You may want even more types of coverage, such as [roadside assistance](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/emergency-roadside-assistance-174215567.html), [rental car coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/rental-car-reimbursement-175331598.html), or [custom parts and equipment insurance](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/custom-parts-and-equipment-insurance-160731485.html). The types of coverage you want can impact which insurer you choose.
  * **Shop around.** Get quotes from multiple insurance companies because each insurer has its own methodology for setting [car insurance premiums](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/car-insurance-premium-212507632.html). You can use online comparison tools that provide quotes from multiple insurers, visit car insurance websites to expand your search to companies that aren’t featured in comparison tools, or work with an independent insurance agent, who can get quotes from several companies for you.
  * **Ask about discounts.** You may be able to get a better deal on the coverage you want if the insurer offers a range of discounts and you qualify for them. Common auto insurance discounts include rate reductions for having a safe driving record, a car with safety features, multiple policies with the same insurer, automatic payments, and paying your premium in full each year.
  * **Don’t focus on price alone.** Opting for the cheapest car insurance policy could lead to higher costs if coverage is inadequate. Ask about coverage restrictions, such as whether your coverage level will drop if you drive outside of your state or if friends will be covered if they get into an accident when borrowing your car.
  * **Check reviews and do your research.** Read online reviews and complaints for insurers you’re considering to find a company with a good customer service track record. Also, check the insurers’ financial strength through an independent agency such as A.M. Best, Fitch, or Moody’s to ensure they can pay customers’ claims.

## Best auto insurance FAQs
### What’s the best auto insurance?
American Family earned the highest rating in Yahoo Finance’s evaluation of 13 auto insurance companies. But it’s important to shop around to find an auto insurance company that provides the coverage you want at a price you can afford.
### Who has the cheapest auto insurance?
In our analysis, American Family and Farm Bureau had the cheapest car insurance for full coverage. American Family also had the cheapest car insurance for liability-only coverage.
## Methodology
### Auto insurance ratings
We researched the coverage details and prices for 13 auto insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each auto insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best auto insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated.
**Coverage types: 20% of score.** We examined all the coverage options available, and assessed whether each insurer offered the following: new car replacement (5%), GAP insurance (5%), accident forgiveness (5%), and diminishing deductible (5%).
**Average cost: 40% of score**. The average cost was generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and includes more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. These estimates are for policies with full coverage for the average policyholder who owns one car. Average policyholder here is defined as a 48-year-old driver, driving a 13-year-old car, in an average-income ZIP code with full coverage.
**Customer satisfaction: 30% of score.** We factored in information from three major sources: 1) National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaints (10%), in which we took the total number of complaints each company had over a three-year period (2022-2024), 2) CRASH scores (10%) from the Crash Network which share how well each company ensures quality repairs and customer service, and 3) J.D. Power scores (10%) from the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the U.S. Auto Insurance Study.
**Discounts: 10% of score.** We gave points for each type of discount that each auto insurer offers.
All app ratings were accurate at the time of publication.
### Auto insurance pricing data
Unless stated otherwise, the estimates above are provided by Savvy Insurance Solutions (“Savvy”). Savvy operates a marketplace for home and auto insurance, plus an agency licensed in all 50 states. Estimates are generated using Savvy’s in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and include more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Savvy’s nationwide data set. This includes data from more than 2 million insurance accounts connected through Trellis Connect, an in-house technology allowing consumers to “link” their insurance accounts before searching for insurance, and tens of thousands of policies bound by Savvy’s own agents. It takes into account a myriad of factors to create predictions, such as:
  * Policyholder age
  * Number of vehicles
  * ZIP code
  * Vehicle age
  * Insurer
  * …and more


Savvy creates estimates by running models against multiple inputs to the parameters of interest. For instance, the “teen driver” estimates were created by adjusting the policyholder age input into the pricing model while keeping all other variables steady from the baseline for “full coverage.” The models enable hyper-personalized estimates that take into account a plethora of user attribute permutations (e.g., teen drivers in specific states, teen drivers with new vehicles, teen drivers in specific states with new vehicles) to provide individuals with a unique and tailored experience. The charts above are a subset of the kinds of personalization Savvy can do.
### Definitions
The following are definitions used by Savvy when providing its rate estimates for various types of coverage.
**Full coverage car insurance:** A policy with comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage.
**Average policyholder:** A 48-year-old driver who owns a 13-year-old vehicle and lives in an average-income ZIP code.
**Senior driver:** A 70-year-old policyholder with full coverage car insurance.
**Good driver:** Drivers across all coverage types, vehicle types, and locations who have no tickets, accidents or DUIs.
