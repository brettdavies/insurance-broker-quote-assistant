## What does renters insurance cover in San Diego?
[Standard renters insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/renters-insurance/what-does-renters-insurance-cover/) covers your belongings, liability and more.
### Personal property

### Liability
This covers injuries and property damage you cause to other people. It can also cover related legal expenses.

## How much renters insurance do I need in San Diego?
**California does not require you to carry renters insurance. But landlords can require it as part of a lease.** Even if your landlord doesn’t require it, it’s often a good investment. You get thousands of dollars of coverage for paying just a few dollars a month.
The main thing to focus on when buying renters insurance is your personal property limit. You’ll want enough to replace all your belongings if there’s a total loss. Make a home inventory that lists all the stuff you want covered. Include serial numbers and prices when you can. This will help you get the right amount of coverage.
The minimum limit for liability coverage is usually $100,000. This may seem like a lot, but a long hospital stay or court trial can tear through that fast. Any claim-related costs after you hit your limit has to come out of your own pocket. To avoid this, raise your liability limit to at least $300,000, if you can afford it.
