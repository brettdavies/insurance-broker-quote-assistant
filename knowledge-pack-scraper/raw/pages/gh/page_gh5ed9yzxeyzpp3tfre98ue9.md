## Government-mandated auto insurance discounts for seniors
While older drivers will eventually see their car insurance rates increase, many states mandate that drivers over 50 be given discounts for good driving or for taking approved driving courses.
For example, if you have an AARP membership, you can enroll in the [AARP Smart Driver Course](https://www.aarpdriversafety.org/). This online or in-person defensive driving class helps you refresh your driving skills and could help you get a discount on your car insurance. AARP's Smart Driver Course is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., but you should check with your insurance carrier to see if they will honor the discount.
In addition to AARP's program, senior drivers can also take state-approved defensive driving courses through [AAA](https://www.ace.aaa.com/automotive/driver-education/senior-programs.html) and [The National Safety Council](https://www.nsc.org/safety-training/defensive-driving/courses/online) (NSC). Depending on your insurance company and the course you take, you could be eligible for a discount of **5% to 15% on your car insurance**.
Currently, about 34 states and Washington, D.C. have such programs. Eligibility requirements and discounts vary from state to state. 
In most cases, senior drivers will be required to take a mature driver safety course. These courses are designed to refresh driving skills, update knowledge of traffic laws, and promote safe driving practices.
## How to get the government-mandated auto insurance discount for seniors
Don’t expect your insurer to simply offer up the discount – you may need to ask. Follow these simple steps:
  1. Ask your insurer if a government-mandated seniors discount is available in your state.
  2. Find out what the eligibility requirements are and find an approved course. AAA, the National Safety Council and AARP are among the organizations that provide mature driver courses.
  3. Check whether you will need to complete the course in person or online. 
  4. Take the class and submit your proof of completion to your insurance company.


If your state doesn’t offer such a program, you might still qualify for other discounts offered to senior drivers, such as a low mileage discount, time of day driving discount or a good driver discount.

## Car insurance rates for seniors
Auto insurance rates for seniors increase over time because insurers see older drivers as riskier to insure. Statistics show that seniors are more accident-prone than younger drivers. This is caused by age-related changes in hearing or vision, slower reflexes and changes in overall health. Car insurance rates for seniors start to rise at 65 but really jump after 80.
In addition, older drivers suffer graver injuries and more fatalities in car accidents than younger people. This means larger claimAn insurance claim is a request you make to your insurance company for coverage after your car is damaged or you have an accident. You can file a claim online, by phone, or in writing. payments and, as a result, increased car insurance rates.
How much your premiums will increase will depend on your insurance company.
While Insurance.com data shows that older drivers do pay more than middle-aged drivers as a group, they don’t pay nearly as much as teens. Explore our [car insurance calculator](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/auto-insurance-coverage-calculator.html) to see what rates apply to you.
## Senior auto insurance rates by age
At 65, experience and industry data show that drivers are more susceptible to getting involved in accidents, and as a result, insurers charge more, and rates continue to rise.
Here’s what you can expect to pay for seniors’ insurance from age 65 to 75 for a full coverage 100/300/100 policy with a $500 collision/comprehensive deductible.

## Car insurance discounts for seniors
There are [plenty of discounts](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts.html) available to older drivers, and you should pursue all that apply to you. Below are eight specific actions you can take to reduce your premium costs:
  1. **Drive less.** You can save with a low mileage discount.
  2. **Consider usage-based insurance.** Usage-based or [pay-as-you-drive insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/pay-per-mile-auto-insurance.aspx) programs can save you up to 40%.
  3. **Take a defensive driving class.** Mature driver courses offered by AARP and others, as discussed earlier, can reduce your premiums by 5% to 15%
  4. **Drop a driver.** If someone in your household no longer drives, you can remove them from the policy.
  5. **Upgrade your car.** The latest vehicle safety features may get you lower rates and also keep you safer on the road.
  6. **Keep a clean record.** Good driver discounts can be up to 40%.
  7. **Join a club.** Membership in organizations such as AARP can get you a discount.
  8. **Dial back coverage**. If you have an older car, you can consider dropping full coverage.
  9. **Bundle it up.**[Auto and home insurance bundles](https://www.insurance.com/home-auto-bundle/how-to-bundle-auto-and-home-insurance) can save you a lot of money.
  10. **Stop driving.** If your insurance rates are sky-high because of your driving record, it might be time to quit. 


For more information, review our [tips on being a safe driver](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/safety/good-drivers-top-10-tips-for-safer-driving.aspx). Drivers of any age can raise deductibles, bundle with home or renter's insurance or reduce coverage in order to save on premiums.
## Safety tips for older drivers
Here are the most important tips from the [National Institute of Health](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safety/safe-driving-older-adults) (NIH) to be safe on the road. 
  * **Maintain your health**. Have your hearing, vision and general health evaluated regularly, and keep any prescription equipment such as glasses and hearing aids up-to-date. If you don't see well after dark, avoid driving at night.
  * **Stay physically active**. Physical activity may foster quick reaction times.
  * **Change your vehicle**. A car with the latest safety features can keep you safer on the road.
  * **Review medications**. Understand how your medications may affect your driving ability. Avoid driving after taking any drugs with warnings about operating machinery.
  * **Create a healthy buffer zone**. Follow at a greater distance and avoid busy parts of town and busy times of day.
  * **Sharpen skills**. Defensive driver classes and behind-the-wheel refresher courses can sharpen your skills and lead to lower insurance rates.
  * **Maintain your vehicle**. Regular inspections and tune-ups reduce the chance of roadside breakdowns.

If you realize that you may not be the driver you once were, talk to your physician. You may come up with a plan to address your limitations and decide that it is time to give up driving or get a license with limits. Some states offer a restricted license. For example, some licenses prohibit driving at night if that is an area of concern for you. 
It may also be time to look at alternative modes of transportation, such as community-offered senior rides, Lyft or [Uber](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/uber-insurance.html). If you sell your vehicle, you could easily offset other transportation costs from the savings you receive from no longer owning and maintaining a vehicle.
