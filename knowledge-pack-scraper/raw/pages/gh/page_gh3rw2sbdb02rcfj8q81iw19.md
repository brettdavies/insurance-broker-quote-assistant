[Home](https://www.habitecsecurity.com) [Blog](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/resources/) [ About Habitec ](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/resources/category/about-habitec/)
We all know that homeowners insurance can be a hefty expense, but what if protecting your home could also save you money on those premiums? At Habitec Security, we’ve got you covered. Our monitored security systems do more than just safeguard your home—they can actually lower your insurance costs.
By installing one of our systems, you can unlock discounts offered by some of the top insurance companies. In this article, we’ll walk you through how Habitec Security helps you save on insurance, why providers offer these savings, and how our advanced security solutions benefit you in the long run.
## The Cost of Homeowners Insurance and How Discounts Make Security Systems More Affordable
Homeowners insurance in the US typically costs between $1,200 and $1,500 annually, depending on factors like location, home value, and coverage limits.
Installing a [monitored security system](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/home-security/home-security-systems.php) like the ones from Habitec Security can reduce your premium by 5% to 10%, meaning you could save a significant amount each year. For example, if your annual premium is $1,500, a 10% discount would save you $150 annually. That’s a nice discount to enjoy as a bonus to protecting your home and family!
The savings from insurance discounts can go a long way in making your system more affordable. The average cost of a professionally monitored security system can more be balanced out by these annual savings. Plus, you benefit from increased home security, which potentially saves you from thousands or more in damage every year.
When factoring in the savings from insurance discounts, your Habitec system becomes even more affordable. Not only will you save on premiums, but you’ll also gain peace of mind knowing your home is fully protected by our professional monitoring services.
## Examples of Major Insurers Offering Discounts for Monitored Home Security Systems
Many major insurers, including Allstate, State Farm, Nationwide, USAA, and Farmers Insurance, often offer discounts ranging from 5% to 10% for homes equipped with monitored security systems. These discounts typically apply to homes with systems like monitored burglar alarms, fire alarms, and smoke detectors, which help reduce the risk of theft or fire.
While the exact savings may vary, most insurers offer these discounts as an incentive for homeowners to install systems that reduce the likelihood of costly claims. Be sure to check with your specific provider to see if your system qualifies and to confirm the available discount.
## Why Insurers Offer Discounts for Monitored Security Systems
Insurers view homes with monitored systems as lower-risk properties. Security systems are designed to reduce the risk of burglaries, [fires](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/home-security/fire-alarms.php), and other costly hazards. Insurers save money when fewer claims are filed.
With professional monitoring services like ours, the likelihood of damage or theft is reduced, which means fewer claims and lower costs for the insurer. These savings are passed on to you in the form of insurance discounts.
Habitec’s monitoring services are designed to detect potential threats early—whether it’s a break-in, fire, or gas leak. The quicker these threats are identified, the lower the risk of significant damage or loss. This early detection and prevention are key factors in why insurers offer discounts for devices like [Habitec’s security systems.](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/home-security/prices-specials.php)
Claims related to burglary or fire can cost thousands of dollars, so preventing these incidents is essential. Habitec Security helps prevent these large claims, saving insurers money, which they reflect in discounted premiums.
## Common Types of Security Devices from Habitec Security That Can Qualify for Insurance Discounts
### Monitored Burglar Alarms
Our burglar alarms ensure immediate notification of a break-in, with 24/7 monitoring that allows us to respond promptly and keep your home safe. With constant monitoring, your home is always protected. Only Habitec-monitored burglar alarms qualify for insurance discounts, as unmonitored systems don’t provide the same level of security. By installing our burglar alarms, you can expect to save between 5% and 10% on your insurance premiums.
### Monitored Fire Alarms
Habitec’s fire alarms offer real-time alerts to emergency responders, helping to minimize damage caused by fires. For insurance discounts to apply, fire alarms need to be monitored, and Habitec Security meets this requirement. With our monitored fire alarms, homeowners can typically receive a 5% to 10% discount on their premiums.
### Monitored Smoke Detectors
Our smoke detectors are designed to alert both you and emergency services when smoke is detected, ensuring a rapid response and reducing potential fire damage. To qualify for insurance discounts, it’s essential that these detectors are monitored. Habitec Security’s smoke detectors meet this criteria, offering homeowners a savings range of 5% to 10% on their insurance premiums.
### Carbon Monoxide Detectors
Our [carbon monoxide detectors](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/home-security/environmental-monitoring.php) provide critical notifications in the event of a gas leak, alerting both you and our monitoring station to ensure your family’s safety. Homes equipped with Habitec-monitored carbon monoxide detectors can qualify for similar discounts to those provided for fire and smoke detectors.
### Video Surveillance and Smart Monitoring
With [Habitec Security’s video surveillance](https://www.habitecsecurity.com/home-security/security-cameras.php), you can monitor your home from anywhere using your smartphone or computer, providing remote access and peace of mind. Video surveillance systems also serve as a powerful deterrent against theft. Some insurers may offer additional discounts if video surveillance is integrated into our monitored systems for enhanced protection.
## How to Choose the Right Habitec Security System to Maximize Your Insurance Discount
When deciding between monitored and unmonitored systems, it’s essential to know that only Habitec-monitored systems qualify for insurance discounts. Selecting a system with professional monitoring ensures you are eligible for these savings and that your home receives the highest level of protection.
One of the key reasons to choose Habitec is the reliable 24/7 monitoring we provide. Our systems are designed to keep your home secure at all times, and we meet the specific criteria required by insurance companies to qualify for their discounts. This means with Habitec, you not only get top-notch protection but also the added financial benefit.
While Habitec Security does not officially partner with specific insurers, many major companies such as State Farm and Allstate recognize the value of our security systems. As a result, they can offer discounts to homeowners who use services like ours.
To maximize your insurance savings, we recommend installing a combination of burglar alarms, fire alarms, and smoke detectors from Habitec Security. This setup provides comprehensive coverage and ensures that you qualify for the highest possible insurance discount.
