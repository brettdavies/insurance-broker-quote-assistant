For example, if you have an AARP membership, you can enroll in the [AARP Smart Driver Course](https://www.aarpdriversafety.org/). This online or in-person defensive driving class helps you refresh your driving skills and could help you get a discount on your car insurance. AARP's Smart Driver Course is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., but you should check with your insurance carrier to see if they will honor the discount.
In addition to AARP's program, senior drivers can also take state-approved defensive driving courses through [AAA](https://www.ace.aaa.com/automotive/driver-education/senior-programs.html) and [The National Safety Council](https://www.nsc.org/safety-training/defensive-driving/courses/online) (NSC). Depending on your insurance company and the course you take, you could be eligible for a discount of **5% to 15% on your car insurance**.

While Insurance.com data shows that older drivers do pay more than middle-aged drivers as a group, they don’t pay nearly as much as teens.

There are [plenty of discounts](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts.html) available to older drivers, and you should pursue all that apply to you. Below are eight specific actions you can take to reduce your premium costs:
1. **Drive less.** You can save with a low mileage discount.
2. **Consider usage-based insurance.** Usage-based or [pay-as-you-drive insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/pay-per-mile-auto-insurance.aspx) programs can save you up to 40%.
3. **Take a defensive driving class.** Mature driver courses offered by AARP and others, as discussed earlier, can reduce your premiums by 5% to 15%
4. **Drop a driver.** If someone in your household no longer drives, you can remove them from the policy.
5. **Upgrade your car.** The latest vehicle safety features may get you lower rates and also keep you safer on the road.
6. **Keep a clean record.** Good driver discounts can be up to 40%.
7. **Join a club.** Membership in organizations such as AARP can get you a discount.
9. **Bundle it up.**[Auto and home insurance bundles](https://www.insurance.com/home-auto-bundle/how-to-bundle-auto-and-home-insurance) can save you a lot of money.
10. **Stop driving.** If your insurance rates are sky-high because of your driving record, it might be time to quit.
For more information, review our [tips on being a safe driver](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/safety/good-drivers-top-10-tips-for-safer-driving.aspx). Drivers of any age can raise deductibles, bundle with home or renter's insurance or reduce coverage in order to save on premiums.
Here are the most important tips from the [National Institute of Health](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safety/safe-driving-older-adults) (NIH) to be safe on the road.
Below is information from the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) about the differences by state.

It may also be time to look at alternative modes of transportation, such as community-offered senior rides, Lyft or [Uber](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/uber-insurance.html). If you sell your vehicle, you could easily offset other transportation costs from the savings you receive from no longer owning and maintaining a vehicle.

Yes. A 65-year-old will pay about**$** 2,274 per year for a full coverage policy while a 75-year-old will pay about $2,620.
Many insurance companies offer discounts to seniors who take a [defensive driving course](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/saving-money/defensive-driving-classes-save-on-car-insurance.html). Contact your insurer to ensure they offer a discount for seniors and get a list of approved defensive driving courses.
While [collision and comprehensive ](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html)are usually not required, if you are not carrying these coverages and your vehicle is damaged or destroyed in an accident, you will be covering the cost to repair or replace your vehicle out of pocket.
