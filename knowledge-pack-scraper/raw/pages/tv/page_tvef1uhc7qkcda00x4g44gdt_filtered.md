# "Progressive" filed accident claim without consent, concerned about insurance rate impact

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

Seeking advice. I had an accident very recently where the other car hit my car while doing improper lane change. Even the police said by seeing the dash cam video of my car that the other person was at fault, I called my insurance company in order to report the accident but they filed it as a claim without confirming with me first. Even though I told them I don't want to use my collision coverage as the accident was not my fault, they still filed a claim without confirming with me first. The claim was closed next day without any pay as they suggested to contact the other person's insurance because I am not at fault. Now I am afraid that this claim will increase my insurance rate from now on, what should I do now? How much it might increase? Is there any way to remove it from the record? Any kind of suggestions will be appreciated.
