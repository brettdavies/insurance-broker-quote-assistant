We also checked the NAIC Complaint Index and found that Progressive gets fewer complaints than the average insurance company.
Progressive offers standard auto insurance coverages like liability, collision, and comprehensive. It also provides optional features such as roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and accident forgiveness.
The company’s usage-based program, **Snapshot**, lets drivers earn personalized rates based on their driving behavior.
Founded in 1937 as Progressive Mutual Insurance Company, the Ohio-based insurer now serves customers across all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
Policies can be purchased online, over the phone, or through a local insurance agent.
Progressive’s average yearly premium is $1,820, which is $192 less than the national average of $2,012 for a 12-month policy. Its rates fall around the middle compared to other major insurers in our review.
For most driver profiles, such as young adults or those with a speeding ticket, Progressive’s average rates tend to be below the national average.
![Progressive Insurance](https://insuredtechy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Progressive-Insurance-3.jpg)
Like many auto insurance providers, Progressive offers a range of discounts to help reduce premiums.
It has more discount options than most companies in our 10-insurer comparison, including savings for young drivers through its teen driver, good student, and distant student discounts.
Keep in mind that our review uses sample rates for comparison. Actual premiums vary based on factors like your location, coverage options, and the type of vehicle you drive, so your individual costs may differ.
Progressive’s sample yearly rates for teenage drivers are higher than the national average, **$2,569 more for females** and **$2,558 more for males**. This difference exists because insurers generally see teens as higher-risk drivers due to their limited experience and greater likelihood of accidents.

* National Average: **$6,475**
**17-Year-Old Male:**
* Progressive: **$9,879**

* Progressive: **$2,305**
* National Average: **$2,309**
**25-Year-Old Male:**

**40-Year-Old Female:**
* Progressive: **$1,710**

Our research shows that the average cost of minimum coverage nationwide is **$780 per year**, while Progressive’s average rate is slightly lower at $771.
However, meeting only the state’s minimum requirements may not be enough. It’s important to consider how much coverage you truly need to ensure proper financial protection.
**Minimum Coverage**
* Progressive: **$771**
* National Average: **$780**
Full coverage car insurance generally includes your state’s required minimum coverage along with **collision** and **comprehensive** insurance, both commonly required for financed or leased vehicles.
Progressive’s average annual rate for full coverage is about **$150 less** than the national average.
**Full Coverage**
* Progressive: **$2,233**
* National Average: **$2,386**
Minimum coverage only meets state-required liability and other mandatory protections.
Full coverage, on the other hand, includes the following:
* $100,000/$300,000 bodily injury liability,
* $100,000 property damage liability,
* comprehensive and collision with a $500 deductible,
* $100,000/$300,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (UIM),
* Any additional state-required protection.
It’s worth noting that some states don’t permit insurers to use **gender** when setting car insurance rates, and others limit the use of **credit information** when determining premiums.

* **Multi-policy discount**
