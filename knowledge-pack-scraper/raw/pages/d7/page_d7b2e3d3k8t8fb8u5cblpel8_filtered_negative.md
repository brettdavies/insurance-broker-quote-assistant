Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_Collision coverage may be essential for effectively managing your auto insurance. This optional type of coverage assists in covering the repair cost for your vehicle after an accident with another vehicle or object, regardless of who is at fault. This article explains what collision coverage usually includes, what common incidents it typically does not cover (like theft or weather damage, which are covered by comprehensive coverage) and discusses important factors like deductibles and your car’s value. This information may help you decide if this coverage is the right choice for you._
Are you thinking about your car insurance and wondering what is [collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage)? This important type of insurance can help protect your finances after certain types of car crashes. Whether you’re a [first-time driver](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/teen-driving-101-a-stepbystep-test-of-essential-skills) or someone revisiting your coverage options, understanding collision coverage can help you make an informed decision that help fit your needs.

Collision coverage is a type of optional car insurance that helps pay to [repair or replace your vehicle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/should-you-repair-or-replace-your-car) if it is damaged in a crash. This could involve an accident with another car or running into a stationary object like a utility pole, mailbox or guardrail.
* **Hit-and-run damage** — if [another driver damages your car and drives off](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-after-a-hit-and-run) without leaving contact information.
Keep in mind that collision insurance only applies to damages to your own vehicle. If you are at fault for damages to someone else’s property or vehicle, that is covered by your [liability insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover).
* **Car theft** — if [your car is stolen](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft), that may be covered under [comprehensive insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage).
* **Hitting an animal** — collision insurance typically doesn’t cover damage from [hitting a deer](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car) or other animals; this would usually fall under comprehensive coverage.
* **Damage to someone else’s property** — this is covered by Property Damage [liability insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), which is required by law in many states.
* **Medical costs** — medical expenses for you and others who qualify for coverage are typically addressed by [medical payments (MPC)](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/medical-payments-coverage) or personal injury protection (PIP) coverage. Whether MPC or PIP is available depends on the state where you live.
Theft, vandalism, weather-related and [hitting an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-likely-are-you-to-have-an-animal-collision)
* **Your car’s value** — collision insurance will pay up to your vehicle’s actual cash value (ACV), in the event of a covered loss. If [your car is worth](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/new-vs-used-car-calculate-cost-of-ownership) only a small amount, the cost of coverage might outweigh the potential benefit.
* **Repair costs** — consider whether you could pay for unexpected car repair costs out of pocket.
* **Your budget** — evaluate how adding collision insurance (and paying a deductible) fits into your overall financial picture.
Pro tip: Choosing a higher deductible usually lowers your premium, while a lower deductible typically raises it. Evaluate what works best for your [budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown) and willingness to pay out of pocket if you have a loss.
Here’s one of the most common questions about coverage: Should I consider collision insurance on an older car? The answer depends on the [vehicle’s value](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/calculate-your-vehicle-depreciation) and your specific needs.
Car insurance can feel like a lot to navigate, but understanding the details of [coverage types](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options) like collision insurance may make a big difference for your financial security on the road. Ready to take the guesswork out of choosing coverage?
