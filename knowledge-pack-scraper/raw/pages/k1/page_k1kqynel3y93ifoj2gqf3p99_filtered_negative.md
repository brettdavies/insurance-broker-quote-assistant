For example, imagine a guest falls on your property and is critically injured, and they successfully sue you for $1 million in damages. If your homeowners insurance policy's [liability coverage limit](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need#liability "How Much Homeowners Insurance Liability to Get") is $250,000, that would be used first to pay the guest. Your umbrella policy would then cover the remaining $750,000 in damages. Without a personal umbrella policy, you'd be responsible for the $750,000 yourself.
For example, if someone drives their car into the side of your house, that driver's property damage liability insurance would cover the damage to your home. Or, if the driver didn't have an auto insurance policy, the [damage may be covered](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "What Homeowners Insurance Covers") by your standard homeowners insurance policy. But your PUP cannot be used.

Let's say you carry $100,000 of bodily injury liability insurance under your auto insurance policy, which is much more than the [minimum requirement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "Insurance Requirements by State")) in most states. If the other driver in a crash sues you for $1 million in damages, you'd be responsible for the $900,000 difference.
However, if your umbrella policy is worth $2 million, it would cover the $900,000 that exceeds your auto insurance policy's limit. You would only have to pay the [deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "How to Pick a Home Insurance Deductible") for the claim.
A trampoline or ATV on your property can lead to a serious injury to a guest that may exceed the [limits of your homeowners insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/insure-expensive-homes-study "Most Expensive Homes in US Cost 66% More, on Average, to Insure"). Incidents like these can result in ongoing medical bills. Even if you don't possess significant assets, the injured party may still sue you for more than your entire net worth, because they need financial compensation beyond their own coverages. In such situations, a personal umbrella policy will help protect you.
