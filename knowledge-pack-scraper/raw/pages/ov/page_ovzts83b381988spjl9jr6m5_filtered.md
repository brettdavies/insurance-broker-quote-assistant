AAA and GEICO are two of the largest car insurance companies on the market.[[1]](#cite-1) Both companies sell car insurance and other insurance products nationwide. Any driver can purchase car insurance from GEICO, but you must have an AAA membership to get AAA car insurance.

While AAA and GEICO are two of the best car insurance companies, each one has strengths and weaknesses. Before choosing an insurance company, it’s important to [**compare rates**](/car-insurance/) as well as coverage options, discounts, customer service, and prices.

Quick Facts

* GEICO has cheaper average car insurance rates than AAA.
* GEICO has a better financial strength rating than AAA’s affiliates.
* Both companies offer a few endorsements for additional coverage.

## AAA vs. GEICO: The verdict

Based on Insurify’s review, GEICO is the better overall insurance company. GEICO’s average rate for liability-only insurance is $91 per month, which is much lower than AAA’s average rate of $125 per month.

Both AAA and GEICO offer a variety of discounts for potential savings. However, GEICO offers a bigger selection of discounts, including savings for military personnel and federal employees. Neither company offers many optional endorsements, so you have few opportunities to customize your policy with these insurers.

Both AAA and GEICO have fewer complaints than expected from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for private passenger car insurance.[[2]](#cite-2) However, GEICO has a better AM Best financial strength rating of A++ (Superior) than AAA’s regional insurance companies, most of which have an average AM Best rating of A (Excellent).[[3]](#cite-3)

## AAA

AAA auto insurance is exclusively available to AAA members who have a roadside assistance program membership. AAA sells auto insurance through regional insurance companies, like CSAA and The Auto Club Group, so you don’t get to choose which insurer underwrites your policy.

AAA’s insurance underwriters have excellent financial strength and fewer complaints than expected. But when it comes to policyholder satisfaction, AAA’s affiliates get mixed ratings based on location.[[4]](#cite-4)

Why we picked this company

The American Automobile Association (AAA) is a members-only organization known for roadside assistance — the not-for-profit company partners with regional insurance companies to offer auto insurance coverage. You must have an AAA membership to qualify for coverage, but AAA doesn’t underwrite its policies.

AAA membership perks include travel discounts, extensive roadside help, and access to exclusive DMV locations. But membership perks aren’t a selling point for AAA insurance since you can become a member without buying insurance coverage.

Pros 

* Unique membership perks
* Standard extra coverage
* High customer satisfaction

Cons

* Can’t choose a company
* Must buy membership
* Different coverage based on location

## GEICO

GEICO, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, is the third-largest car insurance company in the United States based on market share.[[1]](#cite-1) GEICO has superior financial strength and is rated above average for overall customer satisfaction by J.D. Power in most U.S. regions.[[4]](#cite-4)

The company stands out for its affordable rates and excellent discounts. However, GEICO offers few endorsements for customized coverage.

| Liability Only Liability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $91/mo |

Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $139/mo |

Why we picked this company

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
* No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
* Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

## AAA SMARTtrek vs. GEICO DriveEasy

AAA and GEICO both offer telematics-based safe driver programs. You’ll download a mobile app on your smartphone, and every time you drive, the app tracks your behaviors, like brake force, acceleration, and distracted driving. The insurer then calculates a score based on your driving habits. If you score well, you may qualify for a lower car insurance rate.

When you enroll in AAA’s SMARTtrek program, you can get a 10% participation discount during your initial policy term.[[5]](#cite-5) GEICO doesn’t advertise its DriveEasy discount percentage online, but an insurance agent can tell you how much you can save in your state.[[6]](#cite-6)

## AAA vs. GEICO: Which is the cheapest?

GEICO is the most affordable option, based on Insurify’s proprietary rate data. The average liability-only insurance rate from GEICO is $91 per month, while AAA’s average rate is $125 per month.

However, the cost of car insurance depends on many factors besides your insurance company. Your location, ZIP code, [**age**](/car-insurance/driver/age/), claim history, driving record, and your vehicle’s safety features will also affect your premium. It’s a good idea to get quotes from both companies to see which one will be the cheapest for your situation.
