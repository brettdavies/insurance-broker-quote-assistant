# Can roommates share car insurance?

Many insurers, including Progressive, allow roommates to share car insurance. If both cars are kept at the same address overnight, you can share a policy, even if you drive different vehicles or don't share a last name. Adding a roommate to your auto insurance will raise the cost of your individual policy, but it could be lower than the combined cost of two separate policies.

## Do I have to put my roommate on my car insurance?

No, as long as your roommate won't be driving your car. If your roommate drives your car at all, even occasionally, you'll want to add them as a driver on your car insurance policy. Depending on your insurer, your vehicle may not be covered if your roommate gets in an accident and isn't listed as a driver on your policy.

Depending on your [state's insurance requirements](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/) and insurance company, you may be required to disclose any driving-age people living at your residence. A disclosure would include providing the name, age, and license status of your roommate, but they can be excluded from your coverage if they don't drive your vehicle.

### Can my roommate drive my car if they aren't on my policy?

To ensure coverage, your roommate should be listed as a driver on your policy before they drive your vehicle. Damage to your vehicle may be covered if you've given your roommate permission to drive your car and they aren't listed on your policy, but it will depend on the situation and the insurer.

### Who qualifies as a roommate?

For insurance purposes, any member of your household counts as a roommate except for your [spouse](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-with-spouse/). This could be a friend, sibling, relative, fiancé, significant other, or anyone else who shares your living space.

## Pros and cons of roommates sharing car insurance

### Pros

1. Potential savings

   It could be cheaper to share one policy than own separate policies because you'll split the cost of insurance.
2. Freedom to swap vehicles

   You're usually covered when driving each other's cars.
3. Multi-car discount

   With some insurers, including Progressive, roommates can get a [multi-car discount](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/#multi-car) for having more than one car on a policy.

### Cons

1. Potentially higher rates

   If your roommate has violations on their motor vehicle report, a lower [insurance score](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-score/), or drives an expensive car, the cost of your individual policy could increase. If a roommate files a claim on your policy, it could also raise your insurance rate in the future.
2. Loss of discounts

   You could lose some discounts or other incentives for being a safe driver if your roommate's driving record isn't as clean as yours.

## FAQs about roommates and car insurance

### If we combine policies, how should we split the bill?

Many insurers, including Progressive, will provide a breakdown of the cost per vehicle so you and your roommate can split your car insurance effectively. Dividing up the cost per driver for shared [coverages like liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/liability-insurance/) may be more complicated. However, some insurers, including Progressive, will include the cost of liability coverage per vehicle in their breakdown as well. It's ultimately up to you and your roommate to decide how to split these costs, but the person with more accidents and driving violations should probably pay more because they're more expensive to insure.

### What happens if my roommate moves out?

Your former roommate will need their own policy because their vehicle will be kept at a different location. They can stay on your policy as a covered driver if they continue to borrow your car, but the roommate's vehicle must be removed from your policy.
