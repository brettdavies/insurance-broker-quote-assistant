### Factors That Affect Tesla Car Insurance Costs

A few things drive up your Tesla insurance costs:

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

Average Repair or Replacement Costs

Tesla ranks 22nd in repair affordability among 59 U.S. automakers with median annual costs of $1,034. Tesla Model 3 repair costs average $787 annually, making it Tesla's most affordable model to repair while still contributing to higher insurance premiums.

![coins2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/coins_zcfzqj.svg)

Vehicle Trim, Features and Accessories

The Tesla Model 3's high-performance capabilities (271 to 425 horsepower, 0 to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds) increase insurance premiums. Higher trim levels like Long Range cost more to insure due to advanced features, specialized parts and higher replacement values.

![gasCard icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/gasCard_owzerv.svg)

Fuel Type

Tesla Model 3s cost more to insure because they run on batteries instead of gas. When something breaks, you can't just take it to any mechanic. You need someone who knows electric cars.

Not many shops can work on Teslas yet. The ones that do charge more because they need special tools and training. Plus, Tesla parts cost more than regular car parts. Insurance companies know this, so they charge Tesla owners higher rates to cover these expensive repairs.

![usMap icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/us-map_s1ingz.svg)

Location

Tesla Model 3 owners are concentrated in California and wealthy ZIP codes (55% in top 10% wealthiest areas), where regional rates vary. Location affects rates through state regulations, weather risks, crime rates, and accident statistics. Limited repair shop availability and specialized parts in certain regions increase insurance costs due to higher repair expenses.

![male icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/male_zrocgh.svg)

Driver Profile

Most Tesla Model 3 drivers are [middle-aged (47 to 51)](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2018/11/tesla-owner-demographics/) males with incomes of $128,000 to $134,000. This demographic receives lower rates due to higher credit scores, though Tesla owners have high accident rates (around 24 per 1,000 drivers).

Driver demographics affect Tesla Model 3 rates:

+ **Age (47 to 51 median)**: Middle-aged drivers receive lower rates than younger buyers.
+ **Gender (84% male)**: Male ownership correlates with higher risk-taking behaviors.
+ **Income ($128,000 to $134,000)**: Higher credit scores reduce premiums, though wealth enables riskier vehicle purchases.
+ **Accident Rate**: Tesla owners lead all brands with about 24 accidents per 1,000 drivers.
+ **Home Ownership (56%)**: Below-average ownership rates indicate higher mobility risk.
