Drivers with clean records already pay lower rates, but GEICO’s safe driver discount makes it even easier to save. You can earn up to 22% off your auto insurance premiums by staying accident-free for one year and apply the savings to most coverages.

That early reward matters: Studies show that financial incentives like car insurance discounts can encourage safer driving habits.[[1]](#cite-1)

In this guide, we’ll explain how the [GEICO](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico) safe driver discount works, how much you can save, and how it stacks up to similar programs from other [top car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies).

## **What Is the GEICO Safe Driver Discount?**

GEICO offers a discount to drivers who maintain a clean driving record — essentially a safe driver discount. The company will give you a discount if you go at least one year without an [accident](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/at-fault-collisions) or [ticket](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/tickets).

Other than that, you don’t have to do anything. GEICO applies the discount automatically when you sign up or at renewal. You can check your car insurance discounts in the online portal.

Many car insurance companies offer [safe driver discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/safe-driver-discount), but GEICO makes it easier than most competitors. For example, companies such as [Travelers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/travelers-insurance), USAA, [The Hartford](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/the-hartford), and [Nationwide](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/nationwide-insurance) require you to have a clean driving record for at least three to five years. Others, like State Farm and Progressive, require you to join a [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount) to earn the discount.

If you get a ticket or get into an accident, you’ll lose your safe driver discount and have to wait at least a year before you can qualify again.

## **How Much Can You Save With the GEICO Safe Driver Discount?**

![A car drives down a long, empty road flanked by vast green fields under a cloudy sky.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/5278a5be6e/one-car-on-road.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

GEICO advertises that it will give up to a 22% premium reduction if you’ve kept a clean driving record. You can apply the discount to most insurance coverages on your policy, including [liability](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/liability-insurance), [collision](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance), and [comprehensive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/comprehensive-insurance). And, because GEICO rewards safe driving after just one accident-free year, you can start saving sooner.

One Reddit user helped their relative sign up for GEICO car insurance online and noticed he received a five-year good driver discount that substantially lowered the relative’s rate.[[2]](#cite-2) Unfortunately, despite having a clean record since 2016, they didn’t qualify for GEICO’s safe driver discount.

The customer couldn’t get a clear answer from the insurer as to why they couldn’t get the discount, which suggests that the discount may depend on the policy type and structure.

Another Reddit user says GEICO reduced their premium by 30% after they added their partner, who has a clean record, to their policy.[[3]](#cite-3)

### **How does GEICO’s safe driver discount compare to competitors?**

Many insurers offer safe driver discounts, including Progressive, Allstate, and GEICO. Keep in mind that other companies reward safe drivers, so shop around and [get quotes](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) from additional insurers.

That said, here’s how GEICO’s safe driving discount compares to close competitors, according to our research.

GEICO stands out for large potential savings and uncomplicated terms if you’re looking for a safe driver discount specifically. Many insurers delay safe driving discounts for years — three for Allstate and five for USAA, for example.

Some insurers, like Progressive, offer safe driving discounts only through [usage-based insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) programs that track your driving habits with a mobile app or plug-in device, depending on the company.

Additionally, companies that offer [telematics programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/how-insurance-telematics-work) can save you as much as 30% on your auto insurance premiums. It can pay off, but it comes with less privacy, and your insurance costs could go up if you get a low driving score.

## **How to Get the GEICO Safe Driver Discount**

![Smiling person sitting on a couch using a laptop in a cozy living room with shelves and soft lighting.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/b969ab81ac/man-couch-laptop.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

You don’t need to jump through many hoops to get GEICO’s safe driver discount. GEICO reviews your driving history when you sign up or renew your policy. You can also request that the company review your record.

GEICO usually applies the discount automatically if you’ve gone at least one year without an accident or traffic violation.

To meet GEICO’s eligibility requirements — and [get the most savings](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) possible — follow these steps:

1. **Avoid accidents and tickets.** Maintaining a clean driving history can help you keep your auto insurance premiums low.
2. **Confirm your discount.** Go into your online portal or confirm your discount with an agent.
3. **Take a driver training course**. If available, enroll in a course to learn road safety techniques (and potentially earn an additional [driver training discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/driver-safety-discount)).

Maximize your discount with other GEICO savings, such as discounts for vehicle equipment, safety features, or driver training.

## **Other GEICO Discounts to Consider**

Yes, GEICO offers a safe driver discount of up to 22% if you’ve been accident-free for at least one year. The company also offers telematics discounts and car insurance savings resources. Eligibility criteria vary by state, so check with an agent if you have questions.

Nationwide offers the largest advertised safe driver discount, with drivers shaving up to 40% off their auto insurance rates, according to our research.

GEICO’s safe driver discount can get you premium reductions of up to 22% on some insurance coverage if you qualify. That means liability, comprehensive, collision, and potentially more coverage options, depending on the rules in your state.

GEICO checks your driving record when you sign up or renew a policy. The company usually applies all auto insurance policy discounts, like the safe driver discount and vehicle safety equipment discounts, automatically when the company verifies information like your driving history.
