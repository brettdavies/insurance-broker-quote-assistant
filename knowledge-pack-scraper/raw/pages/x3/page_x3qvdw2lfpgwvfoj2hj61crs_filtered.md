## Amica vs. GEICO FAQs

Still on the fence about whether Amica or GEICO is the best option for your car insurance needs? Here, you’ll find the answers to some frequently asked questions about both insurers.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

GEICO doesn’t have a single top competitor. Other large insurance companies that offer similar products to GEICO (like [**homeowners insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/)) and are widely available include State Farm, Allstate, Nationwide, Progressive, and Liberty Mutual.

Amica Mutual is considered to be a good insurance company, at least when it comes to financial security. This insurer earned an AM Best score of A+ (Superior), which indicates it’s very financially secure and likely to pay out future claims.[[2]](#cite-2)

Both Amica and GEICO offer a fairly standard suite of car insurance coverage options, like liability only, full coverage, medical payments, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. The key differences are the fact that GEICO generally has lower rates and Amica has more coverage offerings. For example, Amica offers auto loan or lease coverage, while GEICO doesn’t.
