### State Farm stonewalls the claims processing process
I was hit by a State Farm insured driver. I am also insured by State Farm. Good luck getting the claims adjuster to return your calls or make any attempt to process your claim, especially if his name is Nathaniel [REDACTED NAME]. I was hit by a driver over 3 weeks ago and still have not received a call back from the adjuster. They do not have an escalation process, a supervisor to speak to, a complaint department, etc....

Good luck getting the claims adjuster to return your calls or make any attempt to process your claim, especially if his name is Nathaniel [REDACTED NAME]. I was hit by a driver over 3 weeks ago and still have not received a call back from the adjuster. They do not have an escalation process, a supervisor to speak to, a complaint department, etc.... You are basically at the whim of one individual with NO RECOURSE. NONE! I need my vehicle fixed and cannot get it done and have no one to escalate the issue to. Pathetic.

### Run from State Farm, they are not what they use tobe!
State Farm Wow have you changed The game they play now is they check to see if they make more money totaling your car out and selling parts off of it and then giving you wholesale price( who buys wholesale besides car dealers). Vs fixing your car Be worn State Farm drivers, State Farm will tell the drivers to lie on accidents so make sure you always get a accident report,

I don’t know why, but I believe it was an error on their part for not submitting all the paperwork in a timely fashion. I cashed the check and used the money to pay other bills as I am a disabled senior citizen on a fixed income. The agent phoned me some time later and said I should have not cashed the check, it was an error on their part and I need to pay them that money ($119.83) back or they will cancel my insurance. So, I had to pay them again, or risk losing my insurance coverage. DO NOT USE THIS AGENT. THEY ARE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE AND DO NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

### Incompetent [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] of State Farm
[REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] of State Farm El Cajon, CA is a flagrantly incompetent insurance agent.

[REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] of State Farm El Cajon, CA is a flagrantly incompetent insurance agent. I’ve had State Farm car insurance for 15 years and have decided to cancel my insurance with them because of his mismanagement of my account. He overcharged me and then his company sent texts and emails stating my car insurance would be imminently cancelled. When I called to address this [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] said this was an error and then charged me a made up number less than the original amount. When I explicitly asked if I owed anything else, I was told I did not. Likely to get me off the phone so he could return to not doing his job. I still continued to receive impending cancellation notices which [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] kept apologizing for. Shows how organized that office is. [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] then proceeded to overcharge me the original amount on my next bill, I presume thinking I wouldn’t notice. He then insisted that this is the amount I’m supposed to pay. The inconsistency and the lying is inexcusable. I have never spent so much time emailing and calling an insurance company. If [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] knew how to do his job like all the other agents I have worked with over years then I would have stayed loyal to State Farm. He should be fired by State Farm.

### Loyalty doesn’t pay with Statefarm they could careless
I’ve been with StateFarm for 39 years. It is the ONLY Auto insurance I have ever had. I personally have no tickets and no accidents however 2 other people in my household have had one car totaled and a RV fire. As a result apparently Statefarm looks at it as the whole household.

I’ve been with StateFarm for 39 years. It is the ONLY Auto insurance I have ever had. I personally have no tickets and no accidents however 2 other people in my household have had one car totaled and a RV fire. As a result apparently Statefarm looks at it as the whole household. My policy has been randomly canceled. Now there’s some loyalty for ya huh? I did nothing!!!! NOTHING yet because other members in my household had claims MY policy gets canceled. 39 years wow really? No wonder they got downgraded they have no good business sense. That is just a dumb way to loose revenue not gain. Unbelievable. And Gigi doesn’t care she is insensitive to clients regardless. She said “hey this is how I pay my bills” wow so just cancel people who have done NOTHING WRONG ya that’s fantastic for gaining revenue and building a brokerage. Good Job Gigi!! You should be proud for canceling a 39 year loyal customer who ended up going elsewhere getting the same coverage for cheaper. So glad you have no idea how to maintain revenue and build a solid business. Bravo to ya! Let’s also not forget you brought up a claim my husband had. And I had to remind you he has been dead for 8 years. Yep good job! Your response of trying to point out they are my family members is ridiculous. The bottom line is MY policy was canceled for something others did family or not. I did NOT deserve that kind of treatment after 39 years of loyalty. You as an agent should have done something. I’ve spoken to a couple other agents and it appears you’re just not really sure how to get things done for your clients.

### Two thumbs down for the claims department.
State Farm appears to be riding high with their NFL player commercials all the while treating their customers with little to no valve. State Farm’s claim department is cheap and unorganized. You’ll get a different answer to the same question every time you talk to a different claim specialist. When it comes to getting your car fixed expect to have to pay for repairs. I have full coverage and had damage done to my car. When I took it to a shop...
State Farm appears to be riding high with their NFL player commercials all the while treating their customers with little to no valve. State Farm’s claim department is cheap and unorganized. You’ll get a different answer to the same question every time you talk to a different claim specialist. When it comes to getting your car fixed expect to have to pay for repairs. I have full coverage and had damage done to my car. When I took it to a shop recommended by the dealer the State Farm adjuster undercut the shops prices left and right leaving me with a $1167.00 bill. Then they give me bs excuses why I’m out of pocket. I can only imagine what they would do if my house was damaged from a Hurricane or wind storm. This has been a terrible experience for my wife and I and will be switching to a different insurance company in the near future.

### Excellent Insurance Experience with State Farm
I unfortunately hit a deer and my front end was damaged to a small extent. State Farm made my car repair and rental car process seamless. Since there was no one involved in my accident besides myself, I decided to try their app to log my claim and I had a very easy experience. I didn't have to submit photos since it was a deer that caused it and it gave me next steps clearly and quickly. It gave me a list of collision centers and rental car pla...
I unfortunately hit a deer and my front end was damaged to a small extent. State Farm made my car repair and rental car process seamless. Since there was no one involved in my accident besides myself, I decided to try their app to log my claim and I had a very easy experience. I didn't have to submit photos since it was a deer that caused it and it gave me next steps clearly and quickly. It gave me a list of collision centers and rental car places, let me know what my rental car allowance was since I had recently added that to my policy, and let me know my deductible clearly at the end. I did everything through the app. Within a few hours, someone called me from State Farm to make sure I was okay and to ask if I needed any clarification or help navigating the app. She was caring and easy to talk to. I also love my agent, Bob Garrigan, and his whole team. They have always been there to discuss things with, to make good decisions with, and to support whatever I choose to do. I have never felt taken advantage of. I had two other accident claims with them a few years ago. Both went smoothly as well - both times, men rear-ended me. The first gentleman lied about it to avoid a policy issue on his end and my agent stayed the course and continued to patiently work with his insurance company until they took ownership of his actions and paid the claim. The second time I was rear-ended, the young man didn't contest his part in it, but the collision center was difficult to work with and State Farm had to call them out for their poor performance and work on my behalf. This is how an insurance company should treat their customer. I plan to stay with State Farm for as long as they give five star service.

### To "Insure" a downfall
State Farm, as with many insurance companies care about only 1 thing. Money. I think the best way to understand it is just to watch the Incredibles, and that scene with Bob at his job. Does it matter who is at fault? No. Does it matter what the circumstances were? No. Does it matter if anybody is being unethical? No. What matters is the cold, hard cash. You can pay thousands of dollars, have a fender bender with barely a scratch and OOOP, they ha...
State Farm, as with many insurance companies care about only 1 thing. Money. I think the best way to understand it is just to watch the Incredibles, and that scene with Bob at his job. Does it matter who is at fault? No. Does it matter what the circumstances were? No. Does it matter if anybody is being unethical? No. What matters is the cold, hard cash. You can pay thousands of dollars, have a fender bender with barely a scratch and OOOP, they had to pay money to fix it? Strike one. Soon enough, you are out with yesterday's garbage. Heaven forbid you have a child learning how to drive and something goes wrong. I can promise you it will haunt them for years to come. They say they only look at the past three years. That would be a lie. They say they have your back, and that would be a lie. Any possibility they have to pay anything, even if only partial fault, they can, and will, throw the sack at ya. With that said, it does have some lovely agents. I could rave about how awesome they are. Heck, an agent thought it would be ridiculous to sack somebody over what happened to me, but, you know, he appealed and the company still said "Whaaat, we must pay money even though the person has barely had issues? No way!" Amazing how they can hire good ethical employees, but can't be a good ethical business. You can spend way more in premiums than they have ever had to pay for anything, but who cares? They don't want to to ever have to do their job. Insurance is required by law. But what is the point of having insurance when at the snap of the fingers they can dig up something that happened when you were learning how to drive and compare it to a small fender bender in the future and say "We don't want that!" What is to feel safe about? The motto "we got your back... as long as you are the only one who has to pay us anything. Ever." Should be their slogan. You can't learn from mistakes, even if you never make them again, you can't have complications with a new license without it haunting your future. You can't be human, and sometimes make human error. Insurance is there to ensure you will be ok. The only thing state farm ensures is their path to your wallet, and a way to ditch if any of YOUR money ever has to come back to you because things happen.

### Ridiculous Rate Increases
They just raised my rate by $100.00 which was bad enough but they raised my mother's $400.00. She's on a fixed income and her rate was already ridiculously high. She has a good driving record and has been with SF for decades. When we made a move to the West coast, they doubled what she was paying back home (from a little over $600.00 per yr to $1200 every six months) and now to raise it another $400.00 after six months is adding insult to inju...

When we made a move to the West coast, they doubled what she was paying back home (from a little over $600.00 per yr to $1200 every six months) and now to raise it another $400.00 after six months is adding insult to injury. She worked her entire life and always paid her bill on time. No accidents, tickets, etc. No way she can afford $1600.00 every six months. That's if they don't raise it again in 6 months. It is appalling that they treat decades long customers this way. She's supposed to be enjoying retirement but how is she supposed to do that when she can't drive? If you think being with SF forever will help you in your twilight years forget it. They don't care about longterm business. Obviously, they raised her rate so much because they know she can't pay that much and they get to drop her without being called out for age discrimination. Changing companies ASAP.

I would not recommend this app. Allstatea was much more user friendly and less \"Big Brother.\"
