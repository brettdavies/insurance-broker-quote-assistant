## Home insurance and flood damage

[Homeowners insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) **doesn’t cover flood damage,** but flood insurance can. If rising water from a storm damages your home, a separate flood policy is the only way to be fully protected.

Most homeowners don’t realize this gap exists. In fact, **67% don’t have proper coverage for [natural](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-home-insurance-cover-natural-disasters/)[disasters](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-home-insurance-cover-natural-disasters/)** like floods or earthquakes.[[1]](#footnote-1)

While standard policies [may cover things like burst pipes or appliance leaks](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage/), **they won’t help if water enters from outside**, such as during a storm surge or heavy rain. That’s why **flood insurance matters**, even in areas with moderate or low risk.

![map]()

#### Floods can happen anywhere

**Flooding has happened in nearly every county in the U.S., and all 50 states have seen flood events.**[[2]](#footnote-2) FEMA’s maps mostly focus on rivers and coastal areas, but they don’t always show newer risks like flash floods, which are becoming more common, even in places that aren’t near water.[[3]](#footnote-3)

## Do you really need flood insurance?

If you live in a **high-risk flood zone**, your **[mortgage lender](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/guide/lender-requirements/) may require you to buy flood insurance**. That’s because your lender wants to protect the value of your home, just like you do. Sometimes, lenders may even require it in lower-risk areas, just to be safe. Every property is in a "flood zone," however, they're all categorized by their risk level, even if that happens to be "low risk."

If your home is in a moderate- or low-risk area, flood insurance usually isn’t required. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a good idea. In fact, **40% of flood insurance claims come from homes in low- or moderate-risk zones**.[[2]](#footnote-2)

So even if your lender doesn’t require it, getting flood coverage could help you avoid huge repair costs if the unexpected happens.

![Johnny Hawkins]()

Agent Insight: Regional disasters can affect rates everywhere

"The more natural disasters we experience, the more insurance companies have to pay out, leading them to increase rates to recoup their losses. As a result, policyholders may see rate increases not just in states directly impacted but across the board. However, the biggest rate hikes typically occur in states hit hardest by these events."

## Will home insurance cover water damage?

Standard homeowners insurance doesn’t cover damage from flooding caused by storms, heavy rain, [hurricanes](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-hurricane-damage/), or other disasters. About **90% of [natural disasters](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-home-insurance-cover-natural-disasters/) in the U.S. involve** flooding, too, so staying protected by adding flood insurance is generally a good idea.[[4]](#footnote-4)

While traditional flooding isn’t covered, **your home insurance does protect against certain types of water damage**, and these are usually outlined in your policy. Common covered situations include:

* Burst pipes or plumbing malfunctions
* Damage from rain or snow entering your home
* Overflow from a broken appliance, like a water heater or sump pump
* [Roof leaks](/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-leaks/) that lead to water seeping into your home
* Vandalism that causes water damage

If you’re not planning to buy flood insurance but still want more peace of mind, you can often **add a [sewer or water backup](/homeowners-insurance/coverage/sewer-backup-coverage/) endorsement**. This gives you extra protection if water backs up into your home through drains or plumbing.

> 90% of all natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding.

## How much does standard homeowners insurance cost?

It’s natural to focus on price when shopping for homeowners insurance, but the [cheapest policy](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance/) isn’t always the best fit. If a quote seems unusually low, take a closer look at what’s actually covered.

To give you a general idea, we’ve gathered average rates from top insurers in each state. Just keep in mind: your cost may vary based on things like where you live, your home’s age and size, and even your claims or credit history.

The key is finding a policy that fits your budget and protects what matters most.

## How to get flood insurance

The majority of flood policies are written by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), though a small number of private insurance companies offer flood coverage as well. Use the menu below to learn more about the methods for buying flood insurance.

National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
Chevron down icon

* Most flood insurance policies in the U.S. are backed by the NFIP.
* You can purchase an NFIP policy through major insurers like [GEICO](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) or [Progressive](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/progressive-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) — they act as intermediaries, but the policy itself is provided by the federal government.
* NFIP also offers [flood insurance for renters](https://www.thezebra.com/renters-insurance/coverage/does-renters-insurance-cover-flooding/), which can be added alongside a [renters insurance policy](https://www.thezebra.com/renters-insurance/).
* If you already have a homeowners policy, your current insurer may be able to offer NFIP coverage at a competitive rate.

FEMA’s Write Your Own (WYO) program
Chevron down icon

* FEMA works with private insurance companies to offer flood coverage under the companies’ own names.
* These companies manage policy sales and claims, but the coverage is still funded by the federal government through FEMA’s [reinsurance](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/what-is-reinsurance/) program.

Private flood insurance
Chevron down icon

* Some regional and specialty insurers offer fully private flood insurance policies.
* These policies often include higher coverage limits and additional benefits, such as living expenses or shorter waiting periods.
* Availability can vary, and not all private policies are accepted by mortgage lenders.

## What does flood insurance actually cover?

Flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the most common option for homeowners, but it’s important to understand its limits. **Coverage caps out at $250,000 for your home and $100,000 for belongings**, which may not be enough if, for example, your home would cost $400,000 to rebuild or you have items like a backyard hot tub that aren’t covered.

NFIP policies also come with a 3**0-day waiting period** before coverage begins. Some private insurers may offer higher limits and shorter or no waiting periods, depending on your situation.

### ✅ What flood insurance does cover (NFIP)

* Your home’s structure (up to $250,000): foundation, walls, flooring
* Plumbing and electrical systems
* Water heaters and central air
* Built-in features like carpet, paneling, and window blinds
* Built-in appliances such as dishwashers and bookcases
* [Your belongings](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/personal-property-insurance/) (up to $100,000): furniture, clothing, electronics
* Limited coverage for valuables (up to $2,500 for jewelry, artwork, or collectibles)
* Separate [deductibles](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/home-insurance-deductibles/) apply for the building and contents [[5]](#footnote-5)

### 🚫 What flood insurance doesn’t cover

* [Temporary living expenses](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/additional-living-expenses-coverage/) (like hotel stays or meals)
* [Mold, mildew, or long-term moisture](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold/) damage from poor maintenance
* Outdoor property: fences, decks, patios, pools, landscaping
* [Vehicles](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-flood-damage/) and anything stored inside them
* Cash, coins, or valuable paper documents
* Damage that exceeds NFIP limits (e.g., rebuilding costs over $250,000)

## How much does flood insurance cost?

Flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) **typically costs between $400 and $1,500 per year for single-family homes.** Many homeowners pay under $1,000, but costs can vary widely depending on your property and location.

That’s because FEMA’s pricing system (known as Risk Rating 2.0) looks at your home’s **individual flood risk**, not just your zone on a map. Your rate is based on factors like:

* How close your home is to water
* The type of flooding that could affect your area (flash floods, coastal surges, etc.)
* Your home’s structure, elevation, and rebuild cost
* Whether your home has any flood-prevention features

If you're in a low-risk area or your home is built to better withstand flooding, you may pay less. Some homeowners are still on a gradual path toward their full rate, so your current premium might increase over time, but by law, it won’t rise more than 18% per year.

**Bottom line:** Most people pay under $1,500, but your actual cost depends on your unique risk. You can get a quote from an agent or check your property’s flood zone using FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center.[[6]](#footnote-6)

Learn more about flood zones and how rates are set
Chevron down icon

* **Flood zones** are assigned by FEMA. Homes in zones **A or V** are high risk; zones **B, C, or X** are lower risk.
* **Pre-FIRM homes** (built before 1975) may cost more to insure because they weren’t built using modern flood data.
* **Post-FIRM homes** (built after 1975) may qualify for lower rates.
* FEMA’s new **Risk Rating 2.0** system now uses more personalized factors to determine rates — some homeowners may see gradual rate increases, while others may benefit from lower premiums.

You can check your home’s flood zone using FEMA’s flood map tool on their website.

![NFIP vs. private flood insurance]()

NFIP vs. private flood insurance: what’s the difference?

The NFIP is the go-to option for most homeowners, but if the value of your home and belongings surpass the limits of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, you may need to look for excess flood coverage by way of private insurers. You have the option of carrying both NFIP *and*private flood insurance or choosing one private carrier for all of your flood coverage needs.

## Pros and cons of private flood insurance

Private flood insurance can be a great option if you need more coverage than what the NFIP offers, especially for higher-value homes or unique properties. But like any insurance choice, it’s worth looking at both the benefits and trade-offs.

Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons to help you decide if private flood coverage is a good fit for your needs.

Pros

* **Short or no waiting period** before coverage kicks in
* **Higher coverage limits**: Ideal for [high-value homes](/homeowners-insurance/policies/high-value-insurance/) and assets
* **Replacement cost** coverage for personal belongings
* **Covers more**: Other structures, additional living expenses, lost income
* **May be cheaper** than combining NFIP and private policies

Cons

* **Premiums vary**: No standardized pricing like NFIP
* **No federal backing**: It depends on the insurer’s financial stability
* **May not meet lender requirements**
* **Coverage can be dropped**: Some policies can be canceled even before a storm

Standard home insurance doesn’t cover flood damage, but a separate flood policy can. Whether through the NFIP or a private insurer, having coverage in place can protect your home and savings from the growing risk of severe weather and rising water.

Flooding doesn’t just affect high-risk areas, and coverage costs vary by location and home. If you’re unsure whether you need it, getting a quote is an easy first step.

## Home insurance and floods: FAQs

Does homeowners insurance cover flood damage?
Chevron down icon

No, standard home insurance doesn’t cover flood damage from storms or rising water. It may cover water damage from things like burst pipes or leaky appliances, but for protection against actual flooding, you’ll need a separate flood insurance policy.

What types of water damage are covered by home insurance?
Chevron down icon

Most policies cover sudden water damage, like from a burst pipe or broken appliance. But damage caused by neglect, poor maintenance, or long-term leaks usually isn’t covered. It’s always a good idea to review your policy details to understand what’s included; if you have questions or don't understand your coverage, ask your insurance agent for clarification.

Do I need flood insurance if I don't live in a flood zone?
Chevron down icon

Possibly. Floods can happen anywhere — even in low-risk areas. Flash flooding is becoming more common, and many claims come from places outside high-risk zones. If you want peace of mind, it’s worth considering coverage no matter where you live.

What does NFIP flood insurance cover?
Chevron down icon

It typically covers your home’s structure (up to $250,000) and your belongings (up to $100,000) from flood damage. Coverage is limited, so visit [FloodSmart.gov](https://www.floodsmart.gov/) or contact FEMA for full details.
