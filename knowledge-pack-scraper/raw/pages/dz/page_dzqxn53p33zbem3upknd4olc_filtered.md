# What's the difference between named perils vs. open perils coverage?

Insurance policies cover you in the event of "perils" — specific circumstances that may cause damage or loss to the things you own, like your home or belongings. Coverage for "open perils" means you're potentially covered in the event of any peril unless that peril has been excluded from your policy. Coverage for "named perils" means you're only protected against the perils specifically listed in your policy.

## What is "named perils" coverage?

Coverage for named perils — and the similar term of "specified peril" coverage — means that the policy may cover damage or loss from all potential perils unless specifically excluded in that insurance policy.

## What is "open perils" coverage?

Coverage for “open perils”— and similar terms such as "all perils," "all risk," or "special perils," coverage — means that damage or loss from all potential perils may be covered unless specifically excluded in the insurance policy.

Flooding is an example of a peril generally excluded from coverage. For this and other exclusions, you may be able to add riders or purchase separate policies such as [flood insurance](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) to insure your home against damage from excluded perils.

## Choosing “named perils” vs. open peril coverage

An open peril version of any policy coverage will likely be more expensive than the "named-peril" version of the same policy coverage. An open peril policy provides broader coverage than the “named peril” policy.
