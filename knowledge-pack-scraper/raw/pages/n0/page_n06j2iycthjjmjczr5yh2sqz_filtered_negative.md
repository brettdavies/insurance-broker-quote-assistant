# How can I estimate homeowners insurance cost?
[Jennifer Phillips](https://www.rate.com/insurance/resources/how-can-i-estimate-homeowners-insurance-cost/#authorInfo) [Home](https://www.rate.com/insurance/category/home/)
In practical terms, this means that if the cost to rebuild your home and replace your belongings is $400,000, you would need replacement cost coverage in the amount of _at least_ $320,000 to be considered fully covered.
A caution on personal property—don’t try and just guess what dollar amount might _sound_ like enough to replace your belongings. Homeowners frequently underestimate the amount of property they own, and underestimate the cost of replacing those items, particularly if you have to buy them new—and all at once.
