Our team of insurance experts also rated insurance companies based on several categories. These categories include average rates, discounts, coverage options, third-party customer service ratings and app/website experience. We weighted these categories based on what customers value in an insurance company.

For third-party customer service ratings, we included complaint index scores from the NAIC and financial strength ratings from AM Best. NAIC complaint index scores are used to determine how satisfied customers are with their claims, while financial strength ratings from AM Best reflect the ability to pay out claims.
