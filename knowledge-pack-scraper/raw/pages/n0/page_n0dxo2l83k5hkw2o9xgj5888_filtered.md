# What is RV comprehensive and collision coverage?

Comprehensive and collision are two different types of coverages that can cover physical damage to your RV. Comprehensive protects against events outside your control: theft, vandalism, fire, glass breakage, collisions with animals, and weather-related issues. Collision covers repairs caused by collisions with other vehicles or objects. A deductible of your choice typically applies for both RV comprehensive and collision coverages.

## What does comprehensive insurance cover on an RV?

[Comprehensive coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-insurance/) can safeguard your motorhome or trailer from events beyond your control such as:

* Hail
* High winds
* Lightning
* Fire
* Vandalism
* Hitting an animal
* Broken glass that isn't the result of a collision
* [RV theft](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-theft-insurance-prevention-tips/)

## What does collision insurance cover on an RV?

[Collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/collision-insurance/) can pay for damage to your motorhome or trailer from collisions with vehicles or objects, such as a:

* Fence
* Tree
* Guardrail
* Hit and run
* One vehicle accident

If your RV is damaged, your policy's comprehensive or collision coverage may pay to repair or replace your RV, less the amount of your deductible. Choosing a higher comprehensive and collision deductible can lower the cost of your RV policy.

## Is RV comprehensive and collision coverage required?

Comprehensive and collision coverages aren't required by state law for motorhomes or travel trailers. However, if you finance or lease your motorhome or travel trailer, most lenders **require comprehensive and collision coverage**. If you hold the title or your RV is paid off, it's up to you if you want to carry either coverage.

## Is RV comprehensive and collision coverage worth it?

If a lender doesn't require you to carry comprehensive and collision, the decision to carry RV comprehensive or collision coverages comes down to your finances, risk tolerance, and the value of your RV. Comprehensive and collision coverage for your motorhome will raise your policy's rate, so ask yourself whether it's more important to pay less for RV insurance or to have coverage down the road if your RV is damaged, stolen, or totaled.

If your RV is worth less than a few thousand dollars, it may not be worth carrying physical damage coverages—especially if your comprehensive or collision deductible is $1,000 or more. If your travel trailer or motorhome is one of your most valuable assets, or even your primary residence, protecting your investment against damage and loss can be crucial.
