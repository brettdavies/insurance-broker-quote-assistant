> Florida's no-fault rules have grown stricter in recent years. You can usually only receive the full $10,000 in PIP coverage if you had an "emergency medical condition" resulting from the crash.
Florida's no-fault/PIP laws have grown stricter in recent years. The only way for a car insurance claimant to receive the full **$10,000** in PIP coverage for treatment of car accident injuries is if a qualified medical care provider determines that the claimant had an "**emergency medical condition** " resulting from the crash, and the treatment was for that condition.
The claimant can only receive **$2,500** in PIP coverage for car accident-related medical treatment if a health care provider concludes that the claimant **_did not_ have an emergency medical condition** stemming from the car accident.
_A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, which may include severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following:_
_1. Serious jeopardy to patient health, including a pregnant woman or fetus._
_2. Serious impairment to bodily functions._
_3. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part._
So, as long as you went to the emergency room, or saw your doctor, or otherwise received valid medical care of some kind in the first two weeks after the accident, you're entitled to receive payment for 80 percent of your reasonably-incurred medical expenses. You don't need to be done receiving treatment within 14 days; you just need to have received _any_ accident-related medical care within that time.
