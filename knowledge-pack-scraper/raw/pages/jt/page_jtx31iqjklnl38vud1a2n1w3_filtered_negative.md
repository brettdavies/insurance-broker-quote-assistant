# Why Won’t California Auto Insurers Disclose Policy Limits in Liability Claims?
* [![Picture of Sasha Bojat](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/085e572d4926436b06dc5ac5c42b8bfd6ca4b8b2b1c279e4de9a9ac3edc400b4?s=96&d=mm&r=g) Sasha Bojat  ](https://bojatlaw.com/blog)

Shortly after a [car accident](https://www.bojatlaw.com/los-angeles-car-accident-lawyer/) where a third party gets injured and seeks compensation for medical expenses from the at-fault driver, there’s often a request for auto insurance policy limits information. Typically, an attorney or public adjuster contacts the insurance company to urge them to reveal the policy limits.
Individuals well-versed in this procedure make demands for policy limits, which encompass [umbrella coverage and excess amounts](https://www.bojatlaw.com/blog/what-is-the-cost-of-uninsured-motorist-coverage/). When insurance companies choose not to reveal this information or only disclose it partially, they gain a strategic edge by forcing the injured party to negotiate without knowing the full extent of potential compensation available.
In cases involving claims by third parties, one of the most crucial pieces of information is the total available funds to compensate the victim. This “policy limits” data is so pivotal that some liability insurers guard it closely, refraining from disclosing it to prevent its use in negotiations.

## ****Understanding How Insurance Policy Works****
![Screenshot 2024 07 08 at 21.55.31 min](https://www.bojatlaw.com/blog/why-wont-california-auto-insurers-disclose-policy-limits-in-liability-claims/)Why Won’t California Auto Insurers Disclose Policy Limits in Liability Claims? 3
Every liability insurance policy comes with a defined limit, representing the maximum sum the insurance company commits to covering for losses resulting from a covered incident.
Consider purchasing car insurance featuring a liability policy capped at $20,000. In an accident where you’re at fault, the insurer will only disburse up to $20,000 to cover injuries or vehicle damages suffered by others.
Should the total damages amount to $50,000, the insurer won’t cover the additional $30,000. In such a scenario, if a judge or jury awards this excess amount, you’ll need to seek the remaining funds from alternative sources.
Understanding the insurance company’s interests in not disclosing policy limits can help policyholders navigate their claims more effectively.
## ****Knowing the Insurance Policy Limits****
The law requires drivers to have auto insurance that meets specific standards. In California, drivers must maintain a minimum of:
* Bodily injury liability coverage of at least **$15,000** per person or**$30,000** per accident
* Property damage liability coverage of at least **$5,000**
* Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage of at least **$15,000** per person or **$30,000** per accident
Those responsible for injuries should possess at least this level of coverage. Some drivers might have policies exceeding these amounts, often reflecting the maximum settlement their insurer will offer an injured driver.
Typically, insurance companies involved in liability claims refrain from disclosing policy limit details before litigation begins, although they are legally required to reveal this information through formal discovery processes as outlined in [California’s Judicial Council Form Interrogatories](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/jcc-form/DISC-001), specifically in section 4.1(e).
In California, when a claimant requests policy limits information pre-litigation, the insurance carrier must promptly inquire in writing to their insured about releasing this information. If the insured consents in writing, the carrier can communicate the policy limits to the claimant. Otherwise, the absence of documented consent could jeopardize the carrier’s position if the case could have settled within the policy limits pre-litigation but resulted in an excess at trial, potentially leading to liability and exposure beyond the policy limits.
Understanding personal injury law is crucial for navigating these requirements and ensuring adequate compensation in the event of an accident.
This creates a divergence of interests between insurers and policyholders. Non-disclosure favors the insurer economically, while disclosure could benefit the policyholder by facilitating purposeful settlements, aiding case evaluation, discouraging excessive demands, and potentially preventing litigation.
## ****What Are Umbrella Policies?****
Umbrella policies, also known as excess liability insurance, provide additional coverage beyond primary insurance limits. Key features include:
* **Coverage Extension:** Activates when primary policy limits are exceeded.
* **Broad Protection:** Covers various liabilities not included in primary policies.
* **Higher Limits:** Offers substantial coverage, often starting at $1 million.
* **Cost-Effective:** Affordable protection against significant financial losses.
* **Versatility:** Covers worldwide liabilities and legal defense costs.
Recommended for high-net-worth individuals, business owners, and homeowners seeking comprehensive liability protection. Consult with an insurance professional to assess if an umbrella policy suits your needs.
## ****Do Insurance Companies Lie About Policy Limits?****
![Copy of Copy of Blog photos 6 min](https://www.bojatlaw.com/blog/why-wont-california-auto-insurers-disclose-policy-limits-in-liability-claims/)Why Won’t California Auto Insurers Disclose Policy Limits in Liability Claims? 4
Many individuals hold the mistaken belief that the primary aim of insurance companies is to assist them. Regrettably, their foremost objective isn’t necessarily centered on aiding you with your losses.
Just like any other business, insurance companies want to earn a profit. If each client receives a maximum payout for their injury claim, the company’s ROI (Return on Investment) will be deficient. Therefore, insurance adjusters do everything possible to minimize payouts or deny claims, including making false statements. Consulting with an experienced personal injury attorney can help you navigate these challenges and ensure you receive fair compensation.
When speaking to an insurance adjuster, you must understand that they represent the at-fault party. For the sake of your claim, this makes them your opponent. Having an experienced personal injury lawyer handle all communications can help protect your claim.
## ****Why Do California Auto Insurers Withhold Policy Limits?****
**Strategic Advantage:** Auto insurers often argue that keeping policy limits confidential gives them a strategic advantage during settlement negotiations. By not revealing these limits upfront, they aim to control the direction and outcome of discussions, potentially limiting their financial liability.
**Economic Interests:** From an economic standpoint, insurers prefer to settle claims within their policy limits to avoid paying excess judgments. Disclosing these limits could lead claimants to demand amounts that approach or exceed the coverage available, which insurers seek to avoid.
**Legal Considerations:** Under California law, insurers are not legally required to disclose policy limits until a lawsuit is filed. This lack of transparency can leave injured parties at a disadvantage, especially when negotiating settlements without knowing the full extent of available coverage.
**Impact on Settlement Negotiations:** For individuals seeking fair compensation for medical bills, property damage, and pain and suffering, understanding policy limits is essential. Without this information, it’s challenging for injured parties and their attorneys to accurately assess the value of a claim and negotiate effectively.
## **Should I Disclose My Policy Limits In California?**
Navigating policy limit disclosure in California poses a crucial question for those involved in insurance claims. While not legally mandated, revealing policy limits can foster trust and transparency. However, premature disclosure might limit negotiation flexibility. Seeking legal counsel becomes essential, as experienced attorneys can guide individuals on the strategic and ethical implications, ensuring a fair and balanced negotiation process for all parties involved in the claim.
