# Concrete Block vs Engineered Wood Frame
May 13, 2025March 19, 2010
![The Valverde Wood Interior Framing](https://blog.icihomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-valverde-wood-frame.jpg)The exterior walls are constructed with 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 dimensional lumber. The lumber member is spaced between 12″ and 16″ on center and is determined by the engineer using required building codes. The wall is anchored from the bottom of the wall at the slab to the top of the wall. The wall sits on a pressure treated 2×4 on top of a weather barrier that sits on the concrete slab itself.
