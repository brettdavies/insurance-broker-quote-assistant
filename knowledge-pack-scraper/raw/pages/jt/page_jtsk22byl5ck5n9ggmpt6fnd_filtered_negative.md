State law requires California drivers to carry at least minimum limits for bodily injury and property damage [liability insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/liability-car-insurance), which increased at the beginning of 2025.
**Bodily injury liability coverage (BI)**
If you’re at fault in an accident that injures someone else, this covers their medical costs and other injury-related expenses, up to your policy’s limits. It can also pay for your legal fees if you’re taken to court in the accident’s aftermath. Note that bodily injury liability insurance doesn’t cover your expenses.
California drivers are required to meet these minimum BI coverage limits:
* $30,000 for injury or death to one person
* $60,000 for injury or death to more than one person in an accident
**Property damage liability coverage (PD)**
Property damage liability insurance covers damage you cause to someone else’s property when you’re at fault in an accident. This could be a fence, a building, or another driver’s car. Motorists in the state are required to carry $15,000 in property damage liability coverage.
### Additional car insurance coverage to consider in California
Beyond the liability coverage required by state law, there are other types of coverage you may want, depending on your circumstances. These include:
#### Uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM)
[Uninsured motorist](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/uninsured-motorist-car-insurance) covers your expenses if you’re in an accident with an at-fault driver who doesn’t have insurance. Underinsured motorist covers your costs after an accident with an at-fault driver who doesn’t have adequate insurance to cover damages.
#### Collision
This pays to repair or replace your vehicle if you collide with another vehicle or an object, such as a fence or tree. [Collision coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-coverage-options) is often required by a lender or lessor if you finance or lease a car.
#### Comprehensive
This pays for non-collision damage to your vehicle. For instance, it can cover flood or fire damage, hail damage, vandalism, and theft. Lenders and lessors also often require[ comprehensive](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/comprehensive-car-insurance) coverage.
#### Medical payments (MedPay)
This covers injury-related expenses for you and your passengers after an accident. [MedPay](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-coverage-options) covers expenses regardless of who’s at fault.
#### Rental reimbursement
Typically offered as an optional coverage, this can help you pay for the cost of a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered accident.
#### Roadside assistance
This is usually an add-on, though a few companies may provide it standard with each policy. It covers roadside emergencies, which may include fuel delivery, emergency towing, battery jump-starts, flat tire changes, and lockout service (if you get locked out of your car).
### Risks of getting minimum coverage
It can be tempting to save money where you can, especially with the costs of goods and services increasing, including the cost of car insurance. But careful consideration should be given to how much car insurance you carry. While only meeting your state’s minimum requirements may be the cheapest option, it can leave you financially unprotected in many situations.
When buying insurance, consider both the cost of a policy and the level of financial protection that it can provide you with peace of mind and adequately protect your assets.
Insurance in California can be pricey but, if you are involved in a collision without proper insurance, your driving privileges will be suspended for up to four years, regardless of who was at fault for the accident. You could potentially have your driver’s license reinstated after the first year of the suspension by providing and maintaining a California Insurance Proof Certificate (SR 22/SR 1P) for that three-year period.

## How To Get the Cheapest Car Insurance Rates in California
There are steps you can take and factors to consider as you look to save money while maintaining adequate coverage. These include:
Comparing quotes from multiple companies can give you confidence that you’re getting the most competitive rate possible. Many car insurance companies provide quotes for free through their websites or by phone, making comparisons relatively simple. For an apples-to-apples comparison, look at quotes for the same types and amounts of coverage. Many consumers prefer to work with independent agents to help with this process.
Most auto insurers offer discounts. Some offer more than others, and the types of discounts can vary by insurer. When considering insurers, research their discounts to see which ones you may qualify for. Taking advantage of multiple discounts can lead to substantial savings over time.
A history of safe driving can help you save money on car insurance while having traffic violations like speeding tickets can cause your rates to increase. Too many tickets or other types of violations could even make it difficult for you to find coverage if insurers view you as a high-risk driver.
Raising your deductible can lead to you paying lower rates, but it leaves you open to more out-of-pocket costs if you file a claim. Keep your deductible within a range you can afford, since you’ll have to meet it before your coverage kicks in.
Some insurers offer programs that can tailor your rate to your driving habits. For instance, some companies’ apps can measure things like braking, acceleration, and even whether you use your phone while driving, among other details. If you drive safely, you can achieve a lower rate with a program like this. Some companies also offer insurance with variable rates based on how many miles you drive – verified mileage is key to achieving your discounts.
## Car Insurance Alternatives in California
For most drivers, a car insurance policy is probably the most efficient and affordable way to meet the state’s minimum [financial responsibility](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/educational-materials/fast-facts/financial-responsibility-insurance-requirements-for-vehicle-registration-ffvr-18/#:~:text=Effective%20January%201%2C%202025%2C%20the,%2415%2C000%20for%20damage%20to%20property) requirements.
But the state does accept other forms of financial responsibility, including:
* Cash deposit of $75,000 with the Department of Motor Vehicles
* Surety bond for $75,000
* DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance
To learn more about these alternatives, contact the DMV’s Insurance Unit at (916) 657-6677.

## California Car Insurance FAQ
If requested by law enforcement in California – for instance, during a traffic stop – you’ll have to produce proof that your vehicle is adequately insured. This can be done using a physical car insurance card issued by your insurer or by showing electronic proof of an active car insurance policy on a mobile device.
Failure to show proof of insurance in California can lead to fines starting at $100 and stiffer penalties such as suspension of your driver’s license or vehicle registration.

## Methodology: How We Collected Our Car Insurance Rates
To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual driver profiles. Our study rates are based on profiles for male and female drivers aged 17, 25, 40, and 60. Vehicles used include the 2020 and 2025 Toyota Camry, 2020 and 2025 Toyota RAV4, and 2020 and 2025 Ford F-150, with annual mileages of 7,000 and 14,000 for each vehicle. Three car insurance coverage levels were used, as were credit tiers of good and poor. Clean driving records, as well as records with one accident, one speeding violation, or one DUI were also used in the calculations of certain driver archetypes.
The three coverage levels we used are referred to as "low," "medium," and "high." Low coverage refers to the minimum coverage required in each state the insurer covers, along with any other mandatory coverages in the state. The medium coverage tier is $50,000/$100,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible, $50,000 property damage coverage, $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, and any other mandatory coverages a state may require. The high coverage tier is $100,000/$300,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $500 deductible, $100,000 property damage coverage, $100,000/$300,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, as well as any other mandatory coverages a state may require.
To get the average annual rate used in our analysis, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers aged 25, 40, and 60 who drive 14,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record. The rates are for comparative purposes only and should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. Because car insurance rates are based on individual factors, your car insurance rates will differ.
