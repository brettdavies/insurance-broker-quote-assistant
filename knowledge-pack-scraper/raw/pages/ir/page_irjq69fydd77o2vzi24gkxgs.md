UPDATED: Jan 6, 2025
State Farm Steer Clear is a driver training program offered by State Farm Insurance. It is designed to help young drivers develop safe driving habits and reduce their risk of accidents. This review will provide an overview of the program, explain how it works, discuss its pros and cons, and share customer reviews and experiences. We will also compare State Farm Steer Clear to other driver training programs.
## What Is State Farm Steer Clear?
State Farm Steer Clear is a program specifically designed for drivers aged 16 to 25. It aims to provide them with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the roads safely and responsibly. The program focuses on defensive driving techniques, emphasizing the importance of awareness, anticipation, and proper decision-making behind the wheel.
The State Farm Steer Clear program consists of various components that help participants enhance their driving skills. These include online modules, in-person sessions, and the use of a smartphone app to track progress and earn discounts on [auto insurance](https://www.thetruthaboutinsurance.com/auto-insurance-am-i-covered/ "auto insurance") premiums. By completing the program, participants can demonstrate their commitment to safe driving and potentially reduce their insurance costs.
The online modules provide participants with comprehensive information on various driving topics, such as traffic laws, road signs, and defensive driving strategies. These modules are designed to be interactive and engaging, incorporating videos, quizzes, and real-life scenarios to reinforce the learning material. Participants can complete the modules at their own pace, allowing for flexibility in their schedule.
In addition to the online modules, State Farm Steer Clear offers in-person sessions where participants can receive hands-on training from experienced driving instructors. These sessions cover practical skills, such as parallel parking, merging, and navigating intersections. Participants have the opportunity to practice these skills in a controlled environment, receiving personalized feedback and guidance to improve their driving abilities.
The smartphone app provided by State Farm Steer Clear is a valuable tool for participants to track their progress and earn rewards. The app uses GPS technology to monitor driving habits, such as speed, acceleration, and braking. Participants can view their driving data, receive tips for improvement, and earn points for safe driving behavior. These points can then be redeemed for discounts on their auto insurance premiums, providing an incentive for participants to continue practicing safe driving habits.
There are several benefits to participating in State Farm Steer Clear. Firstly, it equips young drivers with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate various driving situations confidently. By learning defensive driving techniques and understanding the importance of situational awareness, participants can better anticipate potential hazards and make informed decisions on the road.
Secondly, successful completion of the program can result in a discount on auto insurance premiums. State Farm recognizes the value of safe driving and rewards participants who demonstrate their commitment to responsible behavior behind the wheel. This discount can lead to significant savings on insurance costs, making State Farm Steer Clear an attractive option for young drivers looking to reduce their expenses.
Finally, State Farm Steer Clear helps drivers establish good driving habits early on, reducing their risk of accidents and mishaps. By emphasizing the importance of defensive driving and providing practical training, the program instills safe driving behaviors that can last a lifetime. Participants are encouraged to practice these habits consistently, creating a positive impact on their own safety and the safety of others on the road.
To be eligible for State Farm Steer Clear, participants must hold a valid driver’s license and be between the ages of 16 and 25. This age range is crucial as it targets young drivers who are at a higher risk of accidents due to their limited experience on the road. By focusing on this age group, State Farm aims to provide them with the necessary skills and knowledge to become responsible drivers.
In addition to the age requirement, participants must have a clean driving record with no recent at-fault accidents or traffic violations. This eligibility criterion ensures that participants have a solid foundation of safe driving habits and are committed to maintaining a good driving record. By selecting participants with a clean driving history, State Farm can further promote safe driving behaviors and reduce the likelihood of accidents.
Furthermore, participants must have an active auto insurance policy with State Farm. This requirement ensures that participants are current customers of State Farm and have the opportunity to benefit from the potential [insurance premium](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/what-is-an-insurance-premium/ "insurance premium") discounts offered through the Steer Clear program. It also encourages participants to establish a long-term relationship with State Farm, fostering loyalty and trust between the insurance provider and the young drivers.

## How Does State Farm Steer Clear Work?
The State Farm Steer Clear program is structured in a way that allows participants to complete it at their own pace. It consists of three steps: self-assessment, practice driving, and knowledge evaluation.
The first step involves completing online modules that cover various topics, including safe following distances, handling inclement weather, and avoiding distracted driving. These modules serve as a self-assessment tool, helping participants identify areas where they may need further improvement.
After completing the online modules, participants must log six hours of supervised driving practice with a licensed adult who is at least 21 years old. During these practice sessions, participants are encouraged to apply the skills and knowledge gained from the online modules to real-world driving scenarios.
Once the practice driving requirement is fulfilled, participants must schedule an in-person evaluation with a State Farm representative. During this evaluation, participants will be assessed on their driving skills and knowledge. Successful completion of the evaluation allows participants to move on to the final step of the program.
The final step involves using the State Farm Steer Clear app to track and log an additional 12 hours of driving. Participants receive feedback on their driving habits and have the opportunity to earn a discount on their auto insurance premiums based on their driving performance.
The State Farm Steer Clear app is an essential tool throughout the program. It allows participants to track and log their driving hours, receive feedback on their driving habits, and complete quizzes to reinforce their knowledge. The app also provides tips and resources to help participants become safer and more responsible drivers.
The app’s tracking feature ensures that participants are able to monitor their progress and stay motivated to complete the required driving hours. It provides a visual representation of the hours logged, allowing participants to see how close they are to achieving their goal. Additionally, the app’s feedback system provides valuable insights into areas where participants may need to improve, such as braking too harshly or not maintaining a safe following distance.
As participants log their driving hours using the State Farm Steer Clear app, they receive feedback on their driving habits. Achieving safe driving milestones can earn participants a discount on their auto insurance premiums. The discounts are based on factors such as driving duration, time of day, and adherence to safe driving practices.
For example, participants who consistently demonstrate safe driving habits, such as maintaining a safe following distance and avoiding distractions, may be eligible for a greater discount on their auto insurance premiums. On the other hand, participants who do not meet the program’s safe driving criteria may not be eligible for any discount at all.
Once participants have completed the required driving hours, they will receive a certificate of completion. This certificate can be provided to their State Farm agent to potentially qualify for an auto insurance discount. The certificate serves as proof that participants have successfully completed the State Farm Steer Clear program and have demonstrated a commitment to safe driving practices.

In conclusion, the State Farm Steer Clear program is a comprehensive and flexible program that allows participants to improve their driving skills and potentially earn discounts on their auto insurance premiums. Through self-assessment, practice driving, and knowledge evaluation, participants can become safer and more responsible drivers, ultimately benefiting themselves and the community as a whole.
## Pros And Cons Of State Farm Steer Clear
State Farm Steer Clear has several advantages that make it an appealing option for young drivers. Firstly, it offers valuable training and resources that help participants become safer and more responsible drivers. The program includes comprehensive modules that cover various aspects of driving, such as defensive driving techniques, understanding road signs and signals, and handling adverse weather conditions. Participants also have access to informative videos, interactive quizzes, and helpful tips to enhance their learning experience.
Secondly, successful completion of the program can result in a discount on auto insurance premiums. State Farm rewards participants who complete the Steer Clear program by offering them a discount on their car insurance. This can be a significant financial benefit for young drivers who are often faced with higher [insurance rates](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/insurance-rate-increases-and-decreases/ "insurance rates") due to their lack of driving experience. The discount serves as an incentive for participants to actively engage in the program and demonstrate their commitment to safe driving practices.
Furthermore, the flexibility of the program allows participants to complete it at their own pace. State Farm understands that young drivers have busy schedules, so they have designed Steer Clear to be flexible and convenient. Participants can access the program online, allowing them to study and complete the modules at any time that suits them. This flexibility ensures that participants can fit the program into their daily routine without feeling overwhelmed or rushed.
However, there are also potential drawbacks or limitations to consider. One of the challenges of the program is the requirement for supervised driving practice, which may depend on the availability of a licensed adult. While the program provides valuable theoretical knowledge, hands-on experience is crucial for young drivers to develop their skills. The supervised driving practice component of Steer Clear requires participants to complete a certain number of hours behind the wheel with a licensed adult. This requirement may pose difficulties for participants who do not have immediate access to a licensed adult or whose schedules do not align with their supervisor’s availability.
Additionally, the program is only available to State Farm customers, limiting its accessibility to those insured with other providers. While State Farm Steer Clear offers numerous benefits, it is important to note that it is exclusively available to State Farm policyholders. This limitation may be a disadvantage for young drivers who are insured with other insurance companies and are unable to take advantage of the program’s benefits. It would be beneficial for the program to expand its availability to a wider range of insurance providers to ensure that more young drivers can benefit from the training and discount opportunities.
Lastly, while State Farm Steer Clear covers a wide range of driving topics, some participants may require additional training tailored to their specific needs. Every driver is unique, and certain individuals may have specific areas of weakness or require additional instruction beyond what the program offers. It is important for participants to recognize that Steer Clear provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills, but it may not address every individual’s specific needs. In such cases, participants should consider seeking additional training or guidance from driving schools or professional instructors to further enhance their driving abilities.
