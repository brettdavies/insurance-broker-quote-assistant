![Young woman checking her engine with her cell phone light on a dark road while calling for roadside assistance.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/how-roadside-assistance-coverage-may-save-you-money.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_Adding roadside assistance coverage to your auto policy may help save you money in the long run by turning unpredictable roadside emergencies into manageable expenses. Instead of facing high out-of-pocket charges for services like towing, lockouts or jump-starts, this coverage may offer financial advantages and help ensure greater confidence behind the wheel._
When it comes to managing your auto expenses, one question often comes up: Is [roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) worth the cost? While it can be easy to see the sense of security it may offer, many drivers may overlook its potential as a smart financial choice. Let’s dive into how roadside assistance coverage can be a cost-effective choice by helping shield you from unexpected expenses.

Imagine you're on a road trip and your [car suddenly breaks down](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down). Without roadside assistance coverage, you might find yourself facing hefty out-of-pocket costs for services like towing, [jump-starts](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car) or lockouts. Here’s a peek at what [these expenses could look like](https://www.marketwatch.com/insurance-services/auto-insurance/how-much-is-roadside-assistance/):
Estimated out-of-pocket cost*
(*These costs can vary widely based on your location, the time of day and the service provider.)
One advantage of roadside assistance coverage is the predictability it may bring to [your budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown). Rather than worrying about a sudden big bill for a single incident, you pay a small, regular premium that can help protect you from surprise expenses and can offer more confidence on the road.
Roadside assistance typically covers common incidents like towing, dead batteries, [flat tires](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care) and lockouts, making it a practical choice for many drivers. By transforming unpredictable, often costly emergencies into manageable expenses, roadside assistance coverage may be a smart addition to your auto policy.
While there are many [reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/reasons-you-might-want-roadside-assistance-coverage), the optional add-on also has benefits that may outweigh the cost. Though it may be tempting to consider a [DIY car repair](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/benefits-of-roadside-assistance), coverage can help you avoid hidden safety risks. Further, it’s not just about having a sense of security — it's about making a decision that may help protect you from the unpredictable.
So, the next time you’re reviewing your [auto insurance options](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options), consider how roadside assistance coverage can be a valuable addition to your policy. When you use this coverage, a claim will likely be filed. Talk to your insurance company about how this may impact your policy. For more details, connect with a [State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) today or [get an auto insurance quote online](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto).
