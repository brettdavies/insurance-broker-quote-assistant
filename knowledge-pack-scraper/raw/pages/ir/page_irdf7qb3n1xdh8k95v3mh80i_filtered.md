Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

When it comes to managing your auto expenses, one question often comes up: Is [roadside assistance coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) worth the cost? While it can be easy to see the sense of security it may offer, many drivers may overlook its potential as a smart financial choice.

## The cost of roadside emergencies without coverage

Imagine you're on a road trip and your [car suddenly breaks down](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down). Without roadside assistance coverage, you might find yourself facing hefty out-of-pocket costs for services like towing, [jump-starts](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car) or lockouts. Here’s a peek at what [these expenses could look like](https://www.marketwatch.com/insurance-services/auto-insurance/how-much-is-roadside-assistance/):

Emergency service type

Estimated out-of-pocket cost\*

Towing (local)

$75 - $200+

Flat tire change (labor)

$50 - $100

Lockout service

$50 - $150

Jump-start

$50 - $100

[Fuel delivery](https://www.yelp.com/costs/roadside_assistance)

$50 - $75 (+ cost of fuel)

(\*These costs can vary widely based on your location, the time of day and the service provider.)

Consider how these possible one-time repair costs stack up against the average price of roadside assistance coverage. In many cases, you can add roadside assistance to your auto insurance for a modest extra fee. The average cost for roadside assistance from State Farm is $10-$20 per year. This more affordable expense can help you avoid the risk of much higher, unexpected costs if roadside problems arise.

## Helping keep your car budget predictable

One advantage of roadside assistance coverage is the predictability it may bring to [your budget](/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown). Rather than worrying about a sudden big bill for a single incident, you pay a small, regular premium that can help protect you from surprise expenses and can offer more confidence on the road.

Roadside assistance typically covers common incidents like towing, dead batteries, [flat tires](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care) and lockouts, making it a practical choice for many drivers. By transforming unpredictable, often costly emergencies into manageable expenses, roadside assistance coverage may be a smart addition to your auto policy.

## Is roadside assistance coverage worth the investment?

While there are many [reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/reasons-you-might-want-roadside-assistance-coverage), the optional add-on also has benefits that may outweigh the cost. Though it may be tempting to consider a [DIY car repair](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/benefits-of-roadside-assistance), coverage can help you avoid hidden safety risks. Further, it’s not just about having a sense of security — it's about making a decision that may help protect you from the unpredictable.

So, the next time you’re reviewing your [auto insurance options](/insurance/auto/coverage-options), consider how roadside assistance coverage can be a valuable addition to your policy. When you use this coverage, a claim will likely be filed. Talk to your insurance company about how this may impact your policy.
