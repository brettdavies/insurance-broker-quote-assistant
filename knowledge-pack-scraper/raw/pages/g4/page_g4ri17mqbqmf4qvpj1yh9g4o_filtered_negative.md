Understanding PIP Checks in Florida: Who Gets Paid and When?
Car accidents are stressful enough without worrying about how your medical bills will be paid. If you’re a Florida driver, understanding how your Florida PIP check works can make a big difference in how smoothly you recover physically and financially. Below, we break down how personal injury protection (PIP) functions, who gets paid, and what happens if your PIP payout doesn’t cover everything you need.
## What Is PIP and Why Does Florida Require It?
[Personal injury protection](https://www.lawhancock.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-floridas-pip-law/), commonly known as PIP and “no-fault” auto insurance, is a type of no-fault auto insurance coverage. In Florida, every driver is required to carry a minimum of $10,000 in PIP coverage as part of their auto insurance policy.
Florida’s PIP laws are found under [Florida Statutes 627.736](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.736.html). In short, the no-fault rule provides that regardless of who caused the accident, your own PIP insurance covers your medical expenses and certain other costs up to the policy limit. Specifically, PIP typically covers:
* 80% of reasonable medical expenses
* 60% of lost wages
* $5,000 in death benefits
This system is designed to ensure that accident victims can receive prompt medical care without the delays associated with proving fault in court.
Any remaining balance not covered by your PIP auto insurance, such as the remaining 20% of reasonable medical expenses, has to be paid by you.
## Who Gets the PIP Check—You or Your Doctor?
One of the most common questions we hear is: When there’s a PIP payout, who actually gets the money?
In Florida, the answer often depends on how your medical providers handle billing and assignment of benefits. Typically, when you receive medical treatment after an accident, you’ll sign what’s called an assignment of benefits (AOB) form. This form allows your medical provider to bill your PIP insurance directly and receive payment straight from your insurance company.
So, in most cases, your doctor or healthcare provider receives the PIP check directly, not you. If you haven’t signed an AOB, your insurance company might reimburse you for out-of-pocket medical expenses after you submit your bills.
Under the statute, your auto insurance carrier has 30 days to pay PIP benefits to your medical provider after receiving the reasonable medical billing.
## What to Do If Your PIP Claim Is Denied
Unfortunately, insurance companies don’t always make the claims process easy. If your Florida PIP check is delayed, underpaid, or outright denied, don’t panic — but act quickly.
Here are some steps to take:
* Request a written explanation from your insurance company about why the claim was denied.
* Review your policy carefully to understand what is and isn’t covered.
* Consult a personal injury attorney, especially if you believe the denial was unreasonable or you’re facing mounting medical bills.
With over 30 years of expertise in injury cases, our attorneys at Hancock Injury Attorneys can help you challenge the denial, negotiate with the insurance company, and ensure your rights are protected.
## Coordinating PIP with Health Insurance
If your medical expenses exceed your PIP policy limit (often $10,000), you may wonder what happens next. This is where coordination of benefits comes into play.
In Florida, your PIP coverage is considered primary, meaning your PIP benefits pay out first before any available health insurance starts paying benefits. Once your PIP coverage is exhausted (a fancy way to say “used up”), your personal health insurance, if you have any (such as through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.), may cover your remaining medical costs.
However, some health insurance policies require proof that your PIP benefits have been fully used before they start paying. Keep detailed records of all your bills, PIP payments, and communications with providers and insurers to make this process smoother.
It’s also worth noting that in cases where another driver is at fault and your damages exceed what PIP and health insurance cover, you may have grounds to file a personal injury lawsuit to recover additional compensation against the at-fault driver’s bodily liability insurance.

##### You guys are the best
I just wanted to take a moment and let you all know how very much I appreciate your hard work and time taken to settle this last case. It shocked me this morning when I got your letter with the check in it! Since I have been unable to work for so long, my financial situation has been horrid. Just two weeks ago I had to voluntarily give my car back to the bank, as to could no longer afford the payments and high insurance premiums due to my accidents.

##### Outstanding Reputation
Based upon my experience as an attorney defending personal injury lawsuits, I have long been aware of the outstanding reputation of Michael and Claire among other attorneys, judges and insurance adjusters. They are known to be aggressive and extremely competent attorneys who consistently obtain maximum recoveries for their clients. I am so confident in their abilities that I asked Michael to represent me when I was injured in a motor vehicle accident. I have since referred others to Michael and Claire based upon my complete satisfaction with their legal representation.
- P.W.

##### My first choice
Both Michael and Claire have been prompt in returning my phone calls – this is something that is so exceptional, since with other attorneys, I’d waited days and weeks before they answered me. I’ve received good legal advice on my concerns, and if they can’t help me, they always refer me and my friends to someone who can. Michael and Claire are my first choice. Also, their receptionist is always so pleasant. Keep up the good work.
- E.D.
