Finding [the best car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) can be tricky, especially when you realize that what’s best for one driver may not be the best for another. In general, it’s best to look for companies that offer extensive coverage options while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and a solid financial strength rating. Depending on your needs, of course, priorities can shift. Some drivers may need an insurer specialized in high-risk drivers, while others may want one that offers customizable coverage for antique cars. With diverse needs in mind, Bankrate’s insurance editorial team analyzed and compared four of the best-performing auto insurance companies: Geico, State Farm, Progressive, and Allstate.

## Top car insurance companies compared

When comparing these four companies, our experts considered financial strength, available coverage, digital tools, customer service, average annual rates and more. Our team calculated a Banrkate Score for each company based on its overall performance, with a five being the top score available. Similarly, our team utilized third-party ratings for [customer satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study) and [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study) from J.D. Power. The following table shows these ratings, comparing Allstate vs. State Farm vs. Geico vs. Progressive.

| **Company** | **Bankrate Score** | **J.D. Power Claims Satisfaction Study** | **Avg. annual full coverage premium** | **Avg. annual full coverage premium after speeding ticket** | **Avg. annual full coverage premium after at-fault accident** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Progressive](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/progressive/) | 4.4 | 672/1,000 | $2,190 | $2,846 | $3,309 |
| [Geico](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/geico/) | 4.3 | 692/1,000 | $2,167 | $2,583 | $3,044 |
| [State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/state-farm/) | 4.3 | 710/1,000 | $2,686 | $3,095 | $3,384 |
| [Allstate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/allstate/) | 3.9 | 691/1,000 | $3,355 | $3,893 | $4,474 |

### **Progressive: Best for safe drivers**

**Why we chose it:** Progressive offers competitive average rates and has a program that can help safe drivers save money on their [deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/). The Progressive Deductible Savings Bank is an add-on option that can lower a driver’s deductible by $50 every six months they go without filing a claim or having an auto incident. The company also offers driving-based discounts through its telematics program, [Snapshot](bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/), further rewarding safe drivers. However, Progressive scored in the bottom two for customer claims satisfaction with J.D. Power.

#### **Pros**

* Offers a Name Your Price tool for policy customization and budget friendliness

#### **Cons**

* Scored second-to-last in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study

### **Geico: Best for discounts**

**Why we chose it:**Geico has a history of offering low average rates for many types of drivers. Because the company also provides a robust list of potential [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), the savings possibilities really start to add up. Geico’s many discounts include military, emergency deployment, telematics, good student, multi-vehicle and more. Geico tends to score well in overall customer satisfaction on J.D. Power surveys, but has struggled with claims satisfaction.

* Scored below the industry average in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study

### **State Farm: Best for claims handling**

The company also scored above the industry average for overall customer satisfaction in every region of the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.

## **Which company is best: Allstate vs. State Farm vs. Geico vs. Progressive**

Which of the above companies is best for you will depend on several [personal rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), including your coverage needs. When considering Progressive vs. Geico vs. Allstate vs. State Farm, each company offers different perks and drawbacks, with none being unilaterally the best.

If you are simply looking for the [most affordable car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/), you can request free quotes from each. However, it’s essential to make sure the coverage you purchase doesn’t just fit your budget, but also meets your needs. If you park your car regularly in an area with high vandalism, for instance, it might be wise to consider comprehensive coverage, even though it will increase your premium. Car insurance is about protecting your financial safety long-term, and so it can be complicated to consider how the up-front cost of premiums balances out. In general, you’ll want your coverage to match the risks you face.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### Should I pick a big or small car insurance company?

  Caret Down Icon

  Choosing between [big and small car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/small-vs-large-car-insurance-companies/) depends on your specific needs and preferences. Big insurance companies often have extensive financial resources, larger agent networks, comprehensive digital tools and a broader array of coverage options. They may also offer better customer service accessibility and financial stability. Smaller insurers, on the other hand, often focus on providing personalized service, offering competitive rates and tailoring coverage options to regional needs.

  It’s worth [comparing quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) from both big and small companies to find one that aligns best with your budget, customer service expectations and insurance needs.
* ### What do I need to buy a car insurance policy?

  Caret Down Icon

  When you’re [shopping or buying an insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/buying-car-insurance-online/), the insurance company will typically ask for some personal information, like the names, birthdates and driver’s license numbers of all drivers that will be included on the policy. You will also be asked to provide information on the vehicle’s make and model, and may also need to provide the vehicle identification number (VIN). By offering this information to the insurance company, you’re more likely to get an accurate quote.
* ### How do I find the cheapest car insurance policy?

  Caret Down Icon

  If you want to find the cheapest car insurance policy, it may be helpful to shop around and get quotes from a number of different insurance companies. In order to accurately compare your options, request quotes for the same type and amount of coverage from each company, which will let you see how much the same type of coverage would cost from the companies you get quotes with. Ask about the discounts you could be eligible for, as well; discounts can have a big impact on your premium.
* ### Do all these car insurance companies offer telematics programs?

  Caret Down Icon

  Yes, all four of these insurers have their own telematics programs that potentially reward safe driving with premium discounts. Allstate provides [Drivewise](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/allstate-drivewise/); Geico offers [DriveEasy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/geico-driveeasy/); Progressive has its [Snapshot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/) program (and reserves the right to raise your premium if the program reveals unsafe driving habits); and State Farm offers [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/). These programs generally track driving behaviors like speed, braking, acceleration and distance.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze August 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually. Bundling and paperless billing discounts are applied.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:

* ### Credit-based insurance scores:

  Caret Down Icon

  Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.
* ### Incidents:

  Caret Down Icon

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
* ### Mileage:

  Caret Down Icon

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
* ### Model:

  Caret Down Icon

  Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
* ### Age:

  Caret Down Icon

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents’ policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
* ### Gender:

  Caret Down Icon

  The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
* ### Status:

  Caret Down Icon

  Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.

### Bankrate Scores

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
