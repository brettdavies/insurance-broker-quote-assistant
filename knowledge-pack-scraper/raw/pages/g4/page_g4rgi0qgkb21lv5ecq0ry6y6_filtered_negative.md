**Why we chose it:** Progressive offers competitive average rates and has a program that can help safe drivers save money on their [deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/). The Progressive Deductible Savings Bank is an add-on option that can lower a driver’s deductible by $50 every six months they go without filing a claim or having an auto incident. The company also offers driving-based discounts through its telematics program, [Snapshot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comparison-allstate-geico-progressive-state-farm/bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/), further rewarding safe drivers. However, Progressive scored in the bottom two for customer claims satisfaction with J.D. Power.

**Why we chose it:** Geico has a history of offering low average rates for many types of drivers. Because the company also provides a robust list of potential [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), the savings possibilities really start to add up. Geico’s many discounts include military, emergency deployment, telematics, good student, multi-vehicle and more. Geico tends to score well in overall customer satisfaction on J.D. Power surveys, but has struggled with claims satisfaction.
