* Using Rental Reimbursement When Your Car's in the Shop
![Man texts on phone at an autobody shop](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/rental-reimbursement-car-in-shop.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
_**Overview:** Having your car in the shop after a covered crash or other incident is never convenient. Rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage is a valuable optional addition to your auto policy that can assist you. This step-by-step guide gives practical insights into using this optional coverage start to finish, from contacting your insurer and understanding your benefits, to arranging temporary transportation and keeping the correct records for reimbursement while your car undergoes repairs from a covered loss._
The following steps may only apply to you if 1) you have optional [rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage) as a part of your auto policy and 2) your insured car needs repairs due to a loss covered by your policy's[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage)[comprehensive](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) or[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage)[collision](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) coverage. Rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage does not apply to a routine maintenance scenario.

Immediately after a covered incident (collision, [theft](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft), [storm damage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-stay-safe-during-a-severe-wind-event-loss-mit), etc.) report the damage on the insured vehicle to your insurance company. This important first step starts the [claim process](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/auto) for your vehicle's damage. Both car rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage typically depend on having a covered comprehensive or collision claim. Quickly reporting the incident allows you to begin the process of using these benefits.
Once you've reported the claim, contact your agent or claims representative to understand the details related to your rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage. Knowing your [coverage limits](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need) will help enable you to make informed choices when you explore temporary transportation options.
* Rental reimbursement coverage gives both a maximum limit per day and a maximum per loss limit when renting a car as a result of a covered loss.
* Travel expenses coverage typically provides a maximum limit per loss when the loss occurs more than 50 miles from your home.
* **Consider extra costs.** Rental reimbursement typically only aids in paying for the transportation itself. This means it usually doesn't cover extras like gasoline, rental car upgrades, security deposits, separate [insurance or waivers you buy for the rental car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-car-insurance) or extra mileage fees.
**Other transport receipts**(Taxi, Bus, Rideshare)
Even though it may not be convenient to be without your personal vehicle, knowing how to use rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage can help reduce the stress and cost of managing transportation during the [repair period](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-when-discussing-car-repairs-with-mechanic). Consider looking at your specific [policy details](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) and talk with your claims representative for guidance based on your[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options)[situation](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options).
