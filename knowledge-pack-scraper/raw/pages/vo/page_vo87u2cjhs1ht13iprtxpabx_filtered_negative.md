## Progressive Renters Insurance Coverage
A standard Progressive [renters insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/what-does-renters-insurance-cover) policy includes:
#### Personal Property
Your personal belongings – such as clothing, furniture, and electronics – are covered under your renters insurance policy up to a certain amount. Personal property coverage also applies when your items are in a storage unit or traveling with you.
#### Personal Liability
Personal liability insurance is designed to cover you if you’re liable for injuries or property damage.
#### Guest Medical Payments
This coverage helps cover medical costs if someone gets injured in your rental space, regardless of who’s at fault.
#### Additional Living Expenses
If you experience a covered loss that temporarily prevents you from living in your rental unit, this coverage can help pay for your increased living costs, such as staying at a hotel or buying food. It’s also called loss of use coverage.
## Additional Progressive Renters Insurance Coverage
You may be able to add optional coverage to your Progressive policy or purchase a separate plan for extra protection. Here are some examples:
* **Jewelry:** If you have individual pieces of jewelry worth more than $1,000, you can add additional coverage to your policy for those specific items.
* **Enhanced Coverage Package:** You can add this package to your policy to get water backup and personal injury coverage, an additional $5,000 in computer protection, and increased coverage limits for specific personal items. Personal injury coverage may help pay your legal fees and damages in certain lawsuits, like slander. Water backup may cover water damage and removal when water backs up through a sewer or drain.
* **Extra Computer Coverage:** If the worth of your electronics – such as computers, tablets, software, and printers – exceeds $2,500, you should add extra coverage to your renters insurance to get full protection.
* **Standalone Plans:** Progressive offers separate plans from third parties that can complement your renters insurance, including identity theft protection, jewelry insurance, home warranty, and home security plans.
* **Flood Insurance:** For protection against flood damage, which is typically excluded from coverage, consider a flood insurance policy through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance).
## How Much Does Progressive Renters Insurance Cost?
Progressive’s sample monthly rate is $22.69, which makes it one of the most expensive options in our study. We determined this rate by averaging premiums from policies in four different U.S. cities with a $500 deductible.
Keep in mind that your quoted rate will differ from our sample premium. The [cost of your renters insurance policy](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-much-is-renters-insurance) depends on several factors, including where you live and how much coverage you need. After you get a Progressive quote, you should still continue to shop around to find the best deal.
## Progressive Renters Insurance Discounts
Here are some of Progressive’s discount options for renters:
* **Multi-policy:** You may qualify for a discount if you bundle your [renters and auto insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-bundle-renters-and-auto-insurance) with Progressive; the company estimates the average bundle savings at 3%. If you experience a loss that applies to both policies, you may only have to pay one deductible. You can also combine renters insurance with other types of Progressive policies, such as boat or motorcycle insurance.
* **Secured/gated community:** You may be able to lower your rate if the complex or community where you live has a security guard or requires a key or remote for entry.
* **Receive documents by email:** This discount may apply to policyholders who choose to receive paperless statements via email.
* **Quote in advance:** You may be eligible for an early shopper discount if you apply for a Progressive quote at least three days before your current renters policy ends.
* **Pay in full:** If you pay your full annual premium up front, you may qualify for a discount.
## How Do I Buy a Renters Insurance Policy From Progressive?
You can get a renters insurance quote and buy a policy [on Progressive’s website](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/); however, unlike most other companies in our rating, Progressive requires your Social Security number when you apply for a quote. You can also call 855-798-5686 to speak with a Progressive insurance expert or [find an independent agent](https://www.progressiveagent.com/local-agent/).
Before you [buy renters insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-buy-renters-insurance), evaluate the value of your personal belongings to determine how much coverage you need and whether you should add any optional coverage, such as increased limits for jewelry or electronics. Also, check if your landlord has specified certain coverage limits required by your lease.
Other than your desired coverage, here is the information you need to provide when you apply for a Progressive quote online:
* Your address and type of residence (apartment, condo, etc.)
* Your name, birthdate, and contact information
* Your Social Security number
* Your marital status and information on your spouse, if they’re listed as an additional insured
* Details on your landlord, if they need to be included as an additional interest
* Whether you own any restricted pets (certain dog breeds, exotic pets, or farm animals) that prevent you from buying Progressive renters insurance
* Information about your current renters policy, including past claims and liability limits
Once you put in all the information to get a quote, you can typically purchase your policy right away (unless you’re ineligible for coverage because of a banned pet or something else).
## How Do I File a Renters Insurance Claim With Progressive?
Because Progressive sells insurance through a network of third-party providers, you need to file a claim directly with your specific underwriter. To contact the right insurer, check the fine print of your renters policy and consult the list of company contact details on [Progressive’s website](https://www.progressive.com/claims/property-process/). If you don’t know who your provider is, call Progressive at 800-776-4737 and give your policy number to get connected to the right place.
When you experience a loss that involves a crime such as theft, you should file a police report first. If your property is at risk of imminent further damage, take any immediate steps to mitigate it, which may involve arranging emergency repair work. You may also need to inform your landlord. If possible, take detailed photos and videos of the damage as soon as possible and create a list of your lost or damaged belongings.
When you [file a renters insurance claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-file-a-renters-insurance-claim), you should submit any relevant documentation, such as a police report, receipts for repairs, photos, an inventory of damaged items, and anything else that will help your claims agent evaluate your claim.
These are the typical steps of the claims process:
1. **Contact your insurer:** Once you get connected to the right provider, you can submit your claim.
2. **Your insurer creates an estimate:** When your claims representative assesses your claim, you may need to provide additional details or documents, or schedule an inspection with an adjuster. Then, your provider will create an estimate based on the cost of repairs or replacements and the deductible amount you have to pay.
3. **Your insurer sends a payment:** Your provider will issue a payment for the estimated amount. If you need to schedule repairs, you can use any contractor of your choice.
4. **Your personal property gets repaired or replaced:** If more damage is discovered after you receive payment for your claim, your insurer may issue an additional payment.
