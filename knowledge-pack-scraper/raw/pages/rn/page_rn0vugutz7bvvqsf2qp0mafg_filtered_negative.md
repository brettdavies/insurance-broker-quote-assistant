Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.consumerreports.org/customerservice/privacy-policy/) which is a part of this Agreement and describes how CR treats your personal information.
(a) _AUTOMATIC RENEWAL SERVICES_: In order to provide you with uninterrupted service, most of our online Paid Services such as Consumer Reports digital and print Paid Services such as Consumer Reports magazine or print membership (when purchased online) renew automatically at the end of the applicable subscription or membership period at the rate then in effect. We alert you at the point of offer when a product or service is offered on an auto-renewing basis. As explained below, CR will automatically charge your credit or debit card or other payment method on file for an auto-renewing Paid Service unless you cancel the product or service by going to your Account Settings, logging in with your username and password, and then selecting “cancel membership.” Your Account Settings can be accessed through a link in the footer of any page on ConsumerReports.org. If you purchase a Paid Service on an annual basis, you will be sent a reminder notice before the expiration of your term that alerts you to the upcoming renewal charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for fees billed through the Apple App Store, Google Play Store or other platform from which you purchase your subscription, membership or other access to a Paid Service (each, a “Third Party Platform”), (i) the Third Party Platform will automatically charge your credit or debit card or other payment method on file for an auto-renewing Paid Service unless you cancel your subscription or membership by following the instructions provided by the Third Party Platform and (ii) you are subject to the Third Party Platform’s terms and conditions.
* (i) Annual Paid Services: If you purchase a one-year Paid Service that is billed annually (an “Annual Paid Service”), you may cancel at any time during that Annual Paid Service year by logging in to your “Account Settings” and selecting “cancel membership.” In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your Annual Paid Service prior to the end of your current membership or subscription year. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to your membership benefits through the end of your current Annual Paid Service year, but you will not be entitled to receive any refund or credits for the time remaining in your membership or subscription year.However, if you cancel during the first 30 days after your purchase of the Annual Paid Service, including any renewal year, your access to the Annual Paid Service will terminate on the next monthly anniversary of your purchase date and you will receive a refund of your paid Annual Paid Service fees for your current Annual Paid Service year, less $10 for a month of digital access during the 30 day grace period.For example, if you purchased an Annual Paid Service on January 15 and canceled on February 10, you will obtain a refund for the period January 15 – January 14, less $10. Your access to your membership or subscription benefits will terminate on February 15. However, if you cancel the Annual Paid Service after February 15, you will continue to have access to your membership or subscription benefits through January 14, but you will not be entitled to receive any refund or credits for the time remaining in your Annual Paid Service year. You may also cancel an Annual Paid Service by calling us at 800-333-0663.
* (ii) Monthly Paid Services: If you purchase a Paid Service that is billed monthly (a “Monthly Paid Service”), you may cancel at any time by logging in to your “Account Settings” page and selecting “cancel membership.” Partial months will not be refunded. Upon cancellation, your access to the Monthly Paid Service will terminate on the next monthly anniversary of your purchase date. For example, if you purchase the Monthly Paid Service on December 15 and cancel on December 28, your access will terminate on January 14.
* (iii) Print Paid Services: If you purchase a print Paid Service online, you may cancel at any time during the print Paid Service subscription or membership year by following these steps: go to the “Account Settings” page, click “Print members sign in here.” Then “sign in with your account number”, enter your Login information (you’ll need your account number listed on your publication issue and your Zip Code), click “Print Membership”, click “Manage My Membership”, and select “Cancel.” Upon cancellation, CR will refund you the remainder of your print Paid Service fees on a pro rata basis based on the number of print issues which have not yet been mailed to you. In addition to cancelling a Print Paid Service through your “Account Settings” page, you may also write to us at Consumer Reports, Member Services, P.O. Box 5066, Boone, IA 50950-100668. Alternatively, you can call us at 1-800-333-0663.
* (iv) All Access Paid Services: If you purchase a combined print and digital Paid Service that is billed annually (an “All Access Paid Service”), you may cancel at any time during that All Access Paid Service year by logging in to your “Account Settings” and selecting “cancel membership.” In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your All Access Paid Service prior to the end of your current membership or subscription year. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to your membership benefits through the end of your current All Access Paid Service year, but you will not be entitled to receive any refund or credits for the time remaining in your membership or subscription year.However, if you cancel during the first 30 days after your purchase of the All Access Paid Service, including any renewal year, your cancellation will be effective immediately and you will receive a refund of your paid All Access Paid Service fees for your current All Access Paid Service year, less $10 for a month of digital access during the 30 day grace period. You will continue to have access to the digital Paid Service through the next monthly anniversary of your purchase date. For example, if you purchased an All Access Paid Service on January 15 and canceled on February 10, you will obtain a refund for the period January 15 to January 14, less $10. Your digital access will terminate on February 15. However, if you cancel the All Access Paid Service after February 15, you will continue to have access to your membership or subscription benefits through January 14, but you will not be entitled to receive any refund or credits for the time remaining in your All Access Paid Service year.
* (v) Third Party Platforms: Notwithstanding the foregoing, for subscriptions, memberships or other access to Paid Services managed by a Third Party Platform, (i) you must cancel your subscription, membership or other access by following the instructions provided by the Third Party Platform and (ii) you are subject to the Third Party Platform’s terms and conditions.
(c) _Payment Amount_: CR reserves the right to increase fees and surcharges, including fees for Paid Services, or to institute new fees at any time, upon reasonable notice posted in advance on this Site or sent to you based on contact information you provide in your Account Settings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase a Paid Service on an annual basis, your rate remains in effect throughout the membership or subscription year, and is subject to increase only for subsequent membership or subscription years. If you purchase a Paid Service on a monthly basis, the rate for that Paid Service is subject to change at any time for subsequent months, effective upon prior notice to you.
(d) _Updating Payment Information_: If you are enrolled in an auto-renewing Paid Services, you must update your credit or debit card or other payment information promptly to keep your account current, complete and accurate (e.g., for changes in your credit card number, billing address or expiration date). You may update your credit or debit card or other payment information at any time by going to [Payment Information](https://secure.consumerreports.org/ec/account/change-payment) or the My Account link located at the top of the ConsumerReports.org home page and logging in with your username and password. You can also contact Member Services at 1-800-333-0663. If your credit or debit card or other payment method information is not current, complete and accurate and you do not notify us promptly when such information changes, your account may be suspended or terminated. In order to avoid service interruption and as a convenience to you, if you do not notify us of updates to your credit or debit card information (e.g., updated account status, payment card number and expiration date), we may try to update your credit or debit card information, either directly or indirectly through third party payment card updating services supported by your card provider, and you authorize us to continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain. Such updater services may not be available for all credit or debit cards or other payment methods, and you should check with your card issuer to determine eligibility. For fees billed through a Third Party Platform from which you purchase your subscription, membership or other access to a Paid Service, (i) you must update your credit or debit card or other payment information by following the instructions provided by the Third Party Platform and (ii) you are subject to the Third Party Platform’s terms and conditions.
(e) _Updating Registration Information_: For purposes of identification and billing, you agree to provide CR with accurate, complete, and updated information required when purchasing a product or service on our Site, including registering for a Paid Service (“Registration Information”). Registration Information may include your name, address, telephone number(s), email address and applicable credit or debit card or other payment method data (e.g., payment card number and expiration date). You may check your “My Account” page to determine whether your Registration Information is current and accurate. You may update your Registration Information at any time through the My Account feature by clicking the My Account link located at the top of the ConsumerReports.org home page and logging in with your username and password. You can also contact Member Services at 1-800-333-0663. Failure to comply with this provision (including without limitation falsification of any Registration Information) may, at CR’s option, result in immediate suspension or termination of your right to use our Site, including the Paid Services.
(f) _Unauthorized Use_: You agree to promptly update your Registration Information in your “Account Settings” page if you know of or suspect unauthorized use of your Paid Service or other product or service, or in the event of any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your credit or debit card or other payment method information. In the event of a breach of security on your part, you will remain liable for any unauthorized use of your Paid Service or other product or service until you update your Registration Information. If your credit or debit card expires, is canceled, is lost or is subject to use without your authorization, or if your Paid Service or other Site service is subject to use without your authorization, go to your “Account Settings” page to update your Registration Information or call Member Services at 1-800-333-0663.
(g) _Other Charges_: In addition to the charges set forth above, you are responsible for all charges associated with connecting to the Site, including without limitation all telephone access lines (including long-distance charges, when applicable), telephone and computer equipment and any service fees necessary to access our Site, including any messaging, data and other rates and fees applied by your mobile communications carrier for use of the Mobile Services.

(a) _To the Agreement._
(b) _To the Site and/or Mobile Services_.
These supplemental terms (the “Generative AI Terms”) apply to Services that use “Generative AI”, such as AskCR (the “CR AI Services”). “Generative AI” allows you to submit inputs (“Prompts”) to generate results (“Output”). By using the CR AI Services, you agree to the following additional terms.
* • Not to engage in activity that violates any person’s rights, including privacy rights. Do not attempt to create or share content that could violate an individual’s privacy or inappropriately uses confidential or personal information. Do not attempt to use the CR AI Services to collect or process confidential information or sensitive personal data. Do not input photographs, video/audio recordings, or any content of others taken without their consent.
* • Not to engage in activity that is fraudulent, false, or misleading. Do not attempt to create or share deceptive or misleading content, including creation of misleading prompts, disinformation, or content enabling fraud, or deceptive impersonation. Do not impersonate any person or entity, including, without limitation, a moderator or a manufacturer or owner of any product, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.
* • Not to use the CR AI Services to (i) generate content for fraudulent activities, phishing or malware; (ii) promote or facilitate the generation or distribution of spam; (iii) compromise security or gain unauthorized access to any computer system or network, including by spoofing and social engineering; or (iv) violate the confidentiality, integrity or availability of any network, computer, communication system, software application, or device.
The CR AI Services may block prompts, instructions, or content uploads that violate the Code of Conduct, or that we believe are likely to lead to the creation of material that violates the Code of Conduct. Prompts, or Outputs that violate the Code of Conduct may be removed. Abuse of the CR AI Services, such as repeated attempts to produce prohibited content or other violations of the Code of Conduct, may result in service or account suspension, service limitations, or the removal, deletion, or restriction of content. Serious or repeated violations of the Code of Conduct may result in a limitation of service, removal or disabling of certain features of the CR AI Services, or in severe cases, permanent suspension. Users can report problematic or illegal content via askcr@cr.consumer.org.
