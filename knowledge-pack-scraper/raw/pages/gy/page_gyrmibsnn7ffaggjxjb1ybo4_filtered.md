Bankrate's take

For drivers with DUIs, finding insurance coverage can be particularly challenging. Not all insurance companies are willing to provide coverage to drivers with DUIs due to the increased risk they represent. Progressive is one of the insurers that typically offers policies to such drivers, although it's important to note that this may result in significantly higher [rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). On the other hand, State Farm generally does not write policies for drivers with DUIs. For those affected by State Farm's policy, it becomes essential to explore other insurers like Progressive or seek specialized [high-risk insurance providers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). Prospective policyholders should prepare for a thorough rate assessment, where disclosing all relevant details of their driving history is important for receiving an accurate quote. This helps ensure they find a coverage option that aligns with their needs and budget.

### Customer complaints

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) Complaint Index measures the number of complaints an insurance company receives relative to its size, expressed as its market share. This index is a useful tool to gauge how well an insurer meets customer expectations in handling claims and service. A lower index score (under 1.00) typically suggests better performance, indicating fewer complaints than expected for a company of its size, while a higher score (above 1.00) indicates more complaints. Understanding this index can help consumers compare the reliability and service quality of different insurers.

#### Progressive auto insurance customer complaints

Progressive's auto insurance [customer complaints from the NAIC](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=24260&:refresh) show a trend of improvement over recent years. A decreasing score from 2021 to 2023 suggests that Progressive has been addressing customer issues more effectively or seeing fewer complaints in proportion to its size. This information can be a valuable factor for potential customers to consider when evaluating the quality of customer service and reliability of Progressive's insurance offerings.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
