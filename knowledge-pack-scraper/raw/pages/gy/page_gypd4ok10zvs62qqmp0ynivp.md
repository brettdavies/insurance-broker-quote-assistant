Personal injury protection (PIP) is a type of car insurance that pays for medical expenses, lost wages and other related costs if you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident—regardless of which driver is at fault.
PIP is mandatory in some states under “no-fault auto insurance” laws, which limit your ability to sue for crash-related injuries. In states where it’s optional, PIP can still be a valuable part of a car insurance policy.

## What Does Personal Injury Protection Cover?
PIP insurance generally covers:
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ambulance@2x.svg) | 
### **Medical Expenses**
Pays bills for items like ambulance services, hospital stays, medical and surgical treatments and prescriptions.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wallet-1.png) | 
### **Lost Wages**
Pays if accident-related injuries make it so you’re unable to work. PIP can also help if you’re self-employed and must hire temporary employees.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/injured-person.png) | 
### **Rehabilitation Costs**
Pays for occupational or physical therapy, if needed, due to your injuries.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/money@2x.svg) | 
### **Replacement Services**
Pays for assistance for things your injuries keep you from doing for yourself or your family, such as house cleaning and child care.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cemetery@2x.svg) | 
### **Funeral Expenses**
Pays for funeral expenses and survivor benefits if the auto accident caused fatal injuries.  
The main goal of PIP is to provide prompt payment for auto accident injuries. Because PIP claims are paid regardless of who caused the accident, there’s no waiting around for a liability claim or lawsuit against someone else to be resolved.
## What Is Not Covered by Personal Injury Protection?
PIP insurance does not cover:
  * Bodily injuries to the other driver and their passengers.
  * Injuries in an accident if you are driving for work purposes.
  * Injuries from an accident while you were committing a crime.
  * Damage to someone else’s property.
  * Damage to your vehicle.


## Do I Need Personal Injury Protection?
Some states require drivers to have PIP. It is optional coverage in other states and not available in others.
In states where PIP is optional, it’s generally a good coverage to have. That’s because PIP can help cover expenses, such as your [health insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/health-insurance/what-is-a-health-insurance-deductible/), lost wages and replacement services for tasks you cannot perform due to your injuries, such as child care or house cleaning.
## Example of Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
Let’s take a look at examples of how PIP works in a couple of states. Say you’re driving in your Brooklyn neighborhood when you’re in a car crash and injured. Regardless of fault—it can be that you were rear-ended at a traffic light or you went too soon at a stop sign and someone t-boned your car—you make a claim under your PIP coverage for your medical expenses. 
In New York, your car insurance must include a PIP minimum of $50,000 per person. New York PIP coverage will pay, up to your limit, for medical bills, lost wages (up to 80%) and other reasonable expenses, such as transportation to medical appointments (up to $25 a day). 
PIP limits and coverage vary by state. While one state’s PIP coverage may cover 100% of medical costs up to your limit, another state’s PIP plan may pay less.
Now, say you’re a Florida driver injured in an auto accident. Florida’s minimum PIP coverage will pay 80% of your reasonable and necessary medical expenses up to your limit. This includes medical care with a doctor or at a hospital as well as other services such as X-rays, surgeries, ambulatory transport and physical therapy. And if you’re unable to work, PIP pays 60% of your lost wages. PIP will also pay for household services you’re unable to do because of your injury, such as cleaning your house.

## Personal Injury Protection (PIP) vs. Liability Insurance
Personal injury protection pays for injuries that you and your passengers sustained in an auto accident, regardless of fault. Your bodily injury liability car insurance pays for other people’s injuries you cause in an at-fault auto accident, such as running a red light and hitting a car. Property damage liability pays for the repairs to the other person’s car you damaged. Liability insurance is required in most states to drive legally and is the core of a standard [car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) policy.
Here’s an overview of PIP vs. liability insurance.
Situation  |  PIP  |  Liability insurance   
---|---|---  
Who it covers |  You and your passengers, if injured due to an auto accident. |  Other people who were injured in an auto accident that you caused. Includes other drivers and their passengers.  
Fault basis |  No fault based, pays regardless of who caused the accident. |  Fault-based, pays only when you’re deemed legally responsible.  
Pays for damage to the car? |  No, it’s only for injuries and related items, such as lost wages. |  Yes, property damage liability pays for repair costs to a car you crashed into—but not your own car.  
State requirements |  Mandatory in 15 states. Optional or unavailable in other states. |  Mandatory in all states when you buy a car insurance policy.

– PIP is required in Michigan  
– Average PIP claim: $95,752.
**Who’s covered:** All family members living in your household. This includes times when family members are injured in someone else’s car or hit when they are pedestrians. Motorcyclists who are injured in accidents involving your car are covered by your PIP. It also covers people without their own PIP who are injured in your car or as pedestrians hit by your car.
**Details:** Under Michigan’s insurance reform law (which took effect in July 2020), drivers can choose between unlimited medical coverage or lower limits for PIP. Previously, all drivers could receive unlimited lifetime medical benefits for car accident injuries.
However, Michigan’s PIP claims still remain extraordinarily high, averaging over $80,000.  
Michigan drivers now have a choice of:
The unlimited medical benefits that have been offered previously.
– $500,000 limit.  
– $250,000 limit.  
– $250,000 limit with medical exclusions (possible for household members who have health insurance that covers an auto accident).  
– $50,000 limit (only available if you’re on Medicaid).  
– PIP medical opt-out (only available if you’re on Medicare).
Selecting a PIP limit is crucial when buying a Michigan auto insurance policy. Otherwise, you’ll be automatically given unlimited medical benefits—and charged the increased price that comes with it.
Even if you choose the PIP medical opt-out or the $250,000 limit with medical exclusions, PIP will still be part of a Michigan auto insurance policy to cover lost wages, replacement services and funeral and burial costs. Also, be aware that auto insurers in Michigan can apply a deductible to PIP claims, meaning you’ll have to pay the deductible amount toward medical bills before insurance pays.
**When can you sue a driver in Michigan who caused the accident?** A driver can be sued if they cause serious impairment of body function, permanent serious disfigurement or death.
###  Minnesota  

– PIP is required in Minnesota  
– Average PIP claim: $11,176.

**When can you sue a driver in Minnesota who caused the accident?** When medical expenses are more than $4,000 or the accident results in permanent disfigurement, permanent injury, disability for more than 60 days or death.

– PIP is required in New Jersey  
– Average PIP claim: $14,653.
**Who’s covered:** You and others covered under your auto insurance policy.

Choosing “limited” only affects your right to sue for pain and suffering, not medical bills and lost wages.

**Who’s covered:** Anyone injured in your car, and also pedestrians injured by your car.

Oregon PIP also pays up to $5,000 for funeral expenses.

###  Pennsylvania  

– PIP is optional in Pennsylvania  
– Average PIP claim: $4,069.
**Who’s covered:** PIP in Pennsylvania covers you, relatives who live with you, other passengers in your car and any pedestrian or bike rider hit by your car.

With a full tort auto insurance policy, you have unlimited rights to sue another driver. Limited tort costs less and you can still sue someone for medical expenses after an accident, but you won’t be able to sue them for pain and suffering unless you have a “serious” injury.
**When can you sue a Pennsylvania driver who caused the accident?** If you have a “limited tort” policy you can sue if you suffered serious impairment to a significant bodily function or if you were injured while on a motorcycle, injured as a pedestrian, injured as a passenger on a bus, truck, taxi or other commercial vehicle, hit by a drunk driver or hit by an out-of-state vehicle.
###  Texas  

– PIP is optional in Texas
**Who’s covered:** Drivers and passengers of your car.
**Details:** PIP in Texas works differently than in other states. If a Texas driver crashes into you, you’ll first make injury and lost wages claims on their liability insurance. If their insurance isn’t enough, you can turn to your auto or health insurance for the remaining bills. Your auto insurance company will use either PIP, medical payments coverage, or your policy’s uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to pay the difference.
Texas PIP will pay up 80% of lost income if you can’t work because of the accident. But PIP payment limits include both medical bills and lost wages[ax], and Texas PIP benefits can be low as low as $2,500.
###  Utah  

– PIP is required in Utah  
– Average PIP claim: $2,915.
**Who’s covered:** You, your passengers and pedestrians hit by your vehicle.

The maximum PIP coverage you can buy in Washington is $35,000.  
Buying PIP in Washington doesn’t limit your ability to sue a driver who caused an accident. PIP will give you an easy way to make injury claims for the accident, no matter who was at fault.

## Alternatives to PIP
If your state requires personal injury protection coverage, you have no choice but to buy it. If PIP is optional where you live, you might choose to decline it if you have a good [health insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/health-insurance/best-health-insurance-companies/) plan that you’d use for car accident injuries. Still, PIP has some perks that health insurance won’t offer, such as reimbursement for lost wages and payments for services you can’t do, such as house cleaning. 
But PIP doesn’t cover all injury-related expenses if you get into a car accident. For example, if you cause an accident that results in injuries to others, you may need to tap the bodily injury portion of your [liability car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/liability-insurance/). Liability car insurance also covers your legal costs, settlements and judgments if you are sued because of a car accident.

##  Personal Injury Protection Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
### How is personal injury protection different from bodily injury liability?
PIP covers you and your passengers’ medical costs and other expenses (such as lost wages), no matter who is at fault for the accident. In contrast, [bodily injury liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-bodily-injury-liability-insurance/) covers medical expenses for injuries to others if you’re at fault for an accident. Bodily injury liability also covers your legal costs if you’re sued because of an accident.
PIP is required in 15 states, optional in other states and unavailable in others. Bodily injury liability insurance is a portion of your car insurance’s liability coverage and is required in all states if you buy all states when you buy an auto policy.
### Do you need PIP if you have health insurance?
You’re mandated to have PIP in 15 states as part of your car insurance policy, even if you have health insurance. In some other states, PIP is optional, and in others, it’s unavailable.
### How do you file a PIP claim?
If you have PIP, you typically file a claim with your own [car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) company, no matter who caused the accident. Your insurance company will pay your injury-related expenses up to the policy limits. 
If your passengers are injured, the rules can vary by state. For example, some states might require passengers who have their own auto policy to file a claim on their policy for PIP coverage.
### Should I get medical payments coverage on top of PIP?
It usually doesn’t make sense to buy both [medical payments coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/medical-payments-medpay-coverage/) (MedPay) and PIP since you would be paying for redundant coverage. MedPay and PIP are similar in that they both pay for medical expenses for you and your passengers, no matter who caused the accident. But PIP insurance includes more benefits.
MedPay does not cover lost wages or replacement services (like house cleaning or laundry services), while PIP does. If you have the option to buy both PIP and MedPay in your state as part of your car insurance policy, PIP is generally the better coverage.
