# Is New York a No-Fault State?

**Yes, New York is a no-fault state.** This means that after most motor vehicle accidents, your insurance company covers your basic medical expenses, lost earnings, and related costs, regardless of who was responsible for the crash. If you’re navigating a car accident claim in it’s important to understand how New York’s no-fault laws affect your case and rights to pursue further compensation.

## Mandatory Auto Insurance Requirements in New York

Under [New York law](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements), drivers must carry specific minimum insurance coverages to satisfy the financial responsibility requirements needed to register a car and obtain license plates:

* **No-Fault (Personal Injury Protection):** Pays for medical expenses, lost earnings, and other reasonable and necessary costs, such as transportation to medical providers.
* **Liability Coverage:** Protects against damages your vehicle, or a vehicle you operate with permission, might cause to other people or property.

**Uninsured Motorists Coverage:** Offers protection if you, your family members, or your passengers are injured by a hit-and-run driver or an uninsured vehicle.

## Everyone in New York Is Required to Carry Insurance

Everyone is required to carry insurance. There are varying minimums for car insurance, homeowner’s insurance, and other applicable policies. For car insurance, you are required to have:

* $25,000 for bodily injury to one person in one accident
* $50,000 for bodily injury to all people in one accident
* $10,000 for property damage in one accident

Just because New York is a no-fault state does not mean that the other party is off the hook for your damages. Conversely, if you caused the accident, that does not mean that you escape liability, either.

### How New York’s No-Fault Law Applies to You

Let’s look to the following scenarios to understand how New York’s no-fault system works:

* If you were a motorist who was hit by another car, you would file your claim with your own insurer before pursuing more money from the other driver.
* If you were a bicyclist struck by a motorist, you would file a claim with the at-fault driver’s insurance since you were not actively driving. The same goes for motorcyclists injured by car drivers. If the insurance company tries to minimize your claim or deny it altogether, you should seek help from a bicycle accident attorney in Long Island or a Floral Park motorcycle accident lawyer – depending on the accident’s location and circumstances. [You could file a lawsuit against the at-fault party if negotiations don’t lead to a satisfactory settlement](/faqs/how-is-at-fault-determined-in-car-accident/). Talk to your lawyer about your insurance coverage, your injuries, all the expenses and losses you suffered because of the accident, etc. A reputable law firm might be able to secure you the compensation you deserve.
* If you were injured as a passenger on a bus, you would file a claim with your car insurance carrier. If you did not drive a car and have insurance, then you would file your claim with the bus company’s provider.

If you were harmed as a motorcyclist, the no-fault rule does not apply to you. You can immediately begin pursuing damages from the negligent driver.

* Insurers must send necessary verification forms within **10 business days** after receiving a completed no-fault application (NYS Form NF-2) or similar notice.
* Additional documents must be requested within **15 business days** of receiving the completed forms.
* If a claim is delivered to the wrong office, the deadline restarts once it reaches the correct office, but cannot be extended by more than **10 business days**.
* Insurers must collect all required documents directly from the designated parties.
