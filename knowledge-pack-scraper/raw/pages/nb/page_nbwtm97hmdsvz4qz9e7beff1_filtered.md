## How we chose the cheapest companies in Connecticut

NerdWallet’s editorial team analyzed car insurance rates from 11 auto insurers in Connecticut and listed the five cheapest options for drivers in several age brackets and with different histories, all driving a 2022 Toyota Camry LE. For minimum coverage, we looked at rates that reflect the minimum requirements in Connecticut. For full coverage, we used the below coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist coverage per accident.
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible.

* ### Why you can trust NerdWallet

  Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) to ensure fairness and accuracy in our writing and data analyses. You can trust the prices we show you because our data analysts take rigorous measures to eliminate outliers and inaccuracies in pricing data, which include rates from every locale in Connecticut where coverage is offered and data is available. When comparing rates for different coverage amounts, ages and backgrounds, we change only one variable at a time, so you can easily see how each factor affects pricing.

## Minimum auto insurance limits required in Connecticut

Connecticut drivers must carry liability insurance, uninsured motorist bodily injury insurance and underinsured motorist bodily injury insurance in at least the following amounts:

* $25,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
* $25,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $25,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage per person.
* $50,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage per accident.

[Liability car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) covers the cost of any damage, injuries or deaths you cause in a car accident, up to your policy’s predefined limits.

[Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage) will cover expenses from injuries or damage after an accident with a driver who doesn’t have car insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage will cover the same expenses if you’re hit by a driver with some car insurance, but not enough to cover all costs from the crash.

Keep in mind that causing just one crash could result in property damage or injury costs that surpass the liability limits above, so it’s usually smart to buy more than the bare minimum.

#### METHODOLOGY

For our “good driver” profile, NerdWallet averaged insurance estimates for single male and female drivers with good credit and no tickets or violations. The analysis included 5-10 of the largest insurance companies in each state; smaller insurers were also included when rates were available. Liberty Mutual and its subsidiaries were excluded from our analysis as rates were not available.

For full coverage policies, we used the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist coverage per accident.
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible.

In states where required, minimum additional coverages were added. Some policies include additional coverages at the insurer’s discretion.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE for all drivers and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven.

We analyzed rates for drivers 20 to 70 years old in 10-year increments. For the average cost of full and minimum coverage in each state, we looked at 35-year-old drivers.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* For drivers with minimum coverage, we adjusted the numbers above to reflect the minimum required coverage by law in the state.
* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit.
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.

We looked at 35-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company overall, the cheapest company for minimum coverage and the cheapest company for drivers with poor credit in states where credit history is used to price rates. We looked at 20-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company for young drivers.

These are rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different. Some insurance companies included in this article may have made changes in their underwriting practices and no longer issue new policies in your state.
