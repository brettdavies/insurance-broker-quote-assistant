One way you can lower your car insurance after an accident is by reducing the amount of coverage that you pay for. Another way to lower your premium is by comparing quotes from multiple insurers and finding a cheaper one. You can also take a defensive driving course and search for additional discounts from your current insurance provider. On average, an at-fault accident [raises premiums](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/how-much-does-insurance-go-up-after-an-accident/87986) by about 50%, and the increased cost lasts [3-5 years](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-long-does-it-take-for-car-insurance-to-go-down-2140685614/).

If a car accident is not your fault, your insurance rate could still go up, depending on your state and insurance company. On average, a not-at-fault accident makes insurance costs go up by about 12%, compared to 45% for an at-fault accident.

## [How long does a car accident stay on your record?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-long-does-a-car-accident-stay-on-your-insurance-2140725770/)

A car accident stays on your record for insurance for three to five years, depending on the state and insurance company. After that period, an accident no longer appears on a driver’s record for insurance purposes and will not affect car insurance premiums directly.

Yes, Progressive has [accident forgiveness](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/accident-forgiveness/10552/). Progressive accident forgiveness can prevent a rate increase after an eligible incident, regardless of whether you’re at fault, and it may apply automatically or you can buy it.

## Types of Progressive Accident Forgiveness

**Small accident forgiveness**: Progressive customers won’t see their rates go up for certain claims of $500 or less. This type of Progressive accident forgiveness applies to all Progressive customers in most states, starting as soon as your car insurance coverage does.

**Large accident forgiveness:** This accident forgiveness benefit works more like a loyalty program. If you’ve been a Progressive customer for at least five years and accident-free for five consecutive years, your rate won’t go up for having an accident of any scale.

**Accident forgiveness you can purchase**: In most states, Progressive allows customers to purchase accident forgiveness coverage when they buy or renew a policy.

## How Progressive’s Accident Forgiveness Works

* Accident forgiveness applies to one accident per policy, not one accident per driver.
* If you do have an accident and use the benefit, you can earn the benefit again if you go without an accident for another five straight years.
* If you opt to purchase accident forgiveness, the benefit applies once per policy period. If you have an accident, any small or large accident forgiveness you’ve earned from being a loyal Progressive customer will apply first, and then you can apply the accident forgiveness benefit you purchased to a second eligible claim.

It’s important to remember that even though Progressive might forgive an accident, the accident still shows on your driving record. That means it will be visible to other insurance companies for three to five years, and it could still cause higher premiums with another insurer.
