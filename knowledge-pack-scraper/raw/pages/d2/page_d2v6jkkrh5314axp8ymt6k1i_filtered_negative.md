Thank you - and thank you to everyone else who has responded so far!
In your experience, does insurance for a mobile home tend to be more costly than it is for a conventional home? I have heard that this is normally the case, because mobile homes are more prone to damage. Can you confirm?

Back when I sold mobile home insurance (80s and 90s) higher premiums were the case. This was primarily due to the poor quality of mobile homes at the time. My parents had a 11x70 Fleetwood that had 2"x3" walls that bowed. It got so cold in the winter they had to stack hay bales around the house up to the roof line in order to maintain a 70 degree temperature.
Mobile homes now are a far cry from the crap that used to pass for mobile homes. Now you get 2x6" walls with great insulation and build quality that meets or exceeds modern building codes. So insurance now is comparable to stick built homes. That being said, I'm no longer an agent so your best bet is to talk with someone who's still in the business.

Depending on where you are, you can try calling manufactured home dealers. I own a dealership but am also a licensed insurance agent. As a dealer, I have access to certain programs that normal agents may not be aware of. Also, talking to a dealer, they can calculate a true replacement cost, including setup, transport, trim out, utility connections, etc, that most agents are not familiar with unless they focus on MH. The number of people that I help who are under insured is quite astonishing.

For a new home it is no problem. It is when you start getting into older manufactured homes, or especially if you look for insurance for a pre-HUD mobile home that you will start to run into issues.

It depends on the home. Now in my case since I have an 83, they won't cover "replacement", and my coverage maxes out at right around the purchase price.
I am in NJ so our rates aren't awful since hurricanes are a relatively rare event, I am nowhere near a flood prone area I don't have a fire place, and I have a security system, all of which help keep my rates low.

No, homeowners insurance for new and late model manufactured housing is not more expensive than site built homes, or at least it’s not in middle America. (I finance home sales and so I see quotes & pay the policies)

I would recommend checking out covertree and getting a quote. Looks like they have great reviews and specialize in mobile home insurance.

Home insurance options for manufactured homes
Buying a manufactured home can be a great affordable housing option, but finding the right insurance can be challenging. Here are some insights and recommendations from Redditors on insurance for manufactured homes:
### General Advice
* **Know Your Budget and Costs**: Include utilities, insurance, property taxes, and land improvements in your budget. ["Know your budget (don’t forget utilities, insurance, property taxes, and land improvements like septic and power)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManufacturedHome/comments/1noig1o/2year_followup_if_youre_buying_a_manufactured/)
* **Get Pre-Approved**: Find a lender that specializes in manufactured homes. ["Get pre-approved with a lender that actually does manufactured homes and construction loans."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManufacturedHome/comments/1noig1o/2year_followup_if_youre_buying_a_manufactured/)
* **Have Paperwork Ready**: Be organized with your documentation. ["Underwriting is tougher on documentation, so being organized is more important than ever."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManufacturedHome/comments/1noig1o/2year_followup_if_youre_buying_a_manufactured/)
### Insurance Companies
* **Foremost Insurance**: Often recommended for manufactured homes. ["Maybe check with an agent who sells Foremost. They're the leader in Manufactured Home coverage and also offer a specialty dwelling policy that might be a good solution."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1oafh4l/comment/nk9477s/)
* **American Modern Insurance Group (AMIG)**: Another carrier that offers competitive rates. ["I recently bought a property like that and have the home insured through American Modern (AMIG) at competitive rates."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1oafh4l/comment/nki4b9z/)
* **21st Century Insurance**: Some Redditors have found them to be affordable. ["I get mine through 21st. All the others who took manufactured homes had insanely high costs."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManufacturedHome/comments/1l4d7mo/comment/mw86tfg/)
### Specific Considerations
* **Older Manufactured Homes**: Insurance can be more difficult and expensive. ["Due the age very few insurers will touch. Expect coverage to be expensive and not comprehensive."](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/1nssmn3/comment/ngopyca/)
* **Permanent Foundations**: If your manufactured home is on a permanent foundation, it might be treated differently. ["It’s still a mobile home even if on a perm foundation. Problem we run into is twofold, mobile homes are classified as vehicles which depreciate, not appreciate like a stick built."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1oafh4l/comment/nkbgjyp/)
* **Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value**: Ensure your policy covers replacement cost if possible. ["The only thing you have to have is Replacement Cost on your policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManufacturedHome/comments/1l4d7mo/comment/mw9eiin/)
### Home Inventory
* **Video Inventory**: Take a video of your belongings and store it in the cloud. ["Take a video on your cell phone, dictate at the same time. upload to the cloud."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1netw6f/comment/ndrgudj/)
* **Detailed Inventory**: Use a spreadsheet or app to list items with specifics. ["As someone who works in the industry, it is sometimes worth doing. You can keep it on a spreadsheet and update it when you make a major purchase."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1netw6f/comment/nduvp0o/)
