# Home insurance for a manufactured home?

Does this exist? Is it even possible?

Is this something that a home dealer would typically offer you a policy on? Or will you be expected to find this on your own?

I would not mind paying a little more than what you would normally pay for a policy on a conventional home, if that's what it takes to get this kind of insurance.

Appreciate any responses.
