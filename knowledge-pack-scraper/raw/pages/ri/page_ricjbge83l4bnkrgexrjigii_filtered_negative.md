However, [_**Atlanta News First Investigates**_](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/ "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/") found a State Farm employee attached an email with the April 25, 2024 approval estimate clearly stating: “Replacement cost benefits will be issued contingent completed of roof replacement and submission of photos, submission of photos, certificate of completion and or signed contract agreement with service provider.”
A spokesperson for State Farm told [_**Atlanta News First Investigates**_](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/ "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/") it provided every benefit available to the homeowner within his policy.
The commissioner’s office told [_**Atlanta News First Investigates**_](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/ "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/") that State Farm is sticking to its decision, so the office is closing the second complaint as well.
