# Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Coverage
![A Lawyer Holds A Paper That Reads &Quot;Liability Insurance.&Quot;](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lawyer-holds-a-paper.jpg)
Bodily injury liability (BIL) insurance coverage provides optional protection for Florida drivers in the event of an accident. It covers the medical expenses and property damage of anyone they hurt. BIL is not mandatory in Florida for most drivers. However, if you are a Florida driver, it is highly recommended to have this coverage, as it helps prevent potential financial impacts if you are at fault in an injury-causing car crash.

## **Why Does Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Matter?**
Bodily injury liability coverage matters because it provides an added layer of financial protection if you are found liable for [bodily injury in a car accident](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/areas-of-practice/tampa-car-accident-lawyer/what-is-considered-bodily-injury-in-car-accident/). Even though Florida is a no-fault state, if you are at fault, the other party can sue you when their injuries and property damage exceed their own insurance coverage limits. When you have BIL, it helps protect your finances and assets from being taken if you are sued and are found at fault for their injuries.
## **Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Provides Coverage in Which Scenarios?**
BIL coverage provides protection in different car accident scenarios, including:
* You are at fault for the accident and injure another driver.
* A passenger in the other driver’s car is injured, and you caused the car accident.
* You hit a motorcyclist, bicyclist, or pedestrian, and they sustained injuries.
* You are a passenger in a taxicab, and the taxicab driver causes a car accident, and you are injured.
* A rideshare driver is “on duty,” and you are injured because they were at fault for causing a car crash.
## **How Does Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Work?**
Bodily injury liability coverage works by paying for the medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage of another party when you are found at fault for an accident. BIL covers these losses up to the policy limits. While the minimum amount of BIL coverage you can obtain in Florida is $10,000/$20,000, it is recommended to carry a much higher amount. The “10/20” split means that BIL will pay up to $10,000 per person or a total of $20,000 for all people injured per accident.
## **What Does Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Include?**
BIL coverage includes:
* Medical expenses
* Lost wages
* Pain and suffering
* Funeral expenses
* Your legal fees if you are sued
## **Is Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Required in Florida?**
Bodily injury insurance is not mandatory in Florida for most drivers and is considered optional coverage. However, it is highly recommended to protect yourself in case you are at fault for an injury-causing car crash.
Florida operates under a [no-](https://floridafarmbureau.com/2022/03/how-does-a-no-fault-accident-work/)fault system, meaning that those involved in car crashes typically file injury claims against their own insurance first. The mandatory PIP coverage will cover up to 80% of medical expenses, 60% of lost wages up to your coverage limits, and a $5,000 death benefit.
## **When Is Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Mandatory in Florida?**
There are certain circumstances where BIL insurance is mandatory in Florida, including:
* You are a taxi driver.
* You have been convicted and found guilty of a DUI or other certain traffic offenses.
* You are required to file an FR-44 or SR-22 form.
* You have been involved in a previous accident where you were at fault and caused bodily injuries.
* You have not maintained the [minimum mandatory state-required](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) insurance limits.
What Is the Liability Insurance Minimum Requirement for Bodily Injury Coverage Per Accident in Florida?
The liability insurance minimum requirement for bodily injury coverage per accident is:
* $10,000 per person/$20,000 per accident for most drivers
* $125,000 per person/$250,000 per accident for taxi drivers
It is vital to remember these are only the mandatory state minimums, which may not be sufficient to cover all potential damage. As such, it is recommended to carry higher limits. How Much Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Do I Need?
Deciding how much BIL coverage you should have depends on several factors, including:
* The value of your assets, financial investments, and income.
* The likelihood of causing moderate to severe injuries that would exceed the other person’s PIP coverage.
* The cost difference between higher coverage levels.
Ideally, it is recommended that drivers carry the same minimum coverage as taxi drivers to ensure they have sufficient protection. Even carrying $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident is still better than the minimum BIL. If you are unsure about how much BIL coverage to get, consult with your insurance agent for additional guidance.
## **Difference Between Bodily Injury Liability and Other Coverages**
BIL covers injuries and property damage you cause to another driver when you are at fault for the car crash in Florida, and their losses exceed their coverage limits. Other [insurance coverages](https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/consumers/understanding-insurance/personal-automobile-insurance-overview) drivers can have are:
* **Personal injury protection (PIP):** Mandatory required insurance that covers your personal injuries and lost wages.
* **Property damage liability (PDL):** Mandatory coverage that covers damage to another person’s property when you are at fault.
* **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage:** Optional insurance that provides added protection when another motorist is at fault, and they have insufficient or no insurance coverage.
* **Medical payments:** Optional supplement coverage to cover the 20% not covered by PIP and provide additional medical expenses coverage once you reach your PIP limits.
* **Comprehensive:** Optional coverage that provides protection for damage to your vehicle from fire, theft, vandalism, or hitting an animal.
* **Collision:** Optional coverage that covers the costs of repairing your vehicle after a car crash.
* **Rental car coverage:** Optional coverage that helps cover the cost of a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after a car crash.
## **What Is Bodily Injury Liability vs. Full Coverage?**
Bodily injury [liability vs. full coverage](https://bernsteininjurylaw.com/blog/liability-vs-full-coverage/) refers to the types of coverage you have on your auto insurance policy. If you have PIP, PDL, and BIL, it means you have limited coverage that will not cover damages to your vehicle. With full coverage, your injuries and property damage, as well as those you cause when you are at fault for an accident, are covered.
## **What Happens If My Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Isn’t Enough?**
If you have insufficient BIL coverage in Florida, you could be sued, resulting in a judgment against you, your property, your assets, and even wage garnishment. To protect yourself and provide peace of mind, you should consider getting BIL coverage if you do not currently have it, or if you do, raising your coverage limits.

## **FAQ**
### **If Someone Borrows My Car and Causes an Accident With Injuries, Whose Insurance Covers the Bodily Injury Liability?**
Your insurance would cover the initial bodily injury liability because insurance is normally associated with the vehicle, not the driver. However, if you hit your coverage limits, then the other person’s insurance would be considered secondary coverage.
### **Does Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Pay for My Own Injuries If I Am at Fault in an Accident?**
No, bodily injury liability coverage will not pay for your injuries. It only covers injuries to other people caused by your negligence.
### **What Is the Difference Between Split-Limit and Combined Single-Limit for Bodily Injury Liability Coverage?**
Split-limit liability coverage is where you divide your bodily injury and property damage into separate coverage limits. Combined single-limit coverage combines both bodily injury and property damage into a single coverage limit.
For example, a split-limit policy could be structured as $250,000/$500,000/$100,000, which means it will pay a maximum of $250,000 per person, up to $500,000 when multiple people are injured in an accident, and up to $100,000 for property damage.
Conversely, a combined single-limit policy of $500,000 would cover up to $500,000 in injuries and property damage, whether one person was injured or multiple people.
### **If I Have Multiple Vehicles, Do I Need Bodily Injury Liability Coverage on Each One?**
In Florida, bodily injury liability coverage is not mandatory for most drivers. However, it is highly recommended to carry BIL coverage on each vehicle you own since it covers injuries caused to others when you are at fault, and they hit their coverage limits.
### **Can I Be Sued for More Than My Bodily Injury Liability Policy Limits?**
You can be sued for more than your BIL policy limits in Florida. Your insurance will cover any damages up to your coverage limits, but any excess amount owed over that could result in a judgment against you. This is why it is recommended to carry higher policy limits.
### **Does My Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Cover Injuries to Passengers in My Own Vehicle?**
No, BIL insurance coverage does not apply to any passengers in your vehicle. Your PIP coverage would cover their injuries if they do not have their own auto insurance. If they have their own insurance, then they would file a claim against their own PIP coverage.
