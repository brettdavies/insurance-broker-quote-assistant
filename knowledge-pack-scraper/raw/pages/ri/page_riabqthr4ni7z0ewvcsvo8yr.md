#  Umbrella - shady stuff from GEICO 
[ Claims Related  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Claims%20Related%22)
We were hit with a frivolous lawsuit which our umbrella should have protected but GEICO denied. Now that we won the frivolous lawsuit, GEICO says since there was a lawsuit in the last 5 years they won’t renew policy. 
Talk about pissing on and loosing a customer of 25 years…. 
Anyone else have a recommendation of a good company that can cover auto/home/umbrella/personal. 
Is this standard practice and will I have an issue finding another company to cover us?

Loyalty means nothing these days anyways. Look for an independent broker in your area who can shop around for a company that wants to offer you an umbrella et al

Typically it should be a provision from your policy that they send which is normally designed to be read by real humans even if it can be a bit wordy.

Unfortunately, it would make sense that being sued may move you to a different pool of risk. 
There isn’t an amount of premium dollars they feel they can accept from you to offset the likelihood now that you will be sued again for some reason and maybe they will have to pay for it. 
How much you pay and if a company will do business with you is all about their betting odds. 
Maybe not every company would drop you in this particular incidence,but it is not a shocking outcome. Loyalty means nothing, don’t waste it on corporations. 
Consider a good broker who can help you look through your complex situation and make tailored choices.

Imagine you were in a lawsuit against someone else insured by GEICO, and they didn't cover you but covered the other party because they'd been a customer longer and/or made fewer claims. That would be pretty messed up, right? That's why coverage is defined by the policy, not by how long you've been insured or what your claims history looks like. 
Umbrellas are very cheap, typically you can get around $1M in coverage for around $300. It takes a whole lot of claims free policies to make up for one umbrella claim. So insurance companies are pretty risk averse for that reason. Having been the target of a lawsuit, frivolous or not, statistically makes you more likely to be the target of a second lawsuit than someone who's never been sued. 
You can probably find another insurance company that will offer the umbrella, it may be more expensive since they're less risk averse. Definitely check with a few local insurance agents.

Impossible to answer, since you have decided to omit all the relevant information….what was the lawsuit and why was it denied?

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers 
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors. 
### Home Insurance
  * **Coverage Types** : You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Rebuild Cost** : Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
  * **Personal Property** : Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
  * **Bundling** : Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
  * **Deductibles** : Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)


### Life Insurance
  * **Mortgage Protection** : This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Policy Types** : Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)


### Health Insurance
  * **Premium Stability** : Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
  * **Enrollment Periods** : You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
  * **Employer Plans** : If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)


### Car Insurance
  * **Coverage Considerations** : Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
  * **Car Choice** : Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
  * **VIN Quotes** : Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)


### Additional Tips
  * **Use a Broker** : Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Read the Fine Print** : Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Check Claims Handling** : Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.
