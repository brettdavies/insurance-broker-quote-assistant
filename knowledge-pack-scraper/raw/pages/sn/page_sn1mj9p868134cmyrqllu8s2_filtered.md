## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Colorado

In Colorado, car insurance companies can use both age and gender to calculate car insurance premiums, which helps insurance underwriters determine certain risk levels. Generally, males and younger drivers face higher average premiums since they are typically considered higher-risk drivers.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Car insurance rates are based on risk factors and statistics. From the time we start driving, men tend to have more accidents associated with risky behavior than women do, such as speeding, aggressive driving and not wearing seat belts, according to the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females). Accidents involving male drivers are statistically more severe and have more fatalities. However, this trend gets less extreme as men and women get older and gain more driving experience. When drivers reach their 50s, the average premiums are usually only different by a few dollars.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Colorado?

Your driving record has a significant impact on your car insurance rates. For example, a driver with one [DUI conviction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/#how-does-a-dui-affect-insurance-premiums) in Colorado pays, on average, 64 percent more per year for full coverage auto insurance than they would have with a clean driving record. Receiving even a single speeding ticket could increase a Colorado driver's average rate by 24 percent more for full coverage. Insurers penalize drivers for these types of incidents because they highlight that the driver represents an increased risk for filing claims.

The table below breaks down how each type of incident can affect the average cost of full coverage in Colorado compared to a clean driving record.

| Driving incident Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending | Avg. annual premium\* in CO Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending | Percentage increase from CO avg. annual premium\* Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending |

## Car insurance rates in Colorado by credit score

Car insurance providers often use [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) to determine a driver’s risk level. Drivers with less than stellar credit tend to pay more for car insurance. For instance, a Colorado driver with poor credit will likely pay much more for car insurance than average. Conversely, drivers with excellent credit pay less than average because insurance providers don’t see them as the riskiest demographic to insure.

## Colorado car insurance rates by vehicle type

The [make and model](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) of your vehicle is another important variable that can affect your car insurance rates in Colorado. Different types of cars can impact rates based on crash ratings, costs of repairs and risk of theft associated with each type of vehicle. This information helps insurers determine things like how expensive it will be to replace or repair different parts of that specific vehicle, or how well it is likely to perform in a crash. Insurers take these data points to approximate how much it will cost them to handle potential claims on any given vehicle.

## How to save on car insurance in Colorado

When looking for ways to save on car insurance in Colorado, there are several things to consider. From what kind of car you drive to your driving record and habits, it all affects your insurance premium. Trying out some of these strategies might help you lower your Colorado car insurance rates:

* **Increase your deductible:** If you have [collision and comprehensive](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/) insurance, you pay a [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) before your coverage kicks in. If you can afford to increase that deductible — for example, from $250 to $500 — you are likely to earn a lower premium. Be careful to keep your deductible at a level you would easily be able to pay, however, in the event of a claim.
* **Review coverage annually**: When it's time to renew your policy each year, it can be a good idea to review the types and levels of coverage you have to see if changes can be made. This is especially important after milestones, such as getting married or purchasing a new car. You may also want to consider dropping collision and comprehensive insurance if your car is on the older side and potentially not worth fixing after an accident.
* **Shop around**: When obtaining quotes from insurers, don't assume that the first price you get will be the lowest possible option. Every insurer has its own method of determining price, and by [asking for quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/) from a range of carriers, you can determine which company can offer you the most affordable coverage.
* **Change how you pay your policy**: Most insurance companies offer a discount if you pay in full or set up automatic payments. If you do not drive much, it may benefit you to consider [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/pay-per-mile-insurance/), which only charges you based on how many miles you drive.
* **Practice safe driving habits:** Being a careful driver may result in cheaper rates and help you qualify for more discounts. If you regularly practice safe driving habits, you may want to consider enrolling in a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/), which tracks your driving and rewards safe driving behaviors with [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). However, some insurance companies also penalize you if you practice unsafe driving habits while being tracked, so keep this in mind.

* ### Is Colorado a no-fault state?

  Caret Down Icon 

  No, Colorado is not a [no-fault](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/no-fault-coverage/) state. Colorado is one of the many tort, or [at-fault states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/), which means that the driver or the insurance company for the driver that caused the accident will pay for medical expenses. A common misconception is that a no-fault state means that neither driver is held responsible for a car accident, but in actuality, it just refers to whether drivers are required to carry insurance, typically personal injury protection (PIP), that automatically kicks in to pay their own medical expenses, regardless of who caused an accident.
