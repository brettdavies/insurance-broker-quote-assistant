**Bankrate’s take:** Car insurance rates are based on risk factors and statistics. From the time we start driving, men tend to have more accidents associated with risky behavior than women do, such as speeding, aggressive driving and not wearing seat belts, according to the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females). Accidents involving male drivers are statistically more severe and have more fatalities. However, this trend gets less extreme as men and women get older and gain more driving experience. When drivers reach their 50s, the average premiums are usually only different by a few dollars.
