# Florida 15-Year Roof Rule

[AskFlorida](/r/florida/?f=flair_name%3A%22AskFlorida%22)

Has anyone ever successfully argued the 15-Year Roof Rule with their homeowners’ insurance provider? Or have more useful information on the correct implementation/application of the rule?

Long story short, I purchased a home 5-years ago and my insurance provider (Frontline - I don’t recommend) has determined (by stalking permits) I must immediately get a new roof(at my cost) now or else! Five years with this insurance provider and every year they send notification that their insurance inspector must inspect/document/photograph the property. I find this annoying inconvenience to be an invasion of privacy to have some random individual photographing every room of my house and roof every year. Interesting, every year the insurance inspector finds no issues (even after multiple hurricanes) with my roof, but suddenly my roof hits 15-years old and I suddenly required to get a new roof. This is despite the fact the insurance providers’ inspector declaring and documenting the roof is great. Under threat of being canceled I must comply immediately (apparently).

Am I wrong to complain? Do normal people have the luxury of just paying for a new roof at moments notice? It just seems like a tremendous waste of resources to have a new roof installed when their inspector reported no issues with the roof. But this seems common practice by Frontline to have people arbitrarily replace something every year that is in great working conduction under threat of being canceled.
