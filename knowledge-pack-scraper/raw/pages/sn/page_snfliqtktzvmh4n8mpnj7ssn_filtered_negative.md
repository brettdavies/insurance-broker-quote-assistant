**Progressive includes $3,000 of coverage for custom parts, upgrades and customizations when you get[collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** This means your policy covers things like a custom saddle or stereo. And you can pay extra to raise the limit up to $30,000 if needed.
Progressive gets  35% fewer complaints compared to an average company of the same size.. That means you can count on Progressive to fix your bike quickly after an accident.
However, Progressive doesn't offer [rental reimbursement coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") for motorcycles. You may want this coverage if you don't have another vehicle or if you ride your bike every day.

**Monthly rate:** $22?

* [Emergency roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") includes service for flat tires, bad batteries, mechanical or electrical problems, fuel, fluid, oil or water refills and tow service.
* [Rental reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") helps cover the cost of a rental vehicle while your motorcycle is in the shop after a crash. This is an important coverage to have if you ride your bike to get to work or for everyday activities.
**In addition, Dairyland will pay to fully restore or replace your motorcycle after a crash like it's brand new if it's less than three years old.** This is usually called [new vehicle replacement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-car-replacement-insurance "New Car Replacement Insurance") or replacement cost coverage. Many other companies have a mileage limit or set a one-year cap on full replacement coverage.
Riders aren't thrilled with the service they get from Dairyland, though. It gets  60% more complaints than an average insurance company its size. **If you're in an accident, it may take longer to settle your claim with Dairyland compared to other companies.**

**Harley-Davidson also has[lots of coverage add-ons](https://www.valuepenguin.com/harley-davidson-insurance-review#coverage "What's covered under a Harley-Davidson policy?") to help you customize your motorcycle insurance policy.** Options include roadside assistance, rental reimbursement coverage, vacation rental coverage and custom equipment coverage.
The main downside to Harley-Davidson insurance is that it doesn't sell car, home or [cheapest renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies") policies. If you need to protect another vehicle, your home or your belongings, you'll have to get a policy from a different company. That can be inconvenient, especially if you have a major emergency, like a fire that damages both your home and bike.

**Monthly rate:** $36?

**Geico's motorcycle insurance isn't typically the cheapest option.** The average cost of a full coverage policy is $36 per month. That's $3 per month more than the national average. But Geico lets you lower your insurance costs with [a number of discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review#moto-discounts "Geico motorcycle insurance discounts"). For example, young riders who take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation or Military Safety Course get a 10% discount.
Geico motorcycle insurance allows you to customize your coverage to meet your needs. That means policies don't automatically include extra coverage young riders may not need. However, it doesn't offer some [popular upgrades](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-does-motorcycle-insurance-cover "What Does Motorcycle Insurance Cover?"), like original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coverage.

USAA doesn't offer motorcycle insurance directly. It refers its members to [Progressive #progressive ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-motorcycle-insurance-companies#progressive "#progressive"), one of the best companies for motorcycle insurance.
USAA also offers [motorcycle loans and financing](https://www.valuepenguin.com/motorcycle-buying-guide "How to Buy a Motorcycle: A Guide to New and Used Bikes") for up to 100% of the value of your new bike. That makes it a one-stop shop for people looking to buy a new motorcycle.
Besides motorcycles, USAA also sells insurance for [ATVs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/atv-insurance-coverage-cost-and-discounts "ATV Insurance: What Does It Cover and How Much Is It?"), [mopeds and scooters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/moped-and-scooter-insurance "Moped and Scooter Insurance").

[Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive Insurance Review") |  |  Fewer than average

[Allstate](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-auto-insurance-review "Allstate insurance review") |  |  Fewer than average
**Choosing a company with reliable customer service is just as important as finding the cheapest rate.** Consider [Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive Insurance Review: Car, Home and More"), Nationwide, Allstate or Geico motorcycle insurance quotes, since these companies get a low number of complaints.
The best motorcycle insurance depends on your coverage needs, the type of motorcycle you have, your riding habits and where you live. For example, [Dairyland #dairyland ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-motorcycle-insurance-companies#dairyland "#dairyland") has the best rates for most riders. But [Progressive #progressive ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-motorcycle-insurance-companies#progressive "#progressive") is the best company for custom bikes because of its OEM and custom parts coverage.
[Dairyland](https://www.valuepenguin.com/dairyland-motorcycle-auto-insurance-review "Dairyland Insurance Review: Auto and Motorcycle") has the cheapest motorbike insurance, with an average rate of $22 per month. That's $17 per month cheaper than the national average.
