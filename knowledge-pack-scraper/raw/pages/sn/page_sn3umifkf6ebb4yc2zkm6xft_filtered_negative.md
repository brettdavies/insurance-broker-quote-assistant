An asphalt shingle roof that is 15 years old in Florida is near the end of its useful life. A roof inspector doing a four point may say that it’s not damaged and in “good condition for its age” but invariably some shitty roofing company going door to door sends some kid they hired from the Home Depot paint aisle to go up on your roof and they find that a storm that happened on [checks Weather Underground historical wind data] with 18 mph winds has irreparably damaged your roof because of some curling around the corners of the tabs and a few spots that are relatively bare of the sand they put on the shingles to give them color.
The insurance company sends out a field adjuster who finds nothing wrong with your roof and your claim is denied. Then a lawyer with whom the shitty roofing company has a relationship sues your carrier and files allegations with the state that your insurance company denied the claim in bad faith and that they are always acting in bad faith. Then the insurance company has to make a decision about whether to spend 18 months and $50,000 defending their coverage decision in court or to just pay you, nonrenew your policy and increase premiums.

So the lesson is to buy the absolute cheapest shingle roof you can find because you are going to replace it every 15 years no matter what. Forget the architectural thicker shingles with a 25 or 50 year warranty - they are going into the dumpster in 15 years just like the cheapest shingle you can find.
Check. Got it. It's a race to the bottom!

Yup. I upgraded my shingles to have extra granules and they are significant heavier. They can stand up better to wind. And I have hurricane straps. I brought this up to my insurance. They couldn’t care less. All they care about is how new the roof is, nothing more. I said the same thing you said. So since there’s no reason to get a better roof, just standard, middle of the road shingles because it’s just gonna have to be replaced in 15 years anyway. You’d think that they would want roofs that are tougher and would last longer, but no, they just want a new roof because that has a lower risk value. It’s all metrics now.

My house was built in 2005 and insurance never said a thing that is until Ian ripped that shit right down to the plywood. Got a cool fancy looking roof and now I have 12yra left so hopefully a hurricane just shreds it every 10 till I have enough to get a fancy tin roof

**FS 627.7011 Homeowners’ policies; offer of replacement cost coverage and law and ordinance coverage.—**
5(c) For a roof that is at least 15 years old, an insurer must allow a homeowner to have a roof inspection performed by an authorized inspector at the homeowner’s expense before requiring the replacement of the roof of a residential structure as a condition of issuing or renewing a homeowner’s insurance policy. The insurer may not refuse to issue or refuse to renew a homeowner’s insurance policy solely because of roof age if an inspection of the roof of the residential structure performed by an authorized inspector indicates that the roof has 5 years or more of useful life remaining.

No, normal people like myself had to take out a loan for a new roof just to have the insurance company drop my coverage mid re-roof. Mind you the roof was already inspected three times and I was told I could get a minimum of 7 years out of it. Insurance company didn’t care. I disputed the cancellation and won, but guess what that got me? Insurance jumped from 5k a year to 7k. No flood zone, near a fire station, block house and now a new roof.

Ouch! I was told the insurance provider cannot drop you for the 15-year rule alone, but they usually just make up another reason in order to cancel the policy. I considered having an inspection done, but your experience makes me believe that hiring an independent inspector would be a waste of money and a losing battle.

It absolutely was in my situation. The free state of Florida has allowed these companies to go unchecked. There’s no way I could’ve afforded forced place insurance from my lender. The entire situation was a shit show, but they all seem to be in kahoots with one another to fuck us over. I’m now mentally prepared to have to replace the roof every 15 years. Luckily I plan on selling this bitch before my next 15 is up and leaving Florida.

I mean, have you talked with an insurance broker to see what other companies will offer you a policy?
It's not like this one company is you end-all-be-all, just be prepare for pay an ever increasing amount the older your roof gets.

My State farm policy just renewed. My house is valued at 460k, 11 miles from the coast and the roof is 20 years old. I asked my agent if I had to replace the roof and he asked if I was having problems with i said no and he said we'll no problem then. My insurance went up 200 bucks to 1610 a year.

Wait till you spend $30k for a roof that is perfectly fine BUT is getting close to the 15yr bs. My insurance company was kind enough to give me a $44 a YEAR discount because of the new roof.

It will soon be 10 years. That is what the insurance companies are pushing for on a shingle roof. I did a wind mitigation and it bought me 8 months. Then had to replace. Thing is with shopping around you will run into the same issues.

You may get an extension if you get a wind mitigation inspection. Threatening to drop you isn’t specific to Frontline. All the insurance companies do it to offload risk.
To answer your question about you being expected to suddenly buy a new roof, the answer is technically, yes. Roof replacement is apart of maintaining a house, just like replacement of an HVAC system, water heater, house painting. Homeowners either save up for it when it is time for replacement or pay for it after. It sucks because roofs are expensive and the argument is insurance companies push replacement on roof that are still good. Understandable. But technically yes, homeowners are expected to pay for roofs when it’s time.
See if a wind mitigation can help you or talk with an insurance broker to shop a new policy.

Properly maintaining a home is excepted, however, if a roof installer installs a new roof. The installer insures the roof for 25 years, but your home insurance provider demands a new roof after 15-years regardless of the actual condition of the roof. Then the 15-year roof rule seems more arbitrary and not actually based upon the roofs time. Resulting in an unexpected home maintenance that may be… unnecessary.

They did the same to us. We got a new roof and immediately switched companies. With them for 5 years and not one claim and would not contribute anything so we said bye.
Our insurance went down half what they were going to raise it to and they won’t get our business again

The insurance industry has been given a free pass by the State to make whatever demands fit their narrative of being 'victims.' Maybe they need to do THEIR jobs better and make sound investments rather than high risk, short term endeavors and maybe take responsibility for the fraud they continue to rubber stamp.. Its an incestuous industry where nobody at a senior level is suffering financially. I received my 'replace your roof' demand 127 days before renewal. At least they stayed outside the 120 day requirement. It's not the retrofits that is the problem, its the fact they know way in advance that they will drop you or charge ridiculous premiums leaving you scrambling which is why my premium is nothing short of price gouging. People need to read up about the cronies running the show.

I just had a random inspection done by Citizens and my 22 year old shingle roof passed fine and was marked as 'good' condition. I do have a lot of big Oaks so it's shielded from a lot of sun plus a little wind mitigation during Hurricanes.

My insurance company doubled my rate when my roof got to 15 years. So I replaced the roof at my expense. Went back to them to say I had a new roof, can you lower my rate back to where it was? “No. Actually, we’re going to increase it some more. “

> Has anyone ever successfully argued the 15-Year Roof Rule with their homeowners
Nope. literally had this happen to me last year. Hit the 15 year mark and Citizens dropped us because of the age of the roof than we were automatically placed on self imposed insurance which was a $1000/month top of the mortage and everything else. Had to spend 15k out of pocket to get the roof replaced before insurances would accept us back and take us off self imposed insurance.
I did a lot of research into defending the old roof at it really didnt have any problems. I read that you can get the roof inspected by a professional and they could write a recommendation to extend the replacement requirements, but IMO it isnt worth it as it only extends it by 2-3 years MAX and you will be forced to replace the roof at that point anyways.
