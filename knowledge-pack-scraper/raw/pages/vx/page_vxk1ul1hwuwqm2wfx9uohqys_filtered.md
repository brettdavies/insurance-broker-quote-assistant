# Progressive "Renter Protection Policy" doesn't cover liability?

I have a tenant who left a faucet running. The water spilled out and damaged hardwood floors. My tenant has a Progressive "Renter Protection Policy", which includes liability. But.. excludes liability for a .. get this.. rented property. Excluded in a renters policy is: ""Property damage" to property rented to, occupied by, used by or in the care of an "insured". This exclusion does not apply to "property damage" resulting from fire, smoke or explosion. "

Progressive is denying the claim.

Wow.... thoughts??
