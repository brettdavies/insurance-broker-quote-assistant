## Should you buy whole life insurance?
Whole life insurance is the most common type of [life insurance policy](https://www.thezebra.com/life-insurance/policies/). Whole life insurance has a number of benefits, including the ability to build cash value over time. However, as monthly premiums can run substantially higher than the average [term life policy](https://www.thezebra.com/life-insurance/policies/term-life-insurance/), whole life insurance may not be right for everyone. Read on to find out more about the perk
Recommended for:
  * Those in a higher tax bracket
  * Those who need insurance for more than 15 years
  * Those aged 35 years or older
  * Those looking for long-term investments


Not recommended for:
  * Those who are young and have lower incomes
  * Those who need a policy for less than 10 years
  * Those looking for high return investments


### Whole life insurance statistics
Whole life insurance is important to consider when looking for a new life insurance policy. The following statistics shed some light on the value and interest in whole life across multiple generations and years. For more data, consider the reports from Policy Genius and Statistica. 
  * The cost for a life insurance policy policy that accrues cash value and has a guaranteed death benefit is on average 8 times higher than a term life policy with similar coverage.
  * Whole life policies will cost more than other life insurance policies at about $3,000 to $5,000 or more annually depending on the age and health of the insured.
  * 70% of whole life insurance policies are bought by millennials and the boomer generation.
  * 46% of millennials who purchased permanent products purchased a whole life policy, followed by a universal life policy (25%).
  * In 2017, whole life was the most common type of permanent life insurance purchased.

## What is term life insurance?
Term life insurance is a type of temporary, short-term life insurance that pays a death benefit to your beneficiaries should you pass away while the policy is in effect. A death benefit is a monetary sum that can provide a safety net to your family and loved ones in the form of some financial security upon your passing.
The most common term life insurance policy duration is 10 years. If the insured lives beyond the specified period in which the policy is active, the policy simply expires and the insured would need to renew or enroll in another life insurance policy.
### Term life insurance payout statistics
Term life is another option to consider when purchasing a life insurance policy. Here are some statistics to remember before moving forward. To follow up on this data, find the full reports at Penn State University and Consumer Reports. 
  * 99% of all term policies never pay out a claim. This is due to most people letting their policies lapse.
  * If you buy a $250,000, 20-year term policy, and inflation is about 4% a year, your policy will lose 56% of its value over the next 20 years. 
  * In 2015, the average life insurance policy in the U.S. carried a face value of $160,000. 
  * The average unclaimed life insurance benefit is $2,000, but other payouts can yield $300,000.

## What do you need to know about life insurance?
Most causes of death are covered by life insurance, including natural causes, accidents, and illness. There may be stipulations around suicide, however, and life insurance may consider it exempt from coverage within the first number of years of having the policy. 
Another factor to consider — aside from how much insurance you need — is what type of life insurance is best for you and your family members. There are three kinds of life insurance policies to choose from: term life, whole life, and universal life. 
Lastly, it’s time to consider if life insurance is a good purchase for you right now. Life insurance could be a smart long-term investment for those who are:
  * The sole financial provider in a household
  * Parents, including stay-at-home partners, divorced or single parents, and parents of a special-needs child
  * Homeowners with a mortgage
  * Business owners
  * High net-worth individuals
  * Those paying off debt
  * Those concerned about funeral costs
  * Those looking to provide an inheritance
