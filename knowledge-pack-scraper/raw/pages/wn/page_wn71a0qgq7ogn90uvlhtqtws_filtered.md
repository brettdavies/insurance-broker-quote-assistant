## What is term life insurance?

Term life insurance is a type of temporary, short-term life insurance that pays a death benefit to your beneficiaries should you pass away while the policy is in effect. A death benefit is a monetary sum that can provide a safety net to your family and loved ones in the form of some financial security upon your passing.

The most common term life insurance policy duration is 10 years. If the insured lives beyond the specified period in which the policy is active, the policy simply expires and the insured would need to renew or enroll in another life insurance policy.

### Term life insurance payout statistics

Term life is another option to consider when purchasing a life insurance policy. Here are some statistics to remember before moving forward. To follow up on this data, find the full reports at Penn State University and Consumer Reports.

* 99% of all term policies never pay out a claim. This is due to most people letting their policies lapse.
* If you buy a $250,000, 20-year term policy, and inflation is about 4% a year, your policy will lose 56% of its value over the next 20 years.
* In 2015, the average life insurance policy in the U.S. carried a face value of $160,000.
* The average unclaimed life insurance benefit is $2,000, but other payouts can yield $300,000.

## What do you need to know about life insurance?

Most causes of death are covered by life insurance, including natural causes, accidents, and illness. There may be stipulations around suicide, however, and life insurance may consider it exempt from coverage within the first number of years of having the policy.

Another factor to consider — aside from how much insurance you need — is what type of life insurance is best for you and your family members. There are three kinds of life insurance policies to choose from: term life, whole life, and universal life.

Lastly, it’s time to consider if life insurance is a good purchase for you right now. Life insurance could be a smart long-term investment for those who are:

* The sole financial provider in a household
* Parents, including stay-at-home partners, divorced or single parents, and parents of a special-needs child
* Homeowners with a mortgage
* Business owners
* High net-worth individuals
* Those paying off debt
* Those concerned about funeral costs
* Those looking to provide an inheritance
