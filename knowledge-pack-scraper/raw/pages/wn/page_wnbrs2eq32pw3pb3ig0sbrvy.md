# Do you need RV insurance?
Nearly every state requires you to carry an RV insurance policy with liability coverage if you drive a motorhome. If you're towing a travel trailer, the liability coverage on your tow vehicle extends to your travel trailer. While insurance for your travel trailer is optional in all states, lenders typically require comprehensive and collision coverage if you finance your trailer or motorhome.

## What RV insurance coverages do you need?
Here are the coverages that you may need on your RV insurance policy:
### Bodily injury and property damage liability
Almost all states require [RV liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-liability-coverage/) before you can get behind the wheel of your motorhome. Note that if you have a travel trailer, you need auto liability coverage on the vehicle you use to pull your trailer.
### Comprehensive and collision
[RV comprehensive and collision](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-collision-comprehensive-coverage/) are separate coverages, but both are typically required by your lender or lease company if you finance or lease your motorhome or travel trailer.
### Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injured
Some states may mandate [uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-vs-underinsured-coverage/) for your motorhome.
Find out [what your state requires](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-rv-insurance-requirements/) when it comes to RV insurance and get additional information about [RV insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/coverages/).
## Do you have to have insurance on a travel trailer?
There are no [travel trailer insurance](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/travel-trailer-insurance/) requirements for any state, but [auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) is required in nearly every state for the vehicle used to tow your trailer. If you make payments on your travel trailer, regardless of whether you lease or buy, your lender will typically require a travel trailer insurance policy.
Since liability coverage isn't an option for travel trailer insurance, your travel trailer policy will consist of coverages for physical damage and other RV insurance coverages you choose to add. Comprehensive coverage is included for all travel trailer policies, while collision may be optional if your trailer is paid in full.
## What if your motorhome or travel trailer is your permanent residence?
If you live in your RV full-time, you can purchase [full-time RV insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/full-time-rv-insurance/) — a policy consisting of coverages offering broader protection for when your RV is parked. Full-time RV insurance isn't mandatory but may be valuable if your RV is your permanent residence.
For instance, full-timer's liability coverage can cover you, up to a specified limit, if you're responsible for injuries in or near your RV, and loss assessment coverage may pay for fees charged by your RV association for damage to shared areas.
