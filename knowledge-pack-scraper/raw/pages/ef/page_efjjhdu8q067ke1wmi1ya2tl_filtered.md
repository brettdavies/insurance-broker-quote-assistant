# New York Home Insurance

Whether you choose to make your home in iconic Niagara Falls, the suburban community of Irondequoit, the capital city of Albany or somewhere else in New York, having the right home insurance policy is crucial for protecting yourself and your property from unforeseen accidents and events. With Amica, you can customize your New York homeowners policy by selecting coverage limits, deductible amounts and additional coverage options to ensure that you have the protection you need.

## Is home insurance required in New York?

New Yorkdoesn’t legally require homeowners to have insurance on their property, but if you finance your home through a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to have [homeowners insurance](/en/products/home-insurance.html). Even if you own your home outright without a mortgage, it's still highly advisable to have homeowners insurance. Home insurance is not a one-size-fits-all product. It should be tailored to your specific situation and needs.

## Typical New York homeowners insurance coverages

* **Coverage A – Dwelling:**

  Coverage for your home and attached structures for damage caused by events such as fire, lightning, wind or hail.
* **Coverage B – Other structures:**

  This covers damage to other structures on the property that are set apart from the dwelling, such as a fence, shed or detached garage.
* **Coverage C – Personal property:**

  Coverage for your belongings, such as furniture, clothing and electronics, if they’re damaged by a cause listed in your policy.
* **Coverage D – Loss of use:**

  This covers your temporary living expenses when a covered loss makes your home unfit to live in.
* **Coverage E – Personal liability:**

  This covers damage or injury to another person or their property that you’re responsible for causing. It also covers legal assistance for claims made against you.
* **Coverage F – Medical payments to others:**

  This coverage can pay for medical bills for people who are accidentally hurt on your property, not including members of your household.

Remember, each of these coverages is subject to a policy limit and exclusions, which are specified within your policy.

Your homeowners insurance won’t cover flood damages, so it helps to ensure you’re properly covered if there’s a flood. Flood insurance policies are available and are written through the federally backed National Flood Insurance Program. It’s common for mortgage companies to require flood insurance if your home is within or near a floodplain. Regardless, a flood can occur anywhere, and it’s a good idea to buy this additional coverage.

### Additional coverages in New York

You may find that the general coverages afforded in a basic homeowners policy don’t cover certain losses or types of property. Amica offers [home insurance options](/en/resources/home/coverage/home-insurance-options.html) in the form of policy endorsements that can fill in some of those gaps in coverage. Adding endorsements to your New York homeowners insurance policy can provide valuable additional coverage tailored to your specific needs. Here are a few endorsements you might consider:

* **Special computer coverage:**

  Additional protection beyond what’s included in your policy for devices against direct physical loss, like accidental damage or theft. Devices covered under special computer coverage include:

  + Desktops
  + Laptops
  + Smartphones
  + Gaming devices
  + Smart TVs
* **Identity fraud expenses:**

  Identity theft is a growing concern, and this endorsement can help cover expenses associated with restoring your identity, such as legal fees, lost wages and other related costs.
* **Water backup and sump overflow:**

  Unexpected and accidental water damage, like from an appliance or burst pipes, is covered by most homeowners insurance policies. But, at the same time, they also exclude coverage for backed-up sewers and drains. This endorsement provides coverage for water that backs-up through drains and sump pumps, which could be excluded under the standard policy.
* **Scheduled personal property:**

  If you have high-value items such as jewelry, fine art or collectibles, a basic homeowners policy may not provide sufficient coverage. With this endorsement, you can insure specific items to make sure they're adequately covered against loss or damage.
* **Earthquakes:**

  A standard New York policy excludes damage caused by earth movement, including earthquakes. This endorsement would extend coverage to damage caused by an earthquake.

## Facts and figures about New York

### Common claims in New York:

Because of its location, New York experiences a range of weather conditions that can pose risks to homeowners.

* **Coastal storms:** Areas, including New York City and Long Island, face risks associated with coastal storms, which can lead to property damage, flooding and erosion. Inland areas may be less susceptible to coastal hazards but can still experience flooding from rivers, streams or heavy rainfall.
* **Ice dams**: Ice dams occur when snow on the roof melts and refreezes at the edges, forming a barrier that prevents water from draining properly. This can lead to water seeping into the attic or walls, damaging ceilings, insulation and interior spaces. Homeowners insurance may cover repairs for damage caused by ice dams.
* **Frozen pipes**: When temperatures drop below freezing, water pipes in homes can freeze and burst, causing significant water damage. If heat in the home is properly maintained, homeowners insurance typically covers damage resulting from burst pipes, including water cleanup and repairs to the affected areas.

It's important to note that flood damage isn’t covered under standard homeowners insurance policies. Homeowners in flood-prone areas may need to purchase separate flood insurance to protect against this risk.

### Fun facts about New York:

* Yogurt is the official state snack of New York.2
* Almost a third of the battles in the American Revolution took place in New York.3
* Lyman Frank Baum, who wrote The Wizard of Oz, was born and raised in Chittenango.4
