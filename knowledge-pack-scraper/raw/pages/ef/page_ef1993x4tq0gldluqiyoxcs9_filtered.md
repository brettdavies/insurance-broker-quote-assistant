Defensive driving courses are educational programs that help motorists become safer drivers. If you complete a defensive driving course, you may score a discount of 5% to 20% on your [**car insurance premium**](/car-insurance/). Taking a defensive driving course might also come in handy if you have a traffic infraction on your driving record.

Here’s a closer look at what a defensive driving course is and how you may potentially land a defensive driving discount.

## What is a defensive driver discount?

A defensive driving course can teach you how to improve your driving skills to better anticipate situations that may lead to car accidents. Many car insurance companies offer [**discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) to policyholders who complete a defensive driving program.[[1]](#cite-1)

Savings vary by insurer, but a discount of about 10% is typical. Also, if the approved course helps you prevent an accident, you’ll be able to save even more, as car insurance rates usually increase after [**at-fault accidents**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/).

## Where to take a defensive driver course

You can take a defensive driving course online or in person in a classroom setting. Depending on the class format and state regulations, it can take between four and 12 hours to complete and usually costs less than $100.

Defensive driving courses are typically optional. But some U.S. states, like Connecticut, Ohio, and New York, require you to take a defensive driving course to reinstate your license after a moving violation conviction.

A few organizations that offer defensive driving courses include:

* [**National Safety Council**](https://www.nsc.org/safety-training/defensive-driving)**:** The National Safety Council has offered defensive driving courses in the U.S. since 1964. It offers courses for professional drivers, senior drivers, and young drivers.
* [**I Drive Safely**](https://www.idrivesafely.com/)**:** I Drive Safely is an online driver safety company specializing in driving courses that meet state and other requirements. Online and in-person classes are available. Pricing varies by location.
* [**American Safety Council**](https://www.americansafetycouncil.com/)**:** The American Safety Council provides state-approved online driving courses for drivers of any age, including teens and seniors. Completing one of these courses can help dismiss traffic tickets, reinstate a driver’s license, or lower car insurance premiums.

### Benefits of taking a defensive driving course

Taking a defensive driving course provides a number of benefits, such as:

* **Cheaper car insurance premiums:** When you complete a defensive driving course, your insurance company may reward you with lower rates on your auto insurance.
* **Reduce points:** If you receive a traffic violation, a defensive driving course may remove points from your record.
* **Dismiss traffic tickets:** Depending on the state you live in, you might be able to dismiss a traffic ticket after you complete a defensive driving course at an accredited school.
* **Learn or refresh driving knowledge:** A defensive driving course can help make you a better driver.
* **Reduce the risk of accidents:** A defensive driving course can help learn how to prevent accidents that can lead to vehicle damage, injuries, and higher car insurance premiums.
* **Familiarize yourself with local driving laws:** A defensive driving course may help you stay on top of your state’s driving laws.
* **Fewer car repairs:** Learning to drive defensively can help you avoid accidents and spot potholes or other hazards that may damage your vehicle.
* **Drive more confidently in extreme weather:** A defensive driving course can help you be more prepared to drive safely in harsh weather.

## How to secure a defensive driving discount

To lock in a defensive driving discount, sign up for an auto policy from an insurer that offers one. Then, find an accredited course and complete it.

Once you pass the comprehension test at the end of the program, you may qualify for a discount. Most car insurance companies require you to submit a certificate of completion to prove you’ve passed the test.

In many cases, a defensive driving insurance discount is worthwhile. You could save around 10% on your auto insurance premium and become a safer driver in the process.

Defensive driving discounts vary by state and insurance company. Nationwide, for example, offers about 5% off on your insurance company, while GEICO’s defensive driving course discount is about 10%.[[2]](#cite-2)

A defensive driving course is usually good for up to three years. But the time period can vary by state and insurer.

Yes. Many car insurance companies provide discounts to customers who pass online defensive driving courses. A self-paced online course can be a more convenient way to complete a course and lock in a rate discount.
