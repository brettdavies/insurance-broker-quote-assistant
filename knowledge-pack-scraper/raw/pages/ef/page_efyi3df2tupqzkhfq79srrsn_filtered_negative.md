# Is State Farm Guilty of Racial Discrimination? The Presence of Algorithmic Bias in Claims Systems
* [FULR Management](https://www.fulr.org/profile/ianzhou412/profile)

Ms. Wynn and Ms. Huskey are only two of thousands of individuals who have claimed that they have been treated unfairly due to State Farm’s use of algorithmic decision-making tools in its claims review process. (16) The plaintiffs claim that the algorithmic decision-making tools that State Farm employs are trained to predict the chances of fraud within each claimant. (17) Those who are deemed to be “low touch” are paid out immediately, while those who are deemed to be “high touch” are faced with more scrutiny, resulting in lengthy delays on their claims. (18) The bias is believed to have been caused by the system’s inputs “that correspond with race or learn from historic housing or claims data that is biased.” (19) If there is a racial bias within State Farm’s system, that does not necessarily mean it was intentionally placed there. There is a chance that an algorithmic bias is present, which occurs when the inputs of the algorithm, usually imposed by the data science team that collects and codes the training data, result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes. (20) Algorithmic bias has been a growing concern in recent years, with an increasing number of companies and institutions using algorithms to aid in decision-making scenarios. To reference a recent case, algorithmic bias was also found in the COMPAS algorithm (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), which was used to assess the risk of recidivism and produced a higher false positive rate for black defendants compared to white defendants.
