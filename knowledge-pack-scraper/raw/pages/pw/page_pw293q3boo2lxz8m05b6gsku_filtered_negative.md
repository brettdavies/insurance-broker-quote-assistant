Bankrate.com is an independent, advertising-supported publisher and comparison service. We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
According to Bankrate’s analysis of annual premiums from Quadrant Information Services, the average cost of car insurance in the U.S. is $2,671 per year — an uncomfortably high bill for many Americans. Since 2024, the average cost of a full coverage car insurance policy has increased around 12 percent. Minimum coverage, on the other hand, has an average annual cost of $806. It's important to note that actual car insurance rates can vary a lot, even between similar drivers in the same area. For instance, the type of vehicle you're insuring and your personal driving record have a significant impact on your individual insurance costs. Still, knowing the average cost of car insurance can help you estimate car insurance costs and ensure you're not overpaying for this [necessary financial protection](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/why-is-car-insurance-mandatory/#why).

[ Other factors ](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/#factors-that-impact-the-cost-of-car-insurance)
The average cost of car insurance [varies between states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) for many reasons. Factors like accident and claim frequency, the cost of labor and vehicle parts, vehicle theft frequency and road conditions all play a part. The [coverage levels you choose](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-really-need/) will also factor into your final premium. Here, we cover the two most common coverage limits — full coverage and minimum coverage — to give a holistic picture of average rates. Drivers who have leases or loans on their vehicles typically have full coverage policies with comprehensive and collision coverage, along with higher liability limits of 100/300/50. Drivers of older cars, on the other hand, may choose to have a policy that only meets the state-mandated minimum for coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist coverage and/or personal injury protection. Minimum coverage requirements also vary by state, which can affect insurance costs.

###  How much is auto insurance based on gender?
* Male drivers ages 20 and 25 pay about 11 percent more and 5 percent more for car insurance, respectively.
* By age 40, the national average full coverage car insurance cost for men is only 1 percent more than for women.

[ Read our full methodology ](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/#methodology)
* **DUI conviction:** After being convicted of a DUI, drivers pay an average of 96 percent more for car insurance, and that conviction may stay on your driving record for 10 years or more. The amount surcharged will also vary in each state. For example, the [average cost of car insurance after a DUI ](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/)for a full coverage policy is $202 per month in Idaho, but $671 per month in Michigan.
[Drivers with poor credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) pay nearly 76 percent more for full coverage car insurance compared to those with good credit. This is because drivers with poor credit are seen as [more likely to file claims](https://www.iii.org/article/what-determines-price-my-auto-insurance-policy) compared to drivers with excellent credit, based on actuarial data. In states where using a [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) as a rating factor is allowed, insurers review your insurance credit tier, which is not necessarily identical to your credit score from services like Experian, TransUnion or Equifax.

The [type of vehicle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-and-model/) you drive has a significant impact on your car insurance premium. Generally speaking, a foreign car with expensive parts or a sports car with a low safety rating will cost more to insure than a minivan or well-rated sedan. Other factors include the price and availability of parts, the cost of labor, and how much damage your vehicle could cause in an accident. Your vehicle’s safety and crash prevention features may also be considered when underwriting a policy. The [vehicle makes and models](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) in the table below are suited for a variety of lifestyles and budgets.

* **High-end vehicles, like**[**luxury or sports cars**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/luxury-car-insurance/): High-value vehicles cost more to insure because they often cost more to replace as well as to repair. Sports cars and sporty versions of luxury models also present an added risk of at-fault accidents thanks to powerful engines and high top speeds.
* **Compare multiple quotes**: Every auto insurance company calculates rates differently, and these systems change. Regularly [comparing quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) can help you find the best coverage at the most competitive price in a shifting market.
* **Reduce your mileage**: Driving less than the average annual mileage reduces your risk of accidents. If you’re able to work from home, carpool or switch to another form of transportation, you may qualify for a lower rate [based on your mileage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/low-mileage/).
* **Raise your deductible**: If you have full coverage on your vehicle, increasing your [deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) — the amount you pay out of pocket to make a claim — can lower your monthly premium. Keep in mind, however, that this could increase your expenses after a covered claim by several hundred dollars.
