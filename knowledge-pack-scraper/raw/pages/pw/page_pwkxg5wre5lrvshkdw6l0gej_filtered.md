CANYON, Texas (KVII) — A hailstorm caused widespread damage in Canyon.

A storm producing 84 mph winds and 3-inch hail blew through between 2-3 a.m. Sunday.

According to city officials, more than 200 homes suffered damage.

Hail also shattered windows and busted up vehicles at the Legends Apartments.

The West Texas A&M campus suffered hail damage as well. There are numerous broken windows on buildings and dorms, along with broken windshields and battered cars.

Mayor Gary Hinders signed a disaster declaration at 2 p.m.

Canyon City Manager Joe Price said the public works department have been working since 8 a.m. to clear roadways, pick up tree limbs from the road and work with public services to clear debris.

Hinders said he can't remember a severe weather season like this and reminded residents that while they have sirens, you can still sign up for text alerts from NWS Amarillo for emergency alerts.

The Texas Division of Emergency Management is in the area to help.

Price advised residents to be cautions of solicitors going door to door and said they must have a permit from planning and development. He said if things "get out of hand" the city will issue citations.
