Umbrella insurance provides extra liability protection that kicks in when your home or [auto insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) limits max out.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/umbrella-insurance#cite-1) It helps cover major car accidents, serious injuries on your property, or lawsuits — expenses that could otherwise put your savings or assets at risk.
Umbrella insurance is a type of personal liability coverage that provides an extra layer of financial protection beyond your homeowners, [renters](https://www.compare.com/renters-insurance), or [auto liability limits](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-do-policy-limit-numbers-mean). Some people refer to it as excess liability insurance, but umbrella insurance also gives you broader protection for certain claims your underlying policies don’t cover.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/umbrella-insurance#cite-2)

Personal injury lawsuits can be costly if they go to trial. For example, in 2020, the median jury award was about $125,000, but the average verdict exceeded $2.4 million.[[3]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/umbrella-insurance#cite-3)

The average $1 million umbrella policy costs $383 per year for one home and two cars and drivers, with a $500,000 underlying liability limit, according to a recent ACE Private Risk Services report.[[4]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/umbrella-insurance#cite-4) Your cost may increase if you have [teen drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens), own rental properties, or own features that increase liability risk, such as a swimming pool, trampoline, boat, or dog.
