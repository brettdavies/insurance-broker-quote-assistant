## How much is car insurance?

According to Bankrate’s analysis of annual premiums from Quadrant Information Services, the average cost of car insurance in the U.S. is $2,671 per year  — an uncomfortably high bill for many Americans. Since 2024, the average cost of a full coverage car insurance policy has increased around 12 percent. Minimum coverage, on the other hand, has an average annual cost of $806. It's important to note that actual car insurance rates can vary a lot, even between similar drivers in the same area. For instance, the type of vehicle you're insuring and your personal driving record have a significant impact on your individual insurance costs. Still, knowing the average cost of car insurance can help you estimate car insurance costs and ensure you're not overpaying for this [necessary financial protection](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/why-is-car-insurance-mandatory/#why).

### Key insights from Bankrate's 2025 car insurance cost analysis:

* Full coverage car insurance costs an average of $2,671 per year, while minimum coverage is $806 per year. On a monthly basis, full coverage averages $223, with minimum coverage averaging $67 per month.
* USAA, Auto-Owners and Geico offer some of the cheapest full coverage car insurance but may not be available to all drivers depending on occupation and geography.
* Men tend to pay more than women for car insurance, on average, since data show they are more likely to engage in riskier driving behaviors.
* Vehicles with poor safety ratings, high theft rates or higher repair costs (like foreign vehicles) often have higher average premiums.

## How much does car insurance cost by state?

The average cost of car insurance [varies between states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) for many reasons. Factors like accident and claim frequency, the cost of labor and vehicle parts, vehicle theft frequency and road conditions all play a part. The [coverage levels you choose](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-really-need/) will also factor into your final premium. Here, we cover the two most common coverage limits — full coverage and minimum coverage — to give a holistic picture of average rates. Drivers who have leases or loans on their vehicles typically have full coverage policies with comprehensive and collision coverage, along with higher liability limits of 100/300/50. Drivers of older cars, on the other hand, may choose to have a policy that only meets the state-mandated minimum for coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist coverage and/or personal injury protection. Minimum coverage requirements also vary by state, which can affect insurance costs.

## How much does car insurance cost by age?

Car insurance companies use many different rating factors to determine your premium, and in most states, [your age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) significantly impacts how much you pay for coverage. Statistically speaking, younger drivers (especially teens) are more likely to be involved in an accident and file insurance claims. Because of the added risk, [younger drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) tend to pay more for auto insurance compared to drivers with more experience behind the wheel.

Average rates tend to decrease from ages 25 to 60 but begin to creep back upward when a driver reaches their 70s. Advanced age can cause decreased reaction time and poorer eyesight, which in turn can increase the likelihood of an accident. Because of this, [senior drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) typically see elevated insurance rates.

  ### How much is auto insurance based on gender?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Gender impacts car insurance pricing in most states. [Women](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-women/) tend to pay lower premiums than men, particularly among younger age groups. This is because men generally engage in [riskier driving behavior](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-highway-safety) and have a higher rate of accident severity, according to the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I). To account for the added risk, insurers typically charge men higher rates than their female counterparts. However, the difference between male and female drivers is typically negligible after the age of 25.

  + Male drivers ages 20 and 25 pay about 11 percent more and 5 percent more for car insurance, respectively.
  + By age 40, the national average full coverage car insurance cost for men is only 1 percent more than for women.

  Not all states allow gender to be a factor in rates, though. If you live in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina or Pennsylvania, your gender does not affect how much you pay for car insurance because of state regulations prohibiting this rating factor.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance?

Drivers with a single at-fault accident on their driving record pay 43 percent more for car insurance on average compared to drivers with a clean driving record. This average increase is even higher for drivers with a DUI conviction, who pay 96 percent more than the national average for full coverage. If you have more than one incident on your driving record, or if an individual incident is severe enough, you may be considered a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/).

* **Speeding ticket**: Earning a speeding ticket conviction is one of the most common driving infractions. On average, drivers with a single ticket pay 22 percent more for coverage than drivers with clean records. Every car insurance carrier will have its own algorithm for determining rates after a speeding ticket. For example, even [after a speeding ticket conviction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-tickets/), Erie and Auto-Owner’s average car insurance rates are both well below the national average cost of auto insurance.
* **At-fault accident:** An at-fault accident on your record raises average monthly full coverage car insurance payments from $223 to $322. If this is your first accident and you’ve previously added optional coverage like accident forgiveness to your policy, you may be able to avoid the surcharge.
* **DUI conviction:** After being convicted of a DUI, drivers pay an average of 96 percent more for car insurance, and that conviction may stay on your driving record for 10 years or more. The amount surcharged will also vary in each state. For example, the [average cost of car insurance after a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) for a full coverage policy is $202 per month in Idaho, but $671 per month in Michigan.

## How much does car insurance cost by credit score?

[Drivers with poor credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) pay nearly 76 percent more for full coverage car insurance compared to those with good credit. This is because drivers with poor credit are seen as [more likely to file claims](https://www.iii.org/article/what-determines-price-my-auto-insurance-policy) compared to drivers with excellent credit, based on actuarial data. In states where using a [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) as a rating factor is allowed, insurers review your insurance credit tier, which is not necessarily identical to your credit score from services like Experian, TransUnion or Equifax.

Regulations in California, Hawaii and Massachusetts prohibit auto insurers from using credit as a factor when setting rates.

## How much does car insurance cost by vehicle type?

The [type of vehicle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-and-model/) you drive has a significant impact on your car insurance premium. Generally speaking, a foreign car with expensive parts or a sports car with a low safety rating will cost more to insure than a minivan or well-rated sedan. Other factors include the price and availability of parts, the cost of labor, and how much damage your vehicle could cause in an accident. Your vehicle’s safety and crash prevention features may also be considered when underwriting a policy.  The [vehicle makes and models](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) in the table below are suited for a variety of lifestyles and budgets.

[Read our full methodology](#methodology)

The vehicles listed above are representative of common model types seen across the United States. Our list includes a variety of luxury and standard brands and a broad selection of model sizes. Some vehicle makes and models are considered more [expensive to insure](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/most-expensive-cars-to-insure/) by insurance companies. Vehicles that may carry higher insurance costs include:

* **High-end vehicles, like** [**luxury or sports cars**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/luxury-car-insurance/): High-value vehicles cost more to insure because they often cost more to replace as well as to repair. Sports cars and sporty versions of luxury models also present an added risk of at-fault accidents thanks to powerful engines and high top speeds.
* **SUVs, vans and other large vehicles**: While large vehicles like SUVs and vans can reduce the risk of damage to your vehicle or injuries to your passengers, they can cause more damage to other vehicles and their occupants, leading to higher liability costs.
* **Common, more affordable vehicles:** Economy cars may be more affordable upfront, but their lack of advanced security and safety features could increase your risk of claims. Cheap Hyundai and Kia models, for instance, are common theft targets due to a lack of key security features.
* **Hybrid and electric vehicles:** The insurance cost gap between [electric and hybrid cars](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/electric-car-insurance/) and their gas-powered counterparts is closing, but not gone. EVs come with steep repair costs thanks to expensive parts and specialized labor, which can lead to higher rates for comprehensive and collision coverage.
* **Vehicles with low safety ratings:** Opting for a car with lower safety ratings could raise the base rate you pay for insurance, since these vehicles may have a higher chance of getting into accidents and can sustain more damage in the event of a crash.

## What other things affect my car insurance price?

Your car insurance price can also be influenced by less apparent [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/):

* **Your occupation:** Your insurer may consider certain professions to be less risky to insure based on job requirements or your commute.
* **The annual mileage on your car:** Cars with lower mileage can be cheaper to insure since they’re exposed to fewer risks on the road.
* **Your marital status:** Some insurers associate marriage with stability and reduced risk, so they may charge married couples lower premiums in states that allow this as a rating factor.
* **Where you park your vehicle:** You may get a cheaper premium if you keep your car parked in a secure parking garage or your home garage instead of on the street where it’s more likely to be vandalized or stolen.
* **Coverage selections**: If you select higher [liability limits](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-liability/), choose lower deductible levels or add optional coverage types like comprehensive and collision coverage, your rates will likely be higher.
* **Insurance history**: [Lapses in your coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/lapse-in-coverage/) (unless you did not own a car during that time) can be an indication of high-risk behavior and may increase your premium.

## How are car insurance rates changing?

Unfortunately, car insurance rates continue to climb. However, our analysis of rate data from Quadrant Information Services found that, while rates are still rising, they are rising more slowly compared to prior years. From 2023 to 2024, the average cost of full coverage car insurance increased by 14 percent and again by 12 percent from 2024 to 2025.

These can partially be attributed to 2022's historic net combined underwriting losses, says Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications for the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I). That year, he told Bankrate, for every dollar collected in premiums, the auto industry paid out $1.12 in claims — the worst underwriting result in nearly 50 years. Friedlander also told Bankrate that Triple-I expects auto replacement costs to rise, and labor costs could also change drastically. Rises in auto parts and labor can drive up the cost of property damage liability, collision and comprehensive coverage.

The Trump Administration could also affect the cost of car insurance. Car insurance is regulated at the state, not the federal level. However, some of President Trump's policies, like his [implemented tariffs](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/tariffs-and-car-prices-pose-challenges-for-consumers/), could influence your car insurance premium.

Effective April 3, 2025, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on all imported passenger vehicles entering the United States, regardless of their origin. A similar tariff against automotive parts took effect on May 3, 2025. Exemptions have been granted to vehicles and automotive parts that meet the Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but the cost to own and insure a car could still go up. When it becomes more expensive to fix a car, insurers are likely to increase premiums.

Effective June 4, 2025, President Trump announced a 50 percent increase on foreign aluminum and steel. The following week, he threatened to impose further tariffs on new cars, in addition to the 25 percent tariff he had imposed just two months earlier. The majority of U.S. trade partners were given until [July 9, 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-trump-china-vietnam-july-9/) to negotiate a trade deal or face new tariffs starting August 1, 2025. This could lead to increased tariffs as high as 70 percent. In turn, the price of auto parts and auto insurance could continue to climb.

## How to lower your car insurance costs

If you're looking to save when [buying car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/how-to-get-car-insurance/), there are several simple strategies you can use to lower your costs:

* **Compare multiple quotes**: Every auto insurance company calculates rates differently, and these systems change. Regularly [comparing quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) can help you find the best coverage at the most competitive price in a shifting market.
* **Bundle your policies**: Purchasing more than one policy with the same insurer is one of the most common ways to save money on insurance. For instance, customers often bundle their auto insurance with homeowners or renters insurance. Carriers often refer to this as a bundling or multi-policy discount.
* **Reduce your mileage**: Driving less than the average annual mileage reduces your risk of accidents. If you’re able to work from home, carpool or switch to another form of transportation, you may qualify for a lower rate [based on your mileage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/low-mileage/).
* **Raise your deductible**: If you have full coverage on your vehicle, increasing your [deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) — the amount you pay out of pocket to make a claim — can lower your monthly premium. Keep in mind, however, that this could increase your expenses after a covered claim by several hundred dollars.
* **Look for discounts**: Layering multiple car insurance discounts can significantly reduce your premium. Most insurers offer discounts, but the number, type and availability of discounts varies, so do your research when you shop.

### How is inflation impacting the auto insurance industry compared to the economy as a whole?

Kenneth Chavis IV

Senior wealth advisor at Versant Capital Management](https://www.bankrate.com/authors/kenneth-chavis-iv/)

"Inflation has impacted the auto insurance industry similarly to many other industries. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a sharp rise in the cost of premiums for auto insurance driven in part by inflation. This is specifically due to higher labor and parts costs for repairs and higher replacement costs for vehicles."

![](https://www.bankrate.com/f/102997/2400x3000/0fadea2acd/jon-schnautz-headshot.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85&width=64&height=64&fit=cover&enable=upscale&crop=1:1,smart)

Jon Schnautz

Assistant Vice President of State Affairs for National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies

“Unfortunately, leading economists do not anticipate supply chain stabilization in the near future. Additionally, many of the costs driving auto insurance rates stem from the realities drivers face on the roads, which are both behavioral in nature and constantly fluctuate. There is no single solution to the inflationary challenges facing auto insurers. While efforts at tort reform and keeping medical costs in check will help, auto insurers are ultimately subject to many of the same inflationary pressures as other businesses, with limited ability to affect meaningful changes to economic reality. However, there are still steps legislators and regulators [might] take to help soften inflationary blows. Auto insurers continue to support policies that embrace matching rate to risk and enhancing road safety and consumers’ right to repair their vehicles as they see fit."

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What's the difference between minimum and full coverage?

  Caret Down Icon 

  A minimum car insurance policy is one where the coverage limits are only enough to meet the state requirements for a car to be legally driven on public roads. This usually refers to bodily injury and property damage liability, but some states require additional forms of coverage, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage or personal injury protection (PIP).

  While there isn't an industry standard definition for full coverage, a full coverage policy typically includes [both collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/). The main difference between the two is that minimum coverage does not include coverage to help pay for damage to your vehicle, while full coverage does. Full coverage isn’t required by law in any state, but it’s a standard requirement in many auto loan or lease contracts.

  There is also a significant price difference between the two policy types. Because it offers financial protection for both the damage your vehicle does and the damage done to your vehicle, a full coverage policy is more expensive than a minimum coverage one.

* ### Does your car insurance go down after your car is paid off?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Usually, paying off your car won’t automatically lower your car insurance rate. While not common, a handful of carriers use having a lienholder as a rating factor, and drivers may see a slight increase to their policy once the lienholder is removed. However, owning your vehicle outright gives you the added flexibility of [choosing your coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/what-is-car-insurance/) and coverage limits. Lending institutions generally require drivers who finance their vehicles to carry comprehensive and collision insurance. You may also have a limit on how high of a deductible you can select. When you own your car, whether you add these coverage types becomes solely up to you.

  It may be tempting to remove comprehensive and collision coverage and opt for a more affordable liability-only policy, but most insurance professionals recommend keeping full coverage in place if you can afford to do so. Collision and comprehensive coverage may save you from extensive out-of-pocket costs if your vehicle is damaged in an accident or other covered event.

* ### Does car insurance increase every year?

  Caret Down Icon 

  [Car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-guide/) don’t automatically increase every year, but rates do respond to driver risk, claims and insurance market considerations. Your insurer will evaluate your risk profile before your policy renews and make policy adjustments based on risk factors and any approved rate filings approved by your state. You’ll typically see your insurance premium go up if you’ve filed a claim, gotten a ticket, adjusted your coverage or added a driver to your policy. Recently, most drivers have seen their rates increase at renewal each year as the cost of insurance steadily increases due to factors like inflation and increased repair costs. On the other hand, there is the possibility that your insurance premium might go down, especially if your credit history has improved or infractions have aged enough to no longer affect your premium.

* ### Which car insurance company is the cheapest?

  Caret Down Icon 

  According to our research, Auto-Owners, Erie and Geico rank as some of the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) on average for drivers in most states. However, car insurance isn't one size fits all. Factors like driving record, location, annual mileage, driving experience and coverage types can all affect how much car insurance is. Additionally, the cheapest carrier for a driver that wants to purchase many endorsements may be different from the cheapest company for a driver seeking [liability-only coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-vs-full-coverage/). Obtaining car insurance estimates from several providers and comparing coverage types and benefits is usually the best way to find the provider that meets your desired coverage and budget requirements.

* ### How can I get cheaper car insurance?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Saving money on car insurance may begin before you even purchase a vehicle. Comparing quotes from different carriers for the makes and models of cars you are interested in might give you an idea of what vehicle type may help you save on your premium.

  You may find cheaper insurance for vehicles you already own by taking advantage of discounts and [telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/). Another option is to review your policy and ensure you still need all the coverage you have. If you have more than one car or access to another vehicle, for example, you may not need to pay for [rental reimbursement coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/does-insurance-cover-rental-cars/). Additionally, depending on your state, improving your credit score may also bring down your premium over time.

For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
