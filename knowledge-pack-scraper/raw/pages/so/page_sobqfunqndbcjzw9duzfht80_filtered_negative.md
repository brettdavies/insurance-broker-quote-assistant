## State Farm vs. Farmers
State Farm and Farmers both offer homeowners policies with broad coverage.
**State Availability:** State Farm is available in 47 states, as well as Washington, D.C., while Farmers is only available in 40 states.
**Online Experience:** Both companies provide online quotes, claims services, document reviews, and more, as well as a mobile app in every state where they do business.
**Discounts and Policy Add-Ons:** State Farm offers limited discounts and a few simple endorsements for things like landlord coverage and umbrella insurance. On the other hand, Farmers offers a variety of discounts and endorsements for things like reimbursement for eco-friendly improvements and coverage for cosmetic damage; if your property suffers a loss of function from a covered peril, it will also pay for any needed cosmetic repairs, although damages deemed purely cosmetic may not be covered.
**Average Cost:** State Farm is one of the cheapest policies on the market at $129 per month. According to our data, a typical homeowners policy from Farmers costs $179.72 per month, which is about $50 more per month than a similar policy from State Farm.
Below are the average annual rates for State Farm and Farmers for several different levels of coverage:
### Do State Farm and Farmers cover mold damage or removal?
Both State Farm and Farmers offer coverage for [mold damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold) or removal, but whether or not it is covered (and the amount of coverage available) varies based on the cause of the mold. If the mold is caused by a covered peril, like a burst pipe, the company is more likely to cover the cost of removal or repair. But mold resulting from poor maintenance or neglect is not covered by standard homeowners insurance policies.
### Do State Farm and Farmers cover roof leaks?
Both companies cover roof leaks if they're caused by wind, hail, lightning, or other covered peril. If a leak appears to be the result of wear and tear or inadequate maintenance, it probably won't be covered. If you’re uncertain as to whether your policy provides coverage for leaks caused by [roof damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-damage), check with your insurance company.
### Do State Farm and Farmers cover termite damage?
Neither State Farm nor Farmers covers damage caused by [termites](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage), insects, mice, or other pests, no matter which insurance company you choose. Because there is no coverage for this type of damage, it is vital to stay on top of pest control and call an exterminator if necessary.
### Do State Farm and Farmers cover water damage?
State Farm and Farmers both cover water damage if it is caused by a covered peril that is both sudden and accidental, like a burst pipe. But water damage caused by neglect, wear and tear, flooding, and slow leaks likely won’t be covered. The best way to be protected from flood damage is to purchase a separate [flood insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance) policy.
### Do State Farm and Farmers offer homeowners insurance bundling?
Both State Farm and Farmers offer discounts for bundling your home and auto insurance. With State Farm, you can bundle your auto insurance with your homeowners, condo, or renters insurance, which, according to their website, can save you up to $1,273 annually.
Farmers Insurance also offers a [bundling discount for home and auto](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles), but if you also add a life insurance policy to your homeowners and auto bundle, Farmers says it will offer a better price on the life insurance policy as well. However, Farmers doesn’t provide specific information about how much you might save by bundling your policies.

Farmers customers have 24/7 access to the company’s website, mobile app, and live customer service agents at 888-327-6335.
In addition to the standard types of coverage included in a home insurance policy, Farmers also offers extra endorsement options, including identity theft, water and drain backups, valuable possessions, environmentally friendly improvements when rebuilding, and more. Additionally, if you file a claim for functional damage, a Farmers’ policy will also cover repairing any related cosmetic damage as part of the claim.
In terms of cost, Farmers is one of the more expensive companies in our rating, with an average monthly premium of $179.72. However, Farmers does offer many discounts, including a Claims Free discount that gives customers a break on premiums if they’ve gone three years without a claim.
Farmers is **not** available in Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia, or Washington, D.C., and although it maintains a presence in California and Florida, it has stopped writing new homeowners insurance policies in those states.
## FAQ
Neither company has anything on its website reflecting any breed limitations for your pets, but there are some personal injury attorney websites with articles stating Farmers may have changed its policy in the last few years, excluding pit bulls, rottweilers, and wolf-hybrids. The best way to make sure your dog will be covered by your liability insurance is to call the company directly and ask about your specific pet.
