## Best car insurance companies in Oregon

Based on data collected by Quadrant Information Services, drivers in the Beaver State pay an average of $841 for state-mandated minimum coverage and $2,121 for full coverage. However, your insurance quotes are likely to vary based on an assortment of personal factors, including your ZIP code, age, gender, credit-based insurance score and driving history, as well as your car's make, model and age.

We understand that for many drivers, finding the [best auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in Oregon is about more than just price. To offer you a holistic overview of the best companies in the state, we looked at third-party scores for customer service from the [2024 J.D. Power Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) and financial strength ratings from AM Best. We also considered each insurance company’s range of coverage options, available discounts and digital tool capabilities. Ultimately, Geico, Progressive, State Farm, USAA and Travelers stood out from the rest.

* #### Overview

  Caret Down Icon

  **Why Geico made our list:** In addition to some of the lowest average rates, Geico has one of the longest lists of discounts in the industry, which may help you offset the cost of your policy. You might save for being a federal employee, a safe driver or a member of certain organizations like alumni groups. Geico also has a highly rated and easy-to-use mobile app for digital policy management, although it did rank below average for service on the [2024 J.D. Power U.S. Insurance Digital Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), indicating its digital service tools may not stack up as well against some competitors these days. You may also want to keep in mind that the company doesn’t offer certain coverage options, such as gap insurance.

  **Who Geico may be good for:** If you're a young driver with a tight budget or someone who wants to spend as little as possible on your Oregon car insurance, Geico could be a good pick — especially if you qualify for a few of its discounts.

  **Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive earned a high Bankrate Score for its customizable policies and highly rated mobile app. It has an extensive list of potential discounts, including homeowner, automatic payments and the Snapshot telematics program. However, Progressive came in slightly below the segment average in the J.D. Power 2024 Auto Insurance Study for the Northwest region.

  **Who Progressive may be good for:** Progressive may be more willing than some other carriers to extend coverage to individuals with a blemish or two on their driving record. While there's no way to know if you're eligible for coverage without requesting a quote, if you have a speeding ticket or accident on your record, it may be worth looking into.

  **Why State Farm made our list:** As the [largest car insurance provider](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the U.S., State Farm is a popular choice for Oregon drivers seeking a standard variety of discounts and endorsements. State Farm stands out for its two safe driving programs: [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) for adults and Steer Clear for drivers under 25. However, the carrier does not offer gap insurance and accident forgiveness coverage must be earned. That being said, State Farm has plenty of local agents, so you can work with an agent face to face if you have more questions.

  **Who State Farm may be good for:** State Farm could be a great option for drivers seeking in-person service from a local agent.
* #### Pros and cons

  **Why USAA made our list:** Year after year, USAA consistently receives high scores from J.D. Power for customer satisfaction, although it cannot be officially ranked due to coverage eligibility requirements. Its average full coverage premium is lower than Oregon’s average, and policyholders may earn discounts for being a good student, insuring a new car or garaging their vehicle on a military base. However, take note that USAA only sells insurance to current military members, veterans and their immediate family members, so you may not be eligible for coverage.

  **Who USAA may be good for:** If you are stationed at Camp Rilea, Umatilla or any Oregon military installation, USAA may be a good fit for you. It may also be worth considering if a member of your immediate family is either an active-duty military member or a veteran.

  **Why Travelers made our list:** Travelers has competitive average rates and stands out for its unique insurance endorsements. Potential add-ons include rental coverage, new car replacement and gap insurance. The company's discount list is extensive, including some easy-to-earn discounts such as continuous insurance and paperless billing, as well as some more uncommon options like hybrid and electric car discounts. Unfortunately, Travelers was ranked second to last by J.D. Power for customer satisfaction in the Northwest region, and it came in below average in the [2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), indicating that its customers may not be totally satisfied with its service.

  **Who Travelers may be good for:** Travelers policies may be a good choice for drivers looking to customize their policies with endorsements beyond standard coverage options. The carrier may also appeal to drivers of electric and hybrid cars as it offers a potential discount for eco-friendly vehicles.

How Bankrate chose the best car insurance companies in Oregon

Bankrate chose the best car insurance in Oregon through an extensive process that began by comparing average rates collected by Quadrant Information Services. The insurance editorial team assessed each company based on their coverage options, discounts and digital tool availability. Third-party customer satisfaction rankings from J.D. Power and financial strength ratings from [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) and [Standard & Poor's](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) were also considered. After assessing all data, each company was given a Bankrate Score.

The better a carrier performed in each category, the higher its overall Bankrate Score for a total score of 5.0 out of 5.0 points. This brief overview of each carrier could be useful during your research, and may help you more effectively compare insurers.

## How to find the best car insurance in Oregon

The best car insurance for you will depend on your needs and preferences. The following steps may help you nail down what considerations to make before choosing a provider.

* Number 1 Icon

  ### Consider minimum insurance requirements in Oregon

  Caret Down Icon 

  Most states, including Oregon, have minimum liability insurance requirements that you must meet in order to legally operate a vehicle on public roads. In Oregon, drivers are required to purchase bodily injury and property damage liability, personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage. The exact coverage amounts you need can be found on the [Oregon Department of Transportation website](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/driverid/insurance.aspx).

* Number 2 Icon

  ### Consider lender requirements

  Caret Down Icon 

  If you lease or finance your vehicle, your lender may require you to purchase [full coverage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) rather than just the minimum liability insurance required by the state. Additionally, you may want to consider [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/). This common optional coverage type for new vehicles helps pay the difference between what you owe on the vehicle and its value if your car gets totaled or is stolen and unrecoverable.

  ### Consider your individual needs

  Caret Down Icon 

  Your unique life events often affect your auto insurance rate. For instance, will you have to add a teen driver to your car insurance? Average rates for [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) can be high, but some providers offer discounts for good students that could help decrease your teen’s auto insurance rate. Do you have a DUI conviction? You may want to look into insurers who offer options for [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). Speaking with a licensed insurance agent may help you identify any special considerations you may want to take into account when choosing coverage.

* ###### Why do car insurance companies have different rates?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Every car insurance company has its own rating algorithm to determine how much to charge you for coverage. These formulas are developed by taking various driver metrics into consideration. These metrics may include a driver’s claim history, as well as the likelihood of claims in your area and the severity of those claims, among other factors. Because of this, each company will weigh your rating factors differently. One company might heavily [surcharge you for a ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) while another only mildly increases your premium. This is why it may be helpful to get quotes from several companies.

* ### Credit-based insurance scores:

  Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

* ### Age:

  Caret Down Icon 

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
