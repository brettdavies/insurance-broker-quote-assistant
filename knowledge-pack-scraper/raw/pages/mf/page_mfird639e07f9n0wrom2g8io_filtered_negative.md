* ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in Oregon?
* ###  Do you have to have car insurance in Oregon?
* ###  How much car insurance do I need in Oregon?
According to Oregon state law, there are several types of insurance you need to have. Liability insurance pays for injuries or damage to the other car, its driver and passengers, and any damaged property. [Personal injury protection](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) (PIP) coverage is required in no-fault states such as Oregon and helps pay for medical expenses and lost wages for you and your passengers. You are also required to have [uninsured/underinsured](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) motorist insurance, which helps pay damages if the other driver does not have insurance or enough insurance to cover all costs resulting from an accident. If you have a car loan or lease, you may be required to purchase collision and comprehensive insurance, as well.
