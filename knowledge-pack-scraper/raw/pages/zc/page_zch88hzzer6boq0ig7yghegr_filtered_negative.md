# Is a $1 Million Umbrella Policy Worth the Price Tag?
* [ April 28, 2025 ](https://strangeins.com/2025/04/28/)
Discover $1 million umbrella policy cost, coverage, and savings tips. Learn if $1 million is enough for your peace of mind.
## Understanding the True Cost of Protection
When people first hear about umbrella insurance, they often assume it must be expensive. After all, a million dollars of coverage sounds like it would come with a hefty price tag. But here’s the surprising truth: a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is one of the best insurance values you’ll find anywhere.
Most households can expect to pay between $150 and $300 annually for their first million in coverage. The national average sits at around $383 per year for a typical family with one home, two cars, and two drivers. That breaks down to roughly a dollar a day for significant peace of mind.
Even more remarkable is how affordable additional coverage becomes. Each extra million dollars of protection generally adds only about $75 to your annual premium. The cost per dollar of coverage actually decreases as your protection increases.
Coverage Amount | Average Annual Cost
---|---
$1 million | $150-$300
$2 million | $225-$375
$5 million | $375-$525
To put this in perspective, many families spend more on coffee each month than they would on umbrella coverage for an entire year. For less than your streaming service subscriptions, you’re buying protection against life-altering financial disasters.
> “An umbrella policy is by far and away the best deal in insurance coverage. It’s a deal you shouldn’t pass up, as you may be just one slippery banana peel away from a major lawsuit.”
Your umbrella policy doesn’t work alone. It activates after your standard auto or homeowners liability limits are exhausted, essentially extending your existing coverage. This includes protection for bodily injury claims, property damage, and even personal injury scenarios like defamation or invasion of privacy.
As someone who’s helped hundreds of families steer their insurance needs, I’ve seen how a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** represents possibly the most cost-effective insurance decision a family can make relative to the protection it provides.

## How Does a Personal Umbrella Policy Work?
![umbrella coverage infographic - $1 million umbrella policy cost](https://strangeins.com/1-million-umbrella-policy-cost/)
Imagine you’re caught in a sudden downpour without an umbrella – you’d get soaked, right? That’s exactly how financial liability works without proper coverage. A personal umbrella policy acts just like that extra-large umbrella you wish you had – it keeps you dry when the rain gets heavier than your regular protection can handle.
Your umbrella policy sits above your existing home and auto insurance, ready to deploy when those policies have reached their limits. It’s that simple, yet that powerful.
Let me paint a picture: You’re driving home from work when you accidentally rear-end another car, causing a multi-car pileup. Your auto policy covers $300,000 in liability, but the total damages and medical bills reach $800,000. Without an umbrella policy, you’d be personally on the hook for that extra $500,000 – potentially forcing you to sell assets or have wages garnished for years. With a **$1 million umbrella policy**, you’d be covered, and you could focus on moving forward instead of financial recovery.
### What It Covers
Your umbrella policy isn’t just a bigger version of your existing coverage – it’s broader too, protecting you in ways your standard policies might not.
When you invest in umbrella coverage, you’re protecting yourself against **bodily injury liability** claims that could arise when someone gets hurt on your property or in an accident you cause. This includes their medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and even compensation for lost wages.
Your policy also handles **property damage liability** when you accidentally damage someone else’s belongings – whether it’s their car, home, or other valuable property.
One of the most valuable aspects is **personal injury protection**, covering claims that standard policies often exclude or limit. This includes defamation, libel, slander, false arrest, and invasion of privacy – increasingly important in our social media-saturated world.
Perhaps most reassuringly, umbrella policies typically include **legal defense costs**. Even if a claim against you is ultimately dismissed, the attorney fees alone could devastate your finances without this coverage.
And unlike some standard policies that only protect you within the U.S., umbrella coverage typically offers **worldwide protection**, following you wherever your trips take you.
For a deeper dive into coverage details, check out our [comprehensive coverage guide](https://strangeins.com/umbrella-policy-what-does-it-cover/).
### What It Doesn’t Cover
While umbrella policies offer impressive protection, they do have their limitations. Understanding these boundaries helps you make informed decisions about your coverage needs.
Your umbrella policy won’t cover damage to your **own property** – it’s designed to protect you from claims others make against you, not to replace your personal belongings. Similarly, it won’t cover your **own injuries** – that’s what health insurance is for.
If you deliberately cause harm or engage in **intentional or criminal acts**, don’t expect your umbrella policy to bail you out. The same goes for liabilities you take on through **contracts** – those typically fall outside umbrella coverage.
Business owners should note that personal umbrella policies exclude **business-related liabilities** – you’ll need a commercial umbrella policy for those exposures. And boating enthusiasts should verify coverage, as certain **watercraft exclusions** may apply unless specifically endorsed.
Knowing these exclusions helps you evaluate whether a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** makes sense for your particular situation.
### Why It Exists in Today’s Lawsuit Climate
We’re living in increasingly litigious times, where a simple accident can lead to a complex and expensive lawsuit. Consider this sobering reality: approximately 15 million civil lawsuits are filed annually in the United States.
What’s more concerning is that about **13% of personal injury liability awards and settlements exceed $1 million**. With medical costs continually rising, even minor injuries can result in major medical bills, pushing bodily injury claims higher and higher.
The digital age has introduced new risks too. A careless comment on social media can lead to a **defamation lawsuit**, and our interconnected world means your digital footprint can follow you anywhere.
As one insurance expert notes: “Many people think they’re not wealthy enough to need umbrella coverage. But they forget that future earnings, retirement savings, and even college funds are all at risk in a major liability claim.”
When you consider that the **$1 million umbrella policy cost** averages less than your monthly coffee budget, it becomes clear why many responsible homeowners and drivers choose this extra layer of protection. It’s not about being wealthy – it’s about protecting what you’ve worked so hard to build.
## $1 Million Umbrella Policy Cost Breakdown
Let’s talk dollars and cents – because I know that’s what you’re really wondering about. How much will that extra layer of protection actually cost you?
### Average $1 Million Umbrella Policy Cost
The national average for a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is about $383 per year, according to ACE Private Risk Services. That’s for a typical household with one home, two cars, and two drivers.
But here’s the good news – most families actually pay less than that! The typical range falls between $150-$300 annually. When you break that down, we’re talking about less than a dollar per day for an extra million dollars of liability protection. That’s less than your daily coffee habit!
I love how our clients react when they hear these numbers. As Leo O. from the Ramsey Baby Steps Facebook Community put it: “It’s a no-brainer for the extra liability coverage!”
Another client, Marc J., shared: “Our $1 million umbrella is $131 per year through a trusted pro bundled with our home and auto.” That’s the kind of value that makes insurance agents like me excited to share these options with clients.
### Cost vs. Higher Limits ($2M, $5M, $10M)
Here’s where umbrella policies get really interesting – the more coverage you buy, the better value you get. Think of it like buying in bulk at Costco!
Coverage Amount | Average Annual Cost | Incremental Cost
---|---|---
$1 million | $383 | $383
$2 million | $474 | $91
$5 million | $608 | $134 (for $3M)
$10 million | $999 | $391 (for $5M)
Look at those numbers carefully. Your first million costs about $383, but your second million only adds about $91 to your annual premium. That’s because insurance companies know that most claims fall within that first million, so they can offer you additional coverage at a significant discount.
This “bulk discount” effect makes higher coverage limits particularly attractive if you have substantial assets to protect. Why stop at $1 million when $2 million costs just a little more?
According to a [Forbes Advisor study on umbrella insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/umbrella-insurance/), these policies represent one of the best values in the insurance industry when comparing coverage amount to premium cost.
### What You’ll Pay in Virginia & North Carolina
Since we’re based in Virginia and North Carolina, I should mention that your **$1 million umbrella policy cost** might differ slightly from these national averages. Several local factors come into play:
First, our states have unique insurance regulations and liability environments. Second, if you’re near the coast (hello, Virginia Beach and Outer Banks!), your coastal exposure might affect your rates. And third, regional litigation trends matter – some areas simply see higher settlement amounts than others.
Despite these variables, umbrella policies remain remarkably affordable throughout Virginia and North Carolina. Most of our clients from Norfolk to Raleigh find that the peace of mind from a $1 million umbrella policy is absolutely worth the modest annual investment.
When you consider what’s at stake – your home, savings, and future income – spending a few hundred dollars a year for an extra million in protection starts to look like the bargain of the century!
## 7 Factors That Influence Your Premium
![factors affecting insurance premiums - $1 million umbrella policy cost](https://strangeins.com/1-million-umbrella-policy-cost/)
When it comes to figuring out your **$1 million umbrella policy cost**, several key factors come into play. Understanding these can help you not only make sense of your premium but potentially find ways to save money while maintaining solid protection.
### 1. Driving Record
Your history behind the wheel matters—a lot. Insurance companies look closely at your driving record because auto accidents represent one of the biggest sources of liability claims.
Those speeding tickets from last summer? They matter. That fender bender three years ago? It counts too. If you’ve maintained a clean driving record without moving violations or at-fault accidents, you’re likely to enjoy a much lower umbrella premium. On the flip side, DUIs or license suspensions can dramatically increase your costs or even make umbrella coverage unavailable to you.
### 2. Teen Drivers
Adding your teenager to your auto policy already gave you sticker shock, right? Well, they’ll impact your umbrella premium too. It’s not personal—it’s statistical. Teen drivers are nearly three times more likely than adults to be involved in serious accidents, making them a significant risk factor in the eyes of insurers.
I remember when a client added their 16-year-old son to their policy. Their umbrella premium increased by about 20%—but considering the extra protection for a high-risk driver, they felt it was money well spent.
### 3. Number of Homes, Cars, and Other Assets
Each property or vehicle you own represents another potential source of liability. That lake house where everyone gathers each summer? Your RV for cross-country trips? All of these assets factor into your umbrella premium calculation.
Rental properties deserve special mention here. When you have tenants, you’re exposed to a whole new level of liability risk. The same goes for boats, ATVs, and other recreational vehicles that friends and family might use.
### 4. Location
Where you call home significantly impacts your premium. Living in an area known for high jury awards or frequent litigation will typically result in higher umbrella costs. Urban dwellers generally pay more than rural residents due to higher claim frequencies in densely populated areas.
Virginia and North Carolina each have their own liability environments that affect pricing. Coastal properties, particularly in hurricane-prone regions, often face different risk assessments that can influence umbrella costs.
### 5. Credit Score
It might seem unrelated, but your credit score actually plays a role in determining your **$1 million umbrella policy cost**. Insurance companies have found strong correlations between credit history and insurance claims. Maintaining good credit doesn’t just help you secure favorable loan terms—it can also keep your insurance premiums lower.
### 6. Claims History
Previous liability claims will follow you. Even small claims from years ago may influence what you pay today. Insurers typically review your claims history across all policies—home, auto, boat—when calculating your umbrella premium.
### 7. Carrier Discounts
Here’s some good news: most insurers offer significant discounts when you bundle your umbrella policy with your existing home and auto coverage. I’ve seen clients save 15-20% on their overall insurance costs through effective bundling.
Other potential savings include loyalty discounts for long-term customers, claims-free discounts, and even discounts for professional association memberships. At Strange Insurance Agency, we’re particularly good at finding these hidden savings opportunities.
According to [Trusted Choice’s analysis of umbrella insurance cost factors](https://www.trustedchoice.com/umbrella-insurance/coverage-rate-cost/), these seven factors consistently have the greatest impact on premium calculations across most major insurance carriers.
### Required Underlying Liability Limits
Before you can even purchase an umbrella policy, you’ll need to meet certain minimum liability requirements on your existing policies. Think of it as the umbrella’s foundation.
Most insurers require:
– Auto Insurance: $250,000/$500,000 for bodily injury and $100,000 for property damage
– Homeowners Insurance: $300,000 personal liability
– Watercraft Insurance: $300,000 liability (if applicable)
If your current policies don’t meet these thresholds, you’ll need to increase your coverage first. Yes, this might bump up your base premiums slightly, but it’s necessary to qualify for umbrella protection.
There’s also something called a “retention” or deductible that applies in certain umbrella claim situations, typically ranging from $0 to $1,000 per occurrence.
### Your Asset & Risk Profile
When determining how much umbrella coverage makes sense for you, we need to look at both what you own and your lifestyle risks.
Your net worth calculation should include home equity, investments, retirement savings, and even future income potential. Many people forget that last part—your future earning capability is actually an asset that needs protection!
Then there are the risk factors that make you more likely to face a lawsuit. That beautiful swimming pool in your backyard? Insurance companies call it an “attractive nuisance.” Do you own a dog, especially a breed with a reputation? That increases your risk profile. Host frequent gatherings? Active on social media? Own rental properties? All of these factors should influence your coverage decisions.
As one of my clients wisely noted: “I don’t just need to protect what I have today—I need to protect what I’m working toward for tomorrow.”
### Bundling & Discount Opportunities
Want to make your **$1 million umbrella policy cost** more affordable? Smart bundling is your best strategy.
Purchasing your umbrella from the same carrier as your home and auto insurance typically results in substantial savings across all policies. I’ve seen clients effectively get their umbrella coverage for next to nothing through strategic bundling.
Another effective approach is adjusting your underlying policy deductibles. Increasing your homeowners deductible from $500 to $1,000 often saves enough to cover a significant portion of your umbrella premium. It’s a way of self-insuring smaller claims while protecting yourself from the catastrophic ones.
Defensive driving courses not only make you safer on the road but can reduce both auto and umbrella premiums. Similarly, installing home security systems may qualify you for discounts on both policies.
At Strange Insurance Agency, we take a holistic approach to your insurance portfolio, finding creative ways to provide maximum protection at minimum cost. After all, umbrella insurance isn’t just about protecting your assets—it’s about protecting your peace of mind.
## Is $1 Million Enough? Coverage, Gaps & Real-Life Scenarios
![courtroom verdict - $1 million umbrella policy cost](https://strangeins.com/1-million-umbrella-policy-cost/)
“But is $1 million really enough coverage?” This is perhaps the most common question I hear when discussing umbrella policies with clients. The answer isn’t one-size-fits-all – it depends on your unique situation, lifestyle, and what you have to protect.
### Who Needs a $1 Million Umbrella Policy?
While nearly everyone can benefit from the extra protection of an umbrella policy, certain folks face higher liability risks that make this coverage particularly important.
If you’re a **homeowner**, you already have liability exposure simply by owning property where others might get injured. **Landlords** face even greater risks, as tenant injuries and property damage claims can quickly escalate.
**Parents of teenage drivers** often don’t realize just how much liability exposure comes with handing over the car keys. One moment of distraction behind the wheel can lead to devastating consequences – both physical and financial.
Are you a **doctor, lawyer, or other high-income professional**? Unfortunately, your success might make you a target in lawsuits, as plaintiffs and their attorneys often perceive professionals as having “deep pockets.”
Do you love **entertaining guests** at your home? While those backyard barbecues and pool parties create wonderful memories, they also increase the likelihood of guest injuries on your property. Speaking of which, **dog owners** should take note that dog bites account for a surprising number of liability claims, with the average cost exceeding $50,000.
If you enjoy **boating, hunting, coaching youth sports, serving on volunteer boards, or maintaining an active social media presence**, your hobbies may be creating additional liability exposure you haven’t considered.
What’s particularly concerning is that about 20% of high-net-worth individuals have no umbrella coverage at all – leaving their hard-earned assets unnecessarily exposed to catastrophic liability claims.
### How to Decide If You Need More Than $1 Million
To determine if a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is worthwhile and whether that amount is sufficient, I always recommend a simple asset calculation. Add up your home equity, investment accounts, retirement savings (though some may have ERISA protection), vehicles, and valuable personal property.
But don’t stop there. Consider your future earning potential too. In many states, future wages can be garnished to satisfy judgments. A 40-year-old earning $100,000 annually has over $2 million in future earnings at stake before retirement. That’s a sobering thought.
Also factor in inflation. What seems like adequate coverage today may not protect you fully in 5-10 years as medical costs continue to rise faster than general inflation.
As a general rule of thumb, I recommend umbrella coverage at least equal to your net worth, with consideration for your future income potential. For many of our clients across Virginia and North Carolina, this means starting with a $1 million policy and increasing coverage as their assets grow.

### Real-Life Claims That Hit Seven Figures
Sometimes the best way to understand the value of umbrella coverage is through real-world examples. These aren’t just hypothetical scenarios – they’re based on actual claims we’ve seen in our years of serving clients.
Sarah and Tom never expected their holiday party would end in a lawsuit. A guest slipped on their icy front steps, suffering a serious back injury that required multiple surgeries. The resulting $750,000 claim exceeded their homeowners liability limit by $450,000. Without their umbrella policy, that difference would have come directly from their retirement savings.
Then there’s Michael, a marketing professional who was sued for $1.2 million after making what he thought were harmless comments about a former business associate on LinkedIn. His standard homeowners insurance provided zero coverage for this defamation claim, but his umbrella policy covered both the settlement and his legal defense costs.
Perhaps the most dramatic example is the Johnson family’s boating accident. What began as a perfect summer day on the lake ended in tragedy when their boat collided with another vessel, causing serious injuries to the other passengers. The resulting claim topped $2 million – far beyond their watercraft liability limit of $300,000. Their umbrella policy covered the excess $1.7 million, preserving their financial future.
These real-life scenarios illustrate how quickly everyday activities can lead to liability claims far exceeding standard insurance limits. When you consider that the average **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is less than $400 annually – about a dollar a day – the protection-to-premium ratio makes umbrella insurance one of the smartest investments in your financial security.
At Strange Insurance Agency, we’ve seen how these policies have saved families from financial devastation. We’re committed to helping you determine not just whether you need umbrella coverage, but exactly how much protection is right for your unique situation.
## Buying & Saving on Your First Umbrella
![laptop with quote comparison - $1 million umbrella policy cost](https://strangeins.com/1-million-umbrella-policy-cost/)
So you’ve decided a **$1 million umbrella policy** makes sense for your family. Smart move! Now comes the part where many people feel overwhelmed—actually buying the coverage. Don’t worry, I’ll walk you through the process in plain English, just like I’d explain it to a friend over coffee.
### Eligibility & Application Checklist
Before you get too far along, let’s make sure you’ll qualify. Most insurance companies look for similar things when approving umbrella policies.
First, you’ll need a relatively clean driving record. Those speeding tickets from five years ago? Probably fine. That DUI from last summer? That’s going to be a problem. Most carriers want to see no major violations in the past 3-5 years.
You’ll also need to have sufficient underlying coverage on your existing policies. This typically means auto liability limits of $250,000/$500,000 and homeowners liability of at least $300,000. If your current policies have lower limits, you’ll need to increase them before adding the umbrella.
Make sure all drivers in your household are properly listed on your auto policy—yes, even that college student who’s only home during breaks. Similarly, all properties you own should have appropriate liability coverage in place.
Be upfront about potential risk factors like swimming pools, trampolines, or dogs. Hiding these won’t help—and could actually invalidate your coverage when you need it most.
The application itself is usually straightforward: a form to complete, declarations pages from your current policies, permission for the company to check your driving record, and some questions about who lives with you and what activities you enjoy.
### Comparing Quotes & Finding Value
One of the biggest advantages of working with an independent agency like Strange Insurance is our ability to shop multiple companies for you. We’re powered by Goosehead Insurance, giving us access to over 30 different insurance carriers. This means we can find the perfect balance of coverage and affordability for your specific situation.
When looking at different umbrella quotes, price isn’t everything. Some policies offer broader protection for modern concerns like social media defamation claims. Others might handle defense costs differently—some include these within your coverage limit, while others pay them in addition to your limit (much better!).
Pay close attention to exclusions, especially if you have unique situations like rental properties or recreational vehicles. A slightly cheaper policy that excludes something you need isn’t a bargain at all.
The financial strength of the insurance company matters too. After all, an umbrella policy is protection against worst-case scenarios—you want to be confident the company will be around to pay claims when needed. Similarly, a company’s reputation for claims handling can be just as important as their pricing.

### Money-Saving Tips
While **$1 million umbrella policy costs** are already quite reasonable (remember, often less than a dollar a day), there are still ways to make this protection even more affordable.
**Bundle your policies** whenever possible. Placing your home, auto, and umbrella with the same carrier typically open ups discounts across all your coverages. The savings on your other policies can often offset much of the umbrella premium.
Consider **raising your underlying deductibles**. Increasing your auto deductible from $500 to $1,000, for example, might save enough to cover a significant portion of your umbrella premium. You’re essentially trading the risk of smaller claims for protection against life-changing lawsuits—a smart trade-off for many families.
Your **credit score** impacts your insurance rates with many carriers. Maintaining good credit can help keep your premiums lower across all your policies, including your umbrella.
Don’t forget to ask about **discounts for home security systems, defensive driving courses, professional association memberships**, or loyalty to your current insurer. These small savings add up!
Finally, make it a habit to **review your coverage annually**. As your life changes—perhaps you sold that boat, or your teenager is now a responsible adult with their own insurance—your coverage needs change too. We might find new savings opportunities or identify gaps that need addressing.
At Strange Insurance Agency, we take a concierge approach to your insurance. This means we handle the shopping and comparison process for you, saving you both time and money while ensuring you have the protection your family needs. We’ll be your guide through the entire process, from application to annual reviews, making sure your umbrella is always the right size for your needs.
## Frequently Asked Questions about $1 Million Umbrella Policies
### What are the minimum underlying limits I need?
When clients ask me about umbrella policies, this question almost always comes up first. Insurance companies want to make sure you have a solid foundation of protection before adding that extra umbrella layer.
For most insurers, you’ll need to maintain these minimum liability limits on your existing policies:
* **Auto Insurance**: Typically $250,000/$500,000 for bodily injury and $100,000 for property damage
* **Homeowners Insurance**: Usually $300,000 in personal liability coverage
* **Watercraft Insurance**: Generally $300,000 in liability (if you own boats or other watercraft)
Think of these requirements as creating a buffer zone. Your primary policies handle the initial portion of any claim, and your umbrella only activates once those limits are exhausted. If your current policies have lower limits, we’ll need to increase them before you can qualify for umbrella coverage—a step that’s absolutely worth taking.
### Can I buy umbrella insurance without bundling my auto/home?
Yes, you can—though I often tell my clients it’s a bit like buying the toppings without the ice cream. Standalone umbrella policies do exist, but they’re relatively rare birds in the insurance world and typically come with a higher price tag.
Most insurance companies prefer (or outright require) that you maintain at least one underlying policy with them—usually your auto or home coverage—before they’ll issue an umbrella policy. This isn’t just the companies being difficult; there are genuine advantages to keeping everything under one roof:
Your claims experience tends to be much smoother when one carrier handles the entire process. Those multi-policy discounts can significantly reduce your overall insurance costs (sometimes enough to offset much of the **$1 million umbrella policy cost**). And perhaps most importantly, bundling eliminates potential coverage gaps that might exist between policies from different companies.
At Strange Insurance Agency, we can explore both bundled and standalone options to find what works best for your particular situation. Our independent agency model gives us flexibility many captive agents don’t have.
### Is umbrella insurance worth it if I have under $1M in assets?
I hear this question all the time, and my answer is an emphatic yes! The idea that umbrella insurance is only for the wealthy is one of the most persistent myths in our industry.
Even if your current net worth is modest, consider these compelling reasons to get umbrella coverage:
**Your future income deserves protection.** In many states, future wages can be garnished to satisfy judgments. That means even if you don’t have significant assets today, your paycheck for years to come could be at risk without proper coverage.
**Legal defense costs can be staggering.** Even if you’re ultimately found not liable in a lawsuit, the legal fees to defend yourself can run into tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most umbrella policies cover these costs, which alone can justify the premium.
**Some claims aren’t covered by standard policies.** Umbrella coverage often extends to situations like defamation, false arrest, and invasion of privacy—risks that are increasingly common in our social media age but excluded from many standard policies.
**Peace of mind has real value.** The psychological benefit of knowing you’re protected against catastrophic liability claims shouldn’t be underestimated. As one of my clients recently told me, “I sleep better knowing I have that safety net.”
As Gerald Gardner from Virginia Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance puts it: “To sum it up, an umbrella policy puts everything under one big umbrella to help protect your family’s financial future and provide peace of mind at a very low cost.”
When you consider that the average **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is less than most people spend on coffee each month, it becomes one of the most sensible insurance decisions you can make—regardless of your current asset level.
## Conclusion
When evaluating whether a **$1 million umbrella policy cost** is worth it, the math speaks for itself. For roughly $1 per day, you can secure protection that could save you from financial devastation in the event of a serious liability claim.
Consider these key takeaways:
1. **Affordable Protection**: With premiums typically ranging from $150-$300 annually for $1 million in coverage, umbrella insurance offers exceptional value.
2. **Broad Coverage**: Umbrella policies protect against bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury claims like defamation and invasion of privacy.
3. **Peace of Mind**: Knowing your assets and future income are protected allows you to live your life with confidence.
4. **Increasing Value**: Each additional million in coverage costs significantly less than the first million, making higher limits worth considering.
At Strange Insurance Agency, we’re committed to helping our clients throughout Virginia and North Carolina find the right umbrella coverage at the best possible price.
