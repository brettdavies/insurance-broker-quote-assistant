##  What Is Additional Insured?
An additional insured is someone who gets added to[ insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability_insurance.asp) policies by the original policyholder. This is usually done through an [endorsement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endorsement.asp) by the named insured or the party who purchases the insurance policy. Once the additional insured is added, they are protected from liability from the named insured's operations under the policy and can file a [claim](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp) if they are sued. For instance, a subcontractor may add a general contractor to their policy as an additional insured.
##  Understanding Additional Insured
An additional insured status in a liability policy extends the coverage beyond the named insured to include other individuals or groups that were not named in the original policy. Additional insured typically applies where the primary insured must provide coverage to additional parties for new risks that arise out of their connection to the named insured's conduct or operations.
##  Benefits of Additional Insured
Also, it's beneficial for a party to be covered as an additional insured since it reduces the loss history of the additional insured, which can ultimately lead to lower premiums. Instead, any losses from claims post against the policies of primary insured, and their premiums would likely increase.
##  Costs of Additional Insured
The cost of adding an additional insured is typically low, compared to the costs of the premium. Insurance company underwriting departments often consider the additional risk associated with additional insureds as marginal. Additional insurance coverage and endorsements are the subjects of frequent disagreements, misunderstandings, and litigation. The disagreements are often about whether the additional insurance coverage should cover "independent negligence" by the additional insured, or if it should only cover liabilities caused by the named insured's acts.
##  Examples of Additional Insured
Typically, a larger and more powerful business will require smaller operations to name the large business as an additional insured. The arrangement might appear counterintuitive, but it essentially comes down to leverage. The larger business has more bargaining power since the smaller companies want to do business with them.
###  Landlords
A landlord in a commercial building will often require that a tenant have the landlord named as an additional insured on the [tenant's insurance policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renters-insurance.asp). In such a case, if there is an accident or loss on the tenant's premises, the landlord will benefit from the tenant's insurance coverage.1
###  Contractors
A general contractor might require subcontractors to name the general and the owner on the subcontractor's policies. For example, a general contractor might contract out work to be done on a project to plumbers, electricians, and engineers. These workers are providing a service to the general contractor as [third parties](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp). As a result, the contracted third parties could sue or file a claim against the general contractor if they get hurt on the job. In this way, if the general contractor or owner is sued due to accidents arising out of the work of the subcontractor, the subcontractor's insurance will protect the general contractor and owner.1
###  Manufacturers
Manufacturers may wish to cover the sellers of their products as additional insureds under the manufacturer's liability policies. This coverage helps provide motivation to the sellers to promote the sale of the products because the seller knows that any product liability lawsuit against the seller will be covered by the manufacturer's liability insurance.2
##  The Bottom Line
