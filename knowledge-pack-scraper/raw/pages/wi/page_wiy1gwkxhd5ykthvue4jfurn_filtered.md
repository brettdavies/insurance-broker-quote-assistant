## Home Insurance in California

While California deserves all the accolades it gets — for its diverse beauty, kind weather, rugged coastline, and more — this iconic state and its residents also have their share of potential trauma to deal with. Californians need to be prepared for all sorts of weather-related events — heavy rainfall, mudslides, snow, drought, and wildfires — and of course, the ever-present threat of earthquakes. If you’re a homeowner in California, you know that a reliable home insurance policy is a must. Wawanesa offers affordable, customizable coverage with superior protection for your home and personal property.

Whether you have a mortgage (which requires insurance) or paid off and own your home, our homeowners insurance coverage provides protection in many ways. It protects the structure of your home if it’s damaged or destroyed by fire or other covered event and protects your belongings against damage or theft.

### California Homeowners Insurance Policies

Wawanesa offers comprehensive home insurance in California where a policy includes:

### Dwelling Protection Coverage

This is a mandatory coverage that pays to repair or rebuild the physical structure of your home if it’s damaged or destroyed by a covered event.

### Other Structures Coverage

Pays to repair or replace detached structures on your property, for example, a shed, garage, or fence if it gets damaged or destroyed in a fire or another covered incident.

### Personal Property Coverage

Insures your belongings, such as furniture, sporting goods, clothing, and electronics if they’re damaged or destroyed due to a covered loss. Your personal possessions are covered whether they’ve been damaged at home or anywhere in the world. Also, you have the option to increase coverage on certain items of value.

### Loss of Use Coverage

This coverage pays for living expenses, including accommodation, meals, and other necessary expenses, if you need to move out of your home temporarily due to being uninhabitable due to a covered incident.

### Personal Liability Coverage

Pays for claims of bodily injury or property damage sustained by others on or in your property that you or members of your household are legally responsible for.

### Other Basic Coverages

This coverage pays costs incurred to prevent further damage after a covered incident, such as a fire—for example, fire department service charges or the removal of debris.
