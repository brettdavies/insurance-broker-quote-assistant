# Progressive customer service rep just told me that having Auto and Home together with them only saves me money on my Auto premium and has no effect on my Homeowners premium. Can anyone verify that this is true?

Somewhat of a confusing situation.

I currently have progressive for both my auto and homeowners. I wanted to add my sons new vehicle onto my policy, however for some reason the rate (with the same coverage) is much cheaper with a whole new policy with him as the primary on the auto policy as opposed to simply adding his vehicle to my existing one. Almost $100/month difference.

Because my son is not listed on my home's title I would not technically be "bundling" with them anymore because of the different primaries on the 2 policies. When I raised this concern with the progressive rep, he claimed that the bundling discount only effects the auto premium, and that my homeowners rate would stay the same whether or not I continued to have a bundled auto policy.

Does anyone know if this is true? Searching online seems to have conflicting answers, so I was hoping to find some clarity before I make a decision. I am in North Carolina if that matters. TIA
