Drive Safe and Save with State Farm is a program that offers car insurance discounts to customers who practice safe driving habits.

It uses an app or software built into your car to track and score your driving behavior. The safer you drive, the bigger your discount.

### Drive Safe & Save: New features

State Farm has introduced several new features to its Drive Safe & Save program. These include:

* **Trip reclassification** lets you manually change the driver after a trip. This may come in handy if you go on a car ride with another person who has the State Farm app installed on their phone. The State Farm app works automatically, so it can occasionally get confused if two signals are coming from the same vehicle.
* **Accident assistance** guides you through the crucial next steps after an accident. Just open up the State Farm app for help with contacting the authorities, ordering a tow or filing a claim.

How we make our recommendations

ValuePenguin analyzed usage-based discount programs from eight national insurance companies. Our experts compared savings, privacy concerns and other key factors to determine if State Farm Drive Safe and Save will fit your needs.

## How does Drive Safe and Save work?

State Farm Drive Safe & Save rewards safe drivers with a discount by tracking their driving habits. This can be referred to as a [telematics or usage-based program.](/car-insurance/telematics "Telematics Insurance: Is It Right for You?")

Most drivers use the Drive Safe and Save app paired with a Bluetooth device called a beacon.

You must download the app and set your location preferences to "always allow" to do this. That way, State Farm can record your trips, even when the app isn't open.

Next, you must place a State Farm tracking device in your car. This device, called a beacon, will ensure State Farm only records trips taken in your car. It won't record trips when you're a passenger in another car or on public transportation.

**Drivers with Ford or Lincoln cars built after 2020 can use Drive Save and Save Connected Car.** The program is available via your FordPass or Lincoln Way account.

## What does Drive Safe and Save track?

State Farm Drive Safe & Save tracks a few key behaviors via the [State Farm Drive Safe & Save app](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-apps "best car insurance apps") or your connected car.

* Quick acceleration and braking
* Making sharp turns
* Handheld phone usage

* Speeding
* How far you drive

You also have to provide an odometer reading at each policy renewal. State Farm will use this to factor your annual mileage into the discount.

**Drive Safe & Save follows the car rather than the driver.** That means you can decide whether to include all the vehicles and drivers on your policy or just one.

However, State Farm says having multiple drivers sign up can increase your discount. So, if you share a policy with other drivers and trust them to drive well, you should add them to the program.

If multiple drivers are in the car for the same ride, the first phone that connects to the Bluetooth beacon will record the trip.

## Is State Farm Drive Safe and Save worth it?

The Drive Safe & Save program is worth it for most State Farm customers. The program is free, and State Farm won't raise your rates for bad driving behaviors.

**State Farm Drive Safe & Save is worth it if:**

You're looking for the cheapest possible car insurance

State Farm has some of the [cheapest car insurance quotes](/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") across the country. In addition, Drive Safe & Save offers safe drivers the chance to save up to 30% or, in some states, up to 50% on car insurance.

Only Allstate and Nationwide offer a potentially larger [usage-based discount](/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"). However, both companies are typically much more expensive than State Farm before discounts.

You're unsure about your driving habits

Drive Safe & Save could be worth it if you're unsure about your driving habits but want to try to get a discount. That's because State Farm won't raise your rates if Drive Safe & Save determines you have bad driving habits. You can also use the feedback you get from the program to improve your driving to earn a future discount.

However, you could lose a low-mileage discount with State Farm if the app shows you drive more than 7,500 miles per year. It would help if you knew how many miles you drive before signing up.

You want to enroll just one car on your policy

Some programs require you to enroll all the vehicles and drivers included in your policy. Drive Safe and Safe does not, though your discount will increase if you do.

**Drive Safe & Save is not a good option if:**

You want your discount to stay consistent

* **Why?:** State Farm adjusts your discount each policy period based on your performance. So, your discount could change from term to term.

  If you'd prefer a little more consistency, pick a program that only monitors your habits for a limited period.
* **Consider:** [Liberty Mutual Right Track](/right-track-liberty-mutual-insurance-review "Liberty Mutual RightTrack Review") or [Travelers IntelliDrive](/travelers-intellidrive-insurance-review "Travelers IntelliDrive Review")

You regularly use your phone in the car

* **Why?:** Handheld phone usage impacts your discount with Drive Safe & Save. That could include making a handheld phone call or picking up your phone to put an address into your GPS.

  Another program may be a better choice if you rely on your phone while driving.
* **Consider:** [Allstate DriveWise](/allstate-drivewise-insurance-review "Allstate Drivewise Review") or [Nationwide SmartRide](/nationwide-smartride-insurance-review "Is Nationwide SmartRide Worth It?")

You drive often

* **Why?:** State Farm Drive Safe & Save uses your annual mileage to help determine your discount.
* **Consider:** [Allstate DriveWise](/allstate-drivewise-insurance-review "Allstate Drivewise Review") or [Travelers IntelliDrive](/travelers-intellidrive-insurance-review "Travelers IntelliDrive Review")
