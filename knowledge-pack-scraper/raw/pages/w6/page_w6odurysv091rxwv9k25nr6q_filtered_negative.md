State Farm Drive Safe & Save rewards safe drivers with a discount by tracking their driving habits. This can be referred to as a [telematics or usage-based program.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/telematics "Telematics Insurance: Is It Right for You?")
**
State Farm Drive Safe & Save is worth it if:
**
State Farm has some of the [cheapest car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") across the country. In addition, Drive Safe & Save offers safe drivers the chance to save up to 30% or, in some states, up to 50% on car insurance.
Only Allstate and Nationwide offer a potentially larger [usage-based discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"). However, both companies are typically much more expensive than State Farm before discounts.

Drive Safe & Save is not a good option if:
**
* **Consider:** [Liberty Mutual Right Track](https://www.valuepenguin.com/right-track-liberty-mutual-insurance-review "Liberty Mutual RightTrack Review") or [Travelers IntelliDrive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travelers-intellidrive-insurance-review "Travelers IntelliDrive Review")
* **Consider:** [Allstate DriveWise](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-drivewise-insurance-review "Allstate Drivewise Review") or [Nationwide SmartRide](https://www.valuepenguin.com/nationwide-smartride-insurance-review "Is Nationwide SmartRide Worth It?")
* **Consider:** [Allstate DriveWise](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-drivewise-insurance-review "Allstate Drivewise Review") or [Travelers IntelliDrive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travelers-intellidrive-insurance-review "Travelers IntelliDrive Review")
