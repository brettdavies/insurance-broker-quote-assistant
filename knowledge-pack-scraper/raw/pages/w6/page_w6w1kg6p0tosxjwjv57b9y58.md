#  Progressive customer service rep just told me that having Auto and Home together with them only saves me money on my Auto premium and has no effect on my Homeowners premium. Can anyone verify that this is true? 
Somewhat of a confusing situation. 
I currently have progressive for both my auto and homeowners. I wanted to add my sons new vehicle onto my policy, however for some reason the rate (with the same coverage) is much cheaper with a whole new policy with him as the primary on the auto policy as opposed to simply adding his vehicle to my existing one. Almost $100/month difference. 
Because my son is not listed on my home's title I would not technically be "bundling" with them anymore because of the different primaries on the 2 policies. When I raised this concern with the progressive rep, he claimed that the bundling discount only effects the auto premium, and that my homeowners rate would stay the same whether or not I continued to have a bundled auto policy. 
Does anyone know if this is true? Searching online seems to have conflicting answers, so I was hoping to find some clarity before I make a decision. I am in North Carolina if that matters. TIA

Some companies may only offer a discount on one line of business in a package - line meaning the type of policy like auto, home or umbrella. This can also vary from state to state. Progressive may discount both lines in one state but not in another. 
However, your agent might mean that, since you already have your own auto insurance policy with Progressive, the package discount for having an auto policy with Progressive is already applied and maximized on your home policy's rate, and adding another auto policy to the policies that are cross-referenced in the system will not afford a further discount on the home. However, his new auto policy would still be eligible to be discounted by cross-referencing the home policy as a home policy discount has not yet been applied to his auto policy. 
If you want to be sure, I suggest contacting Progressive once more in order to verify this information with a different representative. 
If the issue instead has to do with who is the named insured on the policies, keep in mind that you need to have the same named insureds on a policy in order to receive a package discount in almost all cases. If this is the issue, then I would suggest that you clarify if listing yourself and your son as the first and second named insureds on each policy would secure the package discount on both lines of business. Keep in mind that being a named insured will in almost all cases mean that each named insured is considered to have legal ownership of the policy with equal authority to make changes to or to cancel the policy. Ask your agent about the consequences of making someone a named insured if you have any concerns. 
The rate for your son might be cheaper for a variety of reasons, such as if he has a better credit score. 
At least in the states that I write business, I am able to re-quote existing Progressive clients as though they are new business to Progressive. Fairly often this improves the pricing for the client. I suggest you have your business re-quoted through Progressive, if allowed.

That very bottom piece may indeed be the case in the OP's situation. Moving from Progressive's Agency product to Progressive Direct, or vice versa. Progressive is being super shady in this by flipping the names to avoid stealing an agency account - while actually stealing an agency account.

I am an independent agent and am pretty sensitive to these things, but I don't know if it is shady in the sense that if the son has decided to work directly with Progressive rather than an agent then he is entitled to do that. And, at least in my state, I could have a client with the same exact names listed in the same exact ways and they'd still be entitled to purchase additional policies directly from Progressive in conjunction with the policy written through my agency - switching the names doesn't impact anything in that regard. However, in my state, you cannot delete the first named insured - a change like this would require rewriting the policy entirely - so it makes sense to advise that a policy list the primary driver/ owner of the vehicle as the first named insured in a case like this. 
However, I agree it is lame if Progressive purposely avoids referring that client back to an agent that they know already writes a line of business for that client already. 
Something I do find crappy is that Progressive's Direct business typically costs at least a bit less than purchasing through an agent - again, at least in my state. I get that there are increased costs for Progressive when paying a commission to an agency, but independent agents are an important source of business for them, and its crappy to see them working to edge out the middle man in this way. I guess that is just business, though. And I suppose it is up to the client to decide if having an independent agent in their corner to advise them is worth the investment.

Since progressive is an auto insurance company that sounds right.

They don’t underwrite homeowners. They are just a broker.

That is correct. Due to Progressive using a combination of their own product and a white-labeled Homesite product in higher risk states, they do not offer a discount on the home side, only the Auto for the multi-policy.
