# Transfer your Progressive Policy to a Local Agent.

Have you had big life changes in your life recently?

Maybe you've moved out of state or you and your current agent are just not seeing eye to eye or maybe you are wanting a fresh new start with a trusted insurance company.

Whatever your reason for transferring or starting up new insurance is, we are here to help guide you through all of it!

Changes in life happen often, whether it is moving out of state, getting married, having children, or something else - we all know with new life changes come new priorities. More often than not these changes warrant some hard thinking about the protection of your family and belongings.

 During these changes there are endless lists of tasks to perform and things to prepare for, so it is no surprise that making new insurance arrangements might not be your first priority.

But do yourself a favor: Don’t wait! The process is easier thank you think if you find the right agency.

Below are a few key questions to investigate about transferring your insurance policy after a move or life change. They don't cover everything, but they should get you going in the right direction.

## 1. Find a Certified Progressive Signature Agent.

If you're happy with your insurance company, give your agent a call.

Your agent should be able to tell you whether you'll need to find a new agent and how to Transfer\_Policy\_with\_Progressive to your new address.

(if your agent doesn't represent Progressive Insurance in your new state, may we recommend calling us. At RIGHTSURE we are known for our [Famously Friendly Humans](/staff-directory) and are licensed with Progressive in 42 states)

Progressive also has a FIND AN AGENT tool at [https://www.progressive.com/ag...](https://www.progressive.com/agent/find-an-agent/?zipcode=85701&product=AU&languageSpoken=E&state=AZ)

## 2. What About New Insurance? And Transferring Insurance?

Talking with a Progressive agent (or calling us if you need a new Progressive agent) is the best way to find out what you’ll need to do to get new insurance or transfer your insurance to your new address. Your agent will also help you understand insurance requirements in your new location.

If you're moving between states, keep in mind that insurance coverage varies across states. For example, in California, due to the high frequency of earthquakes, you need to take special precautions to make sure your home is safe and secure in case an earthquake occurs. That’s not the case in Indiana! Different states also have different auto insurance laws, and if you’re moving to a new state, you’ll need a new auto insurance policy – plain and simple.

## 3. What about a refund from my old policy?

  If you have prepaid your prior policy or recently made a payment, we can help you request cancellation and process a credit \ refund on that policy.

The thing to remember is this:

If you are just looking to transfer your Progressive policy to a local Progressive agent in your state, you need to start with finding an agent in your state, OR consider contacting RIGHTSURE Insurance Group as we represent Progressive in just about every state and can insure properties \ vehicles in multiple states.
