**Key Takeaways**
* Every P&C insurance company operating in California pays into the FAIR Plan, allowing them to share the costs associated with covering the most high-risk properties in the state.
* Basic FAIR Plan policies only cover damage from fires and similar perils to your home and belongings, though you may be able to pay more for additional coverage.
* You may be able to make up for the perils that FAIR Plan property insurance doesn’t cover, such as water damage and theft, by purchasing difference in conditions (DIC) insurance.
* Since the California FAIR Plan is an insurer of last resort, you must work with a licensed insurance broker to see if you are eligible for any affordable policies from traditional insurance companies before you can qualify for FAIR Plan coverage.
* As of 2022, the combined annual cost of FAIR Plan insurance and DIC coverage is $3,200 on average.

California FAIR Plan insurance does not include personal liability coverage, nor does it cover [water damage](https://smartfinancial.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) or [theft](https://smartfinancial.com/does-home-insurance-cover-theft). That said, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is in the process of seeking reforms that may eventually lead to these perils being covered by the FAIR Plan. In the meantime, you can obtain these coverages by purchasing a supplemental difference in conditions (DIC) insurance policy.[6]
