Finding the right insurance coverage for your business (at the right price) can seem like a big job. First, you need to gain a general understanding of your needs and talk to one or more insurance agents. Quoting the insurance is the next step in the process, which can involve some homework for you or someone on your team.

At Kincaid Insurance Group, we regularly provide insurance quotes for businesses across a variety of industries—from commercial trucking fleets to startups to well-established manufacturing companies. Each quote is different depending on a variety of factors; however, there are a few things that we almost always need to start the quoting process.

We hope that this commercial insurance checklist helps you gather the right information for your quote. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out to us](/contact-us) and start a conversation. Someone from our experienced staff will be happy to assist you.

## About the Business Owner

Even if your business is incorporated as an S Corp, LLC, or another entity, we’ll still need some basic information about you (the business owner). Please note that we take your privacy seriously and use secure technology to keep your information safe.

* First and Last Name
* Address
* Date of Birth
* Social Security Number

## About Your Business

We also need to get to know your organization. Some of this information is easier to come by, so we’ve broken this section into two categories:

Easy stuff:

* Business Description
* Entity Type (LLC, Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, S Corp, C Corp, etc)
* Web Address
* Year Business Started
* Ownership Information (Name of Owner, Corp. Officers, Partners)

Items that may require a little more digging:

* Receipts
* Payroll Information by Job Description
* Employee Breakdown by Job Description
