If you’ve been asked to file an SR-22, you might be worried about the impact on your car insurance costs. An SR-22 isn’t a type of insurance but rather a certificate that proves you meet your state’s minimum car insurance requirements.
It’s often required after serious driving violations, such as a DUI, reckless driving or driving without insurance. Unfortunately, having an SR-22 on your record typically leads to higher premiums, making finding the most affordable options essential.
The cost of SR-22 insurance can vary significantly depending on your location, driving history, and insurance provider. To help you save money, we’ve researched the cheapest SR-22 insurance options in every state.
In Iowa, Nationwide offers the most affordable SR-22 insurance policies at $848 per year and State Farm at $1,008 per year.
Whether you’re looking for a budget-friendly policy or just trying to navigate this complex process, this guide has the information you need to get back on the road without breaking the bank.
## What is an SR-22?
An SR-22 is a Certificate of Financial Responsibility (CFR) that proves you’ve bought the minimum liability auto insurance your state requires. If you’re considered a high-risk driver due to traffic violations, a DUI/DWI, or other reasons, your state or a court may require you to obtain an SR-22-a certificate filed by your insurance company that proves you carry the minimum required auto insurance coverage.
While it’s not a type of insurance, filing an SR-22 is often mandatory after serious offenses and it can lead to higher insurance premiums due to your increased risk profile.
**Key Takeaways**
* The average cost of SR-22 car insurance in Iowa is $1,363.
* Nationwide offers the most affordable SR-22 insurance policies in Iowa at $848 per year.
* An SR-22 isn’t a separate insurance policy; it’s a form your insurer files to the state DMV on your behalf to confirm you have the required minimum coverage.
## Do I need to buy SR-22 insurance in Iowa?
As mentioned earlier, an SR-22 isn’t an insurance policy; it’s a form your insurance company files with your state’s DMV. This form informs the state that you still carry the minimum required insurance despite certain driving offenses on your record. The filing fee is generally inexpensive, though insurance with an SR-22 can be costly.
Examples of offenses that might require an SR-22:
* DUI, DWI or other serious moving violations
* Reckless driving
* Accidents resulting in suspension or revocation
* Accumulation of too many driving violation points
* Driving without insurance
If you have any of these offenses on your record, you may need an SR-22. Once you buy an insurance plan that meets your state’s requirements, request your insurer to file the SR-22 form with the DMV.
You usually need to keep an SR-22 for at least three years. Failing to do so could lead to a license suspension.
## Average SR-22 car insurance cost in Iowa
The average cost of SR-22 car insurance in Iowa is $1,363.
This is $348 higher than in New Hampshire, which has the cheapest SR-22 insurance.
However, it’s also $2,678 less expensive than in Michigan, the most expensive state for SR-22 insurance.
The cost of SR-22 insurance depends on several factors, such as why you need the SR-22, your driving history, and where you live.

## SR-22 insurance requirements in Iowa
The Iowa DMV requires all drivers to have the following minimum car insurance coverage:
* $20,000 for injury or death per person
* $40,000 for injury or death per accident
* $15,000 for property damage per accident
These are just the minimum requirements. Experts recommend getting more coverage than the mandated minimum coverage. Although it may raise your premium, the added coverage could prove highly beneficial.
## How much does SR-22 in Iowa cost with a DUI?
Some insurance companies are much more forgiving than others if you have a DUI. Some charge a few hundred dollars more, while others charge thousands more per year.
Note: In the table below, “filing only” represents the cost of a policy including the fee to file the SR-22 – without considering the reason why someone needed an SR-22.

## How to get the cheapest SR-22 insurance in Iowa
You may face sky-high insurance premiums if you need an SR-22 in Iowa. However, there are ways to save on car insurance whether or not you require an SR-22.
First, shopping around is always a good idea. There can be an enormous difference in the rates you will get from different insurance companies. Some companies specialize in high-risk drivers and offer you better SR-22 rates.
Another way to get the cheapest insurance with an SR-22 is to improve your driving record. Sure, that might be easier said than done, but it can be worth putting in the time if you want a better rate. You can get a quick win by taking a defensive driving course. Ask your insurer if they offer any of these courses and if they can help you qualify for a discount.
You can also ask about safe driving programs. These usage-based programs track your driving habits and may reward you with lower premiums for safe driving.
There are a few ways someone required to get SR-22 insurance can find the most affordable policy while still meeting all the legal requirements.
Sebastian Hov, CEO of 18 Insurance, an insurance agency based in Sacramento, Iowa, recommends the following:
* **Shopping around:** Different insurance companies offer varying rates for SR-22 insurance. It’s crucial to compare quotes from multiple providers to find the best option.
* **Pay upfront:** Paying your premium in full rather than in monthly installments can sometimes result in lower overall costs.
* **Opt for non-owner insurance:** If you don’t own a vehicle but need to maintain SR-22 coverage, non-owner car insurance can be a cost-effective option as it is typically 5% to 15% cheaper than a standard policy. Keep reading for more information on non-owner insurance options.
## Non-owner SR-22 insurance in Iowa
Some states might require you to get an SR-22 even if you don’t own a car. This proves you have the minimum liability insurance your state requires, which is often needed to get your driver’s license back after a suspension or revocation for violations like a DUI or multiple traffic offenses.
Non-owner insurance policies are for people who don’t own a car but still drive and need to meet SR-22 requirements or maintain coverage. This type of insurance provides liability protection when driving someone else’s car and helps you meet state requirements to get your license back after violations like a DUI or multiple traffic offenses.
It’s generally a cheaper option than a standard car insurance policy since it only covers liability.

## Who needs SR-22 insurance?
Remember that an SR-22 is not a separate insurance policy. Instead, it’s a certificate that shows your state’s DMV that you have at least the minimum insurance coverage required.
For instance, if you have a DUI, the state will require you to prove you have enough insurance to be financially responsible.
Keep in mind that not all driving offenses require an SR-22. You will be notified if you require an SR-22. If you aren’t sure if you need one, ask your local DMV or an attorney with traffic law experience.
## How long do you need SR-22 insurance in Iowa?
You typically need to maintain an SR-22 for three years.
During this period, you must maintain continuous coverage without any lapses. If your policy is canceled or lapses, your insurer must notify the state, which could result in further penalties or a license suspension.
## The bottom line on SR-22 in Iowa
The average SR-22 insurance rate in Iowa is $1,363, while the average cost of car insurance in Iowa is $1,241. This means SR-22 insurance in Iowa costs $123 more per year.
Keep in mind that there are numerous factors that affect the auto insurance premiums.
