At [John J. Malm & Associates](http://www.malmlegal.com/), we often hear from clients who say, _“Don’t worry — the other driver had full coverage.”_ Unfortunately, “full coverage” is one of the most misunderstood terms in the world of auto insurance, and it can lead to serious confusion — especially after a [car accident](https://www.malmlegal.com/naperville-personal-injury-attorney/car-accidents/).
1. **Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Coverage**
1. **Medical Payments (“MedPay”) Coverage**
1. **Rental or Towing Reimbursement**
1. **Gap Insurance**
1. **You Might Be Stuck with Your Own Medical Bills**
Let’s say you’re hit by a driver who says, _“Don’t worry, I have full coverage.”_
