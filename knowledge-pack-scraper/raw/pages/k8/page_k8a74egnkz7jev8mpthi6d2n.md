At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site.

But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes.

Elephant Insurance is relatively new to the market compared to some other insurers — it’s only been in business for about 15 years.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/elephant/#cite-1) In that time, the company has expanded its service area and offerings, though Elephant still only sells coverage in eight U.S. states.
Elephant has an impressive list of coverage options, and its various discounts make it easy for customers to save on their premiums. Though the company hasn’t received many third-party rankings, its overall solid customer reviews suggest it’s a good option for many drivers.
Here’s what you need to know about auto insurance offerings from Elephant.
Quick Facts
  * Elephant Insurance has average monthly premiums of $118 for liability and $172 for full coverage, which is on par with the national averages of $100 for liability and $177 for full coverage.
  * Elephant has generally positive customer reviews online and a below-average number of complaints filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
  * Through its variety of discount options, Elephant customers can save up to 40% on their premiums.

IQ ScoreThe [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) uses more than 15 criteria to objectively rate insurance companies on a one-to-ten scale. The Insurify editorial team researches insurer data to determine the final scores. |  8.6 /10  
Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $118/mo  
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events.

Why we picked this company
Elephant has a lot to offer customers, starting with its rates, which are comparable to the national average and similar competitors.
Elephant also stands out for the coverage options and discounts it offers. The company has more coverage options than some other companies in the auto insurance market.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/elephant/#cite-2) Customers can save up to 40% with discounts, which is better than what you can find with many competitors.
Unfortunately, Elephant Insurance isn’t widely available. It currently only offers policies in eight states: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. And because it doesn’t have ratings from third-party agencies, it’s difficult to compare its customer satisfaction and financial strength with other insurance companies.
See how Elephant compares to similar competitors below.

## How Elephant auto insurance works
Elephant is a Virginia-based company that offers various insurance policies, including auto, home, and renters coverage. The company is a subsidiary of U.K.-based Admiral Group, which founded Elephant in 2009.
Elephant offers fairly standard auto insurance policies, including a variety of coverage options, as well as several discounts to help its customers save even more. It’s an online-based company, which means you can get a quote and sign up for your policy online. Elephant doesn’t have local agents — instead, the company’s customer service representatives help customers with any questions or problems they run into.
Elephant underwrites its own auto insurance policies. But its partner companies — which include Dairyland, Ladder, and RLI — underwrite non-auto policies.

## Average cost of Elephant auto insurance
How much you pay for car insurance will depend on your driving record, age, and more.
If you have a history of past speeding tickets, car accidents, or DUIs, you’ll pay more for car insurance than drivers with a clean record. By age group, teenagers pay the highest premiums due to a lack of driving experience. Senior drivers pay much less for coverage than young drivers, but drivers 70 and older experience slight upticks in premiums.
See how average monthly liability rates from Elephant compare to the national average below.

## How customers feel about Elephant
Elephant has some mixed feedback. First, as a smaller and relatively new company, Elephant hasn’t received rankings from some third-party companies like AM Best and J.D. Power. But the company has plenty of existing customer reviews online.
The company’s average customer rating on Trustpilot is 4.5 out of 5 stars, with more than 80% of reviewers leaving five-star ratings. Only about 12% of customers left one-star or two-star ratings. The company also has a below-average number of complaints for a company of its size with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
It’s worth noting that Elephant Insurance was previously subject to a class-action lawsuit regarding a data breach that compromised customer data, but the judge threw the case out, saying the plaintiffs couldn’t show sufficient evidence of harm.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/elephant/#cite-3)

## Elephant car insurance coverage options
Elephant has an impressive lineup of standard coverage and add-on options. First, the company offers standard state-minimum required car insurance, which typically includes bodily injury and property damage liability coverages. This coverage doesn’t pay for damage to your car — it protects other drivers on the road and their property.
Some states may also require other coverages, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist, medical payments, and personal injury protection, all of which Elephant offers. For the most vehicle protection, you can purchase full-coverage insurance, which includes collision and comprehensive insurance.
Elephant also has a large number of optional coverages you can add to your policy to provide more robust coverage:
