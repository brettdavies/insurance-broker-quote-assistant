There isn’t a way to contact the customer service team directly, and it looks like they are deliberately trying to make it difficult for the customer to get in touch with a real human who can assist them. However, if you miss one day in paying the bill, they are quick to send out a letter to cancel your policy.

The company is a subsidiary of U.K.-based Admiral Group, which founded Elephant in 2009.</p><p>Elephant offers fairly standard auto insurance policies, including a variety of coverage options, as well as several discounts to help its customers save even more. It’s an online-based company, which means you can get a quote and sign up for your policy online. Elephant doesn’t have local agents — instead, the company’s customer service representatives help customers with any questions or problems they run into.</p><p>Elephant underwrites its own auto insurance policies. But its partner companies — which include Dairyland, Ladder, and RLI — underwrite non-auto policies.</p><div><div><div class="bc_bn bc_fK"><div class="lt-row lt-gutter-y-0"><div class="lt-col lt-span-10 lt-span--pull-1 lt-span-4-sm lt-span--pull-0-sm bc_d9"><h3 class="lt-align-center">Find Cheap Car Insurance</h3><p class="lt-align-center">Check quotes from multiple insurers in minutes</p><form class="ct_mk" data-cy="zipcodeFormMoneybox"><fieldset><label><span class="ct_ml" data-percy="hidden">Enter your ZIP code</span><input data-percy="hidden" name="zipcode" id="zipcodeInputMoneybox" data-cy="zipcodeInputMoneybox" type="tel" maxlength="5" value=""></label><button class="r_bH r_bR r_bD">View My Quotes</button></fieldset></form></div><div class="lt-col lt-span-12 bc_br"><div><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><path fill="none" d="M0 0H24V24H0z"></path><path d="M12 1l8.217 1.826c.457.102.783.507.783.976v9.987c0 2.006-1.003 3.88-2.672 4.992L12 23l-6.328-4.219C4.002 17.668 3 15.795 3 13.79V3.802c0-.469.326-.874.783-.976L12 1zm0 2.049L5 4.604v9.185c0 1.337.668 2.586 1.781 3.328L12 20.597l5.219-3.48C18.332 16.375 19 15.127 19 13.79V4.604L12 3.05zm4.452 5.173l1.415 1.414L11.503 16 7.26 11.757l1.414-1.414 2.828 2.828 4.95-4.95z"></path></g></svg>Secure.

Only about 12% of customers left one-star or two-star ratings. The company also has a below-average number of complaints for a company of its size with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).</p><p>It’s worth noting that Elephant Insurance was previously subject to a class-action lawsuit regarding a data breach that compromised customer data, but the judge threw the case out, saying the plaintiffs couldn’t show sufficient evidence of harm.<sup><a href="#cite-3">[3]</a></sup></p><h3 id="elephant-customer-reviews">Elephant customer reviews</h3><p>Elephant has generally positive reviews from its customers, who like the affordable rates and easy sign-up process.

not so easy to navigate. There isn’t a way to contact the customer service team directly, and it looks like they are deliberately trying to make it difficult for the customer to get in touch with a real human who can assist them. However, if you miss one day in paying the bill, they are quick to send out a letter to cancel your policy. Their response to that is rapid fire!</div></div><div class="lt-vstack b1_kg b1_kq"><div class="b1_kl"><div class="b1_kj">Kristina</div><div class="b1_ks"><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16

First, the company offers standard state-minimum required car insurance, which typically includes bodily injury and property damage liability coverages. This coverage doesn’t pay for damage to your car — it protects other drivers on the road and their property.</p><p>Some states may also require other coverages, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist, medical payments, and personal injury protection, all of which Elephant offers. For the most vehicle protection, you can purchase full-coverage insurance, which includes collision and comprehensive insurance.</p><p>Elephant also has a large number of optional coverages you can add to your policy to provide more robust coverage:</p><ul class="bQ_jj"><li><div class="bx_g6"><img alt="illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/94dcf3f967/lender-requirement.svg"
