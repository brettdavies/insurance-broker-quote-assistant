Are these composite masonry interior walls? The header courses make me think that’s the case. If so, the homeowner is going to regret missing out on the R-value & sound dampening that batt insulation provides. I’ve never in my career or life as a 5th generation bricklayer seen anything like this. Thanks for sharing.

Materials for durable concrete foundations
When it comes to building a durable concrete foundation, there are several materials and methods that can ensure longevity and stability. Here are some key considerations and materials based on the insights from Redditors:
### High-Quality Concrete
* **Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC)**: This type of concrete is exceptionally strong and durable, capable of lasting for centuries. One Redditor mentioned, ["There's an entire category of concrete called 'ultra high performance concrete' with a MINIMUM compressive strength of 17,500 PSI"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf7exzb/).
* **Specialized Mixes**: Depending on the specific needs and environment, different concrete mixes can be tailored to provide the best performance. ["Concrete is a entire category of products. If you have the checkbook, there's varieties that will last thousands of years."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf3rvca/).
### Reinforcement
* **Rebar**: While rebar is commonly used, it can rust over time. Using rust-neutralizing paint or ensuring proper concrete coverage can help extend its lifespan. ["Most rebar is rusty as shit before it even gets poured in."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Concrete/comments/1907153/comment/kgqqxqf/).
* **Alternative Materials**: Some builders opt for non-traditional reinforcement methods, such as using gabions (wire cages filled with stones) for added stability. ["You can lay down some serious gabions... then build on top of them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf3tty5/).
### Foundation Design
* **Proper Grading and Drainage**: Ensuring that water is directed away from the foundation is crucial. ["Roof and gutters keep a foundation sound."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf4c82v/).
* **Vapor Barriers**: For slab foundations, a vapor barrier is essential to prevent moisture from seeping into the house. ["All flooring over concrete should have a vapor barrier."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeMaintenance/comments/1i3rm9i/comment/m7rbldn/).
### Alternative Materials
* **Stone Foundations**: In some regions, stone foundations have been used for centuries and can be very durable. ["They are all on stone foundations."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf660wt/).
* **Tire Foundations**: While controversial, some builders use packed tires for foundations, which can be durable but may not be the most environmentally friendly option. ["Gravel or dirt packed tires seem the most durable by a good margin."](https://www.reddit.com/r/earthship/comments/1kmr43l/eartship_foundation_types_and_considerations/).
### Professional Consultation
* **Geotechnical and Structural Engineers**: Hiring professionals to assess the soil and design the foundation is highly recommended. ["Hire a Geotechnical engineer to do a subsurface exploration and come up with foundation recommendations."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ed0j1y/comment/lf4m2gt/).
### Additional Tips
* **Avoid Painting Concrete**: Painting concrete can trap moisture, leading to issues. If painting is necessary, use a breathable masonry paint. ["Don’t put _just any_ paint on concrete."](https://www.reddit.com/r/paint/comments/1cwu5w1/comment/l4yazj6/).
* **Regular Maintenance**: Checking for cracks and addressing them promptly can prevent minor issues from becoming major problems. ["Foundation is looking its age, but, it’s not crumbling."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Concrete/comments/1907153/comment/kgmdky8/).

A place for **construction professionals only** to discuss the industry. Anybody working or interested in working in this field is welcome! Carpentry, concrete, steel, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, landscaping, equipment operators, etc. Those with DIY or homeowner-type questions should use subreddits such as /r/DIY. Those posts will be removed.
