### Chicago rates for young drivers

As [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) enter their 20s, they may see lower rates than in their teens. On the other hand, this drop could be offset by the price jump that often happens when you move from your parents' policy to your own. Still, once drivers hit their mid-20s they are likely to see some premium relief as long as they maintain a safe driving record. On average, 25-year-old drivers in Chicago pay 44 percent less for coverage than 20-year-old drivers (both on their own policies). Maintaining a clean driving record and shopping around may help young drivers find coverage that fits within their budget.

## The cheapest car insurance in Chicago by driving record

Your driving record is one of the [most significant factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) that can impact your car insurance rates in Chicago. Insurance companies typically view drivers with clean records as lower risk, which usually translates to lower premiums. Conversely, having violations such as speeding tickets, at-fault accidents or DUIs on your record can mark you as a higher risk, leading to higher rates. If you do have marks on your record, shopping around and comparing quotes from various insurers can help you find the best possible rates for your situation.

### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Chicago

Getting [a speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-tickets/) in Chicago will likely affect your car insurance rates for three to five years. Speeding is linked to more frequent and severe accidents, making you a riskier driver to insure.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Chicago

Insurers see drivers with DUIs as [high-risk](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), and typically charge much higher premiums to compensate for this added risk. Some carriers will not insure drivers with DUIs on their record, so requesting personalized quotes is a good way to assess whether you are eligible for coverage with a particular company. Insurers specializing in high-risk coverage might offer more competitive rates for a driver [with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/).

Minimum coverage requirements in Chicago

In [Illinois](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/), drivers must meet the state's minimum auto insurance requirements to legally operate a vehicle. These [requirements include](https://www.ilsos.gov/publications/pdf_publications/vsd361.pdf):

* **Bodily injury liability:** $25,000 per person
* **Bodily injury liability:** $50,000 per accident
* **Property damage liability:** $20,000 per accident
* **Uninsured motorist coverage:** $25,000 per person for bodily injury
* **Uninsured motorist coverage:** $50,000 per accident for bodily injury

Drivers in Chicago should also be aware of specific metro considerations when selecting coverage. Given the city's dense traffic and higher cost of living compared to rural areas, it may be prudent to consider higher coverage limits than the state minimums. Higher liability limits can offer greater financial protection, especially considering the rising costs of medical care and vehicle repairs. Moreover, optional coverage types such as collision, comprehensive and underinsured motorist coverage, can provide added financial protection in the event of an accident or other incident.

Enforcement of these requirements is strict, with significant penalties for non-compliance. Driving without insurance can result in fines starting at $500, and repeated offenses or causing an accident without insurance can lead to higher fines, license suspension and the need to file an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) certificate. Therefore, maintaining at least the minimum required coverage is crucial for staying compliant with [state laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) and protecting your financial well-being in the event of an accident.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What are the best car insurance companies in Chicago?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) depends on your specific needs. The first step in shopping for insurance is identifying what you are specifically looking for from a company. Someone who owns a condo in downtown Chicago and barely drives might have very different needs than a commuter who lives on the outskirts and doesn’t like to take the train. Additionally, someone who prizes customer service above all else might look at different options than someone who has a very tight budget and wants the lowest possible price.   
    
  Once you’ve figured out what is most important to you, get quotes from several companies that you think may meet your needs. Make sure the quotes are for the same coverage types and levels so you’re making an accurate comparison. You can also ask each company to apply all the discounts for which you qualify to ensure you’re looking at the lowest possible rates.

* ###### Do I have to tell my car insurance company if I move in Chicago?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Illinois law requires you to [inform the Illinois Secretary of State](https://apps.ilsos.gov/addrchange/) within 10 days if you change your address. You should also inform your insurance company. If you move to Chicago, from within Illinois or out of state, you could run into trouble if you fail to disclose a change of address.

Check your insurer’s policy about how soon you need to change your address. Many carriers make it easy to change your address online or over the phone.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
