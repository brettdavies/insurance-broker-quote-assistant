### Chicago rates for young drivers
As [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) enter their 20s, they may see lower rates than in their teens. On the other hand, this drop could be offset by the price jump that often happens when you move from your parents' policy to your own. Still, once drivers hit their mid-20s they are likely to see some premium relief as long as they maintain a safe driving record. On average, 25-year-old drivers in Chicago pay 44 percent less for coverage than 20-year-old drivers (both on their own policies). Maintaining a clean driving record and shopping around may help young drivers find coverage that fits within their budget.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Chicago
Insurers see drivers with DUIs as [high-risk](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), and typically charge much higher premiums to compensate for this added risk. Some carriers will not insure drivers with DUIs on their record, so requesting personalized quotes is a good way to assess whether you are eligible for coverage with a particular company. Insurers specializing in high-risk coverage might offer more competitive rates for a driver [with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/).

Minimum coverage requirements in Chicago
In [Illinois](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/), drivers must meet the state's minimum auto insurance requirements to legally operate a vehicle. These [requirements include](https://www.ilsos.gov/publications/pdf_publications/vsd361.pdf):
  * **Bodily injury liability:** $25,000 per person
  * **Bodily injury liability:** $50,000 per accident
  * **Property damage liability:** $20,000 per accident
  * **Uninsured motorist coverage:** $25,000 per person for bodily injury
  * **Uninsured motorist coverage:** $50,000 per accident for bodily injury


Drivers in Chicago should also be aware of specific metro considerations when selecting coverage. Given the city's dense traffic and higher cost of living compared to rural areas, it may be prudent to consider higher coverage limits than the state minimums. Higher liability limits can offer greater financial protection, especially considering the rising costs of medical care and vehicle repairs. Moreover, optional coverage types such as collision, comprehensive and underinsured motorist coverage, can provide added financial protection in the event of an accident or other incident.
Enforcement of these requirements is strict, with significant penalties for non-compliance. Driving without insurance can result in fines starting at $500, and repeated offenses or causing an accident without insurance can lead to higher fines, license suspension and the need to file an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) certificate. Therefore, maintaining at least the minimum required coverage is crucial for staying compliant with [state laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) and protecting your financial well-being in the event of an accident.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What are the best car insurance companies in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
The [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) depends on your specific needs. The first step in shopping for insurance is identifying what you are specifically looking for from a company. Someone who owns a condo in downtown Chicago and barely drives might have very different needs than a commuter who lives on the outskirts and doesn’t like to take the train. Additionally, someone who prizes customer service above all else might look at different options than someone who has a very tight budget and wants the lowest possible price.   
  
Once you’ve figured out what is most important to you, get quotes from several companies that you think may meet your needs. Make sure the quotes are for the same coverage types and levels so you’re making an accurate comparison. You can also ask each company to apply all the discounts for which you qualify to ensure you’re looking at the lowest possible rates.
  * ######  How much is car insurance in Illinois?
Caret Down Icon
The [average annual cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) in Illinois is $667 for minimum coverage and $2,376 for full coverage. When compared to the national average, Illinois drivers pay 12 percent less for minimum coverage and 12 percent less for full coverage. While your own rates will vary, understanding these costs can help you budget for your insurance needs and find the [most affordable options](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) available.
  * ###  Why is car insurance in Chicago so expensive?
Caret Down Icon
Drivers in larger cities like Chicago often see higher insurance rates because there’s typically a higher risk of getting into a car accident in densely populated areas. Residents might also be more likely to file a comprehensive claim because of theft or vandalism. With insurance rates in Illinois climbing in the last few years, the Illinois legislature has considered [bills regulating car insurance](https://abc7chicago.com/cheap-car-insurance-illinois-auto-quotes-near-me-average-cost/14500053/) in the state.
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
There are several strategies for lowering your [car insurance rates in Illinois](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-illinois/). You might consider your insurance needs so you’re not paying for unnecessary coverage. If it’s been a while since you shopped for car insurance, now might be the time. Experts recommend requesting car insurance quotes from several providers — use the same coverage types and amounts so you can easily compare the policies. Don’t forget to factor in any discounts that you might be eligible for. Lastly, you could talk to a licensed insurance agent if you feel uncomfortable purchasing insurance coverage on your own or if you have a complex insurance situation.
  * ######  Do I have to tell my car insurance company if I move in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
Illinois law requires you to [inform the Illinois Secretary of State](https://apps.ilsos.gov/addrchange/) within 10 days if you change your address. You should also inform your insurance company. If you move to Chicago, from within Illinois or out of state, you could run into trouble if you fail to disclose a change of address. Carriers use your ZIP code to calculate your premium, so being dishonest about your current address could result in a denied claim. Check your insurer’s policy about how soon you need to change your address. Many carriers make it easy to change your address online or over the phone.

### Rates 
Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates for our base profile are based on the following characteristics and full coverage limits with bundling and paperless billing discounts applied:

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
