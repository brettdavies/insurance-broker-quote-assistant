#  Ring Discontinuing $99/yr Alarm Monitoring – Forced into $200/yr Plan. Any Alternatives?
I just got the news that Ring is discontinuing the **Ring Protect Home Standard with Alarm Professional Monitoring ($99/year)** and is forcing all users into the **$200/year plan** —a **100% increase**.

Last I checked and on their website, Ring alarm works without the subscription.
You lose out on [professional monitoring](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Ring+professional+monitoring&cId=1f9e106d-ce50-4fb6-b792-4f008aa77676&iId=13c89d63-af47-4de2-9970-279eeb75953c). So you would get a push notification if the alarm goes off, but you would then be responsible for any calls to emergency services.

The professional monitoring is (in my case) offset by homeowners insurance benefits. A lot of people are not aware of that.

You also lose functionality of the app and you can only use the system locally through your keypads. The app will not work with the alarm system anymore.
The only plan that lets you keep using the app for the security system is the $200 one.
Edit: correction- you don’t need the $200 plan, but you do have to have a subscription which is still bs.

You just got news? They haven’t offered the $99 plan for 2 years now. If you have it you have been notified multiple times over the past 4 years.

I'm in the UK so not really familiar with the US market. However based on comments I have read from others I don't think it's possible to find another system with professional monitoring for $99/year, even in the US. In this regard it was an under-priced service. I don't know if it's even possible to find one that charges less than $200/year.
It is possible to purchase a system that doesn't charge any subscription fees at all, as others have mentioned. In this case your camera recordings will be stored locally and you won't get cellular backup for the alarm system (a feature which is present in the Ring $99/year service). Although I suppose you could purchase a modem with cellular backup for your whole network.

$99 is not impossible. Wholesale alarm monitoring costs about $5USD. This is all ADT or whoever is paying to the alarm companies your equipment actually talks to.
Ring was running their own monitoring centers last I heard, so it's a cost for their actual work vs paying another company. But either way, the actual cost to do the monitoring is still about $5 a month before markup. To be clear, there will always be a markup.
The way to look at the cost versus value is to start at that low number and see if the other things they offer, plus a fair markup, are worth the price they want you to pay.

But following Ring's price rise is there any system on the market that actually offers professional monitoring to consumers for $99/year (or even less than $200/year for that matter)?

It totally sucks that they doubled the subscription price with no increase in value. With that said, if you shop around you'll find that it's still as good as you can get for alarm professional monitoring. For example, Simplisafe's cheapest plan (which to be fair includes some features that Ring doesn't) is $400 a year.

Looking at the plans described on the [Ring website](https://ring.com/plans) just now, there are three: basic, standard, and premium, at $50, $100, and $200 per year, respectively. There is no mention of the standard plan going away, but _Alarm Professional Monitoring_ is shown as an add-on to the standard and premium plans (not available at all on top of the basic plan), at $10 per month extra. Footnote 4 explicitly states: _Professional Monitoring is an add-on plan that first requires a compatible Ring Home subscription. Both sold separately.[…] Ring does not own its monitoring center._

They’ve changed the price of protect pro which was needed for alarm monitoring 5 years ago.
They gave those they were enrolled before a 5 year grandfathered plan.
The writing on the wall was written then.
It’s still the best game in town. There are some ways to get a traditional alarm system installed and use Alarm.com for professional monitoring but no idea on cost - years ago it was $10 a month..

Your plan will go up to $200 at your next renewal unless you drop professional monitoring.

Lynnwood, Washington is a commuter city/bedroom community. A northern suburb of Seattle, WA and at the same time a southern suburb of Everett, WA. It is most notable for the Alderwood Mall, the largest (and we would argue *best*) mall in the area. Lynnwood is only about 4 miles from the Puget Sound and about 70 from great skiing, hiking, and other outdoor activities in the North Cascades.
