The groups most commonly eligible for defensive driver training discounts are drivers under age 25 or above age 60. People in these age groups are the most at risk for accidents and have the [highest insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#carbyage "How much car insurance costs by age"). However, some states, such as [New York](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-york/defensive-driving "Best Cheap Defensive Driving Courses New York"), require insurers to offer rate discounts to drivers of all ages for taking safe-driving courses. It's worth checking with your insurance company to see what is available to you.
