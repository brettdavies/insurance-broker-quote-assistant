**State Farm has the cheapest car insurance rates for most people, but it's not always the best choice for everyone.**
Another company may have lower rates if you have a bad driving record or poor credit score. Or, you may want specific coverage add-ons not offered by the cheapest company.

### Compare car insurance rates in your state
**The cheapest major insurance company isn't always the best choice.** Midsize insurance companies may offer lower rates in your area, and they tend to have better customer service.
It's important to compare quotes from multiple companies near you to ensure you're choosing the best company.
Choose your state Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington, D.C. West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming
### Which insurance company has better customer service?
State Farm has the best customer service reviews compared to the largest insurance companies.
J.D. Power ranked State Farm 7th out of 22 companies on its claims satisfaction survey. That means you can count on State Farm to get you back on the road fairly quickly after an accident. It also gets  16% fewer customer complaints than an average company its size.
#### Customer service ratings for top insurance companies
Company |  J.D. Power |  Complaints  
---|---|---  
State Farm | 7th of 22 |  16% less than average  
Farmers | 9th of 22 |  32% more than average  
Geico |  12th of 22 |  25% less than average  
Allstate | 16th of 22 |  30% less than average  
Progressive | 21st of 22 |  39% less than average  
**While Farmers also earned a good score from J.D. Power, it gets 32% more complaints than expected.** That means customers aren't as happy with their experience at Farmers compared to other companies.
Geico, Allstate and Progressive all have very few complaints. But all three companies earned below-average scores from J.D. Power. That indicates that it may take longer to fix your car after a crash if you choose one of these companies.

Geico offers far more discounts than other major companies. It may be the cheapest option if you qualify for lots of discounts.
**Pros:**
  * Numerous discounts
  * Good customer service


**Cons:**
  * High rates before discounts
  * Limited coverage add-ons


Geico's rates are typically a little higher than the national average. However, it could have the best prices for drivers who qualify for many of its [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review#auto-discounts "Geico auto insurance discounts").

However, Geico isn't the best choice for people looking to save with a  safe driving program. That's because [Geico's DriveEasy program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-drive-easy-insurance-review "Geico DriveEasy Review: Is it Worth it?") only offers a discount of up to 10%, and your rates can go up if you have bad driving habits.
**People looking to sign up for a safe driving program should consider[State Farm Drive Safe & Save](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save-insurance-review "State Farm Drive Safe & Save Review") instead.** It offers a discount of up to 30% and won't raise your rates if you get a bad score.

Progressive offers many helpful coverage add-ons for people who want extra protection.
**Pros:**
  * Many coverage options
  * Affordable rates


**Cons:**
  * Difficult claims process


**Both Progressive and Farmers offer many useful and uncommon coverage add-ons. Progressive is typically a better choice because its basic full coverage policy is much more affordable.** However, the best company for you depends on your specific coverage needs.
![bank icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/bank)
**Progressive is a good choice if you have a car loan or lease because it sells[gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "How Gap Auto Insurance Works").** If your car is totaled, this coverage pays the difference between its current value and your loan or lease balance. With this coverage, you won't be stuck paying off a loan or lease for a car you no longer have.
![car icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/car)
**If you have a brand-new car, you might want to consider Farmers.** That's because it offers [new car replacement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-car-replacement-insurance "New Car Replacement Insurance"), which pays for a brand new vehicle if your car is totaled in an accident.

**How much car insurance do you need?**
[Each state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") requires a different amount of car insurance coverage.
