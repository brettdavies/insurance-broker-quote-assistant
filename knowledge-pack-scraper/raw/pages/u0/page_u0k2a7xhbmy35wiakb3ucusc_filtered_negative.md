Geico's rates are typically a little higher than the national average. However, it could have the best prices for drivers who qualify for many of its [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-insurance-review#auto-discounts "Geico auto insurance discounts").

However, Geico isn't the best choice for people looking to save with a  safe driving program. That's because [Geico's DriveEasy program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-drive-easy-insurance-review "Geico DriveEasy Review: Is it Worth it?") only offers a discount of up to 10%, and your rates can go up if you have bad driving habits.
**People looking to sign up for a safe driving program should consider[State Farm Drive Safe & Save](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save-insurance-review "State Farm Drive Safe & Save Review") instead.** It offers a discount of up to 30% and won't raise your rates if you get a bad score.

**Progressive is a good choice if you have a car loan or lease because it sells[gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "How Gap Auto Insurance Works").** If your car is totaled, this coverage pays the difference between its current value and your loan or lease balance. With this coverage, you won't be stuck paying off a loan or lease for a car you no longer have.
**If you have a brand-new car, you might want to consider Farmers.** That's because it offers [new car replacement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-car-replacement-insurance "New Car Replacement Insurance"), which pays for a brand new vehicle if your car is totaled in an accident.

[Each state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") requires a different amount of car insurance coverage. Typically, you'll need coverage to pay for injuries to other people and property damage that you cause.
Extra coverage options differ by company and state. It's also usually a good idea to buy [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"), roadside assistance and rental reimbursement for added protection.
