# Ring Discontinuing $99/yr Alarm Monitoring – Forced into $200/yr Plan. Any Alternatives?

Hey everyone,

I just got the news that Ring is discontinuing the **Ring Protect Home Standard with Alarm Professional Monitoring ($99/year)** and is forcing all users into the **$200/year plan**—a **100% increase**.

I only use Ring for **alarm monitoring** and have no other Ring devices, nor do I care for extra features like video storage or smart home integrations. This price hike is frustrating, and I'm looking for advice on what to do next.

* **Are there any alternative services** that provide similar professional monitoring at a reasonable cost?
* **Has anyone found a way to monitor their alarm system without paying these high fees?**
* **Any DIY solutions** that still allow for emergency response notifications?

I’m open to switching providers if it means avoiding unnecessary costs. Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
