#  Just got a text from my State Farm insurance agent saying my rate will be going up from $170 to $391 as of December. Is there anything I can do or am I screwed? 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
So I got a text from my agent saying the following: 
Hi this is your Matt Timothy State Farm Insurance Agency. I looked into rewriting your policy as of 12/16/24. The new rate would be $391 a month for full coverage. If you did just liability it would be $259 a month. We could look to change your coverage if you want to get the price down. Here is what is on your record: 06-05-2024 Accident 10-27-2023 Comprehensive Coverage Claim 02-28-2023 Limitations On Turning Around 11-07-2022 Speeding 26-30 Miles Per Hour Over The Limit 01-30-2023 Towing and Labor Coverage Claim” 
I responded: 
“I'm a little bit confused here because I talked in depth with someone about what my rate would be with switching to my own insurance and getting this new car even after filing the claim on my old one and I was told it would be the amount I'm currently paying? What causing things to go up at the end of the year?” 
Then they said: 
“Due to your driving record and claims frequency our underwriters are non-renewing your current policy, but we can rewrite it for you we just have to add the incidents. Unfortunately the rate is more. You still have coverage under your current policy until 12/16.” 
For context I am a 25 year old male. the comprehensive coverage claim was from me hitting a deer last year and the accident was from my rear wheel falling off while driving due to a failed axel nut. I was told it would not affect my rate because I was not at fault but now it seems like it will. The car ended up getting totaled out on account of it being worth about $2500 and ultimately they gave me a check for about $1800. The two tickets I have no excuses for and have learned my lesson. 
The car I currently drive is a 2010 Subaru Outback I got for about $10k. A few months ago. What options do I have for lowering my rate if I want to keep full coverage? 400 a month seems insanely expensive compared to what I was paying before.

Technically, your rate was not impacted - you were non-renewed. Any rate increase comes from a completely new policy which I'm surprised SF was willing to offer. Granted, this is a distinction without a practical difference, but it's technically correct (which is after all, the best kind of correct). 
Also, the failed axle nut is 100% an at fault claim - you are responsible for maintaining your car in a road-worthy condition, and that didn't happen. As a result, you had a single car collision - who's fault is that besides yours? 
All that aside, you have a dozen or more options - there are lots and lots of carriers besides SF and you should shop around and see if you can do better with one of them. Bluntly though, you have a pretty shitty auto insurance profile - two recent claims, two recent tickets (including a 25+ over the limit!), young driver, etc. You may find out that the SF premium is the best you can do. Good luck. 
One last thing - I see that you have a roadside assistance claim. Generally not a good idea to use your carrier's roadside assistance - it impacts rates and renewal decisions. Better off spending $75 and getting AAA even if your carrier provides roadside assistance "for free." Good luck

It sounds like they're offering to move him from State Farm Mutual to State Farm Fire & Casualty. Mutual gets the better rates/discounts. The way they factor in citations is also different.

After reading OP's situation, this is the most concise explanation of his situation. I'd like to add that OP can also take a defensive driving course offered by his state to maybe get a discount on the insurance.

I love these posts. I have tickets and claims and I am complaining that my rates are going up. Plus you have an agent that is trying to help you. Time to self reflect and realize that your driving habits caused your increase. Plus the amount of people like you are what is the cause of increased rates for others that have a clean driving history.

They are worried you are both a risky driver (amount of claims and infractions) and someone who makes claims over anything they can (roadside). Your policy quote sounds within reason but I would still shop around. You might be able to get 50-100 cheaper with someone else if you are lucky.

Whomever told you the collision claim was not at fault was incorrect. Unless there is another party who is found responsible collision losses need to have someone as at fault. Since it was a single vehicle accident you in paper are at fault. Failure to maintain your vehicle is the direct and approximate cause of the accident. Best you can do is shop around but your claims history will be considered.

Good that you learned your lesson. Most people never do. And yes, $400 a month is expensive. You are a risky driver. High risk means high premium. That's how insurance works. 
Collision claims are sometimes at fault, depending on certain parameters. You're still a young driver. You have tickets and a robust claims history. These are all bad things to insurance. Shop around. State Farm's rates may or may not be the cheapest for you. Get a broker to look for a policy for you.

You have had a lot of claims in a short amount of time. 
Plus, you are 25 and male. I don’t know where you live as that could potentially impact your rates too. Living out in BFE (bum f*** Egypt) (ie the middle of nowhere) vs say San Fran could impact rates too. 
You don’t mention your credit so not sure if it’s used to figure in your rates. 
Your claim history is high not to mention the speeding violation. Ouch. 
You may possibly qualify (ask your agent) for taking a safe drivers class? It may (I’m not sure) affect the price of insurance. 
I’m in Michigan with SF so I understand high rates.

There’s no loyalty in insurance. A “loyalty discount” is a false front. Get an independent agent and have them shop around for you. 
It’s an algorithm, you don’t fit company A’s risk parameters, but you might fit company B.

I'm an agent. That's a lot of stuff in a 3 year period. Shop it around and you'll see that other carriers will most likely charge more than you were previously paying too. You no longer qualify as a preferred risk and are probably being moved out of the mutual company and into the fire and casualty company.

There are many things you theoretically _can_ do but you probably won't want to do. 
Reduce coverage (increase deductibles, reduce coverage maximums), change vehicles (collision coverage is in part driven by the value of the vehicle), garage your car elsewhere (may get you a reduction if you live in a high risk area), switch carriers (other carriers may or may not offer you lower rate). 
If you don't have a loan on your vehicle, consider whether you really need collision coverage. For a 2010, it's getting near the time where the benefit of collision coverage is less than the insurance premium.
