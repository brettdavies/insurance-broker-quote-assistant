# Just got a text from my State Farm insurance agent saying my rate will be going up from $170 to $391 as of December. Is there anything I can do or am I screwed?

So I got a text from my agent saying the following:

Hi this is your Matt Timothy State Farm Insurance Agency. I looked into rewriting your policy as of 12/16/24. The new rate would be $391 a month for full coverage. If you did just liability it would be $259 a month. We could look to change your coverage if you want to get the price down. Here is what is on your record: 06-05-2024 Accident 10-27-2023 Comprehensive Coverage Claim 02-28-2023 Limitations On Turning Around 11-07-2022 Speeding 26-30 Miles Per Hour Over The Limit 01-30-2023 Towing and Labor Coverage Claim”

I responded:

“I'm a little bit confused here because I talked in depth with someone about what my rate would be with switching to my own insurance and getting this new car even after filing the claim on my old one and I was told it would be the amount I'm currently paying? What causing things to go up at the end of the year?”

Then they said:

“Due to your driving record and claims frequency our underwriters are non-renewing your current policy, but we can rewrite it for you we just have to add the incidents. Unfortunately the rate is more. You still have coverage under your current policy until 12/16.”

For context I am a 25 year old male. the comprehensive coverage claim was from me hitting a deer last year and the accident was from my rear wheel falling off while driving due to a failed axel nut. I was told it would not affect my rate because I was not at fault but now it seems like it will. The car ended up getting totaled out on account of it being worth about $2500 and ultimately they gave me a check for about $1800. The two tickets I have no excuses for and have learned my lesson.

The car I currently drive is a 2010 Subaru Outback I got for about $10k. A few months ago. What options do I have for lowering my rate if I want to keep full coverage? 400 a month seems insanely expensive compared to what I was paying before.
