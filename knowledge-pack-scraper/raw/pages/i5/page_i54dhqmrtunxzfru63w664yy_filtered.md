Yes, Progressive will insure you with a DUI. In addition to insuring people who have been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), Progressive will file an SR-22 or FR-44 form with the driver’s state after a DUI conviction, if necessary.

Progressive insurance after a DUI conviction will cost approximately 178% more than a Progressive policy costs for drivers with a [clean driving record](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/clean-driving-record-2140724122/). After the DUI conviction stops showing up on your [driving record](/edu/ci/driving-record-check/12553), usually within 3 to 5 years, Progressive will decrease your rates.

## What to Do If Progressive Denies You Coverage

Even though Progressive insures drivers with a DUI, you may get turned down if you have more than one DUI or a DUI plus other significant risk factors. In this case, your state government will help. Each state has a [program](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/assigned-risk-auto-insurance-2140719422/) that allows drivers who cannot find car insurance coverage elsewhere to get a policy. These insurance programs are typically more expensive and only offer the state’s [minimum required coverage](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/71356), so you should shop around before resorting to getting your insurance through the state.
