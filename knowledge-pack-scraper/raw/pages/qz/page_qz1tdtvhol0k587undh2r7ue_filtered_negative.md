Along with some [standard discounts](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/) — like multi-policy/bundling, multi-car and safe driver discounts — Travelers offers policyholders some additional ways to save on their monthly premium.
Policyholders can save on their car insurance rates if they own or lease a [hybrid or electric car](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/insurance-rates-hybrid-electric-cars/).
Drivers with no gaps in insurance coverage can qualify for this discount.
Travelers offers a [student discount](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/student-discount/) if you meet the company's academic requirements by maintaining a "B" average or better.
