## The best car insurance companies in Ontario

When looking for the best car insurance in Ontario, there are several factors to keep in mind.

That's why Bankrate's insurance editorial team did a deep dive into the best car insurance companies in Ontario. With insights into how your personal factors can impact rates and what signs indicate the right car insurance company for you, our experts review what goes into making an auto insurer one of the best companies.

To pick the [best insurance carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for Ontario, California, our team analyzed the latest premium data available from Quadrant Information Services along with expert third-party customer satisfaction scores and financial strength ratings from J.D.

**Why Progressive made our list:** Affordable rates, a wide range of discounts and excellent policy customization options make Progressive one of our top picks for the best car insurance in Ontario, California. With a 4.4 Bankrate Score for auto insurance, Progressive stands out from the competition with well-rounded options for many Ontario drivers, including those with violations or accidents on their driving record.

**Why Progressive is best for digital policy management:**While Progressive has a handful of [Ontario-area agents](https://www.progressiveagent.com/local-agent/california/ontario/), its highly-rated mobile app and user-friendly website make it a strong option for drivers who prefer to manage their auto insurance from their smartphone. Progressive ranked above average for service and shopping experience in J.D. Power’s [2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), but lagged below average in the [2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study) for usage-based insurance.

**Why Geico made our list:**Geico tied for a [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers, so it may be a good option if you have a few marks on your license. Our research indicates that Geico has particularly low average rates for state minimum coverage. It also ranked third for customer satisfaction in the California region from J.D. Power, an improvement over 2024, when the company scored below the regional average. This could indicate that Geico is making strides in customer service as well as offering affordable rates.

**Why Geico is best for discounts:** Geico offers a wide range of [auto insurance discounts](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/), from automatic discounts based on your vehicle’s equipment and age to loyalty discounts, student discounts and discounted rates for members of certain professional and alumni associations.

**Why Mercury made our list:**Low rates and unique coverage make Mercury a standout option for auto insurance in Ontario, CA. In addition to standard coverage like liability and collision insurance, Mercury offers ridesharing insurance to drivers for transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft. However, it’s worth noting that Mercury receives consistently below-average customer satisfaction ratings in J.D. Power studies.

**Why Mercury is best for local agents:** Mercury works with a network of [local independent agents](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/agentlocator/) in the Ontario area. While the company’s mobile tools are highly rated, drivers who prefer to work with an agent who knows the area may find a good fit in Mercury.

**Why Kemper made our list:** Kemper’s low rates for drivers in Ontario earns it a place in our top picks for local auto insurers. While the company did not rank in the 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study from [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), its basic coverage offerings and below-average rates for Ontario drivers could make it a worthwhile option for some local residents.

**Why Kemper is best for high-risk auto insurance:** Kemper’s specialty is auto insurance for high-risk drivers, including those with poor driving records and immigrant drivers. Kemper offers SR-22 filing and works with drivers who hold international licenses or Matrícula Consular identification cards from Mexico. If you’re struggling to find auto coverage from other Ontario-area insurers because of a suspended license, international driving history or other issues in your driver profile, Kemper Auto could be a viable option with affordable costs.

**Why State Farm made our list:** Although State Farm rates tend to be some of the highest on our list, State Farm offers plenty of discount opportunities and a range of policy options that may make it attractive to Ontario drivers. The company’s coverage offerings, discount availability, financial strength ratings and customer satisfaction scores means the company has a Bankrate score of 4.3 out of 5. It's also worth noting that State Farm was a 2025 Bankrate Award winner for Best Auto Insurance Company for Safe Drivers, and it offers several ways that careful drivers can save on their policies.

**Why State Farm is best for customer satisfaction:**State Farm typically does well in J.D. Power rankings for customer satisfaction. The company scored above average in the J.D.

## How much is car insurance in Ontario, California?

The average cost of car insurance in Ontario, California is $3,076 per year for full coverage and $901. For drivers seeking full coverage, that’s 1 percent less than the [state average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/) of $915 and 14 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/).

Note that your premium is unlikely to be an exact match for these average rates. Your own payments are personalized based on a range of factors that your insurer considers. Your age and [location](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) as well as your car's age, make and model all play a role in determining what you will pay. Another primary risk factor is your driving record. Drivers with [few or no marks on their license](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-good-drivers/) generally qualify for the best rates, since insurers see them as less likely to cause accidents or file claims in the future.

### Ontario rates for teens

[Teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) in Ontario regularly pay some of the highest premiums for car insurance, especially if they’re not on a parent’s policy, because of their lack of driving experience and high accident rate. An 18-year-old Ontario driver with a standalone full coverage policy pays an average of $8,051 per year, while their parents would pay an average of $6,230 per year to keep them on their policy.

### Ontario rates for young drivers

[Drivers aged 20 to 25](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) in Ontario typically pay lower car insurance premiums than teens, but more than older adults with a greater degree of experience behind the wheel. While staying on a family policy at this age can help to keep costs low, many young adults will have their own address and need a standalone policy — which costs from $3,805 on average for 25-year-olds to $5,365 for 20-year-old drivers. Sticking to state minimum coverage could lower rates, but at the expense of financial protection in the event of accidents.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Ontario

[California law](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/alcohol-and-drugs/) imposes serious penalties on DUI convictions, including immediate revocation of driving privileges, SR-22 filing requirements and potential fines, fees, vehicle impoundment and jail time. In addition, your DUI conviction may make it difficult to find affordable auto coverage.  The average annual cost of full coverage after a DUI conviction is $7,820 for drivers in Ontario, and $2,323 just for state minimum coverage. That’s 158 percent more than the state average for minimum coverage and 154 percent more for full coverage.

It’s important to note that securing coverage after a DUI can also be more challenging, as not all standard carriers are willing to write policies following the high-risk incident. Some insurers could cancel your policy mid-term following a DUI conviction while others will wait until the end of the policy term.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
