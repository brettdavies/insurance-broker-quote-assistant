A majority of U.S. drivers say their car insurance rates went up last year, according to new research from [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/money/car-insurance/car-insurance-companies-with-smallest-premiums-increase-a1062317566/), with some reporting premium increases of more than $200 a year.
Of the 40,566 car owners surveyed by the consumer nonprofit, 60% said they faced a rate hike between 2023 and 2024.

“The dramatic difference in price increases from company to company underscores the need for drivers to compare rates to avoid overpaying**,** ” Martin Lachter, head of research for Consumer Reports, told [CNBC Select.](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) “Thirty percent of those surveyed told us that they’ve switched insurers in the past five years.“  
  
According to Lachter, those drivers saw a median annual savings of $461 by changing carriers.
He also noted that insurers that CR customers had previously rated higher for fair pricing, clear terms, agent access and the claims process were less likely to increase rates.

##  How to save on auto insurance
The best way to [lower your car insurance bill](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/) is to get quotes from several companies and compare their offers. Be sure to look for comparable coverage limits, options and deductibles.
Comparing rates isn’t the only way to save, however. Many insurers offer discounts or waive fees for paying your premium in full at the start of your six-month or year-long term. Setting up automated payments from your bank account or credit card could save you between 5% and 15%,
In most states, insurers [consider your credit history](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/) when calculating your premiums. Putting some effort into raising your credit score — such as paying bills in full and on time and checking for errors in your credit report — could also result in significant savings.
Raising your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) is another way to lower monthly premiums. Increasing your collision and comprehensive deductible from $200 to $500 could lower rates by as much as 30%, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Bumping it all the way up to $1,000 could save you 40% or more.  
  
The key is making sure you can afford the increased out-of-pocket expense.
