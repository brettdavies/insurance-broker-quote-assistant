#### Farm Bureau car insurance quotes by age
Car insurance companies see [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) as high risk because of their lack of experience behind the wheel and high accident rate. While drivers under the age of 18 must be insured on a parent or guardian's policy, even those over 18 can often save by staying on that shared policy — if their carrier allows it. Young drivers usually save on coverage in their 20s and 30s as long as they maintain a clean driving record.

### Farm Bureau customer satisfaction
When it comes to grading insurance companies for customer satisfaction, third-party agencies can help. Some, like J.D. Power, conduct annual studies of insurance companies and rank insurers based on billing process and policy information, customer interaction, policy offerings, policy pricing and overall customer satisfaction.
With Farm Bureau, it’s important to remember that the carrier is made up of different companies that operate on a state level. For this reason, be sure to review your state’s Farm Bureau when it comes to customer service experience.
Various branches of Farm Bureau insurance ranked well in the [2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study). These include the Michigan Farm Bureau, which ranked above-average in the North Central region, the North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky Farm Bureaus, which scored above average in the Southeast region, and the Texas Farm Bureau, which ranked above-average in the Texas region.
Additionally, Farm Bureau is recognized for its financial strength with an A (Excellent) rating from [AM Best](https://ratings.ambest.com/CompanyProfile.aspx?amb=354&AltNum=303354), indicating a strong ability to meet its ongoing insurance obligations.
#### Farm Bureau auto insurance customer complaints
The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) tracks complaints against insurance companies. These complaints are categorized by product type and compared against a company's market share to calculate complaint indexes. The index has a baseline of 1.00 with a figure above 1.00 indicating more complaints than expected and vice versa.
The NAIC splits up indexes for Farm Bureau Insurance by state subsidiary companies, so you will need to look up the complaint index for your specific branch to get an idea of how many complaints are filed against the company for its home or auto product.
### Farm Bureau car insurance discounts
Available discounts will vary based on which bureau you're working with. We took a look at the Michigan Farm Bureau as an example. This branch offers a [handful of discounts](https://www.fbfs.com/insurance/auto-insurance/auto-discounts) that could help you save money on your car insurance premium. Some common savings are available, including a multi-policy discount and a good student discount. If you’re looking for the cheapest car insurance, a few of the more unique [ways to save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) include:
  * **Young driver safety program:** This program not only helps newer drivers learn safe driving habits, but can also reduce their car insurance policy premiums.
  * **Driveology:** Farm Bureau’s telematics program tracks your driving patterns and could earn you a discount of as high as 50 percent on your coverage.
  * **Claim-free discount:** This discount’s availability varies by state, but can be earned by drivers who remain accident-free and file fewer claims.
  * **Low mileage discount:** Drivers who drive less than 7,500 miles annually could earn this discount.
  * **Continued in-force credit:** Drivers who continue to renew their car insurance with Farm Bureau can earn loyalty credit on future renewals.
  * **Members Choice:** Bundle your auto insurance with car, home, boat, motorcycle or other Farm Bureau policies and you'll earn a discount and pay one premium and one deductible.


Discount options vary by state, and eligibility can vary based on your personal rating factors. The best way to find the savings opportunities that you qualify for is to talk with an agent.

### Farm Bureau customer satisfaction
Understanding third-party ratings for home insurance can offer valuable insights into a carrier's performance. Agencies like J.D. Power typically conduct comprehensive annual studies, ranking insurers on aspects such as billing processes, policy information clarity, customer interactions, the range of policy offerings, pricing and overall satisfaction. Farm Bureau's A (Excellent) rating from AM Best indicates a robust financial foundation, suggesting the company is generally well-equipped to fulfill its insurance commitments. When considering these ratings, it's beneficial to consider how they might reflect on your specific insurance needs and preferences.
Farm Bureau is not noted in J.D. Power's [2024 Home Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-home-insurance-study). This is likely because the study ranks national companies, and Farm Bureau consists of state-wide insurers that are likely to vary in customer satisfaction from region to region. To help you understand how the farm bureau in your state does with customer satisfaction, it may be helpful to talk to others who have Farm Bureau policies, or review online comments on forum websites like Reddit.
#### Farm Bureau home insurance customer complaints
As with auto insurance, Farm Bureau NAIC complaint indexes vary based on the state branch. To look at an example, the [Florida Farm Bureau](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=31216&:refresh) has a 2024 home insurance complaint index of 0.13, indicating fewer complaints than expected. Most of the Farm Bureaus we looked at had similarly low indexes.
### Farm Bureau home insurance discounts
As with automobile policies, most Farm Bureau home insurance companies offer policyholders several [ways to reduce the cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/keep-home-insurance-cost-down/) of their homeowners policies. Some common discounts, like multi-policy and protective advice, are commonly offered, but some branches offer more [specialized savings](https://www.fbfs.com/insurance/home-and-property-insurance/farm-bureau-members-choice). For example, with the Michigan Farm Bureau, these include:
  * **New home:** If you live in a newly-built home, you might qualify for this discount.
  * **New roof:** Newer roofs are less likely to be damaged and can result in savings on your home insurance with Farm Bureau.
  * **Continued in-force credit:** This discount may reward you for your time with and loyalty to Farm Bureau.
  * **Protective device credit:** If you have a security device or pay for a service, this could help lower your premium.

##  Is Farm Bureau a good insurance company? 
Many Farm Bureau home, auto and life insurance policies come with a variety of attractive discounts and coverage add-ons to help customers personalize their own policy. Additionally, Farm Bureau policies may be specifically tailored to your region, and bureau membership may come with added perks and benefits.
However, Farm Bureau’s average home rates are higher than the national average, which may not make it an attractive option for shoppers on a budget. Ultimately, we recommend investigating your local bureau's coverage options, discounts and customer service metrics for more information.

Thoughts on Farm Bureau
"I tried to purchase an insurance policy through this company because I had heard (read online) good things about this company. My experience however was not the case. first I had received an agent that was in my area. I would call and leave messages and she would never get back to me. …. Long story short, I don’t think I would waste my time with Farm Bureau again."

This commitment to community involvement highlights why many consider Farm Bureau insurance good and supportive of local initiatives.

Filing a claim with Farm Bureau Insurance can be straightforward and can be done through multiple channels:
    * **Contact your local agent:** Your local Farm Bureau agent is your primary point of contact for filing a claim. They can guide you through the process, help you gather necessary documentation and answer any questions you might have about your coverage.
    * **Call toll-free hotlines:** Farm Bureau provides toll-free hotlines for reporting claims. This option is available 24/7, ensuring you can file a claim at any time, especially in emergencies. Check the back of your insurance card or the Farm Bureau website for the appropriate hotline number.
    * **File online:** Many Farm Bureau branches offer online claim filing through their websites. This method is convenient and allows you to submit your claim details and upload necessary documents electronically.
    * **Mobile app:** Some Farm Bureau Insurance branches have a mobile app that allows you to file a claim directly from your smartphone. This can be particularly useful for documenting incidents with photos and submitting them instantly.
The best method to file a claim may depend on the specific Farm Bureau that writes your policy, so it’s always a good idea to check with your local agent or refer to your policy documents for detailed instructions.
  * ###  Is Farm Bureau insurance available in my state?

Farm Bureau Insurance has affiliated insurance companies in many states. Insurance products are available from Farm Bureau affiliates in all states except Alaska and Hawaii.

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:

Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
