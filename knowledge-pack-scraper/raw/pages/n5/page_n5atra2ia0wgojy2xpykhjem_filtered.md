Below you can see average rates for some common driving infractions, but note that eligibility for drivers with these infractions will vary. The best way to gauge eligibility is to request personalized quotes.

#### Farm Bureau car insurance quotes by age

Car insurance companies see [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) as high risk because of their lack of experience behind the wheel and high accident rate. While drivers under the age of 18 must be insured on a parent or guardian's policy, even those over 18 can often save by staying on that shared policy — if their carrier allows it. Young drivers usually save on coverage in their 20s and 30s as long as they maintain a clean driving record.

### Farm Bureau customer satisfaction

When it comes to grading insurance companies for customer satisfaction, third-party agencies can help. Some, like J.D. Power, conduct annual studies of insurance companies and rank insurers based on billing process and policy information, customer interaction, policy offerings, policy pricing and overall customer satisfaction.

With Farm Bureau, it’s important to remember that the carrier is made up of different companies that operate on a state level. For this reason, be sure to review your state’s Farm Bureau when it comes to customer service experience.

Various branches of Farm Bureau insurance ranked well in the [2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study). These include the Michigan Farm Bureau, which ranked above-average in the North Central region, the North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky Farm Bureaus, which scored above average in the Southeast region, and the Texas Farm Bureau, which ranked above-average in the Texas region.

Additionally, Farm Bureau is recognized for its financial strength with an A (Excellent) rating from [AM Best](https://ratings.ambest.com/CompanyProfile.aspx?amb=354&AltNum=303354), indicating a strong ability to meet its ongoing insurance obligations.

#### Farm Bureau auto insurance customer complaints

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) tracks complaints against insurance companies. These complaints are categorized by product type and compared against a company's market share to calculate complaint indexes. The index has a baseline of 1.00 with a figure above 1.00 indicating more complaints than expected and vice versa.

The NAIC splits up indexes for Farm Bureau Insurance by state subsidiary companies, so you will need to look up the complaint index for your specific branch to get an idea of how many complaints are filed against the company for its home or auto product.

### Farm Bureau car insurance discounts

Available discounts will vary based on which bureau you're working with. We took a look at the Michigan Farm Bureau as an example. This branch offers a [handful of discounts](https://www.fbfs.com/insurance/auto-insurance/auto-discounts) that could help you save money on your car insurance premium. Some common savings are available, including a multi-policy discount and a good student discount. If you’re looking for the cheapest car insurance, a few of the more unique [ways to save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) include:

* **Young driver safety program:** This program not only helps newer drivers learn safe driving habits, but can also reduce their car insurance policy premiums.
* **Driveology:** Farm Bureau’s telematics program tracks your driving patterns and could earn you a discount of as high as 50 percent on your coverage.
* **Claim-free discount:** This discount’s availability varies by state, but can be earned by drivers who remain accident-free and file fewer claims.
* **Low mileage discount:** Drivers who drive less than 7,500 miles annually could earn this discount.
* **Continued in-force credit:** Drivers who continue to renew their car insurance with Farm Bureau can earn loyalty credit on future renewals.
* **Members Choice:** Bundle your auto insurance with car, home, boat, motorcycle or other Farm Bureau policies and you'll earn a discount and pay one premium and one deductible.

Discount options vary by state, and eligibility can vary based on your personal rating factors. The best way to find the savings opportunities that you qualify for is to talk with an agent.

Power typically conduct comprehensive annual studies, ranking insurers on aspects such as billing processes, policy information clarity, customer interactions, the range of policy offerings, pricing and overall satisfaction. Farm Bureau's A (Excellent) rating from AM Best indicates a robust financial foundation, suggesting the company is generally well-equipped to fulfill its insurance commitments. When considering these ratings, it's beneficial to consider how they might reflect on your specific insurance needs and preferences.

Farm Bureau is not noted in J.D. Power's [2024 Home Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-home-insurance-study). This is likely because the study ranks national companies, and Farm Bureau consists of state-wide insurers that are likely to vary in customer satisfaction from region to region. To help you understand how the farm bureau in your state does with customer satisfaction, it may be helpful to talk to others who have Farm Bureau policies, or review online comments on forum websites like Reddit.

#### Farm Bureau home insurance customer complaints

As with auto insurance, Farm Bureau NAIC complaint indexes vary based on the state branch. To look at an example, the [Florida Farm Bureau](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=31216&:refresh) has a 2024 home insurance complaint index of 0.13, indicating fewer complaints than expected. Most of the Farm Bureaus we looked at had similarly low indexes.

### Farm Bureau home insurance discounts

As with automobile policies, most Farm Bureau home insurance companies offer policyholders several [ways to reduce the cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/keep-home-insurance-cost-down/) of their homeowners policies. Some common discounts, like multi-policy and protective advice, are commonly offered, but some branches offer more [specialized savings](https://www.fbfs.com/insurance/home-and-property-insurance/farm-bureau-members-choice). For example, with the Michigan Farm Bureau, these include:

* **New home:** If you live in a newly-built home, you might qualify for this discount.
* **New roof:** Newer roofs are less likely to be damaged and can result in savings on your home insurance with Farm Bureau.
* **Continued in-force credit:** This discount may reward you for your time with and loyalty to Farm Bureau.
* **Protective device credit:** If you have a security device or pay for a service, this could help lower your premium.

## Is Farm Bureau a good insurance company?

Many Farm Bureau home, auto and life insurance policies come with a variety of attractive discounts and coverage add-ons to help customers personalize their own policy. Additionally, Farm Bureau policies may be specifically tailored to your region, and bureau membership may come with added perks and benefits.

However, Farm Bureau’s average home rates are higher than the national average, which may not make it an attractive option for shoppers on a budget. Ultimately, we recommend investigating your local bureau's coverage options, discounts and customer service metrics for more information.

### What are real-life customers saying about Farm Bureau?

One way to gain a sense of a company's customer service abilities is to look at online reviews. We parsed Farm Bureau insurance reviews at discussion forums like Reddit to see what real-life customers are saying about their experiences with the company.

#### Reddit

Reddit discussions on Farm Bureau Insurance reveal a spectrum of customer experiences. On one end, some users express frustration with agent responsiveness, particularly when it comes to handling policy inquiries and claims.

Thoughts on Farm Bureau

"I tried to purchase an insurance policy through this company because I had heard (read online) good things about this company. My experience however was not the case. first I had received an agent that was in my area. I would call and leave messages and she would never get back to me. …. Long story short, I don’t think I would waste my time with Farm Bureau again."

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

* **Tier 1 (Ratings):** To determine a life insurance company’s financial health and reliability, we assessed several industry-standard ratings, such as [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Comdex, the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC), and credit agencies like Moody’s, Fitch and [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage options):** We assessed companies’ coverage options, availability and policy features to help policyholders find a provider that best meets their needs. We examined each company’s life insurance product lines, including term, whole and universal life options.
* **Tier 3 (Accessibility & process):** To assess the ease and transparency of applying for coverage, we reviewed the simplicity of obtaining a quote and insurers' underwriting processes — including eligibility requirements. We also considered insurers’ community engagement.
