### What's the best car insurance in Wichita, KS?

Minimum liability coverage could still leave you facing a considerable financial burden if you get into an accident. This level of coverage satisfies legal requirements, but after an accident, drivers may wind up with bills higher than their coverage limits, because of either damage to an expensive vehicle or another driver's medical costs.

[Full coverage auto insurance](/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest and Best Full Coverage Car Insurance") includes protection for a driver's own car with [collision and comprehensive coverages](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?").

* **Collision coverage** covers damage to a driver’s own vehicle resulting from a crash, regardless of who was at fault. Also covers damage from collisions with objects or single-car accidents.
* **Comprehensive coverage** covers damage to a driver’s own vehicle caused by something other than a crash, such as a natural disaster or theft.

We suggest most drivers choose a full-coverage policy.

## Methodology
