From Zuma Beach to Redwood National Park, California is known for its incredible landmarks and natural beauty. But according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, it's also one of the costliest states to live in, second only to Hawaii.

That higher cost of living is also reflected in auto insurance premiums; the average full coverage cost of car insurance in California is $199 per month, compared to the national average of $186.

## How does credit score affect car insurance rates in California?

In most states, car insurance companies can use your credit report and credit score to determine your premiums. However, California is one of the few exceptions that bans or limits the use of credit scores in calculating rates — insurers cannot use your credit history or score for underwriting or rating policies.

However, we found that those with excellent credit often had higher rates than those with poor or fair credit. The discrepancy can be due to other factors; for example, those with excellent credit may be purchasing luxury vehicles that come with higher insurance premiums.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Credit health** | **Avg. monthly premium** |
| Poor (550-649) | $248/month |
| Average (650-699) | $192/month |
| Good (700-749) | $172/month |
| Excellent (750+) | $204/month |

## Average car insurance rates for high-risk drivers in California

High-risk drivers are individuals with a higher likelihood of filing claims or getting into accidents. Insurers consider high-risk drivers as those with past speeding tickets, driving under the influence (DUI) convictions, or at-fault accidents, and charge much higher premiums.

Depending on the driving violation, you could see a significant increase.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Violation** | **Avg. monthly premium before violation\*** | **Avg. monthly premium after violation** |
| At-fault accident | $199/month | $233/month |
| DUI | $199/month | $243/month |
| Speeding ticket | $199/month | $243/month |

## How does age affect car insurance rates in California?

Age plays a big role in determining your car insurance premiums. Young drivers are more likely to be in accidents than other age groups, so they tend to have higher premiums. But we found that once you reach the age of 30, rates decrease and stay relatively the same through age 60.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Age** | **Avg. monthly premium** |
| 17 | $373/month |
| 25 | $266/month |
| 30 | $201/month |
| 40 | $193/month |
| 60 | $177/month |

## California car insurance rates by city

Your location is another major factor in determining your credit. Generally, urban drivers pay more than those that live in rural or suburban areas, and locations with higher rates of crime tend to be more expensive.

In California, Los Angeles is the most expensive city for car insurance, averaging $305 per month. That's no surprise, considering [NeighborhoodScout](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/los-angeles/crime) gave the city a "9" on its crime index, meaning that 91% of U.S. cities are safer than Los Angeles.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **City** | **Avg. monthly full-coverage premium** |
| Anaheim | $204/month |
| Bakersfield | $182/month |
| Fresno | $178/month |
| Long Beach | $236/month |
| Los Angeles | $305/month |
| San Diego | $175/month |
| San Francisco | $253/month |

## CA's minimum car insurance requirements

In California, all drivers must have proof of financial responsibility. But that can take several forms:

* Car insurance policy
* Cash deposit of $35,000 with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
* DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance
* Surety bond of $35,000 or more from a company licensed to do business within the state

The majority of drivers will meet those requirements with a car insurance policy. For auto coverage, drivers must meet the following [liability coverage](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage) minimums:

* $15,000 for the injury or death of one person
* $30,000 for the injury or death of more than one person
* $5,000 for property damage

## How to save money on car insurance in California

You can save money on California auto insurance with the following tips:

* **Compare premiums:** Car insurance rates can vary by company, so shopping around and requesting quotes from the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies) could help you get the same or better coverage at a lower rate.
* **Bundle your car insurance with other policies:** If you have renters or homeowners insurance, you may qualify for a discount if you also purchase auto coverage from the same insurer.
* **Talk to your agent about discounts:** Insurance companies usually have discount programs for drivers with clean driving records, students, or those that complete safe driving courses.
* **Increase your deductible:** Your premiums are partially based on your deductible, which is how much you have to cover before your insurer pays for repairs or damages. Boosting your deductible can lower your premium, but make sure you can comfortably afford that cost before increasing it.

## Methodology

Our analysis was conducted using six different auto insurance marketplaces to determine the average cost of auto insurance in each state. The data we analyzed included coverage premiums from up to 10 different insurance providers. We looked at rates by city, driver profile, and credit score, as well as factored in the impact of driving violations. This data is for comparative purposes only. Your actual quote may be different.
