While average car insurance rates are at their lowest for drivers in their 50s and early 60s, they begin to tick upward at age 65 or 70. That's because insurance companies view changes in vision, hearing, reflexes and cognition as risk factors.

However, it's possible to find reasonably priced coverage at any age. Look for companies that offer generous discounts and optional perks like accident forgiveness. Comparison shop at least once a year make sure you're getting the best possible price.

We've picked the best car insurance companies for seniors, based on price, coverage, availability and other factors.

## How much is car insurance for seniors?

In some ways, insurance companies reward experienced drivers: The average annual premium for a 60-year-old male is $2,430, or more than 15% less than a 30-year-old.

But the tables turn when you hit 70 and premiums bump up to an average of $2,635. After that, rates steadily increase.

## Why is car insurance higher for seniors?

Insurance companies believe seniors have a higher likelihood of filing a claim because older drivers, especially those over 75, are [statistically more likely](https://www.iihs.org/topics/older-drivers) to be in accidents and drive older cars that are harder to find replacement parts for.   
  
Fatal crashes increase noticeably starting with drivers 70 to 74, according to the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/). They're highest among drivers 85 and above.

But age is only one factor impacting how much you pay for insurance. A good driving record and credit history can go a long way to keeping your rates down.

## How seniors can save on car insurance

There are several things you can do to keep your premiums from increasing along with the number of candles on your birthday cake.

### 1. Shop for a new policy

No two insurers will offer you the same rate, so it's worth getting quotes from several providers — especially if you have good credit, a good driving record or own your home. [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163)'s Prime Time contract can provide guaranteed renewal if you're at least 50, have no drivers under 25 on your policy and no violations in the last three years.

### 2. Sign up for a safe driving course

[Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/o6d4820c1bef), [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163), [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/sb2ad78ec907), [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) and [AAA](https://go.skimresources.com?id=96128X1659083&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aaa.com%2Fstop%2F&xcust=select) are among the insurance companies that offer discounts to drivers 55 and older if they complete a state-approved defensive-driving course. Depending on the insurer and your state, you may be able to take the class online. You can expect to spend about $30 to take the course, however.

### 3. Bundle your home and auto insurance

Getting [homeowners insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) from the same company that issued you car insurance can lower your premiums. [Allstate](https://secure.money.com/pr/zcf36bbad280) has one of the [best bundling discounts](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) in the industry, with savings of up to 25% a year when you bundle home and auto online.

### 4. Raise your deductible

When you file a claim, your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) is the amount you're responsible for before your insurance kicks in. Increasing your deductible from $200 to $500 could reduce the cost of collision and comprehensive coverage by up to 30%, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Upping it to $1,000 could save you 40% or more.   
  
But if you don't think you can pay more out of pocket or have a spotty driving record, this isn't the strategy for you.

### **5. Switch to a pay-per-mile policy**

If you're driving less than you used to, you could save some money by switching from a traditional insurance policy to a [pay-per-mile plan](https://www.cnbc.com/select/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/). These policies charge a low base rate per month and then a few cents for every mile you drive.

## Car insurance for seniors FAQs

### At what age do car insurance rates increase?

In most states, average premiums begin to increase around age 70. Hawaii and Massachusetts don't allow age to be a factor in determining rates, although carriers in Massachusetts can consider the number of years you've been a licensed driver.

### Why do seniors pay more for car insurance?

Older drivers are considered [higher risk](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) by insurance companies because age-related changes in vision, hearing, cognition and physical functioning [can impair driving ability](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/older_adult_drivers/), according to the Centers for Disease Control, as can certain medications.

### What is the cheapest car insurance for senior citizens?

The car insurance with the cheapest rates depends on where you live, your driving record, your age and other factors. Our analysis has found [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163), [The Hartford](https://secure.money.com/pr/ta864d1067b5), [Travelers](https://secure.money.com/pr/b68b79b41b79), [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625), [Mercury](https://secure.money.com/pr/j5c5d32841db), [Nationwide](https://secure.money.com/pr/l9470b585c8a), [Auto-Owners](https://secure.money.com/pr/t486eb6aebcb) and [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/sb2ad78ec907) have some of the most affordable rates for seniors.

See [our methodology](https://www.cnbc.com/select/about-us/) for more information on how we choose the best car insurance for seniors.

## Our methodology

To determine the best car insurance for seniors, [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) analyzed dozens of providers and compared them based on various factors, including cost, coverage, availability and customer service.

While narrowing down the best companies, we focused on a sample annual premium from [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/#best-auto-insurance-for-seniors) for a 70-year-old driver with a clean driving record, good credit, and a 2020 Toyota Camry driven 12,000 miles annually with the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

From there, we looked at the availability of discounts for older drivers and considered customer satisfaction scores from the Better Business Bureau, [J.D. Power surveys](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-j-d-power/) on auto insurance and the claims process and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index, as well as financial strength ratings from [A.M. Best](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-are-am-best-ratings/).

We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.
