## Our Experience Getting a Quote
It took us less than five minutes to get an online quote with GEICO. After entering standard personal and vehicle information and agreeing to participate in GEICO’s safe driving program, [DriveEasy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/driveeasy/), we received our initial quote.
![Geico quote](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F05%2F27162105%2FGEICO-quote.png&w=828&q=75)
![Geico quoted coverages](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F05%2F27162201%2FGEICO-quoted-coverages.png&w=1080&q=75)
![Geico discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F05%2F27162242%2FGEICO-Discounts.png&w=1920&q=75)
GEICO showed us a breakdown of premium costs and discounts in the estimated quote. It also allowed us to adjust coverage and see how changes affected the premium. We liked the feature for its transparency, allowing customers to play around with ways to lower their bill. It’s a step up compared to [State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/), which requires connecting with an agent to finish the quote process.
Overall, we found GEICO’s online quote process fast and simple, and we liked the ability to customize coverage online. Real-life customers we spoke to agreed that GEICO’s quote and policy purchase process is straightforward and quick.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Is GEICO getting more expensive?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes. In general, car insurance premiums have risen in the last few years due to increased natural disasters, inflation, and higher car accident rates. However, GEICO’s average full coverage rates are 28 percent lower than the national average.
Who is cheaper, GEICO or Progressive?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO usually offers cheaper premiums than [Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/). GEICO charges $1,731 annually for a full coverage policy, while Progressive’s full coverage policies cost $1,960 annually. While GEICO’s prices are generally lower, Progressive does charge 38 percent less annually than GEICO for drivers with a DUI conviction.
Is there a rideshare coverage option from GEICO?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO offers [rideshare insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/rideshare/) — but unlike other insurance companies, it doesn’t offer this coverage as an add-on to your personal policy. Instead, GEICO’s rideshare insurance typically replaces your personal policy with a commercial policy. It provides continuous protection throughout all phases of rideshare driving, including when the app is on but you haven’t accepted a ride, when you’re en route to pick up a passenger, and when you have a passenger in your car
GEICO does not offer rideshare coverage everywhere — for example, it is not available in Florida or New York. To get a quote or check if rideshare insurance is available in your area, you should contact GEICO directly or speak with a local agent.
Does GEICO auto insurance cover rental cars?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes, GEICO auto insurance covers [rental cars](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/rental-cars/) if you have rental reimbursement coverage on your policy. If you do not pay to have rental reimbursement on your policy, GEICO does not cover a rental car. If you’re renting a car from a rental company, your personal policy extends to any rental car you drive. GEICO recommends getting additional coverage if you rent a car that has a market value higher than your own vehicle.
Can GEICO provide an SR-22 or FR-44?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes, GEICO offers SR-22 and FR-44 certification.

Does GEICO offer accident forgiveness?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes, GEICO offers accident forgiveness in all states except California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. You can add accident forgiveness to an existing auto policy to prevent insurance rates from increasing as a result of a driver’s first at-fault accident.
## Methodology
Our goal is to offer consumers precise and impartial information. Our methodology includes the following steps for evaluating companies:
* **Cost (40 percent):** We analyze average premiums for full and minimum coverage across multiple driver profiles, including those with strong credit and clean records, as well as individuals with DUIs, at-fault accidents, or poor credit. We also factor in available discounts. Our full coverage calculations are based on these standard policy limits:
* Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
* Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
* Comprehensive and collision coverage: $500 deductible
* **Claims Service (25 percent):** We examine how efficiently insurers manage claims, focusing on their speed, communication transparency, and fairness in assessing damage. Our analysis uses independent sources such as the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Survey. We also review financial strength ratings from agencies like AM Best and S&P to ensure insurers have the ability to meet claims obligations. Where applicable, firsthand experience and real customer feedback adds further insights.
* **Customer Satisfaction (25 percent):** We evaluate the quality of the customer experience, from obtaining a quote to policy management. This includes ease of making policy changes, accessing documents, and interacting with representatives. Our assessment draws on data from sources like J.D. Power, the NAIC complaint index, Better Business Bureau ratings, and app store reviews. We also interview customers and include our own experiences, aiming to provide readers with firsthand insights.
* **Coverage Options (10 percent):** We assess each company’s range of coverage options, with an emphasis on additional protections beyond the state-required minimums. We give extra weight to insurers that offer add-ons such as rideshare coverage, rental reimbursement, rideshare insurance, and more.
