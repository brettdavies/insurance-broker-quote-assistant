I carry an umbrella for the extra [um/uim coverage](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+policy+um%2Fuim+coverage&cId=6d8117ef-901b-4be9-9c29-2149bfe4e735&iId=b35d58df-44c5-4e2a-b7c6-a99ac8dd6599). If I'm crippled by some jackass with low limits I do not want to worry about financials while I'm laid up in a hospital.

Same. I live in a state with chronically uninsured and [underinsured motorists](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+policy+uninsured+underinsured+motorists&cId=118157e5-98b0-45c8-826f-ffacd71586a3&iId=e543ba1d-6c1c-4ba2-86a5-c8c13361b1a1). My $4m umbrella is dirt cheap and I have full UM/UIM limits on the umbrella.

Depends on the carrier. I also underwrite personal liability and our umbrellas come stock with 25k extended um with optional increases of 1 and 2 mil for nominal $

Not an insurance professional, but here is my opinion.
What’s your [net worth](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+policy+net+worth&cId=9d0b8341-c1a9-4ee9-989b-aaf692b22ae7&iId=47816ce0-7f89-4710-bf92-88a711bda6d4) that isn’t in a 401k (these are generally protected from litigation)? If you have enough assets to make it worthwhile to sue you then umbrella is a good idea.
I carry $2M. I have teenagers, a pool with a diving board, and a 90 pound dog so it isn’t as cheap as it is for some but I think it’s worth it.

ERISA (401k) plans are protected, but IRAs will depend on the state.

Protected until You start taking it out as income.
Then it's subject to garnishment like any other income.

I would make sure there are no liability exclusions on that diving board. In FL most carriers exclude it or limit coverage to a much smaller limit. Usually the umbrellas are follow form so if excluded on primary it’s excluded on excess.
Heck check for dog liability too while you’re at it. You may be surprised.

If I do a search through my homeowners the word pool is in there 5 times. Mostly in the definition of covered accessory structures, and an exclusion for freezing pool plumbing. Diving and dog aren’t found in the policy. None of the words above are found in my umbrella policy.

[umbrella premiums](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+policy+premium+increase&cId=cad83a00-6a73-41c9-a75d-9888f32e9bc7&iId=5dc2f345-7be0-46ef-acd0-1e1d8ee64d3f) have been increasing recently throughout the industry because more and more customers are dipping into them to pay claims or have their company pay to defend them against huge lawsuits. The fact that costs have risen to a point that umbrella claims activity are increasing is reason enough to have one. It’s much better to transfer the risk to a third party than risk paying for your own defense and ending up with a huge financial loss.

Yes it is a good idea. I don't care if you have assets or not. I'd rather be over insured than under insured.

I think it's worth it to be overinsured if the additional insurance is low cost and depending upon where you are in life. If OP has children (regardless of their age) or a long-term committed relationship, it sounds like an umbrella policy would be worth. If OP is just starting out on their own, not a homeowner, and no children or significant other, having a policy of 500/500/500 is probably going to be more useful.

Yes it’s worth it, but it does not add $1mil to everything. I will hear “I don’t have jewelry coverage, but does my umbrella add coverage”? The misunderstanding around umbrellas is overwhelming, and I think it’s because of agents saying things like “adds extra coverage” or “adds $1mm to everything” It’s $1mm excess liability, which in this litigious age is so valuable, but it’s not adding property coverage etc. Also it often covers defense costs outside of the limit, which again, super valuable.

This is the first year I've purchased one. I think it's worth it. Cost of everything has gone up significantly. Auto accidents can easily exhaust limits. And it's like a couple hundred bucks max.

Like most things in insurance, it’s not worth it till it is. In the case of an umbrella, though, that’s doubly true. 99% of folks will never have an umbrella claim, but if you have a claim breach the umbrella, you’d probably have been royally fucked without it. For $35, do it.

It’s definitely worth having. A million isn’t what it used to be. Also, there are situations where it drops down to primary coverage if your other policies don’t provide coverage.

I didn’t read other responses but yes, an umbrella policy is worth it. I’ve been a claim specialist at State Farm for a long time. I deal with pretty complex injury claims and litigation. I’ve have insureds with no assets get drug into lawsuits because the other insurance bought out our claim. That means, I offered our policy limits of $50,000. The attorney office for the injured party went to get consent to settle from their insurance company. Well, instead of the other insurance company letting me pay our limits, they sent a check for $50,000 to keep our insured in. Now anything that insurance company pays over the $50,000 she could owe. It’s absolutely ridiculous. Our insured has no assets and on disability.
My advice…get the umbrella policy (PLUP.) State Farm no longer sells the UM/UIM endorsements but having a million extra bucks in coverage could make a huge difference.
Also, sorry if my example above was a little confusing. I tried to explain the best I could!

OK, I was told that in order for me to have an umbrella policy. I would have to have the absolute highest limits on my car insurance. That’s just too expensive with teenage drivers so an umbrella policy that makes no sense for me.?

Yes, you have to carry the required underlying limits, which may vary by insurer. This boils down to how much risk you are comfortable with.

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.
