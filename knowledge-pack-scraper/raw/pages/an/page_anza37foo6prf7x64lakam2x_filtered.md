# Geico insurance rate increases

This was more than a year back (1.5 years to be exact) but something that bugged me and as I was browsing through this sub and some others, maybe I’ve gotten some clarity. Back then, my car insurance rates jumped from around $700 for 6 months to $2300 in the next quote. There was no change in circumstances (address, accidents, credit, what you will) so naturally I was perplexed. I’d called the agent to drop and there was no retention effort. It felt a bit odd. I’ve worked in credit risk and know how these models function to an extent and couldn’t explain it. A couple weeks ago I was talking to a neighbor who works at the DMV and apparently geico almost completely moved out of the zip code. It’s not even a high accident/ crime/ weather vagaries zip code so it’s still a mystery why. I’ve been insured with progressive ever since and I know of no complaints regarding the price of insurance or the lack of it (we have a bunch of providers) in our area. I know no one can really answer the question but maybe some industry insiders have info that I lack? Is the competition (and thus pricing) just not making it profitable enough?
