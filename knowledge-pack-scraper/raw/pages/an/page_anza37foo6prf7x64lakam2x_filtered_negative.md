1. your friend at the dmv is talking out their ass and have no idea about zip codes and rates.
2. rates are filed and justified with the state insurance department. They can’t just charge whatever they want.
3. do you drive a [Hyundai](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Hyundai+insurance+rates&cId=eb875b7f-ad6c-4228-8a73-0648df390b02&iId=f8ac3dad-854d-4137-a9ab-604094ebbaf9)?

I’m pretty sure she didn’t run a statistical analysis but she has no reason to just completely make something up about a company she has no stake in. As for justification, I mean every regulated industry has to justify their rates on paper but the state department isn’t pouring over every rate. I don’t drive a Hyundai. And it isn’t about my rates. I know individual rates can be quirky but I was just wondering whether it’s common practice to have include entire areas for large rate hikes.

Almost every state has a [Department of Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=state+Department+of+Insurance&cId=2695336a-5a16-410f-87c7-8d68465ccfba&iId=d2f419da-1eeb-47da-8586-10457a4a1349) that does exactly that. It is probably the most heavily state scrutinized industry out there. Someone at the DMV does not see or record rates. All they see is if you have insurance or not. They might hear people complaining about rates but that is everyone and every company. Glad you found cheaper rates.

DMV neighbor just wants to look like a know-it-all.
This is what I do for a living - set rates based on various factors.
The [departments of insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=state+departments+of+insurance+rate+filings&cId=94e161fe-73fb-4fa7-9389-e2ff83c92a19&iId=190b92a8-d5e9-46ff-8791-be64809cffba) absolutely do pore over rates, every single factor.
You can look up GEICO’s rate filings on your state’s department of insurance web site.

Insurers will sometimes give you the “go away” rate if they’re not wanting to continue business in a particular zip code. It could be your vehicle or your risk profile & many other reasons. I can tell you a year and a half ago Geico was losing money in several states and struggling to recover from [Covid](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+companies+Covid+losses&cId=393e6b11-4420-4a1c-bdda-4dec98078ae3&iId=e3594a1c-6cdf-4e9b-9713-724caf3dc029). In turn, last year they laid off tenured & extremely talented employees by the thousands & replaced them with lower paying, un-vetted staff. It is not a company that cares about its customers or employees anymore and has now turned a record underwriting profit because of it

Geico didn't pull out of your area, geico hasn't pulled out of anything. As alluded by someone else, that was the "we don't want you anymore unless you pay this insane rate" renewal. There was no effort to retain because they were tightening their insurance books and there also was pretty much no retention team anymore. Customer service was basically told just let it go. How do I know? I used to work at the hell hole.

The increase in your Geico insurance rates likely comes from a combination of internal company policies and external market conditions rather than any specific change in your personal circumstances. By exploring different insurance providers and keeping up to date with the insurance market in your area, you can discover better coverage options that align with your needs and budget.

Or it could just come from a plain ole lack of greed and the fact that an insurance company can raise rates when they want to. Just left Geico after 26 years and no claims went to another company.. my b monthly bill has dropped almost 30 $

Another thing to consider is that the industry as a whole has seen rate increases the past 4-5 years. We are in a hard market for insurance due to all the storm activity. Also your individual claim can effect your rates but from what I've seen most have been industry wide just due to all of the storm damages we have been getting lately. Now for your case it sounds like they're trying to shed policies in that area. Maybe too much exposure or they want to get out of that line of insurance in the state/area.
And for the pricing/compensation. Most insurance companies have been pretty tight the past 2-3 years due to the large number of storm losses and being over-saturated in certain areas.

This makes a whole lot of sense. We are an area that used to historically get hit by storms but haven’t been in the last few years (maybe climate change?) and if Geico is tightening overall risk exposure, it’d make sense to avoid our and adjacent areas completely irrespective of individual risk. Thanks!

Chase internally calls it a “hard opt out” they don’t want you as a customer and Jack your rates up very high. They make it hard for you to not opt out of using Chase.
Common pricing practice. Met Life tripled my home insurance for no reason. It turns out they had too many policies my zip cod and jacked rates my zip code I hopes people will opt out of Met Life. A win-win either you leave or pay huge rates

It is underwriting driven. In my case the MetLife home insurance portfolio was sold to Farmers Insurance. Once combined they had too much policies my zip code. So you double rates and hope customers drop off.

It sounds like GEICO stopped doing business in your zip code altogether, and maybe in certain parts of your city. However, given the size that some zip codes can reach in the U.S. (the largest zip code is over 10,000 square miles, I think it's presumptive to say the area isn't a high accident zip code. Based on what you presented here, GEICO increased their rates so you and other residents in your zip code would go elsewhere.

It’s not a super large zip code as the city itself isn’t that large. But I think you’re right. I’m just curious why companies would not simply not renew instead of jacking up rates?

More money for them if you’re willing to pay the crazy rate. They can also only non renew for specific reasons as dictated by your DOI.

For those who choose to pay the increased rates, GEICO would make money from insuring them. It also gives them some retention of standing insureds.

GEICO did not pull out of your area. GEICO charged a rate commensurate with the risk the area posed in insurance, using data, and that rate was filed and approved by the insurance commissioner for your area.
It just happened to be a really high rate for you, and maybe others, as compared to your rates at other companies and their filed rates for your risk group in your area.
That's how companies "pull out" of an area. They charge rate consistent with the losses they want to get away from, and stop quoting new policies to anyone for awhile in that zip code until things come back into balance. Those are two of many ways they can deal with loss ratios that are off the charts.

This makes sense but as an industry outsider I’m not fully getting it. In no way I’m challenging what you said but I’m actually curious to understand this. So a particular firm can justify imposing higher rates across board than another? What’s the regulation(s) based on? What do they regulate? I’m guessing that companies can impose any profit margin they like to justify rates under free market laws and as long as rate increases aren’t arbitrary, they’re fine? Or am I missing something?

In the US, regulation of insurance happens at the state level. Each state will have a department of insurance or some subdivision of another department that deals with insurance.
What and how much they regulate depends on the state, line of business, commercial/personal insurance, etc. but what’s relevant here is that they generally have broad authority to regulate the rates each company files that they use to determine premiums. Rate regulation on personal lines tends to be pretty strict, especially for personal auto because it’s usually compulsory.
You can think of premium as being made up of loss costs, expenses, and profit. Regulators will pay attention to all three of these pieces when deciding whether to approve a rate.
Loss costs are just what the name says - the cost of the loss. The expected aggregate loss cost (how likely will the loss occur x how big will it be when it does) typically comes from large industry data sources to produce credible estimates of loss. (The antitrust/monopoly concerns around this necessary feature of the industry is a reason why it’s so highly regulated) Companies might have differing experience from the industry for certain classes of risk based on their underwriting criteria and they will adjust those loss costs to reflect that.
Regulators will also look at expenses and profit to make sure that they are reasonable. If a company has much higher expenses than the industry they had better be doing something like extra risk management or the best service around to justify that. Sometimes states will directly regulate profit margins by restricting the margins the companies can use, but a lot of the time the limiting factor there is competition.
Insurers have to prove to the regulators that each rate they charge for each risk class is not too high, not too low (risk of insolvency and inability to pay claims), and that the differences between rates for different risks are based on characteristics of those risks and are not arbitrary or unfairly discriminatory.
