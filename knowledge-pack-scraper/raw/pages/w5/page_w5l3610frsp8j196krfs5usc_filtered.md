Uninsured Motorist Coverage for an IL Hit-and-Run | Staver

 

Car accidents are all terrible and inconvenient, but a hit and run accident may be one of the worst types of car collisions. Someone damages your vehicle, possibly injuring you, and then drives away leaving you with all of the consequences. In other accidents when another driver is at fault, you can contact their insurer to try and recover. But in a [hit and run accident](https://www.chicagolawyer.com/car-accident-lawyer/hit-and-run-accident/), there is no other driver to gather insurance information from. You are stuck looking to your own insurance to help you.

[Do you have a case](/do-i-have-a-case/)? If you were involved in a hit and run accident and now you don’t know how you’ll recover, contact the attorneys of [Staver Accident Injury Lawyers, P.C.](https://www.chicagolawyer.com/) at [(312) 827-6392](tel:312-827-6392 "Call Staver Accident Injury Lawyers, P.C.") right away.

### Required Insurance Coverage in Illinois May Help

In Illinois, you are required to carry liability and property damage in case you hurt someone else or damage a vehicle in a car accident. These policies are not meant to fix your own car or pay for your own medical expenses. That means all you have left is the uninsured motorist coverage you’re also required to buy. But will your uninsured motorist coverage apply to the damages associated with a hit and run accident? Yes, many uninsured motorist policies cover hit and runs.

The purpose of uninsured motorist coverage is to cover your medical or property expenses – or both – when you are hurt in an accident that is not your fault. This situation normally arises when you are hit by another person who stays at the scene of the accident but turns out to [not have auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-do-i-find-out-if-a-car-has-auto-insurance-coverage/). However, a hit and run is just another type of accident in which you are hurt without being the cause of the damage and injuries.

However, exactly what and how much is covered by your uninsured motorist coverage depends on your specific policy. Illinois requires uninsured motorist personal injury coverage specifically. Carrying property damage coverage is optional.

Your policy limit also matters. You may have property and physical expenses above and beyond your uninsured motorist coverage policy limit. In this case, you will need to cover your additional expenses out of pocket.
