Since rates can vary significantly between companies, it’s a good idea to [**compare car insurance quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) from multiple insurers that offer non-standard coverage.
* Teen drivers are at the highest risk of getting into an accident.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-1)
Auto coverage can be downright tricky for high-risk drivers. Some insurers might not sell non-standard policies in your state or could deny you coverage. [**Non-standard insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/bad-driving-record/) is for drivers in your situation, although you’ll likely pay more than drivers with lower risk profiles.
While 14% of drivers in the U.S. didn’t have insurance in 2022, according to the Insurance Research Council, going without coverage isn’t an option in most states. In every state but New Hampshire, drivers must have at least a minimum amount of [**liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/cheap-liability-only-insurance/). And if you lease or finance your vehicle, your leasing or lending company will require you to have [**full coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/).

* **How we chose the best car insurance for high-risk drivers**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent 350 hours developing the [**IQ (Insurify Quality) Score**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. Criteria are weighted by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
* **Get quotes from non-standard auto insurance companies.** If standard insurers won’t cover you, compare non-standard prices and coverage options to find the [**most affordable car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/).
High-risk drivers are generally more likely to file auto insurance claims. An insurance company might give you this label if you have a history of [**at-fault accidents**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), speeding tickets, or [**DUIs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/) on your driving record. But insurers can label someone with a clean record as high-risk based on non-driving factors, like being a teen driver or having poor credit.

[**Teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) with little driving experience fall into the high-risk group. Older adults can, too — drivers 70 and older are more likely to have a fatal accident than middle-aged drivers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-2)
[**Poor credit**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/) is linked to a higher probability that you’ll file a claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-3) This increases your risk rating in the eyes of insurers.

It can also reduce the number of points on your license (if you live in a state that uses the point system), leading to cheaper premiums. Here’s why: Insurance companies use points to gauge how risky you are as a driver. For example, if you take an approved driver improvement course, New Jersey can take up to three points off your driving record,[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-4) while Michigan lets you avoid points after a ticket by taking a course.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-5)
Depending on where you live, you might be able to get your traffic ticket erased from your record. This is called “expungement.” States have different rules about the types of offenses that you can expunge and how the process works, but it’s worth looking into, especially if you have an otherwise clean record.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/#cite-6)
Driving safely today won’t change how insurers view you tomorrow. But the more time you put between [**shopping for car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/the-best-and-worst-sites-to-compare-car-insurance-quotes/) and your latest traffic violation, the better. Accidents, tickets, and DUI convictions can affect your car insurance rates for three to seven years.
