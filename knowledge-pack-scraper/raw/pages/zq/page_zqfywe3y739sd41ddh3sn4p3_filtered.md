# What is an SR-22?

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

A state may require a Certificate of Financial Responsibility because of a conviction, major violation or damages caused in an accident.

An SR-22 certifies that an individual has vehicle insurance that meets the state’s minimum [liability](/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) requirements and is needed to maintain driving privileges. The Certificate of Financial Responsibility is sometimes known as SR-22 insurance, but it’s important to clarify that it’s not a type of auto insurance. It is a certificate filed with the state to confirm coverage is maintained.

## Why do I need an SR-22?

You may be ordered by the court or mandated by the state to obtain an SR-22. An SR-22 ensures you have enough auto insurance coverage required by the state. The requirement to have an SR-22 is usually due to:

* Multiple traffic offenses
* [DUIs, DWIs](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/the-real-consequences-of-drunk-driving) or other serious [moving violations](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/the-real-costs-of-a-non-moving-or-moving-violation)
* Driver’s license suspension or revocation
* Violations for failure to maintain the mandatory insurance coverage required in your state
* Driving without insurance or a valid driver’s license

## How to get an SR-22

The state will notify you if an SR-22 is required. You will need to contact your insurance company, and they may file the SR-22 form with the state’s DMV. If your insurance provider does not assist with SR-22 filings, you likely will need to find a new provider. An SR-22 fee may be charged and may differ by state. The filing fee usually costs around $25. Additionally, there may be an increase to your [auto insurance premium cost](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/industry-wide-rise-in-auto-insurance-rates).

If you live in Florida or Virginia, certain situations require you to obtain an FR-44 instead of the SR-22. An SR-22 shows you meet the state minimum auto insurance requirements, whereas an FR-44 requires higher liability limits than the minimum limits.

## How long do you need an SR-22?

Terms and requirements vary by state, but generally, you must maintain both the SR-22 and your auto insurance policy for approximately three years. To ensure your SR-22 remains in effect until you have met the requirements for your state, your insurance policy must remain active. If your insurance policy lapses, your insurer is required by law to notify the DMV office. Your license will be suspended until your insurance has been reinstated. Then once you have met your SR-22 obligations for the prescribed amount of time, your SR-22 status will be removed.

[Contact your insurance agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) for more SR-22 information, and to determine the SR-22 and liability insurance requirements in your state. Your insurance agent may be able to assist you in obtaining [auto insurance](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/high-risk-auto-insurance) and the SR-22 filing through an insurance provider in your area.
