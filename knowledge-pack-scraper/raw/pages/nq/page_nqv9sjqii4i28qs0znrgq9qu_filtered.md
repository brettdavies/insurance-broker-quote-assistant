Umbrella insurance is useful for people who have assets and savings that exceed a typical auto or [**home insurance**](/homeowners-insurance/) policy limit. For example, the average net worth of U.S. households increased to more than $1 million in 2023.[[1]](#cite-1) But typical limits are $500,000 for home insurance and $300,000 for [**auto insurance**](/car-insurance/).

Here’s how umbrella insurance can protect your assets and when you should get it.

## What is umbrella insurance?

Umbrella insurance, also called excess [**liability insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/), covers losses you’re responsible for that exceed your policies’ liability limits. When a claim exhausts your underlying — or primary — insurance policies, umbrella insurance protects your assets by paying for additional legal fees or liabilities you owe.[[2]](#cite-2)

This type of coverage differs from other personal insurance policies because it’s a supplementary policy. Umbrella policies require an underlying insurance policy listed on the declarations page; you can’t purchase umbrella insurance as a stand-alone policy.[[2]](#cite-2)

## How does an umbrella insurance policy work?

Umbrella insurance companies typically require you to have an underlying insurance policy before purchasing excess liability coverage. For example, you may need an auto, [**home**](/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), or watercraft insurance policy for the umbrella coverage to supplement.

Then, if someone makes a claim for injuries or property damage against your policy or sues you in excess of your primary policy’s limits, umbrella insurance can cover the excess. And your umbrella insurance only covers additional damages and liability up to its limits.

Umbrella policies usually have at least $1 million in coverage. And it’s often cheaper to purchase an umbrella policy than it would be to purchase $1 million in liability coverage for your home or auto insurance.[[2]](#cite-2)

FOR EXAMPLE

Say you have [**bodily injury liability car insurance coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) with a $300,000 limit and cause an accident that results in $1 million of medical bills for other people. Without umbrella insurance, you’re on the hook for the excess $700,000. With a $1 million limit for umbrella insurance, your auto insurance pays for $300,000 and umbrella insurance pays for the remaining $700,000, plus any legal fees your auto insurance doesn’t cover.

### What does umbrella insurance cover?

Umbrella insurance pays for excess liability, like damages you owe to others. It doesn’t cover your own property damage or medical bills. Examples of what umbrella insurance would pay for include:[[3]](#cite-3)

* Some liability claims your primary insurance won’t pay, such as defamation and libel claims
* Additional damages exceeding the policy limits for injuries or property damage you cause
* Legal fees your primary insurance doesn’t cover

### Umbrella insurance pros and cons

Here are important advantages and disadvantages to consider before buying umbrella insurance.

Pros 

* Can be cheaper than increasing policy limits on underlying insurance
* Doesn’t require a deductible
* Can provide more asset protection than primary insurance

Cons

* You still have to maintain underlying insurance coverage
* Insurers usually only cover existing customers
* Doesn’t cover damage to your property

## Who needs umbrella insurance?

You need umbrella insurance if you have assets that exceed your primary policies’ limits. If someone brings a lawsuit against you with damages that exceed your policy limits, you’re responsible for paying excess costs out of pocket.

If your assets’ value doesn’t exceed your policy limits, you probably don’t need umbrella insurance.

You may also need umbrella insurance if your business or home puts you at a higher risk of claims. For example, [**homeowners with pools**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-that-covers-pools/) and landlords may want umbrella coverage to provide added protection.

## Where to buy umbrella insurance

Many insurance companies require you to have an existing insurance policy with them to purchase umbrella insurance. But some insurers may offer stand-alone umbrella policies.

You can usually purchase an umbrella policy online, but you may have to contact your insurance agent or company to modify your existing policies.

Here are some [**top car insurance companies**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) that offer umbrella coverage.
