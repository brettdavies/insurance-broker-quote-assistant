## Seeking Compensation Beyond Insurance Limits

If you find yourself in a situation where your damages exceed the at-fault driver’s insurance limits, there are steps you can take to seek additional compensation. Here are some options to consider:

* **Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: This optional coverage can help fill the gap if the at-fault driver does not have enough insurance to cover your damages.
* **Personal Injury Lawsuit**: If your injuries meet the “serious injury” threshold, you may be able to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. [Our lawyers](https://888gothurt.com/attorneys/) can help you understand your legal options.
* **Third-Party Claims**: In some cases, other parties may share liability for the accident, allowing you to seek compensation from them as well.

### Understanding the “Serious Injury” Threshold

New York law defines a “serious injury” as one that results in significant impairment or loss of bodily function. This includes:

* Fractures
* Significant disfigurement
* Permanent limitation of use of a body organ or member
* Significant limitation of use of a body function or system
* Injuries preventing you from performing your usual daily activities for at least 90 days in the 180 days following the accident
* Death
* Loss of a fetus

If your injuries meet this threshold, you may be eligible to pursue a personal injury lawsuit against the at-fault driver.

## The Role of Underinsured Motorist Coverage

Underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) is an optional but highly recommended add-on that provides additional protection.If you’re involved in an accident where the at-fault driver’s insurance limits are insufficient, UIM can help bridge the gap between your damages and what the at-fault driver’s insurance will cover.

### The Benefits of UIM Coverage

* **Peace of Mind**: Knowing you have additional coverage can alleviate some stress when driving.
* **Financial Security**: It protects you from significant out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a severe accident.
* **Flexibility**: You can customize your coverage limits to suit your specific needs.
