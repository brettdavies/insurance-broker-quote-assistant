Umbrella insurance is useful for people who have assets and savings that exceed a typical auto or [**home insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) policy limit. For example, the average net worth of U.S. households increased to more than $1 million in 2023.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/umbrella-insurance/#cite-1) But typical limits are $500,000 for home insurance and $300,000 for [**auto insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/).
Umbrella insurance, also called excess [**liability insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/), covers losses you’re responsible for that exceed your policies’ liability limits. When a claim exhausts your underlying — or primary — insurance policies, umbrella insurance protects your assets by paying for additional legal fees or liabilities you owe.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/umbrella-insurance/#cite-2)
This type of coverage differs from other personal insurance policies because it’s a supplementary policy. Umbrella policies require an underlying insurance policy listed on the declarations page; you can’t purchase umbrella insurance as a stand-alone policy.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/umbrella-insurance/#cite-2)
Umbrella insurance companies typically require you to have an underlying insurance policy before purchasing excess liability coverage. For example, you may need an auto, [**home**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), or watercraft insurance policy for the umbrella coverage to supplement.
Umbrella policies usually have at least $1 million in coverage. And it’s often cheaper to purchase an umbrella policy than it would be to purchase $1 million in liability coverage for your home or auto insurance.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/umbrella-insurance/#cite-2)
Say you have [**bodily injury liability car insurance coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) with a $300,000 limit and cause an accident that results in $1 million of medical bills for other people. Without umbrella insurance, you’re on the hook for the excess $700,000. With a $1 million limit for umbrella insurance, your auto insurance pays for $300,000 and umbrella insurance pays for the remaining $700,000, plus any legal fees your auto insurance doesn’t cover.
Umbrella insurance pays for excess liability, like damages you owe to others. It doesn’t cover your own property damage or medical bills. Examples of what umbrella insurance would pay for include:[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/umbrella-insurance/#cite-3)
You may also need umbrella insurance if your business or home puts you at a higher risk of claims. For example, [**homeowners with pools**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-that-covers-pools/) and landlords may want umbrella coverage to provide added protection.

Here are some [**top car insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) that offer umbrella coverage.
