## Illinois Car Insurance Requirements
Drivers in Illinois must meet these [state minimum coverage levels](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/auto-insurance-shopping-guide.html):
* Bodily Injury Liability: $25,000 per person per accident and $50,000 total per accident
* Property Damage Liability: $20,000 per accident
* Uninsured motorist bodily injury: $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
* Underinsured motorist bodily injury: This is a requirement if you purchase higher limits of uninsured motorist bodily injury.
Keep in mind that these are only minimum requirements. The [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/is-it-legal-to-drive-without-insurance) reports that the insurance industry and consumer groups recommend you maintain at least $100,000 of bodily injury liability per person and $300,000 per accident.
Optional coverages are also available, such as uninsured motorist, comprehensive, and collision insurance. Your lender or lessor may require that you have comprehensive and collision insurance until the loan is paid off.
## FAQ
According to our data, the average annual auto insurance premium in Illinois is $1,713. Some of the companies in our rating have lower average rates, while others are higher:
* Travelers: $1,152
* Geico: $1,382
* Country Financial: $1,776
* Auto-Owners: $1,867

* State minimum insurance requirements
* Comprehensive coverage
* Collision coverage
If you can’t find auto insurance coverage in Illinois due to your driving record, see if you qualify for the [Illinois Auto Insurance Plan](https://www.aipso.com/Plan-Sites/Illinois).

* Have been denied coverage within the last 60 days
* Been unable to obtain insurance at rates below what the plan offers
* Have a valid driver's license or be eligible for one
Any agent or broker with a valid auto insurance license can apply on your behalf.
Comparing quotes from insurers is an important step in shopping for coverage, and many auto insurers offer free quotes. Getting a quote is fairly simple, though the process can vary by insurer. Some companies offer online quotes, while others may ask that you contact an agent.
When getting a [car insurance quote](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto), be ready to provide some basic information. This typically includes:
* Personal information (e.g., name, date of birth)
* Address
* Driving history
* Information about other drivers on the policy
* Year, make, and model of your vehicle; vehicle identification number (VIN)
* Information about how the vehicle will be used
* Information about your current coverage, if applicable

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Best Local Car Insurance Companies
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about car insurance companies in Illinois. For our local rating, we analyzed data we collected and evaluated for our National Best Car Insurance rating, including state-specific insurance premiums provided by Quadrant Information Services, survey respondents from Illinois, and state-level auto insurance complaints filed to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for insurers in our rating.
To qualify for the best list in each state, an insurer must have available state-level premium data provided by Quadrant, along with data from at least one of the two following sources: respondents for that insurer in Illinois from our 2025 national best car insurance survey, or be in the top 10 of market share for Private Passenger Auto in Illinois from the 2024 NAIC market share report.
To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual driver profiles.
To get the average annual rate used in our analysis, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers aged 25, 40, and 60 who drive 14,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record. The medium coverage tier refers to $50,000/$100,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible, $50,000 property damage coverage, $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, and any other mandatory coverages a state may require. The rates are for comparative purposes only and should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. Because car insurance rates are based on individual factors, your car insurance rates will differ.
We then normalized the number of complaints for each company in Illinois by reviewing the total direct premiums written for that insurer in Illinois in 2024, generating a NAIC Quotient. If a company in Illinois fell outside of the top 10 in premiums written, a proxy number was used to calculate its quotient.
### **We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the state-level premium (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment. We then applied weights to each of the standardized scores to calculate the overall rating, demonstrating that some aspects of auto insurance are more important than others when making the purchasing decision. With that in mind, we arrived at the following weights:
* State-level Average Premium (40%)
* Survey Responses (20%)
* NAIC Quotient (40%)
We combined the weighted scores and converted the value to the U.S. News Rating on a 5-point scale, with 5.0 being the best possible rating. The U.S. News Rating for each car insurance company allows us to make company comparisons and ratings. The ratings are periodically updated based on the latest information we collect from online sources and surveys.
