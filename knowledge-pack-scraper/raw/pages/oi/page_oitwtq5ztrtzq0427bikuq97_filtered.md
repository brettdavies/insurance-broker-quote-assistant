To find hidden auto insurance discounts, look up your insurance company’s discounts online, check your state’s mandatory discount laws, and contact your insurance agent, or the company’s customer service department. Discounts might be “hidden” in that they are not widely advertised, like a buy-in-advance discount. Similarly, some of the most commonly overlooked auto insurance discounts are [driver monitoring discounts](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-does-telematics-insurance-work-2140714606/), [paid-in-full discounts](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/progressive-paid-in-full-discount-2140703896/), and the [AARP driver safety course discount](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/aarp-driver-safety-course-insurance-discount-2140721893/) because they usually aren’t automatically applied.

Progressive's multi-policy discount is 5% off one of the policies' premiums, on average. Customers can earn the Progressive multi-policy discount by bundling any combination of two or more insurance policies from Progressive, such as auto, home, renters, boat, motorcycle and RV insurance policies.

For example, if you start with home insurance, you can add auto insurance or any other policy at a later date to qualify for Progressive’s multi-policy discount. Just keep in mind that the discount will only appear on one of your policies.

The Progressive multi-policy discount does not require an auto insurance policy. But if you bundle home and auto insurance with Progressive, you could be eligible for a discount that’s twice as large.

## Multi-Policy vs. Multi-Car Discounts From Progressive:

Progressive's multi-policy discount is different from its multi-car discount. The [Progressive multi-car discount](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/progressive-multi-car-discount-2140714202/) allows you to save a maximum of 12% on your auto insurance premium when you insure two or more vehicles with Progressive.

If you don't have more than one car and don't need more than one type of insurance policy, however, Progressive offers [plenty of other discounts](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/progressive-discounts-2140703655/) that could help you reduce the cost of your coverage.
