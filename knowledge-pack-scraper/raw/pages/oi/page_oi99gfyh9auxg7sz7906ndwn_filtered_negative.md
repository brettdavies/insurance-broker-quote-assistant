**NWS meteorologist Matt Bishop, who works at the Fort Worth office, told _Newsweek_:** "We just had a severe thunderstorm watch recently issued, and some of the hail could get as large as tennis ball size in some of these storms. That type of a hailstone if it hits a city can cause millions to even billions of dollars in damage, especially if it encounters a car sales lot with lots of new cars."
