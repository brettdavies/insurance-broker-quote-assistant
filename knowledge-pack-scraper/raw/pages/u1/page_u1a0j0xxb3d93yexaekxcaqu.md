When purchasing a vehicle, one consideration for your budget should be your insurance coverage. In Illinois, drivers must carry a minimum insurance coverage, including [liability for bodily injury](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage, and uninsured motorist bodily injury. These minimum car insurance requirements in Illinois protect you against the law but not against the loss of your vehicle. Let’s explore additional insurance coverage available to help you understand why full coverage car insurance is worth it in Illinois.

## Definition and Components of Full Coverage
Full coverage for car insurance includes the minimum liability requirement plus: 
  * **Comprehensive:** This type of insurance covers damages to your vehicle from noncollision events, such as hail, theft, or hitting a deer.
  * **Collision:** Collision coverage will pay for damages to your vehicle caused by an auto accident.


Other types of insurance you may add to your policy include medical payments coverage/personal injury protection, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, [roadside assistance](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/roadside-assistance/), and rental reimbursement coverage. If you finance your vehicle, the lender may require you to carry collision and comprehensive coverage to protect their investment. Even if you own your vehicle outright, consider carrying full coverage to protect your assets.
## Misconceptions About Full Coverage
While full coverage offers more protection than having no insurance, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll avoid out-of-pocket costs after an accident. Exploring all available options is essential to ensure full protection for you and your loved ones. The coverage and policy limits you choose can have long-lasting financial consequences. When discussing policies with your agent, ask about all necessary coverages and select a deductible you can afford. A slight increase in your monthly premium could help protect your family from severe financial hardship following a car accident.
## Full Coverage Car Insurance in Illinois
In Illinois, full coverage car insurance isn’t legally required but is highly recommended for drivers who want comprehensive protection. Full coverage typically includes liability insurance, collision, and comprehensive coverage, protecting you against damages from accidents, theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. While liability coverage is mandatory in Illinois, full coverage provides added peace of mind, especially if you have a new or financed vehicle. If you choose full coverage, understand the cost implications and evaluate your specific needs to ensure you get the best protection value.
## State Insurance Requirements vs. Full Coverage
All motor vehicles registered and operated in Illinois must carry liability insurance to cover property damage and injuries caused to others in a crash. The minimum required coverage is as follows:
  * $25,000 for injury or death of one person
  * $50,000 for injury or death of multiple people
  * $20,000 for property damage to another person


Drivers must carry their insurance card in their vehicle and present it upon request by law enforcement. Your insurance company will provide this card when your policy is issued or renewed. Penalties for driving without insurance include a minimum fine of $500 for operating an uninsured vehicle. If you drive a vehicle with a suspended registration due to lack of insurance, the fine increases to a minimum of $1,000. These fines are enforced to ensure drivers maintain proper coverage and comply with state insurance laws.
## Cost Considerations for Full Coverage Insurance
Full coverage insurance costs depend on several factors, including your car’s make and model, driving history, and location. Full coverage costs more than minimum liability insurance due to its added protections. However, the additional cost may be relatively low, especially if your car has a high value or you’re financing or leasing it. The cost of full coverage insurance can also vary based on the deductible you choose; higher deductibles often result in lower premiums. It’s crucial to balance the insurance cost with your ability to pay out-of-pocket for repairs or replacements in case of an accident.
## Why Full Coverage Is Worth It
Full coverage insurance provides comprehensive protection for you and your car. It typically includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, ensuring you’re covered for a range of issues. This level of insurance helps cover the cost of repairs or replacement if your car is totaled.
The benefits of full coverage car insurance include invaluable peace of mind and financial security, especially if you own a vehicle worth a significant amount or if you can’t afford to replace your car. However, you might skip full coverage if you can replace your car on your own or don’t drive often.
## Tips To Save Money While Maintaining Full Coverage
Maintaining full coverage insurance can be a smart choice for protection, but it doesn’t have to break the bank. Here are some tips to help you save money while still keeping the coverage you need:
  * **Shop around:** Compare quotes from multiple insurers to find the best deal for your coverage needs.
  * **Bundle policies:** Combine your car insurance with other policies (home, renters, etc.) for a multipolicy discount.
  * **Increase your deductible:** While a higher deductible can lower your premium, ensure it’s an amount you can afford to pay out of pocket in case of a claim.
  * **Maintain a good driving record:** Avoid accidents and traffic violations to keep your rates lower.
  * **Take advantage of discounts:** Many insurers offer discounts for safe driving, low mileage, or installing safety features in your car.
  * **Ask about usage-based insurance:** Some companies offer discounts based on how much you drive, which could save you money if you’re on the road less frequently.
  * **Review your coverage regularly:** Reassess your policy as your car depreciates or if your driving habits change.
