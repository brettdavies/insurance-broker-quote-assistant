* **Comprehensive:** This type of insurance covers damages to your vehicle from noncollision events, such as hail, theft, or hitting a deer.
* **Collision:** Collision coverage will pay for damages to your vehicle caused by an auto accident.
Other types of insurance you may add to your policy include medical payments coverage/personal injury protection, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, [roadside assistance](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/roadside-assistance/), and rental reimbursement coverage. If you finance your vehicle, the lender may require you to carry collision and comprehensive coverage to protect their investment. Even if you own your vehicle outright, consider carrying full coverage to protect your assets.
* **Shop around:** Compare quotes from multiple insurers to find the best deal for your coverage needs.
* **Bundle policies:** Combine your car insurance with other policies (home, renters, etc.) for a multipolicy discount.
* **Increase your deductible:** While a higher deductible can lower your premium, ensure it’s an amount you can afford to pay out of pocket in case of a claim.
* **Maintain a good driving record:** Avoid accidents and traffic violations to keep your rates lower.
* **Take advantage of discounts:** Many insurers offer discounts for safe driving, low mileage, or installing safety features in your car.
* **Ask about usage-based insurance:** Some companies offer discounts based on how much you drive, which could save you money if you’re on the road less frequently.
* **Review your coverage regularly:** Reassess your policy as your car depreciates or if your driving habits change.
