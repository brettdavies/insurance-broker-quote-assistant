### Age
[**Your age**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/) will affect how much you pay for auto coverage.
[**Teenagers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) pay the most expensive car insurance rates in Texas on average because they’re high-risk drivers. Data shows that drivers between the ages of 16 and 19 are more likely to have accidents than any other age group.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive-in-texas/#cite-2) Once drivers reach their mid-20s, car insurance rates start to decrease with age for people who maintain a clean driving record. This trend continues until drivers reach age 70, after which [**senior drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) may face slight rate increases.
Below, you can see the average cost of liability insurance and full-coverage car insurance in Texas for drivers in different age brackets.

### Location
Where you live in Texas, down to your ZIP code, can affect car insurance costs significantly due to location-based factors like population density, average car repair costs, severe weather risks, medical expenses, and car theft rates. For example, drivers might pay lower premiums in ZIP codes with less crime.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive-in-texas/#cite-3)
The largest cities also tend to have the highest rates. Houston is the most expensive Texas city for car insurance, followed by Beaumont, Dallas, and Austin, according to Insurify data. A few of the cheapest cities for car insurance in Texas include El Paso, Lubbock, and Fort Worth, which have slightly lower populations.
Below, you can find the average monthly car insurance rates for drivers in different Texas cities.

### Driving record
Insurance companies pay close attention to driving history when calculating premiums. Texas drivers with a clean record usually pay the lowest rates for car insurance because they pose less of a risk to insurers. People with accidents, speeding tickets, and [**other traffic violations**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/bad-driving-record/) demonstrate a greater risk to their auto insurers and pay higher premiums.
### Make and model of your car
The type of vehicle you drive will influence your car insurance premium. New cars, luxury cars, and sports cars have higher values and repair costs and tend to cost more to insure. Used cars and older models that have already depreciated typically have lower insurance premiums. Many insurance companies offer savings when you insure a car that has anti-lock brakes, an anti-theft system, and other safety features.
The Ford F-150 is one of the most popular vehicles in Texas.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive-in-texas/#cite-4) On average, it costs $185 per month to insure a Ford F-Series truck with full-coverage insurance in the U.S.
Some of the cheapest vehicles to insure in the U.S. include the Subaru Forester, Subaru Outback, Honda Odyssey, and Dodge Grand Caravan, with average monthly rates ranging between $147 and $158. To compare, some of the most expensive cars to insure are the Infiniti Q50, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Challenger, which have average monthly premiums ranging between $273 and $296.

## Why car insurance is so expensive FAQs
While Texas has high average car insurance rates, the amount you’ll pay depends on a number of factors. Here’s some additional information about the cost of car insurance in Texas that can be helpful as you shop for an insurance policy.
  * ### How much will auto insurance prices rise this year?
Texas car insurance premiums are projected to increase by 23% in 2024, based on Insurify data. The state average premium for full-coverage policies in January 2024 was $2,405. In June 2024, the average premium increased to $2,672 per year.
  * ### Why does car insurance cost so much?
Car insurance can be expensive in Texas for various reasons, including the number of claims filed, the cost of auto repairs in the state, and inflation. Additionally, each driver poses a certain amount of risk to their insurer. Drivers who pose the most risk pay higher rates than low-risk drivers.
  * ### Does car insurance ever get cheaper?
Car insurance typically gets cheaper for Texas drivers over time. Young drivers — including teens and drivers younger than 25 — pay the highest rates because they lack driving experience. Premiums tend to decrease steadily after that. You might also be able to reduce your premium with discounts or bundles.
  * ### Does credit score affect car insurance?
In Texas, insurance companies can use credit-based insurance scores to determine premiums. Drivers with good credit histories usually pay lower rates than drivers with poor credit histories.


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible


Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.
