The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) requires that any structure built or modified here is to comply with specific building codes or be designed by a windstorm engineer, and be inspected and certified by a qualified inspector in accordance with TDI guidelines.  
   
The requirements for windstorm and hail insurance coverage apply only to structures located in areas designated as a “catastrophe area” by the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI).  
   
To purchase a policy from the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA), most homes and properties are required to have a certificate of compliance that confirms the structure meets relevant building codes and is capable of withstanding high winds and hail.
