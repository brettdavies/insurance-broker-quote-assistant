## Check This Map for Sinkhole Incidents in Each Florida County
This map of subsidence incident reports was created by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Learn more about sinkholes at [floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes](https://floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes).
The interactive map above provides a county-by-county look at known sinkhole incidents across the state. Use the dropdown menu in the search field to select your county and see where sinkholes have been reported.
## Find Out If There Are Sinkholes Near You in Florida
Sinkholes are a natural part of Florida’s landscape, but that doesn’t make them any less concerning for homeowners, businesses, and municipalities. While some sinkholes are small and relatively harmless, others can cause significant damage to property and infrastructure.
## Why This Map Matters
* Florida leads the nation in sinkhole activity due to its limestone foundation and underground water movement.
* Knowing whether your area has documented sinkholes can help you make informed decisions about property ownership, insurance, and safety.
* If you notice cracks in your walls, uneven floors, or sinking ground, it may be time to seek a professional inspection.
## What to Do if You Suspect a Sinkhole
* **Document changes**: Take photos of any cracks, depressions, or unusual settling.
* **Contact your local county office**: They may have updated geological or sinkhole reports.
* **Schedule a professional inspection**: Early detection can help prevent costly repairs.
