### Driving record

Insurance companies pay close attention to driving history when calculating premiums. Texas drivers with a clean record usually pay the lowest rates for car insurance because they pose less of a risk to insurers. People with accidents, speeding tickets, and [**other traffic violations**](/car-insurance/bad-driving-record/) demonstrate a greater risk to their auto insurers and pay higher premiums.

### Make and model of your car

The type of vehicle you drive will influence your car insurance premium. New cars, luxury cars, and sports cars have higher values and repair costs and tend to cost more to insure. Used cars and older models that have already depreciated typically have lower insurance premiums. Many insurance companies offer savings when you insure a car that has anti-lock brakes, an anti-theft system, and other safety features.

The Ford F-150 is one of the most popular vehicles in Texas.[[4]](#cite-4) On average, it costs $185 per month to insure a Ford F-Series truck with full-coverage insurance in the U.S.

Some of the cheapest vehicles to insure in the U.S. include the Subaru Forester, Subaru Outback, Honda Odyssey, and Dodge Grand Caravan, with average monthly rates ranging between $147 and $158. To compare, some of the most expensive cars to insure are the Infiniti Q50, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Challenger, which have average monthly premiums ranging between $273 and $296.

## How to lower your car insurance rate

Texas car insurance premiums are increasing, but you can take steps to reduce your insurance costs. Use these strategies to help lower your car insurance premium:

* **Choose an insurer that offers discounts.** Most Texas insurance companies offer [**car insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/)that can help you save money on auto insurance. Every insurer offers different discounts, but you can often find discounts for getting good grades in school, having no prior insurance claims, taking a defensive driving course, insuring multiple cars, and signing up for automatic payments.
* **Bundle your policies.** You can sometimes save a significant amount on insurance when you[**bundle two or more insurance products**](/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/)from the same company. For instance, if you purchase car insurance with home insurance or renters insurance, you could earn a discount on one or both premiums.
* **Select higher deductibles.** Some car insurance policies, like collision insurance, require a deductible that you pay out of pocket when you file insurance claims. Choosing a[**higher deductible**](/car-insurance/coverage/high-deductible/)will lower your insurance premium.
* **Shop around and compare rates.** Car insurance companies charge different rates, even for the same type and amount of auto coverage. [**Comparing personalized quotes**](/car-insurance/) from several insurers is the best way to find the most affordable policy for your situation.

## Why car insurance is so expensive FAQs

While Texas has high average car insurance rates, the amount you’ll pay depends on a number of factors. Here’s some additional information about the cost of car insurance in Texas that can be helpful as you shop for an insurance policy.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Texas car insurance premiums are projected to increase by 23% in 2024, based on Insurify data. The state average premium for full-coverage policies in January 2024 was $2,405. In June 2024, the average premium increased to $2,672 per year.

Car insurance can be expensive in Texas for various reasons, including the number of claims filed, the cost of auto repairs in the state, and inflation. Additionally, each driver poses a certain amount of risk to their insurer. Drivers who pose the most risk pay higher rates than low-risk drivers.

Car insurance typically gets cheaper for Texas drivers over time. Young drivers — including teens and drivers younger than 25 — pay the highest rates because they lack driving experience. Premiums tend to decrease steadily after that. You might also be able to reduce your premium with discounts or bundles.

In Texas, insurance companies can use credit-based insurance scores to determine premiums. Drivers with good credit histories usually pay lower rates than drivers with poor credit histories.
