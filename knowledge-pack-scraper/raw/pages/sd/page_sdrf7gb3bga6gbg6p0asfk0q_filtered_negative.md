In email correspondence with _Sportico_, State Farm reiterated that it will not advertise in the Super Bowl, adding that it “will not have a presence in, and/or around, the game itself.” The company also said even before the wildfires compelled the decision on the Super Bowl commercial, it did not have any other activations planned for this year’s game.
The bulk of Super Bowl ad inventory was sold in August, but demand remained strong after Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced that the spots sold out in a third quarter investor call. According to _Variety_, [several other sponsors](https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2025/super-bowl-ad-prices-8-million-fox-1234825796/) besides State Farm asked to pull their ads in light of the wildfires. With the sudden openings and high demand from advertisers, Fox was able to sell at least 10 commercials appearing during the Super Bowl for more than $8 million.
