The average renters insurance cost in the U.S. is $148 per year, or about $12 per month, according to NerdWallet’s latest rate analysis. We based this estimate on a policy for a hypothetical 30-year-old tenant with $30,000 in personal property coverage, $100,000 in liability coverage and a $500 deductible.

While the nationwide average is a useful baseline, renters insurance rates vary based on where you live and how much coverage you need.

## What’s included in renters insurance rates?

Most renters insurance policies include four basic types of coverage:

[Personal property](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance). If someone steals your belongings or a fire destroys them, this part of your policy would pay to replace them, minus your [deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/insurance-deductible). (A deductible is the part of a claim you have to pay.) Renters insurance typically covers only specific events named in the policy.

[Liability](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/renters-liability-insurance). This part of your policy covers you if you’re found responsible for someone else’s injuries or property damage. This could include incidents like a guest getting hurt in your home or your dog biting a stranger. (Note that some insurers won’t cover certain dog breeds. For example, see [what pit bull owners need to know about insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-insurance-pit-bull).)

[Medical payments](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners). Often grouped with liability, this coverage will pay for a guest’s injuries on your property without requiring anyone to be found at fault.

[Loss of use](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage). This coverage pays if you need to relocate while your home is being repaired after a disaster listed in your policy. For example, it would cover hotel or restaurant bills beyond your normal expenses while you’re waiting to move back home.

## What determines your renters insurance cost?

Every insurance company calculates renters insurance rates a bit differently, but these are the most common factors that could influence how much you pay.

### Where you live

If your home is in a region prone to natural disasters like wildfires or tornadoes, you’ll probably pay more for renters insurance. You may also pay more if your neighborhood has a high crime rate or your home doesn’t have a fire station or hydrant nearby.

### Your previous claims

If you’ve filed claims in the past three to five years, even with a different company, your current insurer will likely see you as a greater risk. For example, a theft claim on your record can raise your premium about 19%, a NerdWallet analysis found.

| Claims history | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No recent claims | $148 | $12 |
| Recent theft claim | $176 | $15 |

### Your credit history

Renters insurance companies don’t check your FICO credit score, but in most states they do look at your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/credit-based-insurance-score), a similar measure. Studies have shown that those with poor credit are more likely to file claims, so insurers tend to charge them more.

On average, renters with poor credit pay about 65% more than those with good credit, a NerdWallet analysis found.

| Credit history | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Good credit | $148 | $12 |
| Poor credit | $245 | $20 |

Using credit to set homeowners, renters, condo and mobile home insurance prices is not allowed in California, Maryland and Massachusetts.

### Your dog

Because renters insurance typically includes liability coverage for dog bites, owning larger dogs or breeds considered more aggressive may cost you more. Some insurers may not cover certain breeds at all.

### Your coverage limits

The more coverage you need, the more your policy will cost. For example, a family renting a three-bedroom house will almost always pay more to insure their stuff than a single person in a studio apartment across town. Below, see a sample of how your renters premium could change based on how much personal property coverage you need.

| Personal property coverage limit | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $10,000 | $111 | $9 |
| $30,000 | $148 | $12 |
| $50,000 | $188 | $16 |
| $70,000 | $235 | $20 |
| $100,000 | $304 | $25 |

Raising your liability limit can also affect your premium, though it costs less than increasing your personal property limit. For example, it costs only $1 more a month on average to add an extra $200,000 of liability coverage.

| Liability coverage limit | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $100,000 | $148 | $12 |
| $300,000 | $160 | $13 |

One common upgrade you may want to add to your renters policy is [replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) for your personal belongings. With this coverage, your policy will pay enough for you to buy brand-new replacements for items that are stolen or destroyed. Many standard renters policies cover your stuff on an [actual cash value](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value) basis, which means your insurer will pay only what your item was worth at the time of the incident.

Imagine a fire destroys the kitchen table and chairs you bought 10 years ago. With replacement cost coverage, your insurer would pay enough for you to buy a brand-new dining set rather than reducing your payout because the furniture has lost value over the years.

Upgrading to replacement cost coverage will raise your premium by about 14%, according to NerdWallet’s rate analysis.

| Type of personal property coverage | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual cash value | $148 | $12 |
| Replacement cost | $168 | $14 |

» MORE: [Actual cash value vs. replacement cost: What's the difference?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost)

### Your deductible

You can lower your premium by choosing a higher deductible — the amount you pay toward a claim before your insurer covers the rest. The difference in premium could be relatively small, though, and might not be worth it if you’d have trouble covering the larger deductible in an emergency.

| Deductible | Average annual cost | Average monthly cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $500 | $148 | $12 |
| $1,000 | $135 | $11 |

## How to lower your renters insurance cost

There are a variety of ways to save on your renters insurance, but these are the most common discounts.

Multipolicy. If you buy both renters insurance and another policy (such as auto insurance) with the same company, you may get a discount on one or both policies. This is known as "bundling." See the [best auto and renters insurance bundles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-auto-renters-insurance-bundles).

Claim-free. Renters with no recent claims are often eligible for discounts. “Recent” claims are typically within the past three to five years, depending on the company.

Safety and security devices. Many insurers will lower your rate if your home has burglar alarms, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems or other devices designed to reduce the risk of fire or theft.

Depending on your insurer, you could also save money by choosing paperless billing or autopay, or paying your policy in full rather than in monthly installments. Nonsmokers may also pay less.

Your best bet is to shop around. We recommend getting quotes from at least three different companies to make sure you’re getting the best possible deal.

Methodology

To find the average cost of renters insurance in the U.S., NerdWallet calculated the median rate for 30-year-old tenants from multiple insurance companies in every ZIP code across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. We also looked at median rates by city and state. Sample tenants were nonsmokers with good credit living in a two-bedroom apartment. They had a $500 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $30,000 in personal property coverage.
* $100,000 in liability coverage.
* $10,000 in additional living expenses coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

We used the same assumptions for all other renter profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for renters with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we used only rates for “good” credit.
* For renters with a higher deductible, we raised the deductible from $500 to $1,000.
* For renters with higher or lower personal property coverage limits, we raised the limit to $50,000, $70,000 or $100,000, or lowered it to $10,000.
* For renters with a history of claims, we added a single theft claim to their record.
* For renters with replacement cost coverage, we added this to their policy.

Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.
