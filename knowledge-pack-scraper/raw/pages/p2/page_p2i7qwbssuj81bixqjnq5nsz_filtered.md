FEATURED PROJECT

[Let's Explore Pricing](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Q9V62BL)

Many things determine the price you pay when you hit the checkout line or complete an online sale, and not all of them are above board. Consumer Reports is investigating potential predatory pricing tactics, which can be hard to uncover, and we need your input to get a clearer picture of the shopping landscape.

[Data Requests](https://action.consumerreports.org/data_requests_mn_or_de)

Residents of Oregon, Minnesota or Delaware are covered by a provision in your state data privacy law that allows you to know which third parties a company is selling your data to. If you are a resident of those states, we need your help!

[Fight for Fair Internet](https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/)

As we push for more affordable and fair broadband for all, more than 50,000 consumers took internet speed tests, told us about their service, and shared 22,000 internet bills for an in-depth examination of our nation’s broadband service. Our findings: hard evidence of arbitrary pricing for the same internet service; confusing and mysterious billing tactics; and having a choice of internet providers lowers consumers’ costs.

[Protecting Your Personal Data](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-study-finds-significant-obstacles-to-exercising-california-privacy-rights/)

Consumer Reports helped pass a groundbreaking law in California that gives residents the right to access, delete, and stop the sale of their personal information online. We used our findings from consumer feedback about the law to create Permission Slip, a new app that allows consumers to easily ask companies to stop sharing their data.

[Ending Hidden Fees](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-investigation-finds-cable-company-imposed-fees-add-nearly-450-to-customer-bills-each-year/)

Thousands of Community Reporters provided their cable TV bills to help analyze the long list of hidden fees on customers' bills. This evidence spurred Congress to pass a law requiring cable companies tell consumers exactly what they'll pay upfront – with no hidden fees – before signing a contract.

[Credit Checkup](https://action.consumerreports.org/creditcheckup)

Based on more than 7,000 consumers checking their credit reports, Consumer Reports discovered that credit reports are rife with errors and and that credit bureaus sometimes charge unfairly for services. We’re fighting for permanent free access to credit reports so errors can be caught and fixed.
