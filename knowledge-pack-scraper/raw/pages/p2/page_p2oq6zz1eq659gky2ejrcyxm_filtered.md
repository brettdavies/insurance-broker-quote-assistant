## **Progressive rating:** 3.2 out of 5 stars

Progressive is one of the biggest names in auto insurance with a wide range of coverage options and perks that appeal to all kinds of drivers, including three types of accident forgiveness.

But its customer satisfaction scores consistently rank below average, and Progressive’s auto insurance rates tend to run a little higher than average. Still, Progressive is worth considering if you want a highly customizable policy or like the idea of getting rewarded for safe driving.

## Types of coverage Progressive offers

You’ll generally find these types of car insurance at Progressive:

* **Liability:** This part of your policy covers damage or injuries you cause to other people or property in an accident.
* **Comprehensive:** This coverage pays for damages not caused by a collision — like theft, vandalism, or weather damage.
* **Collision:** If you hit another vehicle or object, this coverage helps repair or replace your car.
* **Uninsured/underinsured motorist:** UM and UIM coverage helps pay for some of the cost if you're hit by a driver with little or no insurance.
* **Medical payments:** Medpay helps pay medical bills for you and your passengers, no matter who caused the accident.
* **Personal injury protection (PIP):** PIP is similar to MedPay, but it adds lost wages and other extras. It’s required in some states.
* **Loan or lease payoff:** If your car is totaled, this helps cover what you still owe on your loan or lease.
* **Rental car reimbursement:** Pays for a rental car while your vehicle is getting worked on after a covered accident.
* **Auto roadside assistance:** This covers things like towing, dead batteries, and flat tires if you’re stranded.
* **Trip interruption:** If your car breaks down more than 100 miles from home, this coverage could reimburse you for lodging, food, and transportation.
* **Vehicle protection:** This is an optional add-on for newer cars that covers mechanical breakdowns, cosmetic dents, and lost keys.
* **Custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage:** CPE covers after-market upgrades like custom rims, paint jobs, or a new stereo system.
* **Rideshare coverage:** You’ll want this coverage if you drive for apps like Uber or DoorDash.
* **Deductible Savings Bank:** This coverage lowers your deductible by $50 every six months you go without a claim or violation.
* **Pet injury coverage:** If your pet gets hurt in a car accident, Progressive could cover up to $1,000 in vet bills. This perk is automatically included in every policy with collision coverage.

### Does Progressive offer accident forgiveness?

Yes. In fact, Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness, but each works a little differently:

* **Small Accident Forgiveness** comes standard for new customers in most states. It keeps your rate from going up after your first claim of $500 or less.
* **Large Accident Forgiveness** is part of Progressive’s Loyalty Rewards program. If you’ve been a customer for at least five years and accident-free for the last three (in most states), your rate won’t increase after a larger at-fault accident.
* **Additional Accident Forgiveness** can also be purchased, which applies once per policy period, regardless of the accident amount.

Keep in mind, however, that these perks apply per policy, not per driver. So once they're used, future at-fault accidents could still affect your rate.

### Does Progressive auto insurance include emergency roadside assistance?

Yes. Progressive’s roadside assistance includes 24/7 towing within a 15-mile radius, jump-starts, flat tire help, fuel delivery, and lock-out assistance. Trip interruption coverage is also available to those with roadside assistance, which will pay up to $500 for food, lodging, or transportation if you’re stranded at least 100 miles from home.

## How much does Progressive auto insurance cost?

Progressive car insurance is generally more expensive than average, compared to other insurers. This includes both full and basic coverage — with the average cost of full coverage at $205 per month and the average cost of basic coverage at $122.

At Yahoo Finance, we recommend bumping up to full coverage if your budget allows. Every state has its own minimum car insurance requirements, but basic policies usually just include liability coverage. This means they only pay for the other driver’s damages if you cause an accident. They won’t help if your car gets wrecked, stolen, or flooded.

*Learn more:* [*Minimum car insurance requirements in all 50 U.S. states*](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/state-minimum-car-insurance-233457321.html)

### Average auto insurance costs for full coverage

A full coverage policy with Progressive runs about $205 a month. This is $15 above the national average.

### Average auto insurance costs for basic coverage

The average monthly cost of basic coverage with Progressive is $9 above the national average.

### Progressive car insurance discounts

Progressive offers 13 different auto insurance discounts. Here’s what you might qualify for:

* **Multi-policy discount:** This discount saves you money when you bundle your auto insurance with another Progressive policy, like home, renters, or motorcycle.
* **Multi-car discount:** You could get a price break if you insure more than one vehicle on the same policy.
* **Continuous insurance discount:** If you switch to Progressive, you could get a discount just for having insurance previously with another company.
* **Teen driver discount:** Adding a teen to your policy could qualify you for a discount.
* **Good student discount:** If you have a full-time student on your policy with a B average or better, you could get a minimum 5% discount.
* **Distant student discount:** If your student lives more than 100 miles from home without a car and is age 22 or under, you’ll save here too.
* **Homeowner discount:** Just owning a home (even if it’s not insured with Progressive) can lower your car insurance rate.
* **Online quote discount:** Progressive says that customers save around 7% on average by starting a quote online, even if they finish purchasing a policy over the phone with an agent.
* **Sign online discount:** If you're comfortable signing your policy documents online, Progressive could give you another discount. (The average savings is 10%.)
* **Paperless discount:** You could also score a discount simply for opting to receive documents via email.
* **Pay in full:** Progressive also shaves some off your total cost if you opt to pay your premiums in full instead of monthly.
* **Automatic payment discount:** Setting up recurring payments can also unlock a discount — just note this can’t be combined with a pay-in-full discount.
* **Safe driver discount:** Progressive says no tickets or accidents in the past three years could mean a policy that’s 34% less than for drivers with these incidents.

## How to file a claim with Progressive

Progressive makes it easy to file a car insurance claim online, in the app, or over the phone. Here’s how to submit a claim from start to finish:

1. **File your claim.** You can report an accident 24/7 by logging in to your policy online, using the mobile app, or calling Progressive’s claims center. Even non-customers can file a claim as a guest. You’ll just need to provide a few basic details to get started.
2. **Set up an inspection.** After filing, you’ll be assigned a claims rep and in most cases an estimator. They’ll help assess the damage and let you choose between getting your car repaired or receiving a payment.
3. **Choose a repair shop and schedule the work.** Progressive lets you pick any repair shop. However, if you go with one in their network, they’ll help coordinate the repair and back the work with a lifetime guarantee (for as long as you own or lease the car).
4. **Pick up your car.** Once repairs are complete, you can pick up your vehicle. If you choose a network shop, Progressive will handle all parts of the repair process on your behalf.

### How long do I have to submit claims to Progressive?

There’s no set deadline, but Progressive recommends filing your claim as soon as possible.

### How fast does Progressive pay auto insurance claims?

You’ll typically receive payment within seven to 14 days, though the actual repairs could take longer and extend the process.

## Progressive’s mobile app

With Progressive’s mobile app, you can easily manage your car insurance on the go. You can pull up your ID card, check your coverage, file a claim, pay a bill, upload documents, or even request roadside help from your phone. It also connects directly with your Snapshot progress if you’re enrolled in Progressive’s telematics program. The app is well-reviewed, too.

Progressive mobile app ratings

## Progressive auto insurance FAQs

### Which is cheaper: GEICO or Progressive?

According to our methodology, GEICO is slightly cheaper than Progressive — $202 for full coverage instead of $205. Because the difference is so small, it’s not uncommon for Progressive to be cheaper for some people and GEICO to be cheaper for others. Consider grabbing quotes from both to see which is right for you.

### Is Progressive known to deny claims?

Progressive’s three-year average complaint index is lower than the national average, which suggests fewer formal complaints overall (including for claims). That said, the company has had slightly below average ratings in the J.D. Power Claims Satisfaction Study. All said, it’s a good idea to compare multiple insurers before deciding which is right for you.

### Can I get Progressive without an agent?

Yes. You can quote, customize, and buy a policy directly online or through the mobile app. But if you prefer help, Progressive also works with independent agents.

## Methodology

### Auto insurance ratings

We researched the coverage details and prices for 13 auto insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each auto insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best auto insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated.

**Coverage types: 20% of score.** We examined all the coverage options available, and assessed whether each insurer offered the following: new car replacement (5%), GAP insurance (5%), accident forgiveness (5%), and diminishing deductible (5%).

**Average cost: 40% of score**. The average cost was generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and includes more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. These estimates are for policies with full coverage for the average policyholder who owns one car. Average policyholder here is defined as a 48-year-old driver, driving a 13-year-old car, in an average-income ZIP code with full coverage.

**Customer satisfaction: 30% of score.** We factored in information from three major sources: 1) National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaints (10%), in which we took the total number of complaints each company had over a three-year period (2022-2024), 2) CRASH scores (10%) from the Crash Network which share how well each company ensures quality repairs and customer service, and 3) J.D. Power scores (10%) from the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Discounts: 10% of score.** We gave points for each type of discount that each auto insurer offers.

All app ratings were accurate at the time of publication.

### Auto insurance pricing data

Unless stated otherwise, the estimates above are provided by Savvy Insurance Solutions (“Savvy”). Savvy operates a marketplace for home and auto insurance, plus an agency licensed in all 50 states. Estimates are generated using Savvy’s in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and include more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Savvy’s nationwide data set. This includes data from more than 2 million insurance accounts connected through Trellis Connect, an in-house technology allowing consumers to “link” their insurance accounts before searching for insurance, and tens of thousands of policies bound by Savvy’s own agents. It takes into account a myriad of factors to create predictions, such as:

* Policyholder age
* Number of vehicles
* ZIP code
* Vehicle age
* Insurer
* …and more

Savvy creates estimates by running models against multiple inputs to the parameters of interest. For instance, the “teen driver” estimates were created by adjusting the policyholder age input into the pricing model while keeping all other variables steady from the baseline for “full coverage.” The models enable hyper-personalized estimates that take into account a plethora of user attribute permutations (e.g., teen drivers in specific states, teen drivers with new vehicles, teen drivers in specific states with new vehicles) to provide individuals with a unique and tailored experience. The charts above are a subset of the kinds of personalization Savvy can do.

### Definitions

The following are definitions used by Savvy when providing its rate estimates for various types of coverage.

**Full coverage car insurance:** A policy with comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage.

**Average policyholder:** A 48-year-old driver who owns a 13-year-old vehicle and lives in an average-income ZIP code.

**Senior driver:** A 70-year-old policyholder with full coverage car insurance.

**Good driver:** Drivers across all coverage types, vehicle types, and locations who have no tickets, accidents or DUIs.
