### State Farm customer satisfaction

To get a sense of how successful State Farm is at meeting its customers’ needs, we took a look at third-party metrics like the J.D. Power [2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study), which measures customer satisfaction by carriers across several geographic regions, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index, which compares an insurer’s number of customer complaints to the industry average based on its market share. In both cases, State Farm performed well, indicating that it has very good customer service for most policyholders.

#### State Farm auto claims satisfaction

In almost all of the 11 geographic regions studied by J.D. Power in the 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, State Farm scored above the industry average for customer satisfaction, ranking in the top three carriers in six regions. Based on these findings, along with State Farm’s sixth-place finish in the [2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), we conclude that State Farm is consistently successful in meeting customers’ needs.

#### State Farm auto insurance customer complaints

The NAIC provides another way to gauge customer satisfaction by tracking complaints for U.S. insurers based on their market share. Carriers who score above the industry baseline of 1.00 have an above-average rate of complaints, while carriers with scores below 1.00 receive fewer complaints than average based on their size. In 2024, State Farm’s NAIC complaint index score for private passenger auto insurance was 1.21, indicating that it has a higher volume of complaints than other insurers.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
