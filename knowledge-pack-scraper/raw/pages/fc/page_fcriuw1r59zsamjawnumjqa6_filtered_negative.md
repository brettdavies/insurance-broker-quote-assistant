To get a sense of how successful State Farm is at meeting its customers’ needs, we took a look at third-party metrics like the J.D. Power [2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study), which measures customer satisfaction by carriers across several geographic regions, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index, which compares an insurer’s number of customer complaints to the industry average based on its market share. In both cases, State Farm performed well, indicating that it has very good customer service for most policyholders.
In almost all of the 11 geographic regions studied by J.D. Power in the 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, State Farm scored above the industry average for customer satisfaction, ranking in the top three carriers in six regions. Based on these findings, along with State Farm’s sixth-place finish in the [2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), we conclude that State Farm is consistently successful in meeting customers’ needs.

##  State Farm home insurance review
High customer satisfaction scores (per J.D. Power) set State Farm apart. In addition to standard homeowners coverage, such as dwelling, personal property, liability and additional living expense coverage, State Farm offers homeowners many opportunities to customize their policies. State Farm’s [personal articles coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/home-and-property/personal-articles-policy) adds financial protection for items like jewelry, keepsakes, equipment and medical devices that might not otherwise be fully covered. Policyholders can also take advantage of [replacement cost coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost/), an electrical fire prevention program in partnership with Ting and State Farm’s Premier Service Program, which helps eligible policyholders find reputable contractors following a covered loss.

Third-party ratings from J.D. Power and customer complaint data from the NAIC provide a general picture of State Farm’s success at meeting customer needs. We took a close look at J.D. Power’s [2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-home-insurance-study), which measures customer satisfaction for U.S. property insurers, and the [2025 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-property-claims-satisfaction-study), which focuses on the claims experience for customers who filed home insurance claims with each insurer. We also look at the NAIC Complaint Index to see whether an insurer has a higher or lower rate of complaints than the industry baseline.

OVERVIEW  Bankrate identified key carrier features, coverage offerings, discounts and more Info Icon Caret Down Icon Caret Up IconCaret Up Icon
State Farm may be a good option for drivers seeking full coverage, customers looking for affordable home insurance without much customization, or anyone who needs a reliable term or universal life insurance policy. Read More |  Like State Farm, Allstate has an extensive network of local agencies that may help you manage your policies in person. If you prefer digital tools, the company offers an online policy portal and a mobile app. You may also be interested in Allstate’s DriveWise telematics program, which may help you save on your car insurance premium. However, Allstate does have a higher NAIC complaint index for both auto and home insurance. Read More |  Travelers may be a good option for environmentally-conscious shoppers due to its unique discount opportunities for those who drive an electric or hybrid vehicle or own a home that is LEED certified. However, it may be important to note that Travelers does not offer life insurance and scored below average in J.D. Power's auto and property claims satisfaction studies. Read More
