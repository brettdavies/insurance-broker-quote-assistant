#  State Farm Declined to Quote me on New House 
I've had home insurance through State Farm for over 25 years, no lapses. I was told by my local State Farm agent that they couldn't quote me on a new house because I filed an insurance claim two years ago. 
I did indeed file a claim - we had a huge hail storm that damaged nearly every roof in our neighborhood, and totaled many people's cars. The largest hail was baseball to softball sized. 
I was shocked that State Farm wouldn't even quote our new house. ! The local agent said that their corporate office wouldn't allow for a new policy due to our recent claim. 
Is anyone else seeing this? It goes against logic to have insurance that you can't use.

Nope. Neighbor had them do an inspection of their request and told to replace their roof and it was 15 yrs old and still in good shape State Farm said do it or we will drop you. Tha assessment was made by an adjuster FROM THE GROUND.

Because their business is statistics. The individual condition isn't necessarily important or accurate enough to override all their actuarial data. Issues aren't always obvious without destructive inspection and they don't care about losing a couple individual customersif it means their overall payout rate is lower. 
Remember that your house doesn't matter. It's the millions of houses they insure in aggregate that matter to them.

Check out Erie for up here. State Farm’s customer service is horrid. Erie can be a bit more but their customer service is absolutely incredible. I’ve had two major claims on homeowners and they were so easy to work with. They are big up here in the NE.

We’re in Rochester and started getting quotes to see if it made sense to switch home & auto insurers to save some money… we can’t get anyone to insure our house. We put a claim in for a roof 9 years ago when we had hurricane force winds (80mph) rip off half our shingles a year after we bought the house. Didn’t realize we were fucking ourselves over so hard and hope as more time passes we become insurable again. We would never claim anything minor but having just bought the house didn’t have $20k for a new roof just hanging around. C’est la vie, I guess?

We just had the same thing happen to us. Moving from Texas to Central NY. We had hail damage and filed a claim in April on our Texas home. State Farm refused to even provide a quote. Found this guy through our mortgage broker and he was responsive, provided a good price and good coverage. After getting several quotes we ultimately went with him.

I got a 20+% price increase for my home insurance renewal this year. Just to make sure they were still competitive, I tried to get a couple of quotes online. Three other companies would not even provide a quote. WTF? 
Living in the same house for almost 40 years, and haven’t had a claim in 30 years. In NJ fwiw.

Same (in CT). Progressive went up 25%, shopped around, one out of three I looked at would not quote me. No clue why either, never had a claim. Actually ended up going with State Farm, they were half of what the new Progressive rate was (this did require switching auto policy as well though).

In Iowa, using a small regional insurer, my premium jumped 82% from last year when I got my renewal declaration. Additionally, they changed my deductible from $2,500 for all peril, to 2% of the policy value for wind & hell. 
I was furious. Granted this was only my third year in this house coming up, but I haven't had any claims. 
I contacted both insurance brokers in my town to shop policies for me and they all kept coming in around the same price as my renewal declaration. 
I got on the phone and started calling around and found a policy that met my needs from Farmers that was almost the exact same amount I was paying last year. The only change I had to accept was that it was also a 2% wind and hail deductible but all other peril is only $1,000 deductible. 
God I hope I don't have to start doing this every year.

It's insulting, isn't it? 
Used to be one could make at least one legit claim and get reimbursed, but! again! similar to Private Equity invading Health Insurance, the Vampires have invaded Homeowners. 
Your mortgage holder Insists you have insurance and insurance says " sure, but we don't pay any claims".

Anecdotal but.... I know a bunch of people in Texas who used to get a new roof every few years whenever a hail storm rolled through. Most of them would have been fine with some minor repairs. Seems like the insurance companies have shut that down by just dropping people.

High risk homeowners insurance is a thing. If you’re high risk auto insurance, it’s probably your fault. If you’re high risk homeowners insurance, it can be where you live has been unprofitable for insurance companies even if you never filed a claim. It can be because weather happened, things through no fault of your own. It’s a dollars and cents thing to the insurance companies.

Dude, insurance companies are getting cooked and have been for the last couple of years. Your situation isn’t uncommon. 
I had a buddy recently try to buy a home with a 15ish year old roof in very good condition and they were told by their current provider they wouldn’t insure the house. Luckily they landed a provider that would, but their rate went up a pretty good amount. 
Home values and car values have went through the roof the last 4 years, inflation is up on products, labor cost, etc. couple that with tons of natural disasters and they’re all getting absolutely cooked on claims. I’m not taking up for em - they’re scam artists - but that’s the reality consumers have to live with now. Insurance companies aren’t immune to the effects of everything around them.

Homeowners insurance is just fraud now. Mortgage lenders force you to have it, but you can basically never use it (_maybe_ one and done, I suppose).

My Aunt and Uncle had State Farm since they had built their house in the 60's. 
In 2011, an F5 tornado picked up a car from my their backyard neighbor's house, drug it through the roof of their house, and dropped it in their front yard. 
State Farm paid to rebuild the house, replace furniture, and even put them up in a nice 2 bedroom apartment while the house was being rebuilt. 
Then once the claim was closed, they promptly dropped them.
