# State Farm Declined to Quote me on New House

I've had home insurance through State Farm for over 25 years, no lapses. I was told by my local State Farm agent that they couldn't quote me on a new house because I filed an insurance claim two years ago.

I did indeed file a claim - we had a huge hail storm that damaged nearly every roof in our neighborhood, and totaled many people's cars. The largest hail was baseball to softball sized.

I was shocked that State Farm wouldn't even quote our new house. ! The local agent said that their corporate office wouldn't allow for a new policy due to our recent claim.

Is anyone else seeing this? It goes against logic to have insurance that you can't use.
