* ### How we review auto insurance companies

  In our auto insurance reviews, our editorial team considers the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength:** We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints:** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use:** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts:** We look at the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Where Progressive stands out

****Coverage.**** Progressive offers coverage types that some companies don’t, including [rideshare insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/rideshare-insurance) and a form of [gap insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/gap-insurance) called loan/lease payoff. Full coverage policies from Progressive also include coverage that pays for veterinarian bills if a pet is injured in a crash. (Not all coverage types are available in every state, so make sure the options you want are offered where you live.)

****Accident forgiveness.**** Unlike many other insurers, Progressive offers three different types of accident forgiveness, which keep your rates from rising after a covered accident.

* **Small accident forgiveness:** New Progressive policies in most states automatically include small accident forgiveness, which can cover claims up to $500.
* **Large accident forgiveness:** If you maintain a clean driving record for five years with Progressive, you may qualify for large accident forgiveness, which applies to claims over $500 in most states.
* **Additional accident forgiveness:** You can purchase additional Progressive accident forgiveness and use it once per policy period. This type stacks on top of the others, potentially forgiving two accidents within the same policy period.

## Where Progressive falls short

**Customer satisfaction.** According to J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction studies, Progressive was rated below average for auto insurance claims.[1] In a separate 2024 NerdWallet survey around overall customer satisfaction, Progressive scored below average when compared with other insurers surveyed.

## Progressive auto insurance coverage

When you're shopping for car insurance coverage, it's important to understand what coverage you want and what you’re required to buy. For instance, most states require a minimum amount of car insurance to drive a vehicle. Alternatively, if you want extra protection, you may be interested in full coverage insurance. Read about the most common types of car insurance coverage to see how they work.

Depending on your state, you might be able to add these types of coverage to your policy:

* **Gap insurance**. Under this coverage, Progressive pays up to 25% above the value of your car if it’s totaled to cover a loan or lease balance. You must purchase comprehensive and collision coverage to buy gap insurance from Progressive.
* **Custom parts and equipment value**. Pays to fix or replace custom accessories you add to your car if they’re destroyed in a covered claim, up to $5,000.
* **Coverage for pet injuries**. Included if you buy collision coverage and can help pay part of your veterinarian bills if your pet is injured in a car accident.
* **Deductible savings bank.** If you have comprehensive and collision coverage, you can pay to opt in to a program that reduces your deductibles by $50 every six months you’re claim-free, down to $0. This isn’t available in all states.
* **[Rideshare insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/rideshare-insurance).** This is available from Progressive in some states. Typical insurance from ridesharing companies covers only the period between accepting a ride and dropping off a customer. This add-on insurance expands your personal auto policy any time you have the app on, so you’re covered even between rides.

Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness in most states. Small accident forgiveness (up to $500) and large accident forgiveness (over $500) are available for free if you’re eligible, and Progressive accident forgiveness can cover one additional claim if you add it to your policy.

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) and full [ratings methodology for auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

**Average rates methodology**

NerdWallet averaged rates based on public filings obtained by pricing analytics company Quadrant Information Services. We examined rates for men and women for all ZIP codes in any of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.

In our analysis, “good drivers” had no moving violations on record; a “good driving” discount was included for this profile. Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are average rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider.

Sample drivers had the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability coverage per crash.
* $50,000 property damage liability coverage per crash.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per crash.
* Collision coverage with $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with $1,000 deductible.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good credit.”
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash costing $10,000 in property damage.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken-driving violation.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE in all cases and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven. We analyzed rates for drivers of the following ages: 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 and 70.

**Auto insurance survey methodology**

The opt-in survey of 7,503 U.S. adults ages 18 and older was conducted online by Russell Research on behalf of NerdWallet in June and July 2024. Respondents were asked to rate one auto insurance brand they obtained or renewed a policy within the past 12 months, with at least some changes to the original policy. These brands were rated on overall satisfaction, overall value, online experience, trustworthiness, mobile app experience, claims experience and customer support on a scale of 1-100.

Only brands with 100 or more qualifying respondents are reported. Of those respondents: 300 were State Farm customers, 300 were Progressive customers, 300 were Allstate customers, 300 were GEICO customers, 100 were USAA customers, 157 were AAA customers, 100 were Liberty Mutual customers, 100 were American Family customers, 100 were Farmers customers, 100 were Travelers customers and 101 were Nationwide customers.
