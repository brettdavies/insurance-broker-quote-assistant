The [average cost](/average-cost-of-insurance "Average Cost of Car Insurance") of full coverage car insurance in Alabama is $196 per month, but where you live in the state can impact the price you pay. Areas with narrow streets, poorly maintained roads or higher crime rates tend to have higher prices for car insurance.

## What is the mandatory liability insurance in Alabama?

Drivers must have a certain amount of [liability car insurance](/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheapest Liability-Only Car Insurance") in Alabama to drive legally and avoid [penalties](/auto-insurance/alabama/penalties-driving-without-insurance "Penalties for Driving without Insurance in Alabama"). The requirement is sometimes written as 
25/50/25.

* **[Bodily injury liability (BI)](/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?"):** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
* **[Property damage liability (PD)](/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?"):** $25,000 per accident

**Most people should get more coverage than the minimum requirement if they can afford it.**

That's because the liability limits required in Alabama may not be high enough to cover the cost of a serious accident. For example, if you hit an expensive car, it's unlikely that $25,000 of property damage liability will be enough to buy the other driver a new vehicle.

**In addition, liability-only insurance doesn't include [collision and comprehensive coverage](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** These coverages pay for most types of damage to your car, regardless of whose fault it is.

Comprehensive coverage is the only way to [protect your car against damage from natural disasters](https://aldoi.gov/Preparedness/WeatherDisasterPreparedness.aspx "Alabama Department of Insurance: Weather Disaster Preparedness"). This includes tornado damage, flooding from hurricanes and hail damage, all of which are common in Alabama.

If you have a car loan or lease, your lender probably requires you to have collision and comprehensive coverage. You should also consider these coverages if your car is less than 8 years old or worth more than $5,000.
