Was a emerald rated customer with progressive for 18yrs plus. Had my car, truck, motor home and my house with them.Got a call one day from a women telling they would not be renewing my homeowners policy.I asked why she said the mailed me letters and called months ago asking about my roof on my house. No one called me or sent me a single letter! Its because every year they increase my premiums with stuff I didn't ask for or need.....I would call and have it removed I'm sure it had something to do with being cancelled.Very sneaky company go to Geico I switched to them and received a big discount with my excellent credit rating.
