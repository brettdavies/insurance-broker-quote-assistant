The _commission rates can vary depending_ on the type of insurance policy. For home and car captive agents, the commission is typically 5 to 10% on the first year's premium, while independent agents average 15%. Life and health insurance agents, on the other hand, can earn up to 100% of the policy's first-year insurance rates in the first year.

The _commission rates can also vary depending_ on the location and size of the agency. However, the key takeaway is that commissions are a significant part of an auto insurance agent's income, and they can earn a substantial amount of money from both new and renewal policies.
