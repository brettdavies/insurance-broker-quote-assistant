# When Do Accidents Fall Off Insurance in California: What Every Driver Should Know
Thinking about **“when do accidents fall off insurance”**? You’re not alone—especially in California, where the roads are busy and insurance rates can pinch your budget. Whether you’re a teen getting your first car, a parent juggling family drives, or a small business using delivery vans, understanding how long an accident can affect your insurance matters.
### **Why It Matters in California**
California is huge, crowded, and car-dependent. Every year, thousands of accidents happen, and each one can impact insurance prices—for you and for businesses that rely on vehicles. Even a small fender-bender can raise your rates for years. Knowing when an accident “falls off” means you also know when your rates could go down—and when you might be eligible for discounts again.
### **How Long Does an Accident Stay on Your DMV Record?**
Your **DMV driving record** controls much of what your insurance company sees. In California:
* **Most accidents stay on your record for about 3 years** after the date they happened.
* If the accident involved more serious issues—like a DUI or hit‑and‑run—it may stay **up to 10 years**.
So generally, if you had an at-fault crash—like bumping into someone’s car—that shows up for three years, unless it’s enhanced by something serious.
### **How Do Insurance Companies Use This Information?**
Insurance companies check your driving record when:
* You get or renew a policy
* You shop for a new insurance company
They usually focus on your recent history—typically **3 to 5 years**, though **most stick to 3 years** in California. But remember: Every company is different. Some don’t raise rates if you weren’t at fault—so make sure to check!
### **What About CLUE Reports?**
There’s another tool insurance companies use called **CLUE** (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange). Here’s what matters:
* It lists **claims**, not just accidents, going back **up to seven years**.
* Even if an accident drops off your DMV record after three years, it might still show up in CLUE—especially if you switch insurers.
Think of CLUE as a “claims archive” that some insurers peek at when deciding your rate.
### **Quick Summary: When Do Accidents Fall Off Insurance?**
**Situation** | **DMV Record Duration** | **Insurance Look-Back***
---|---|---
Typical at‑fault accident | ~3 years | Usually 3 years
Serious violation (DUI, hit-and-run) | Up to 10 years | May look back longer
Claims history (CLUE) | — | Up to 7 years
“Insurance look-back” refers to what insurers consider when pricing your policy.
### **Real-World Examples**
**Example A: High school student, minor fender-bender, at-fault**
* **Accident happens**: Your rate jumps.
* **0–3 years**: Accident appears on your DMV record. You pay a surcharge.
* **After ~3 years**: Accident drops off DMV record. Rates likely drop (assuming no new incidents).
**Example B: Small business delivery van, serious at-fault crash with DUI**
* **DMV record**: Shows the accident and DUI for up to 10 years.
* **Insurance pricing**: They focus on recent 3–5 years, but that record looms large—especially if you switch insurers and trigger a CLUE check.
### **Why This Matters for You or Your Business**
* **Budgeting**: Knowing when rates might return to normal helps you plan.
* **Discounts**: In California, qualifying as a “Good Driver” after staying clean for **about 3 years** might unlock **20% savings**.
* **Shopping insurance**: If you plan to change insurers, check your **CLUE report** first. Errors can cost you money.
* **Correcting mistakes**: If an accident was unfairly marked as “at-fault,” you can dispute it—both on your DMV record and CLUE reports (via DMV correction forms or contacting LexisNexis).
### **Quick Tips to Stay on Track**
* **Review your DMV records once a year**. Look for errors or old items that should be gone.
* **Mark your calendar**: Three years after an accident is a milestone when it likely “falls off.”
* **Check your CLUE report** annually—especially before switching insurers.
* **Keep documentation**: If there’s a dispute about fault, proper records and photos help your case.
### **Bottom Line**
So, **when do accidents fall off insurance** in California? For most drivers, **about three years**. That’s when the accident disappears from your DMV record and insurers usually stop surcharging you. For major violations—like DUIs—the mark stays longer, up to **10 years**. And don’t forget: insurers may still peek into your past via **CLUE reports**, which go back up to **seven years**.
Staying clean for those crucial three years (or more, if serious) doesn’t just help your driving record—it helps your wallet. Understanding this timeline lets you drive with confidence, shop smarter, and get back to lower rates faster.
