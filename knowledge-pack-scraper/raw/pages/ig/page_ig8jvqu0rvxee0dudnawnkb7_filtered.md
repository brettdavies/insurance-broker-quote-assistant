# Snapshot® by Progressive in Baldwin County, Alabama

At Heritage Insurance in Silverhill, we’re proud to represent [**Progressive Insurance**](https://www.heritageins.net/Progressive-Insurance), one of the most innovative carriers in the industry. One of Progressive’s most popular features is [**Snapshot**](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/snapshot/)**®**, a usage-based insurance program that rewards safe driving with real discounts.

## What Is Snapshot®?

Snapshot® is Progressive’s **telematics program**, designed to personalize your insurance rates based on how you actually drive—not just general statistics like age or ZIP code. By tracking driving behavior through either the **mobile app** or a **plug-in device**, Snapshot can help lower your [auto insurance](https://www.heritageins.net/Auto-Insurance) premiums if you practice safe driving habits.

Drivers typically receive:

* An **initial participation discount** just for enrolling.
* The opportunity to earn **larger savings at renewal** based on performance.

## How It Works

When you enroll through Heritage Insurance, you’ll choose either the **Snapshot mobile app** or a **small plug-in device** mailed to you. Snapshot monitors:

* **Time of day** you drive (late-night driving may increase risk)
* **Hard braking and rapid acceleration**
* **Speed and mileage**
* **Phone usage while driving** (mobile app only)

You’ll be able to see a driving score and trip details inside the app, helping you improve your driving habits while working toward discounts.

## Do Other Carriers Offer Similar Programs?

Yes—many insurers now offer **usage-based insurance programs** like this, but Progressive’s Snapshot® is among the most established and widely used. Other companies may use similar systems (like [National General’s DynamicDrive](https://www.heritageins.net/DynamicDrive)), but Progressive’s program is unique in offering both a plug-in device and an app option.

## Things to Keep in Mind

While many drivers save with Snapshot®, not everyone will. If the program shows risky driving habits—like frequent hard braking, speeding, or late-night trips—it may impact your rate at renewal. Still, most safe drivers find that Snapshot® offers meaningful discounts and valuable feedback.

## Is Snapshot® Right for You?

If you’re a safe, consistent driver, Snapshot® is a great way to turn your good habits into savings. At **Heritage Insurance**, we’ll explain how it works, help you get set up, and make sure your policy is customized for the best value.
