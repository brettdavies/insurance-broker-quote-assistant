Liability coverage |  What it coversInjuries & damages you cause |  Required?In almost every state
Comprehensive coverage |  What it coversDamage to your car caused by events outside of your control |  Required?Only if leasing or financing
Collision coverage |  What it coversDamage to your car caused by other drivers or objects you hit |  Required?Only if leasing or financing
Personal injury protection (PIP) |  What it coversPays for medical bills, funeral expenses, & more |  Required?Only in some states
Medical payments (MedPay) |  What it coversPays for medical bills only, in most cases |  Required?Only in some states
Uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) |  What it coversPays for injuries & damages caused by drivers with too little or no insurance |  Required?Only in some states
**Example:** Chris causes an accident that results in $15,000 worth of medical bills for the injured driver. His policy covers up to $50,000 in bodily injury per person and up to $100,000 in bodily injury total per accident. Since his per person and per accident limits are well above the claim amount, his insurance could fully pay for the injured driver's medical bills.
**Example:** Caitlyn, Chris’ wife, is driving late at night when a deer suddenly jumps in front of her car, causing $5,000 in damage. Unfortunately, they don’t have comprehensive coverage and are on the hook for the full $5,000 to repair Caitlyn’s car, which, despite being five years old, is still worth around $11,000. If they had comprehensive with even a deductible of $1,000, they would have still saved close to $4,000 in repair bills after factoring in the cost of coverage.
**Example:** Chris leaves his car parked on the street overnight. In the morning, he discovers that someone hit his rear bumper, causing $1,000 in damage. Chris doesn’t have collision coverage on his car, as it’s only worth around $2,000. He decided it wasn’t worth having on his car since any claim payout would be minimal, even with a low deductible. Plus, he knew he could afford to pay for repairs or a new car.
**Example:** Caitlyn and Chris are in an accident while riding as passengers in their friend Ted’s car. Everyone is OK, but Chris and Caitlyn get checked out at the hospital just to be on the safe side. Chris gets a $750 X-ray, while Caitlyn gets a $1,000 CT scan. Fortunately, they have MedPay coverage up to $2,000 per person, so their auto insurance pays for both of their bills.
**Example:** It’s Chris’ turn to lead the office carpool. After picking up three of his colleagues, he ends up in a fender bender that leaves two of his co-workers with $500 in medical bills each. They file a claim with Chris’ insurance which provides $2,000 in PIP coverage per person — enough to cover both of their medical bills.
**Example:** Caitlyn and Chris are rear-ended by another driver who doesn’t have insurance. The damage to their car totals $3,500. But since they have uninsured motorist coverage for up to $5,000 in property damage, their insurance pays for the repairs.
Rideshare insurance is a smart choice (often a required choice) if you drive under a ridesharing platform like Uber or Lyft. Rideshare coverage fills the gaps between your personal insurance and any insurance provided by the ridesharing company so you’re always protected, whether you’re waiting for a ride request or dropping someone off.
