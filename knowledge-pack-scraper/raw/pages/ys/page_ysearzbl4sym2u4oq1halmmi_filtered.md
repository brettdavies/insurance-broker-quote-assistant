## What are the minimum requirements for motorcycle insurance in Texas?

Texas motorcycle law requires all riders to carry [motorcycle liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-liability-coverage/) for bodily injury and property damage. Liability coverage may pay for injuries you're liable for or property you're responsible for damaging in an accident, up to your policy's limits. You can increase the amount of liability coverage, if necessary, to more fully protect your assets. It's important to note that property damage liability coverage doesn't cover damage to your own motorcycle.

| Required coverage | What it covers | Minimum amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Bodily injury liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/) | What it coversInjuries you cause to others in an accident | Minimum amount$30,000 per person $60,000 per accident |
| [Property damage liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/) | What it coversProperty damage you cause to others in an accident | Minimum amount$25,000 per accident |

The state of Texas requires the submission of a signed form to reject or lower these three mandated coverages:

* [Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/uninsured-underinsured-motorist/) (UM/UIM)

### Do you need comprehensive and collision coverage?

Comprehensive coverage can protect your prized possession, as it may cover damage to your bike from events out of your control: [motorcycle theft](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-theft/), vandalism, hitting an animal, fire, and weather-related issues. Collision can cover your motorcycle if it collides with another object or vehicle, regardless of who's [at fault](https://www.progressive.com/answers/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/).
