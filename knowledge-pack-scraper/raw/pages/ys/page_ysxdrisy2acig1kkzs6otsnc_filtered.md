In Los Angeles, drivers are required to carry a minimum liability auto insurance of 15/30/5. That means, at minimum, drivers must have insurance that covers $15,000 per person. Driver must also have insurance that covers at least $30,000 per accident and $5,000 for property damage.

The purpose behind this California requirement is to protect other drivers if you’re negligent while driving a vehicle.

However, drivers are not required to carry uninsured motorist coverage. But even though it’s not required, there are benefits to having this type of coverage.

## **Benefits of Uninsured Motorist Coverage**

Some drivers can’t afford or refuse to pay for auto insurance. Without auto insurance, these uninsured drivers often don’t have enough money to pay for damages in the event of a serious accident.

In times like this, having uninsured motorist insurance is extremely helpful. If you’ve been in an auto accident with an at-fault driver that doesn’t carry liability insurance, uninsured motorist insurance protects you. Uninsured motorist coverage protects you when another driver is at fault for causing a vehicle accident.

## **What Does Uninsured Motorist Coverage Insurance Cover?**

Regardless of the other driver’s coverage, Uninsured motorist insurance ensures that accident-related losses are covered. After serious accidents, uninsured motorist insurance covers both economic and non-economic losses. There is a range of costs that this insurance cover, including:

* Medical costs
* Mental and emotional distress
* Physical or emotional pain/suffering
* Lost income
* Property damage (includes vehicle repair bills)
* Car rental costs

Typically, uninsured motorist coverage in California is relatively inexpensive compared to bodily injury coverage. Although you’re required to pay for the insurance to protect others, this less expensive insurance coverage is often waived. But, having uninsured motorist coverage is necessary to protect yourself against in the event you’re involved with an uninsured driver.

## **If You’ve Been Hit by An Uninsured Motorist**

It’s important to understand the various types of coverage provided by your auto insurance company. In the event of an accident, having uninsured motorist insurance can save from you spending money out of pocket for accident-related expenses.

But what happens if you don’t have uninsured motorist insurance?

If you’ve been hit by an uninsured driver, you can file a lawsuit for your injuries. Keep in mind that many uninsured drivers may not have the money to compensate you for your injuries – even if they are at fault.

In addition to filing a claim against the uninsured driver, you can also file a claim against the parties that contributed to the accident. An experienced accident lawyer can help identify the parties involved with your accident and help you with your claim.
