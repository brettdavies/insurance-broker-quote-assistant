GEICO and Progressive are the third- and second-largest insurance providers in the United States, respectively.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-1) This means that they underwrite millions of policies each year and are both reputable companies.

These are two great companies to compare quotes from if you’re looking for insurance, and remember that your quotes will be unique to you, so someone else’s experience with either company may not reflect yours.
That said, we’ve evaluated some overall trends and offerings from both providers to help you in your decision between the two.

Which Auto Insurance Is Better?
## GEICO vs. Progressive Average Cost Comparison
While cost isn’t the only factor you should consider when evaluating auto insurance options, it’s undeniably important. When it comes to cost, both companies offer lower-than-average rates for full coverage, but GEICO has consistently lower average premiums than Progressive across various driver categories. The only category in which Progressive wins is drivers with DUIs.
Company | GEICO | Progressive | National Average
---|---|---|---
**Full coverage** | $1,731 | $1,960 | $2,399
**Minimum coverage** | $517 | $638 | $635
**25-year-old drivers** | $2,172 | $2,723 | $2,113
**Senior drivers** | $1,664 | $1,689 | $1,602
**Speeding ticket** | $2,358 | $2,640 | $2,511
**Accident** | $2,889 | $3,169 | $2,812
**DUI** | $4,246 | $2,770 | $3,305
**Low credit** | $2,492 | $3,414 | $3,377
Keep in mind that any rates mentioned are calculated from aggregated data and that your quoted rates may vary. However, these averages offer a helpful starting point as you consider which company may be more likely to offer you the best rates.
Drivers with violations may have a more challenging time getting auto insurance coverage. Progressive’s rates for drivers with a DUI are lower than GEICO’s, but they’re still higher than the premiums paid by drivers with clean driving records. Those with violations should consider the [best auto insurers for high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/).
## GEICO vs. Progressive Coverage Options
Both GEICO and Progressive have standard coverages available, including [liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/liability/), [comprehensive and collision](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/), uninsured/underinsured motorist, medical payments, and personal injury protection.
They also offer optional add-on coverages that you can include on your policy if you choose to:
Coverage | GEICO | Progressive
---|---|---
Roadside assistance | Yes | Yes
Rental car reimbursement | Yes | Yes
Loan/lease payoff | No | Yes, up to 25% of vehicle’s value (limit may vary by state)
Accident forgiveness | Yes | Yes
Vehicle protection/mechanical breakdown insurance | Yes | Yes
Custom parts and equipment value coverage | Yes | Yes
Rideshare coverage | No | Yes
GEICO is one of the only major insurers that does not offer gap insurance, so if you finance your vehicle, this may be a dealbreaker, depending on your situation. Additionally, GEICO does not underwrite its own home insurance policies. Instead, it partners with affiliate companies to provide these policies. If you plan to bundle home and auto insurance through GEICO, your home insurance policy will be issued by one of these affiliates, not directly by GEICO.
In addition, keep in mind that not all of these coverages are available in every state, so you should always check your quote and speak to an agent to confirm what’s available in your area.
## GEICO vs. Progressive Discounts
GEICO and Progressive have several [auto insurance discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/) that policyholders can take advantage of. Some of these are more common discounts, such as multipolicy and multivehicles discounts. They also offer certain [teen-specific discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/discounts-for-teen-drivers/), including a good student discount.
There are also specific discounts that you’ll only be able to get with one company or the other, so pay special attention to those if you may be eligible for them. For example, GEICO offers special discounts for military members and federal government workers, so if you fall into either of those categories, you may save even more with GEICO over Progressive.
Below is a list of the main discounts offered by both companies. It’s important to note that discounts vary by state.
Discount | GEICO | Progressive
---|---|---
**Bundling** | Yes | Yes
**Multicar** | Yes | Yes
**Continuous insurance** | No | Yes0
**Homeowner** | No | Yes
**Defensive driving course** | Yes | Yes
**Good driver** | Yes | Yes
**Pay in full** | Yes | Yes
**Automatic payment** | No | Yes
**Online quote** | No | Yes
**Paperless** | No | Yes
**Safety features** | Yes | No
**Anti-theft** | Yes | No
**Good student** | Yes | Yes
**Distant student** | Yes | Yes
**Low mileage** | No | No
**New vehicle** | Yes | No
**Military** | Yes | No
**Federal employee** | Yes | No
### GEICO vs. Progressive Telematics Programs
GEICO and Progressive offer telematics programs, also called usage-based insurance, that policyholders can enroll in for further savings. These programs track your driving behavior and provide a discount for safe driving. GEICO’s is [DriveEasy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/driveeasy/), which utilizes the GEICO mobile app, while Progressive’s is [Snapshot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/snapshot/), which works with a plug-in device or the Progressive mobile app.
With DriveEasy, you can get up to 10 percent off your premium just for signing up, and a total of up to 25 percent off if you drive safely. The discount will also depend on your state. DriveEasy is currently only available in 37 states and Washington, D.C.
Progressive doesn’t advertise a percentage discount for Snapshot but, according to its website, safe drivers save an average of $94 at signup and an average of $231 at policy renewal. Snapshot is not available in California, and the sign-up discount is not available in Hawaii or New York.
J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study shows that GEICO’s telematics program has a higher overall customer satisfaction rating — it ranked second in the study with a score of 837, while Snapshot ranked sixth with a score of 816.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-2)
Category | GEICO DriveEasy | Progressive Snapshot
---|---|---
Potential discount | Up to 10% at signup, 25% at renewal | $94 at signup, $231 at renewal (advertised average)
J.D. Power usage-based insurance satisfaction score (study average 821 out of 1,000) | 837 out of 1,000 | 816 out of 1,000
Both GEICO’s and Progressive’s telematics programs may raise your rates if they detect unsafe driving, depending on your state. Consider whether this risk is worth it before opting into either program.
## GEICO vs. Progressive Customer Service
Based on several industry reports and studies, GEICO has a better overall customer service reputation than Progressive, but it depends on the region. Here’s how the companies compare in various customer experience areas:
### Claims Satisfaction
Claims satisfaction refers to how well an insurance company meets its customers’ expectations when they need to file a claim, including factors like ease of filing, timeliness, fairness of settlements, and overall customer experience.
In the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, GEICO and Progressive both scored below average, but GEICO still came out ahead of Progressive in 16th place (Progressive ranked 20th).[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-3)
Meanwhile, the 2025 CRASH Network Report Card ranked Progressive slightly higher than GEICO. This indicates that auto repair shops have a slightly better experience managing claims with Progressive, which can translate to a better experience for policyholders. However, both companies, along with the other 10 major insurers, received relatively low grades.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-4)
Study | GEICO | Progressive
---|---|---
2024 J.D. Power claims satisfaction report (study average 697 out of 1,000) | 692 out of 1,000 | 672 out of 1,000
CRASH Network 2025 Insurer Report Card | 80 out of 97, C- grade | 75 out of 97, C grade
### Customer Service
Progressive and GEICO ranked below or close to average in every region in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study. The company with the higher ranking varied depending on the region, but GEICO took the lead in most of them — Progressive ranked higher only in California and the Central and North Central regions.
Here is a breakdown of each company’s score (out of 1,000) by region:
Region | GEICO | Progressive | Average
---|---|---|---
California | 626 | 635 | 637
Central | 622 | 638 | 647

Metric | GEICO | Progressive
---|---|---
NAIC Complaint Index | 1.83 | 2.13
### Shopping
Customers tend to be more satisfied with Progressive’s quote and purchase process. Both companies offer several options to get a quote and purchase a policy depending on the customer’s preference, including online and on the phone with an agent.
Despite the ease of the process from both companies, Progressive ranked higher than GEICO in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Insurance Shopping Study — it ranked ninth, which was slightly above average, while GEICO ranked 14th.[7](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-7) The study ranks insurers based on factors like policy offerings, price, quote process, and distribution channel.
Category | GEICO | Progressive

However, the companies were tied in the shopping category.[8](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-progressive/#citation-8)
J.D. Power Digital Experience Category | GEICO | Progressive

## Recap
If you’re considering GEICO and Progressive for your auto insurance coverage, you can’t go wrong in the sense that they’re both major, reputable insurers. They have lower-than-average rates for drivers with clean records, strong financial strength ratings, intuitive online tools, and flexible quote and purchase processes.
Customer service ratings are relatively mixed for both companies, but GEICO ranks more highly in most regions. However, if you live in a region where Progressive has a better service reputation, such as Florida, you may wish to consider it more strongly.
**> > Keep Comparing**: [GEICO vs. Liberty Mutual](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/liberty-mutual-vs-geico/)
Our analysis shows that GEICO tends to have the cheapest rates for most drivers, but those with a DUI on their record may find lower premiums with Progressive. Both companies offer various discounts and telematics programs, although availability and eligibility vary based on state.
One major coverage missing from GEICO’s offerings is gap insurance. It also does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, meaning you will work with an affiliate. So, if you have a financed vehicle and are looking for this coverage or you own your home and plan to bundle policies, you’re better off looking into Progressive as well as a few other competitors.
## Frequently Asked Questions
Which is better, Progressive or GEICO?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Whether Progressive or GEICO is better depends on your circumstances and needs. GEICO tends to have cheaper rates for most drivers, but if you have a DUI on your record, Progressive may have lower rates. The coverages and discounts offered also vary by company, so be sure to consider your needs as you evaluate your options to make sure you get the coverage you require.
Why is Progressive so expensive?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Progressive may be more expensive for you than other insurers, but car insurance rates vary greatly depending on several factors, so it may not be expensive for other drivers. If you’re being quoted a high rate, it simply has to do with the way Progressive determines risk, which differs from insurer to insurer.
Who is GEICO's biggest competitor?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO’s biggest competitors are State Farm and Progressive, which are the two largest insurers in the U.S., ahead of GEICO, which is third.
## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we use four key factors to evaluate auto insurers:
* **Price (40%):** We analyze average premiums for both full and minimum coverage for a standard driving profile of a good driver with good credit. We also looked at rates for other driver profiles, including those with violations or low credit. We also consider available discounts. Full coverage averages use the following limits:
* Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
* Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
* Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
* **Claims handling (25%):** An auto insurer’s claims handling process should be quick, transparent, and efficient, with clear communication, fair evaluation of damages, and timely payment or resolution. We assess claims practices using sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s claims satisfaction report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings. We also include real-life customer experiences when possible.
* **Customer experience (25%):** We evaluate the ease of the customer journey, from getting a quote and purchasing a policy to making changes or accessing documents. We consider the availability and quality of both online and agent interactions, as well as the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
* **Coverage options (10%):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and prioritize providers with options beyond the state-required minimums, such as accident forgiveness, gap coverage, rideshare coverage, and more.
