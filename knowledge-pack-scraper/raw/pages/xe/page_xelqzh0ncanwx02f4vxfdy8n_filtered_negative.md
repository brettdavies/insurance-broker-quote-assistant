## **Geico Federal Employee Discount Compared To Competitors**
When we compared Geico’s employee discount to other insurance providers such as State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, Nationwide, and USAA, it was quite clear that Geico provides some of the most competitive rates for federal employees. Their 15% discount for federal workers is one of the highest available which can be further increased by combining other discounts.
State Farm
State Farm provides an employee discount to government employees, but the discount isn’t as strong as Geico’s. State Farm’s discounts for federal employees normally range from 5% to 10% and depend on the region and other factors. However, State Farm does provide more flexibility with additional discounts that can easily be applied, like those for safe drivers, student discounts, and accident-free driving.
Allstate
Allstate provides a discount for government workers which includes federal employees, retirees, and military personnel, usually ranging from 5% to 10% off the base premium. While this is quite similar to State Farm’s offer, Allstate tends to be more costly on average in several areas when compared to GEICO.
Progressive
Progressive provides a variety of discounts which include one for federal employees, but the specific percentage for this group is usually in the 5% to 10% range. Progressive also has many add on discounts for bundling, paying in full, and multi-vehicle coverage. However, Geico tends to have overall lower rates, even after applying discounts.
Nationwide
Nationwide provides an employee discount for federal workers, but much like State Farm and Allstate, the discount ranges from 5% to 10%. Nationwide also provides competitive rates when bundling home and auto policies. However, Geico’s federal employee discount is still leading in terms of overall savings, specifically for military employees who mostly qualify for both federal and military-specific discounts. Nationwide’s add-on benefits, such as accident forgiveness, are good, but they don’t always roll out the higher premiums as compared to Geico.
USAA (for Military and Veterans)
While USAA is highly regarded as the best choice for military members and their families due to its specialized service, perks, and benefits, it doesn’t typically provide an “employee” discount for federal workers as Geico does. USAA’s rates for military families are mostly competitive, but Geico’s federal employee discount could be higher (as high as 15%), specifically when you consider stacking it with other discounts.
