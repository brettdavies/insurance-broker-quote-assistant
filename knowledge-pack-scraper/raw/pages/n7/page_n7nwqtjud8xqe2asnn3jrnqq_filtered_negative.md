Quality Verified
At Insure.com, we are committed to providing the timely, accurate and expert information consumers need to make smart insurance decisions. All our content is written and reviewed by [industry professionals](https://www.insure.com/expert-advisors/) and insurance experts. [Our team ](https://www.insure.com/about-us/)carefully vets our rate data to ensure we only provide reliable and up-to-date insurance pricing. We follow the highest [editorial standards](https://www.insure.com/editorial-policy/). Our content is based solely on objective research and data gathering. We maintain strict editorial independence to ensure unbiased coverage of the insurance industry.
When shopping for [car insurance](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/), you may hesitate to share personal details like your Social Security Number (SSN), address, or driving history. Whether it’s a matter of privacy or wanting to explore your options without committing, obtaining a quote anonymously can be appealing. But is it possible to get a car insurance quote without providing personal information?
The short answer is yes, but there are trade-offs. Anonymous quotes often provide only rough estimates because insurers use personal details to assess risk and calculate accurate premiums. While these quotes can be a helpful starting point, they may not fully reflect the cost or coverage tailored to your situation.
In this guide, we’ll explore how car insurance quotes work, what information is typically required, and how you can balance your privacy with getting an accurate estimate. Whether you’re casually browsing or preparing for a purchase, understanding your options will help you make informed decisions.
**Key Takeaways**
* You can get an anonymous car insurance estimate without sharing personal details.
* Anonymous quotes may not always be accurate because an insurance company doesn’t have enough information to provide an accurate premium.
* To receive the most accurate quote, you’ll need to provide some personal information to the insurance company.
## What information do you need to get a car insurance quote?
To receive a car insurance quote, you’ll typically need to provide the following information:
* Age
* Gender
* Driver’s license
* Driving history
* Current insurance information
* Address
* Vehicle type
* Vehicle year
* The type of coverage you want
[Insurance companies](https://www.insure.com/best-car-insurance-companies/) use the information you provide to evaluate your level of risk as a policyholder. This risk assessment helps insurers determine how likely you are to file a claim, which directly influences the premium they offer. By accurately gauging your risk, the insurer can provide a more precise quote tailored to your circumstances. Factors such as your driving history, vehicle type, and personal details all play a role in shaping this evaluation.
If you request an [auto insurance](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/) quote without providing personal information, the estimate you receive may be less accurate.
## Can you get car insurance without providing personal information?
Some insurers provide shoppers with the option of getting an anonymous car insurance quote without providing personal information to the insurer. These quotes typically require minimal details, such as an email address or general information about the car. They can be a convenient way to get a rough idea of potential costs.
However, it’s important to note that anonymous quotes often lack accuracy because they don’t account for key personal factors that impact your premium, such as your driving history, [credit score](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/bad-credit-history.html), or location. Without this information, the insurer cannot provide a rate that truly reflects your unique situation, which means the estimate you receive may differ significantly from the actual premium you’ll pay.
If you want a more accurate quote but prefer not to link your personal details to your name, you can use a placeholder or fictitious name while shopping.
“Look for no-obligation quotes. You can even enter a made-up name and email if you simply want to view the quote to get ballpark pricing. Of course, none of this is binding or completely accurate until you supply accurate and complete information for the policy docs,” says Zach Lazzari, owner of Cross Border Coverage in Augusta, Montana.
Anonymous quotes can be helpful for those seeking a quick, no-commitment way to explore potential insurance costs. However, sharing additional details with the insurer is typically necessary to get a more precise and tailored estimate.

## Which auto insurers require the least personal information for a quote?
If you want to work with a company that doesn’t need too much personal information, consider the following options:
* **GEICO**:** **You can get a quote with GEICO by just providing your email address. The rest of the details aren’t required for an estimate. But you will need to share more to get an accurate quote.
* **The General:** You can get a quote from this company in just two minutes with minimal personal details.
## States that limit personal information in auto insurance rates
A handful of states restrict the types of personal details insurers can use when calculating premiums. The goal is to make pricing fairer and ensure rates are tied more closely to driving behavior and vehicle factors. Even in these states, insurers still need basic information — such as your driving record, address, and vehicle details — to provide an accurate quote.
* **California.** Insurers in California cannot use credit score, gender, or educational status when setting auto insurance rates. While ZIP code isn’t banned outright, its use is tightly regulated. Companies must prioritize more precise data—like driving history and annual mileage—and can only use ZIP code under strict conditions when other data isn’t credible.
* **Massachusetts.** Auto insurers in Massachusetts are barred from using credit score, gender, marital status, education, or occupation. Rates instead focus on driving history and vehicle information.
* **Michigan.** Michigan prohibits insurers from using credit score, gender, marital status, homeownership, and education. Quotes are primarily based on driving record, address, and vehicle details.
* **Hawaii.** In Hawaii, insurers cannot use gender, age, marital status, credit history, or occupation. They still require information such as your driving record and vehicle details to generate a quote.
## Frequently asked questions
### Can you get car insurance quotes without sharing your VIN or Social Security number?
It is possible to get an insurance quote without sharing your VIN or SSN, according to Zach Lazzari, owner of [Cross Border Coverage](https://crossbordercoverage.com/mexico-insurance-products/mexican-car-insurance/). He says that insurers can often provide initial estimates with minimal information.
Lazzari says clients have entered their general vehicle information, such as the value, make, model, year, policy dates, and more, to retrieve a quote. However, while these quotes are helpful, they may not always be precise.
“Knowing the driver’s age and driving history can also help solidify the quote. If you are 25 years [or older] with a clean record, the quote is pretty close to accurate, but they aren’t binding until more information is retrieved,” says Lazzari.
### Can you compare car insurance online without sharing personal information?
Getting a car insurance quote without sharing personal information can be challenging, but it’s not impossible.
### Do you need your Social Security number (SSN) for car insurance estimates?
You don’t need to provide your Social Security Number to receive a car insurance estimate. However, to obtain an accurate quote and finalize your policy, you may be required to share this important detail.
### Can you estimate car insurance before buying a car?
Yes, it’s possible to get a car insurance quote before purchasing a vehicle. In fact, most dealerships require you to have insurance coverage in place before you can drive your new car off the lot.
### Will using a fake name or address affect your car insurance quote?
You might get a quote by entering false details, but it won’t be accurate — or valid. Insurance companies verify your information, including your address and driving history, before issuing a policy. If the details don’t match, your rate will change, or the quote may be thrown out altogether. Online estimators are fine for rough estimates, but when it comes time to buy coverage, you’ll need to provide correct information to get a real price.
