## More Nerdy Perspective

One of the biggest factors in how much you pay for homeowners insurance is the amount of coverage you buy. Get too little coverage, and you could find yourself underinsured after a major disaster. Get too much, and you’ll overpay. Here’s how to figure out [how much homeowners insurance you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need).

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Farmers scores highly on this measure, drawing a low proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

**Third-party ratings:** Farmers scored below average in J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[1] Its rating for customer satisfaction was also below average in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study.[2]

* ### What Reddit users say about Farmers

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like home insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  There are quite a few complaints on Reddit about Farmers home insurance. Many people talk about rate hikes, while others say they’ve had trouble with customer service or claims.

## How to file a claim with Farmers

You can submit Farmers home insurance claims through the website or mobile app. You can also report a claim by calling Farmers at 800-435-7764 or contacting your agent.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

Inflation has raised the cost of labor and building supplies, making claims more expensive for home insurers.

**Star rating methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts, claims process and website functionality. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or star ratings.

Here’s how we weighted each category to come up with our list of the best home insurance companies:

* Consumer experience (40%).
* Financial strength (30%).
* Coverage (25%).
* Discounts (5%).

Read our [full home insurance ratings methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-home-insurance) for more details.

**Homeowners insurance rates methodology**

NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from various insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each U.S. state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

In states where credit is a rating factor, we changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for homeowners with poor credit.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
