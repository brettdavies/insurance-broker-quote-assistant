The **State Farm Downtown Building**, variously known as the **State Farm Insurance Building** or the **State Farm Fire Building**, is an [Art Deco](/wiki/Art_Deco "Art Deco") building in downtown [Bloomington, Illinois](/wiki/Bloomington,_Illinois "Bloomington, Illinois"). It served as the corporate headquarters for [State Farm Insurance](/wiki/State_Farm_Insurance "State Farm Insurance") from its construction until 1974.

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_Farm_Downtown_Building&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The first eight-floor section of the building (the south portion) was constructed in 1929.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) In 1934, an additional four floors and a penthouse were added.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) Five years later, [State Farm](/wiki/State_Farm_Insurance "State Farm Insurance") acquired the property directly to the north of the lot the Downtown Building was constructed on.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) That property originally held the [Odd Fellows](/wiki/Odd_Fellows "Odd Fellows") lodge and, after acquisition, State Farm demolished the property's original structure.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) From 1939 to 1940 the company constructed the eight-floor south portion of the Downtown Building complex.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) In 1945, another five stories were added to the original eight floors of the north addition. With construction finished, the complex served as State Farm's [corporate headquarters](/wiki/Corporate_headquarters "Corporate headquarters") until 1974.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2)

State Farm moved the last of its employees from the building in January 2018, and in April 2018 announced its intention to permanently leave the 200,000 square foot building. Having failed to find a buyer, in July 2019 State Farm announced that it would be demolishing the building.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

In October 2019, whether because residents expressed concern about the potential loss of the art deco building or the cost of demolishing was more than donating, State Farm transferred its former downtown headquarters for less than $100 to a developer who expressed plans for a $40 million renovation.

## Architecture

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_Farm_Downtown_Building&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Architecture")]

The State Farm Downtown Building was designed by Archie Schaeffer and Phillip Hooton.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) Their firm, Schaeffer and Hooton, was one of two offshoots of the local firm of Arthur Pillsbury after he was killed in a car accident.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2)[[4]](#cite_note-nrhp-4)[[5]](#cite_note-note1-5) The 162-foot (49 m) building is an example of [Art Deco architecture](/wiki/Art_Deco_architecture "Art Deco architecture"), though the decorative nature of the building is atypical among examples of the style.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) The original south portion of the tower features a large sign on its west facade that reads: "State Farm Insurance". The sign's letters stand five and a half feet tall and since February 18, 1935 the sign has been electrically illuminated.[[6]](#cite_note-time-6) The [steel-framed building](/wiki/Steel-framed_building "Steel-framed building") has facades clad in light brown brick and features [curtain walls](/wiki/Curtain_wall_(architecture) "Curtain wall (architecture)") that hang from the frame.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) The second story [belt course](/wiki/Belt_course "Belt course") features [stonework](/wiki/Stonework "Stonework") including stone light fixtures.[[2]](#cite_note-mcmh-2) The building's [cornice](/wiki/Cornice_(architecture) "Cornice (architecture)") features more stonework and large [medallions](/wiki/Medallion_(architecture) "Medallion (architecture)"). The stonework throughout the building is cast in a variety of stone types that include [pygmatic gneiss](/wiki/Gneiss "Gneiss") and [dolomite](/wiki/Dolomite_(rock) "Dolomite (rock)").[[4]](#cite_note-nrhp-4) The Art Deco medallions are a repeating theme of the structure's facade.[[4]](#cite_note-nrhp-4)

The company's founder, [George Mecherle](/wiki/George_Mecherle "George Mecherle"), moved into an office on the Downtown Building's eighth floor in 1940.[[7]](#cite_note-cip-7) Since 1951, the office has been left intact by the company. State Farm's historian claims that "90% of Mecherle's original material is still in the office."[[7]](#cite_note-cip-7) Inside the office are sales receipts dating to 1936 and guest book entries from 1945. Though the office is not open to the public, the company uses it to impart knowledge of the company's past to new employees.[[7]](#cite_note-cip-7)

## Historic significance

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_Farm_Downtown_Building&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Historic significance")]

The building is listed as a [contributing property](/wiki/Contributing_property "Contributing property") to the [National Register of Historic Places](/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places "National Register of Historic Places") listed [Bloomington Central Business District](/wiki/Bloomington_Central_Business_District "Bloomington Central Business District"), a [historic district](/wiki/Historic_district_(United_States) "Historic district (United States)") encompassing much of downtown Bloomington, Illinois.[[4]](#cite_note-nrhp-4)[[8]](#cite_note-prop-8)
