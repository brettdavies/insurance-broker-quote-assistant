# geico insurance monthly increased NYC

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

this is honestly unfair, i live in NYC and i have a bmw that’s 23 years old, i drive to work and home, i got tickets before covid, so they kept getting pushed back, they hit my record last year so i fully understand the increase from that. ive been driving for over 10 years. and im 28 turning 29 in like 4 months.

i was paying 218 before the points, after the points im paying 418 and next renewal it’s 465!!!!. i didn’t get any new tickets..so wtf is going on.

i’ve been shopping for a nee premium and NO ONE wants to insure a bmw. i had progressive tell me its because my car is “luxury” which i now is complete BS. anyone know what i should do. i’m going to call geico very soon cause this increase is uncalled for and dead wrong. i’m in a financial stand still im trying to get out off and this is making it worse
