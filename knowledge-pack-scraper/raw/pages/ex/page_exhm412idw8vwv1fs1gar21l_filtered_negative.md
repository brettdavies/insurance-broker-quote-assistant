[ValuePenguin](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-washington#method "#method") gathered thousands of quotes for hundreds of ZIP codes from the largest home insurance companies in Washington state. We considered factors such as policy quotes, customer service metrics and coverage benefits to find the best insurance companies in WA.
A Mutual of Enumclaw homeowners policy with $350,000 worth of  dwelling coverage costs $857 per year. That's 42% cheaper than the statewide average of $1,483 per year.

Consider [Allstate](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-homeowners-insurance-review "Allstate Homeowners Insurance Review") if you have a high-value house. It offers rates that are half the state average for both $500,000 and $1 million of [dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?").
[Chubb](https://www.valuepenguin.com/chubb-auto-home-insurance-review "Chubb Insurance Review: Excellent Customer Service, but at a Price") is also a good choice if you own an expensive home in Washington state. It offers extra coverage benefits tailored to [high-value homes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-value-home-insurance "Should I Consider a High-Value Home Insurance Policy?"). However, Chubb has some of the most expensive rates among major Washington state insurance companies.

Homeowners in Washington state should protect themselves against [common natural disasters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-washington#perils "#perils"), such as earthquakes, floods and wildfires. Fortunately, homeowners insurance policies typically cover wildfires.
However, you'll have to buy separate earthquake and [flood policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance-coverage "What Does Flood Insurance Cover, and How Does It Work?") to protect against these perils.

[Read Review](https://www.valuepenguin.com/mutual-of-enumclaw-insurance-review "Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Review")
* **Cost:** $857/yr

Most homeowners insurance policies cover wildfires. However, Mutual of Enumclaw goes one step further by offering customers access to a private firefighting service at no extra cost. In addition, Mutual of Enumclaw sells several extra coverage options including [umbrella insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?") and cybersecurity fraud protection.
Mutual of Enumclaw also sells auto insurance policies. Although it's cheaper than the Washington state average, it's not the [most affordable option in WA](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-washington "Best Cheap Car Insurance Quotes in Washington"). However, it may make sense to buy both policies through Mutual of Enumclaw if you plan on taking advantage of its home-auto bundling discount.

All Pemco homeowners policies include water backup coverage as a standard feature. That means you could save thousands of dollars  if your basement floods because of a backed-up pipe. With other companies, you usually have to buy this coverage as a separate add-on.

[Chubb](https://www.valuepenguin.com/chubb-auto-home-insurance-review "Chubb Insurance Review: Excellent Customer Service, but at a Price") is a company that specializes in insuring high-value homes. It offers higher limits and more coverage options than many of its competitors. However, you can only buy a Chubb policy from an independent agent. The Chubb website only lists five agents for the entire state of Washington.

An average homeowners policy in Deer Harbor, a small island town near the Canadian border, costs $1,319 per year for $350,000 of [dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?"). By contrast, Parker, a small town in the Yakama Indian Reservation, has the most expensive homeowners insurance quotes in Washington state, with an average annual cost of $2,023.

Fortunately, most homeowners insurance policies cover damage from wildfires. However, if you live in a high-risk area, you may have a hard time finding an affordable policy. If that's the case, you may need to buy a more expensive type of home insurance of last resort, called a [FAIR plan policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/fair-plans-and-how-do-you-insure-high-risk-home "Compare FAIR Plans for High-Risk Home Insurance").
You may need to buy [flood insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance-coverage "What Does Flood Insurance Cover, and How Does It Work?") if you live in an area at high risk for flooding, such as river valleys and coastal areas. This includes many heavily populated parts of Washington including much of the Puget Sound region and parts of the greater Spokane area.
If you live west of the Cascade Mountains, you're at high risk for earthquakes. That means you should consider [getting earthquake insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/earthquake-insurance "Earthquake Insurance, Explained") if your own savings wouldn't cover the cost of repairing or rebuilding your house after a major earthquake.

[Mutual of Enumclaw](https://www.valuepenguin.com/mutual-of-enumclaw-insurance-review "Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Review") has the cheapest homeowners insurance in WA. It costs $857 per year for $350,000 of dwelling coverage. That's 42% cheaper than the Washington state average.
