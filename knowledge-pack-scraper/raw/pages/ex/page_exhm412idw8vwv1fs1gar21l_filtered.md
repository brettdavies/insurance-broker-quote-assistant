Mutual of Enumclaw has the best combination of service, coverage and cheap rates for Washington state homeowners.

**Pros:**

* Strong customer service
* Large network of local agents
* Extra protection against wildfires

**Cons:**

* Online quotes unavailable

More about Mutual of Enumclaw

Homeowners insurance from Mutual of Enumclaw costs 35% to 48% less than the WA state average.

In addition to its low rates, Mutual of Enumclaw gets significantly fewer complaints compared to an average company its size. That means you can trust Mutual of Enumclaw to get your claim processed quickly and efficiently after an accident.

Mutual of Enumclaw doesn't sell homeowners insurance online. You'll have to call an agent to get set up with a quote. For some Washington residents, the personalized service offered by a local agent outweighs that inconvenience. However, if you prefer to buy insurance online or through an app, you may be better off with a competitor.

Most homeowners insurance policies cover wildfires. However, Mutual of Enumclaw goes one step further by offering customers access to a private firefighting service at no extra cost. In addition, Mutual of Enumclaw sells several extra coverage options including [umbrella insurance](/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?") and cybersecurity fraud protection.

Mutual of Enumclaw also sells auto insurance policies. Although it's cheaper than the Washington state average, it's not the [most affordable option in WA](/best-cheap-car-insurance-washington "Best Cheap Car Insurance Quotes in Washington"). However, it may make sense to buy both policies through Mutual of Enumclaw if you plan on taking advantage of its home-auto bundling discount.

The Chubb website only lists five agents for the entire state of Washington.

In addition, Chubb often requires its customers to meet stricter requirements about the type and condition of their home compared to other companies. For example, it may decide not to insure your home if it's deemed too old or too small.

## Natural disasters to watch out for in WA

**Common natural disasters in Washington state include earthquakes, wildfires and flooding.**

![fire icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90//icons/fire)

Fortunately, most homeowners insurance policies cover damage from wildfires. However, if you live in a high-risk area, you may have a hard time finding an affordable policy. If that's the case, you may need to buy a more expensive type of home insurance of last resort, called a [FAIR plan policy](/homeowners-insurance/fair-plans-and-how-do-you-insure-high-risk-home "Compare FAIR Plans for High-Risk Home Insurance").

These government-backed policies are sold by private companies. You can get FAIR coverage if you're having a hard time getting regular homeowners insurance.

You'll have to buy separate insurance policies to protect yourself against flooding and earthquakes.

![flood icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90//icons/flood)

You may need to buy [flood insurance](/flood-insurance-coverage "What Does Flood Insurance Cover, and How Does It Work?") if you live in an area at high risk for flooding, such as river valleys and coastal areas. This includes many heavily populated parts of Washington including much of the Puget Sound region and parts of the greater Spokane area.

If you live west of the Cascade Mountains, you're at high risk for earthquakes. That means you should consider [getting earthquake insurance](/earthquake-insurance "Earthquake Insurance, Explained") if your own savings wouldn't cover the cost of repairing or rebuilding your house after a major earthquake.

Washington residents who live east of the mountains in cities like Spokane, Pasco and Yakima have less to worry about, although they're not entirely free from risk.

## How to save money on home insurance in WA

Compare quotes to save on your Washington state homeowners policy.

One of the best ways to save on homeowners insurance is to shop around and compare quotes and coverage. For example, you could save nearly $2,000 per year just by switching from Country Financial to Mutual of Enumclaw.

When shopping for Washington state homeowners insurance, it's a good idea to see what discounts you qualify for. For example, Pemco advertises six different discounts for Washington homeowners including an educator discount for anyone who has ever worked at a school or university. Allstate also offers multiple discounts for homeowners including ones for paying on time and in full.

Finally, you can adjust your coverage by raising your deductible to get a better rate. Keep in mind that you have to meet your deductible before your homeowners insurance will pay out. Ideally, you should always be able to pay your deductible from your savings.
