Plus, if you're the type who likes doing everything online and through apps (no judgment, we get it), Progressive's got you covered with a pretty slick digital setup.<br>But here's where it gets tricky. Remember those complaint numbers we talked about? Yeah, they're not great. So if you're someone who wants white-glove service and expects your insurance company to hold your hand through every little thing, Progressive might leave you hanging.<br>Think about it this way: if you want the insurance equivalent of a luxury hotel experience, you're probably better off with someone like State Farm or USAA. But if you're cool with a solid budget airline experience \u2013 gets the job done, saves you money, but don't expect champagne service \u2013 then Progressive could work for you.<br>It's really about knowing yourself. Are you the \"set it and forget it\" type who just wants cheap, reliable coverage? Or are you someone who wants to be able to call your local agent and chat about your policy over coffee?"}},{"@type":"Question","url":"https://www.riskguarder.com/progressive-home-insurance-review/#faq-question-1751278699365","name":"Who underwrites Progressive's home insurance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Okay, this is where things get a little confusing, so stick with me. Progressive isn't actually writing your home insurance policy \u2013 they're basically playing matchmaker between you and other insurance companies.<br>Think of it like this: you go to Progressive thinking you're getting Progressive insurance, but they're actually saying \"Hey, let me hook you up with my friend ASI\" or whoever else they work with in your area. It's like going to a restaurant that doesn't actually cook the food \u2013 they just take your order and have someone else make it.<br>This matters more than you might think! The company that actually writes your policy is the one you'll be dealing with when things go sideways. So even though you're paying Progressive and their name is on your bill, when you file a claim, you might be talking to completely different people with different ways of doing things.<br>It's kind of like ordering an Uber but not knowing which driver you're getting until they show up. Sometimes you get the guy with the spotless car and water bottles, sometimes you get... well, not that guy.<br>When you're getting quotes, definitely ask which company will actually be handling your policy. Trust me, it makes a difference when you're trying to figure out why your claim is taking forever to process."}},{"@type":"Question","url":"https://www.riskguarder.com/progressive-home-insurance-review/#faq-question-1751278884146","name":"How do I file a claim with Progressive?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Filing a Progressive home insurance claim involves several straightforward steps, though the specific process may vary depending on your underwriting company:<br><strong>Report the claim immediately</strong>\u00a0by calling Progressive's 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-776-4737 or filing online through their website or mobile app<br><strong>Document the damage</strong>\u00a0thoroughly with photographs and videos before making temporary repairs to prevent further loss<br><strong>Secure your property</strong>\u00a0by making reasonable temporary repairs to prevent additional damage, keeping receipts for reimbursement<br><strong>Meet with the adjuster</strong>\u00a0who will inspect the damage and assess coverage under your specific policy terms<br><strong>Review the settlement</strong>\u00a0offer carefully and ask questions about any coverage decisions you don't understand<br><strong>Complete required paperwork</strong>\u00a0promptly to avoid delays in claim resolution<br>And if things start going south and you feel like you're getting the runaround? Don't just sit there and take it. Start climbing the ladder \u2013 ask to speak to a supervisor, then their supervisor, and so on. Still not getting anywhere? Your state insurance commissioner is basically the insurance police, and they don't mess around. Sometimes just mentioning you're thinking about filing a complaint with them can magically make things move faster.<br>It's not fun having to be the squeaky wheel, but sometimes that's what it takes to get the grease \u2013 er, the claim payment."}}]},{"@type":"Person","@id":"https://www.riskguarder.com/progressive-home-insurance-review/#author","name":"RiskGuarder.com","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://www.riskguarder.com/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/af706e84e7ee925497e210df4be50fff.jpg?ver=1762434559","url":"https://www.riskguarder.com/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/af706e84e7ee925497e210df4be50fff.jpg?ver=1762434559","caption":"RiskGuarder.com","inLanguage":"en-US"},"sameAs":["http://riskguarder.com"],"worksFor":{"@id":"https://www.riskguarder.com/#organization"}},{"@type":"Article","headline":"Progressive Home Insurance: 3.8/5 Rating Exposed","keywords":"Progressive home insurance,Progressive,Progressive homeowners insurance,Home insurance claims,Insurance coverage","datePublished":"2025-06-30T10:59:25+00:00","dateModified":"2025-06-30T10:59:26+00:00","articleSection":"Homeowners Insurance","author":{"@id":"https://www.riskguarder.com/progressive-home-insurance-review/#author","name":"RiskGuarder.com"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.riskguarder.com/#organization"},"description":"Progressive Home Insurance review : 3.8/5 rating, higher complaints than average.

But here’s the thing: being great at car insurance doesn’t automatically make you awesome at home insurance too.</p><p>So we dug deep to find out if Progressive’s home insurance is actually worth it, or if you’re better off looking elsewhere.

Zero dollars. Nada. That means we can actually give you the straight truth without worrying about hurting anyone’s feelings.</p><p>We’ve got this whole system for rating insurance companies that looks at five main things: how financially stable they are (nobody wants their insurer going belly-up), how many complaints they get, what customers actually think about them, what they cover, and how many discounts they offer. It’s like a report card for grown-ups, but way more important.</p><p>We crunch all these numbers so you don’t have to. Think of us as that friend who actually reads all the fine print and then tells you what matters. If you’re curious about exactly how we do this whole rating thing, you can check out <a href="https://www.riskguarder.com/our-review-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our full methodology</a> – but honestly, the main thing is that we’re not just making stuff up or copying what everyone else says.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="progressive-home-insurance-coverage-what-you-actually-get">Progressive Home Insurance Coverage: What You Actually Get</h2><p>Okay, here’s where things get a little weird with Progressive. They’re not actually the ones writing your home insurance policy – plot twist! They’re more like a middleman who shops around and finds you coverage through other companies. It’s like going to a travel agent instead of booking directly with the airline.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-you-actually-get"><strong>What You Actually Get:</strong></h3><p>Don’t worry, you still get all the basic stuff your mortgage company wants to see. Your house itself is covered (that’s the big one), plus your detached garage, shed, or that fancy fence you spent way too much on. Your stuff inside is protected too, though heads up – the basic coverage only pays what your old couch is worth today, not what you paid for it five years ago.</p><p>If something happens and you can’t live in your house, they’ll help with hotel bills and eating out every night (silver lining?). And if someone gets hurt on your property, you’re covered for the lawsuit that might follow. Because apparently, that’s a thing we have to worry about now.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-extra-stuff-thats-actually-pretty-important"><strong>The Extra Stuff (That’s Actually Pretty Important):</strong></h3><p>Here’s where Progressive gets more interesting. They’ve got add-ons for things that’ll make you go “Oh crap, I never thought of that.” Like what happens when your sewer backs up into your basement – gross, but it happens more than you’d think.</p><p>You can also upgrade to get full replacement cost for your stuff, which means if your TV gets destroyed, you get enough money to buy a new one, not whatever your old one was worth. There’s identity theft protection (because 2024 is fun like that), coverage for your home business, and help if you have to rebuild to newer building codes.</p><p>Just remember, what you actually get depends on which company ends up writing your policy. It’s like ordering from a restaurant that uses different kitchens – the menu looks the same, but the food might taste different.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-real-cost-an-analysis-of-progressives-premiums-discounts">The Real Cost: An Analysis of Progressive’s Premiums &amp; Discounts</h2><p>So here’s how Progressive figures out what to charge you – and honestly, it’s pretty much like everyone else, with a few twists.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://www.riskguarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Progressive-homeowners-insurance-1024x630.webp" alt="Progressive homeowners insurance" class="wp-image-5049"></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-makes-your-bill-go-up-or-down"><strong>What Makes Your Bill Go Up or Down:</strong></h3><p>Where you live is huge. Live near the ocean? You’re paying extra for hurricane risk. Live in tornado alley? Same deal. Your house’s age matters too – newer homes usually get better rates because they’re less likely to have that “surprise electrical fire” moment.</p><p>They’ll also look at whether you’ve filed claims before (they really don’t like that) and your credit score. Yeah, I know, your credit score affects everything these days. It’s annoying, but that’s the world we live in.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-good-news-discounts-galore"><strong>The Good News – Discounts Galore:</strong></h3><p>Progressive throws discounts around like confetti, which is nice. The biggest one is bundling your home and car insurance – we’re talking 5-25% off, which isn’t pocket change. Got a new house? Discount. Haven’t filed claims? Discount. Have a security system? You guessed it – discount.</p><p>They’ll even give you a tiny discount for going paperless (because saving trees apparently saves you money) and another one if you’re over 55. Don’t smoke? That’s a discount too, because your house is less likely to burn down.</p><p>The catch is that getting an actual quote means jumping through some hoops. Their online tool gives you a ballpark figure, but for the real deal, especially if you’ve got a fancy house, they’ll want to take a closer look first.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-customer-experience-claims-complaints-real-world-feedback">The Customer Experience: Claims, Complaints &amp; Real-World Feedback</h2><p>Alright, time for the real talk. We looked at the official numbers AND what actual customers are saying, and… well, let’s just say Progressive’s home insurance isn’t winning any popularity contests.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://www.riskguarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Home-insurance-claims-1024x630.webp" alt="Home insurance claims" class="wp-image-5046"></figure><p><strong>The Numbers Don’t Lie:</strong></p><p>Progressive gets 45% more complaints than the average insurance company. That’s not great, Bob. And it’s been consistently high for three years running, so it’s not just a bad year – it’s a pattern.</p><p><a href="https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/file/2024-09/2024103%20U.S.%20Home%20Insurance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.D. Power</a> ranked them #15 out of 23 companies in their latest study. That’s like getting a C- when you’re used to getting A’s in auto insurance. Their customers are particularly unhappy with claims handling and customer service.</p><p><strong>What Real People Are Saying:</strong></p><p>We went down the rabbit hole of customer reviews – <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/insurance/progressive-homeowners-insurance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ConsumerAffairs</a>, <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/progressive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trustpilot</a>, even Reddit (because that’s where people really vent). And boy, did we find some stories.</p><p>The pattern is pretty clear: people like Progressive when everything’s going smoothly, but when stuff hits the fan and they need to file a claim, that’s when the problems start. Think long wait times, getting bounced around between different people, and feeling like they’re getting the runaround.</p><p>One Reddit user summed it up perfectly: “Progressive was great until I needed to file a claim.” Ouch.</p><p><strong>Common Customer Praises:</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Streamlined online quote process with competitive initial rates</li><li>Convenient bundling options for existing auto customers</li><li>User-friendly mobile app for policy management</li><li>Responsive customer service for routine policy questions</li><li>Competitive rates for customers with clean records</li></ul><p><strong>Common Customer Complaints:</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Significant premium increases at renewal, often 15-30% annually</li><li>Lengthy claims processing times, particularly for complex losses</li><li>Difficulty reaching dedicated claims adjusters during active claims</li><li>Coverage disputes over policy interpretations and exclusions</li><li>Limited local agent support compared to traditional carriers</li><li>Inconsistent service quality depending on the underlying underwriter</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="progressive-vs-the-competition"><strong>Progressive vs. The Competition</strong></h2><p>Comparing Progressive against established homeowners insurance leaders reveals important distinctions that influence long-term customer satisfaction and value.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://www.riskguarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Insurance-coverage-1024x630.webp" alt="Insurance coverage" class="wp-image-5047"></figure><figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th><strong>Metric</strong></th><th><strong>Progressive</strong></th><th><strong>State Farm</strong></th><th><strong>Allstate</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>A.M.

Their below-average complaint index and higher J.D.

Their complaint index remains near the industry average, while their discount portfolio rivals Progressive’s breadth. However, their claims satisfaction scores have declined in recent years.</p><p>Progressive’s competitive advantage lies primarily in their aggressive pricing for bundled customers and digital-first approach. However, their elevated complaint rates and below-average satisfaction scores suggest potential challenges for customers who experience claims or require extensive customer service support.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div id="rank-math-faq" class="rank-math-block"><div class="rank-math-list "><div id="faq-question-1751278547584" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>Is Progressive good for home insurance?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>So here’s the bottom line: Progressive can be a solid choice, but it really depends on what you’re looking for.<br>If you’re already getting your car insurance through Progressive, you’re probably gonna love the bundling discount – we’re talking some serious money off your bill. Plus, if you’re the type who likes doing everything online and through apps (no judgment, we get it), Progressive’s got you covered with a pretty slick digital setup.<br>But here’s where it gets tricky. Remember those complaint numbers we talked about? Yeah, they’re not great. So if you’re someone who wants white-glove service and expects your insurance company to hold your hand through every little thing, Progressive might leave you hanging.<br>Think about it this way: if you want the insurance equivalent of a luxury hotel experience, you’re probably better off with someone like State Farm or USAA. But if you’re cool with a solid budget airline experience – gets the job done, saves you money, but don’t expect champagne service – then Progressive could work for you.<br>It’s really about knowing yourself. Are you the “set it and forget it” type who just wants cheap, reliable coverage? Or are you someone who wants to be able to call your local agent and chat about your policy over coffee?</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1751278699365" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question ">Who underwrites Progressive’s home insurance?</h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Okay, this is where things get a little confusing, so stick with me. Progressive isn’t actually writing your home insurance policy – they’re basically playing matchmaker between you and other insurance companies.<br>Think of it like this: you go to Progressive thinking you’re getting Progressive insurance, but they’re actually saying “Hey, let me hook you up with my friend ASI” or whoever else they work with in your area. It’s like going to a restaurant that doesn’t actually cook the food – they just take your order and have someone else make it.<br>This matters more than you might think! The company that actually writes your policy is the one you’ll be dealing with when things go sideways. So even though you’re paying Progressive and their name is on your bill, when you file a claim, you might be talking to completely different people with different ways of doing things.<br>It’s kind of like ordering an Uber but not knowing which driver you’re getting until they show up. Sometimes you get the guy with the spotless car and water bottles, sometimes you get… well, not that guy.<br>When you’re getting quotes, definitely ask which company will actually be handling your policy. Trust me, it makes a difference when you’re trying to figure out why your claim is taking forever to process.</p></div></div><div id="faq-question-1751278884146" class="rank-math-list-item"><h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>How do I file a claim with Progressive?</strong></h3><div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Filing a Progressive home insurance claim involves several straightforward steps, though the specific process may vary depending on your underwriting company:<br><strong>Report the claim immediately</strong>&nbsp;by calling Progressive’s 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-776-4737 or filing online through their website or mobile app<br><strong>Document the damage</strong>&nbsp;thoroughly with photographs and videos before making temporary repairs to prevent further loss<br><strong>Secure your property</strong>&nbsp;by making reasonable temporary repairs to prevent additional damage, keeping receipts for reimbursement<br><strong>Meet with the adjuster</strong>&nbsp;who will inspect the damage and assess coverage under your specific policy terms<br><strong>Review the settlement</strong>&nbsp;offer carefully and ask questions about any coverage decisions you don’t understand<br><strong>Complete required paperwork</strong>&nbsp;promptly to avoid delays in claim resolution<br>And if things start going south and you feel like you’re getting the runaround? Don’t just sit there and take it. Start climbing the ladder – ask to speak to a supervisor, then their supervisor, and so on. Still not getting anywhere? Your state insurance commissioner is basically the insurance police, and they don’t mess around. Sometimes just mentioning you’re thinking about filing a complaint with them can magically make things move faster.<br>It’s not fun having to be the squeaky wheel, but sometimes that’s what it takes to get the grease – er, the claim payment.</p></div></div></div></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="final-verdict-is-progressive-home-insurance-right-for-you">Final Verdict: Is Progressive Home Insurance Right for You?</h2><p>Alright, let’s wrap this up with some real talk. <a href="https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Progressive home insurance</a> is kind of like that friend who’s great to hang out with but maybe not the person you’d call in a crisis.</p><p>Here’s the deal: if you’re already with Progressive for your car and you love saving money (who doesn’t?), then bundling your home insurance with them makes a lot of sense. You’ll get a nice discount, and their app-based approach is pretty convenient if you’re into managing everything from your phone.</p><p>But – and this is a big but – those complaint numbers we talked about? They’re telling a story. Progressive is really good at getting you signed up with competitive prices and slick marketing, but when it comes to keeping you happy long-term, especially when you actually need them… well, let’s just say there’s room for improvement.</p><p>Remember that whole “they’re not actually your insurer” thing? Yeah, that can bite you when you’re trying to get a claim handled and you’re not sure who’s supposed to be helping you. It’s like calling customer service and getting transferred three times before finding someone who actually knows what’s going on.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="progressive-is-an-excellent-choice-if-you"><strong>Progressive is an excellent choice if you:</strong></h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Currently have Progressive auto insurance and qualify for significant multi-policy discounts</li><li>Prefer managing insurance policies through mobile apps and online platforms</li><li>Have a clean claims history and minimal customer service requirements</li><li>Value competitive initial pricing over long-term rate stability</li><li>Live in areas where Progressive’s underwriting partners offer strong local presence</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="consider-alternatives-if-you"><strong>Consider alternatives if you:</strong></h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Prioritize premium customer service and local agent relationships</li><li>Have complex properties requiring specialized coverage expertise</li><li>Prefer carriers with below-average complaint rates and higher satisfaction scores</li><li>Need extensive claims support or have experienced previous coverage disputes</li><li>Seek long-term rate stability over initial pricing advantages</li></ul><p>Look, if you’re the type who just wants decent coverage at a good price and you don’t plan on filing claims anytime soon, Progressive could work out great for you. But if you’re someone who wants to feel confident that your insurance company will have your back when things get messy, you might want to look at companies with better track records for customer service.</p><p>My advice? Don’t just shop on price alone. Get quotes from a few different companies – yeah, it’s a pain, but so is dealing with a crappy insurance company when your roof is leaking. Compare what they cover, what discounts they offer, and definitely read some reviews to see how they handle claims.</p><p>At the end of the day, the best insurance company is the one that fits YOUR situation and priorities. Just make sure you know what you’re getting into before you sign on the dotted line.</p><p><em>This review is based on publicly available data and customer feedback as of June 2024.
