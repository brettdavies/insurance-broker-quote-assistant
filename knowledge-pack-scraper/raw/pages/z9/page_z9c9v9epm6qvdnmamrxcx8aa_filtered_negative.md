Additionally, could you afford to pay out of pocket for medical or repair bills caused by an uninsured driver?” Carole Walker, director of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Association, a nonprofit consumer insurance information organization, says.

* Choose if you and your passengers have health insurance to indicate if you need medical payment or personal injury protection
If you choose the lowest rates, the calculator shows the least coverage that will meet your needs. On the other hand, the best coverage choice shows the coverage levels that provide the best possible protection.
“Many financial experts recommend carrying at least $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence- commonly expressed as "100/300." Consider what assets you have to protect and what you can afford when deciding how much to purchase,” Walker says.
---|---
State minimum coverage is generally not enough to protect you in the event of even a moderately serious accident. Medical bills can climb quickly, and property damage can easily exceed state minimum limits.
Your loan or lease may require it, but even if you own your car, comprehensive and collision coverage are the only way to ensure your car is covered in the event of an at-fault accident, single-vehicle accident, theft, vandalism or any other damage to your car where another driver isn’t at fault.
