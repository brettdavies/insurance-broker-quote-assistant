## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Georgia's mandated coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay for your totaled or damaged vehicle due to a covered incident, regardless of fault — so if you're not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after an accident, it can make sense to add these physical damage coverages even if you don't have a car loan or lease.
