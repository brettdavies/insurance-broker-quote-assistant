##  What Is the Coinsurance Formula?
The [coinsurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinsurance.asp) formula is the [homeowners insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp) formula that determines the amount of reimbursement that a homeowner will receive from a claim. The coinsurance formula becomes effective when a homeowner fails to maintain coverage of at least 80% of the home's replacement value. Those who file a claim in this situation will only receive partial reimbursement according to the formula.
* The coinsurance formula is applied when a property owner fails to maintain coverage of at least 80% of the home's replacement value.
* If a property owner insures for less than the amount required by the coinsurance clause, they essentially agree to retain part of the risk.
* In this case, the owner becomes a "co-insurer" and will share any loss with the insurance company according to the coinsurance formula.
##  How the Coinsurance Formula Works
Coinsurance is a clause used in insurance contracts on property insurance policies such as homeowners insurance. The clause ensures policyholders insure their property to an appropriate value and that the insurer receives a fair [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp) for the risk. If you have an outstanding mortgage loan on the property, your mortgage lender will likely require you to have a minimum amount of coverage.
Coinsurance is usually expressed as a percentage. Most coinsurance clauses require policyholders to insure 80%, 90%, or 100% of a property's actual value. For instance, a building valued at $1,000,000 replacement value with a coinsurance clause of 90% must be insured for no less than $900,000. The same building with an 80% coinsurance clause must be insured for no less than $800,000.
If a property owner insures a property for less than the amount required by the coinsurance clause, they become a "co-insurer" and will share the loss with the insurance company according to the coinsurance formula.
##  Examples of the Coinsurance Formula
Here are two examples that demonstrate how the coinsurance clause works.
###  Example 1: Inadequate Amount of Coverage
##  [(Actual amount of insurance / Required amount of insurance) X amount of loss] - deductible = Amount of claim paid by the insurer
* ($600,000 actual coverage / $800,000 required coverage) = 0.75 or 75% of the required minimum coverage
The insurance company will pay $225,000 of the claim despite $300,000 worth of damage. The owner absorbs a $75,000 coinsurance penalty since they did not buy enough coverage. Therefore, the owner pays out of pocket for 25% of the loss.
###  Example 2: Adequate Amount of Coverage
If the building had been insured to the amount required by the coinsurance clause (in this case, 80%), the coinsurance calculation would look like this:
[(_Actual_ amount of insurance /  _Required_ amount of insurance) X amount of loss] - deductible = Amount of claim paid by the insurer
* ($800,000 actual coverage / $800,000 required coverage) = 1; required coverage satisfied
