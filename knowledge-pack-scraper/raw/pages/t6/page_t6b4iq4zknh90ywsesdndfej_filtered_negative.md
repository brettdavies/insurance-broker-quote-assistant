# Do I Need a Lawyer for Progressive Claims?
Jacob@MadisonAvenueMA.com | December 27, 2024 | [Personal Injury](https://lawredo.com/blog/category/personal-injury/)
![Do I Need a Lawyer for Progressive Claims?](https://lawredo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-I-Need-a-Lawyer-for-Progressive-Claims-scaled.jpg)
[Progressive](https://www.progressive.com) is a leading provider of auto insurance, holding a substantial 15% market share in the United States. Depending on the circumstances of your [car accident](http://lawredo.com/laredo-car-accident-lawyer/), you may or may not need a lawyer to help you demand fair compensation in a Progressive claim.
## Mandatory Auto Liability Insurance in Texas
Texas, like most other states, requires drivers with cars licensed in the state to carry a certain minimum amount of auto liability insurance. The short form is “[30/60/25](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html),” which means:
* $30,000 per person for injury liability,
* $60,000 per accident for injury liability, and
* $25,000 per accident for property damage.
It is important to note that liability insurance doesn’t pay for your own injuries or damages. It only pays for damages you cause to others.
## The Texas Fault-Based Liability Insurance System
About a dozen US states apply a no-fault system to auto accidents. In these states, drivers typically apply to their own insurance to pay their bills, regardless of fault. Texas is not one of these states. In Texas, you can sue the at-fault driver or file a third-party claim against their liability insurance carrier. That’s why you need liability insurance–in case somebody files a claim against you.
## Red Flags That Indicate You Need a Lawyer
Following is a list of just a few red flags that might indicate you need a lawyer. A complete list might include more than a hundred items. Generally speaking, large or complex claims typically require the assistance of a lawyer. Cases in which you might be more likely to need a lawyer include:
* **Wrongful death**: Survivors can seek compensation when a loved one dies due to another’s actions. These high-value [wrongful death](http://lawredo.com/laredo-wrongful-death-lawyer/) claims often face strong resistance from defendants, making legal representation crucial.
* **Catastrophic injury**: Catastrophic injury accidents, such as accidents causing paralysis, amputation, or lifelong disability, work a lot like wrongful death claims. The claim value is high, prompting the other side to fight hard to win.
* **Severely diminished earning capacity**: Even non-catastrophic injuries can lead to substantial financial losses if they impact your ability to work in a high-earning profession. A lawyer can help quantify and prove these losses.
* **Comparative negligence**: In Texas, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault, and claims are barred if you’re more than 50% at fault. A lawyer can advocate for a fair fault determination.
* **The statute of limitations deadline is looming**: Texas generally allows you two years after the date of your injury to either file a lawsuit or finalize a settlement. Exceptions to the statute of limitations deadline can sometimes extend this two-year period. If the statute of limitations deadline is approaching, you’ll have to rush to put your case together, and that’s why you will need a lawyer.
* **Medical malpractice claims**: A [medical malpractice](http://lawredo.com/laredo-medical-malpractice-lawyer-near-you/) claim arises when a healthcare professional injures you through medical negligence. Medical malpractice claims are scientifically complex, and the use of expert witnesses is routine.
* **Product liability claims**: Injuries from [products](http://lawredo.com/laredo-product-liability-lawyer/), like dangerous medications, often involve complex litigation and well-funded corporate defenses, necessitating skilled legal support.
Having skilled legal representation can make all the difference in navigating the above complex claims, as well as many others.
## The Sooner You Hire a Lawyer, the Better
If you decide to hire a personal injury lawyer in Laredo, Texas, it’s crucial to act promptly, even if the statute of limitations deadline is still years away. Starting your claim as soon as possible helps preserve critical evidence and ensures witness memories remain fresh.
