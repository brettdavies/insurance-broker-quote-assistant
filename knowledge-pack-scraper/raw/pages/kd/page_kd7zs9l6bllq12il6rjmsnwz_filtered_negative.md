Florida Tort Law Update (March 2023)
The Florida legislature passed a series of new laws in March 2023 that, for example, reduced the statute of limitations (the time in which you have to file a lawsuit) for negligence cases from (4) years to (2) years. Several other legal rights were amended or removed as well. The Firm is in the process of amending much of the content on the website to conform to these new laws. Our website has always been intended to be informational in nature and not to provide legal advice. You should contact our firm or other lawyers to verify any information.
