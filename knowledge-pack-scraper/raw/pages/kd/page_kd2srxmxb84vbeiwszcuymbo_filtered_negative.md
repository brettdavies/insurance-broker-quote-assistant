![Family of four sitting on the back of their van.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/auto-insurance-foreign-drivers.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Navigating the [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) world can be difficult, especially for foreign drivers in the United States. Whether you’re just visiting or planning a move to the U.S., there are specific requirements for driving that may differ from other countries. That is why understanding when auto insurance is needed and what coverages to include may be important before you begin your travels.
If your time in the U.S. is short, many [rental car companies offer insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-car-insurance) when you rent a vehicle. This temporary coverage is often adequate for short trips. You can choose from various coverage options, including liability, collision and comprehensive insurance, depending on your needs and the level of risk you're comfortable with. To help determine "How much liability insurance do I need?", research the state’s minimum requirements and consider additional coverage for more security.
## Can I obtain car insurance with an international driver’s license?
Yes, it may be possible for the short term. However, there may be cases where some insurance companies don’t offer insurance for foreign drivers until you have a U.S. driver’s license. Depending on the country you’re from and the state you’ll be driving in while in the U.S., you may be able to use your home country’s driver’s license. In addition, you can obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), sometimes referred to as an [international driver’s license](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/international-drivers-license), which allows you to drive legally in the U.S. and many other countries. If you are driving on your country’s license, it may only be allowed for three months, whereas an IDP could allow up to one year. Check with your local DMV and insurance company to see what rules may apply to your specific situation.
When it comes to [car insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/first-car-insurance-policy-what-should-you-know.html "First Car Insurance Policy What Should You Know"), various factors can influence cost such as the [coverage that you choose](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need.html "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need"). Also, if you don't have a driving history established in the U.S., you may be considered a "new driver.” Finding the right auto insurance can seem overwhelming, but these key steps could help simplify your decision-making process:
To help determine what type of car insurance is required, contact the [DMV in your state](https://ivannovation.com/blog/the-mega-list-of-every-states-drivers-license-department/). [Most states ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state)require at least [liability coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), which generally pays for property damage and medical costs for injuries to others if you are considered at fault in an accident.
Some states have minimum coverage requirements to help cover your own expenses. Coverage for your medical expenses is called [Personal Injury Protection](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-first-party-medical-and-pip-coverage) (PIP) or Medical Payments Coverage (MPC). Which coverage is available to you depends on the state where you are seeking coverage. In certain states it's mandatory in addition to liability coverage. To help pay for damage to your vehicle resulting from a car accident, you would need [collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) which is not mandatory in any state. You may want to consider this coverage if you get in a car crash and don't have the money to repair your car.
If you'd like more information on the topic, State Farm offers [various types of coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options) and you can speak with an agent to help review your options.
Aside from liability coverage and PIP coverage, some states may require [additional coverages](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) such as uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage. Both coverage types may help cover expenses if you’re in an accident with someone who hits you and doesn't have insurance or whose coverage doesn't cover the resulting damages or medical costs.
[Driving without insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/the-real-costs-of-a-non-moving-or-moving-violation) can result in penalties that may include fines or the risk of having your license and registration suspended or revoked.
In short, when it comes to insurance in the U.S., there's a lot to learn. You don't need to know it all, though. A State Farm agent can help explain often in the language that you speak. There are plenty of agents that are bilingual or that have bilingual staff, which can be found in the advanced search options on the [Find a State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent) page.
Before traveling to the U.S. check with your auto insurance carrier to verify coverage for your trip. If you are moving to the U.S. you’ll need to [register your car at the DMV](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-register-car-dmv) of your new home state and obtain insurance.
You can get an [auto insurance quote](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) now, or [give us a few details](https://www.statefarm.com/lead/contact?event=SimpleInsights-auto) and a State Farm agent will reach out to you.
