## How much does car insurance cost in New York per month?
In New York, a full coverage car insurance policy with 100/300/100 limits typically costs about $156 per month.
Opting for monthly car insurance payments can be a budget-friendly strategy for some people. It allows for spreading the cost throughout the year, making it easier to manage than a hefty annual payment. This approach provides more flexibility and avoids the burden of a large upfront sum.
On the other hand, paying for car insurance in full at renewal time can often result in a discount. Ultimately, your best option will depend on your needs and circumstances.

---|---  
State Minimum – Liability Only BI/PD | $61

Full Coverage – 100/300/100 Liability BI/PD with $500 Comp/Coll Deductible | $156   
## Final thoughts on choosing car insurance in New York
There’s no one best car insurance for everyone. Some drivers are willing to pay a bit more for outstanding customer service, some want the lowest rates, others prefer carriers who can handle claims and payments through mobile apps and some prefer agents.
It’s really important to figure out what you need and find the best insurance policy for your car without breaking the bank while driving in New York.
