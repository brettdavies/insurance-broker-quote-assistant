Did you know that, depending on factors like the value of the damaged property or whether the act was committed without proper authorization, the criminal penalties imposed can escalate quickly? When a person commits criminal damage to property, the incident is more than a trespass; it is an allegation that can lead to severe legal consequences. We at[ _Hirsch Law Group_](https://hirschlawgroup.com/) understand the intricacies of these charges and the distress they can create.

* **Vandalism (**[**_720 ILCS 5/21_**](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K21-1)**)**: It might involve destroying crops or breaking windows, acts where individuals willfully damage public or private property.
* **Arson (**[**_720 ILCS 5/20_**](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K20-1)**)**: This is when someone recklessly, perhaps with fire or an explosive, damages property. Consider the gravity of being a property owner watching your assets engulfed by flames.
* **Defacement (**[**_720 ILCS 5/21-1.3_**](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K21-1.3)**)**: Picture an artist’s mural tarnished with graffiti—this, too, is a form of property crime.
Facing charges for criminal damage to property can be devastating, and for those seeking justice, a[ _Chicago property crimes attorney_](https://hirschlawgroup.com/chicago-property-crimes-attorney/) may be the ally they need.
For[ _criminal damages_](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt.+21,+Subdiv.+1&ActID=1876&ChapterID=53&SeqStart=65000000&SeqEnd=65800000) not exceedingly significant, one might face a Class B misdemeanor, entailing a potential fine and a community service requirement. However, if the damage to property exceeds $10,000, the offense escalates to a felony.
Should the case go to trial and result in a conviction, sentencing will depend on the degree of the offense. Illinois statutes ([_720 ILCS 5/21_](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt.+21,+Subdiv.+1&ActID=1876&ChapterID=53&SeqStart=65000000&SeqEnd=65800000)) categorize criminal damage to property offenses from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class 2 felony. Fines, restitution, probation, and even imprisonment could be part of the sentence penalty.
