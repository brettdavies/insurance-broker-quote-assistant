# State Farm homeowners claims

[Insurance](/r/personalfinance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Insurance%22)

In January 3 pipes busted in my home causing major damage to my homes foundation to where contractor says it's not liveable. State Farm denied the claim as their loophole states if water goes into the ground they are not responsible. This makes no sense to me I've been with them over 40 years never filed a claim. How can they deny my claim I'm pretty much homeless now as I don't have the money to fix I thought that's why we pay gir insurance???
