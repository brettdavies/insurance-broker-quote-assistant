closecons
    * Below-average scores in J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction studies.
    * Higher-than-average premiums for young drivers.
    * Some reports of slow claims handling and rate increases after initial quotes.
  * #### Our Take on Progressive Car Insurance
Progressive is recognized for its wide range of coverage options and strong digital tools that simplify policy management. It’s ideal for drivers who prioritize convenience, customization, and tech-friendly management. However, those looking for the cheapest rates or consistently strong customer service may find better options elsewhere.
  * #### Car Insurance Cost
Progressive’s rates range from $62 to $186 monthly for minimum coverage and $118 to $377 for full coverage. Adult drivers pay about $125 per month, while young drivers average $377 — about 25% higher than the national average.
  * #### Customer Experience
Progressive earns praise for its smooth online policy management and knowledgeable agents. Its mobile tools simplify quotes and payments, but reviews show inconsistent claims satisfaction and longer processing times compared to competitors.
  * #### Coverage Options
Progressive offers notable coverage features, including deductible reduction, pet injury protection, rideshare insurance and OEM parts replacement. These options make it one of the most versatile insurers, especially for drivers seeking highly customizable protection beyond standard liability or collision coverage.


For most drivers, Progressive is the fifth-[best car insurance company](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies/) nationwide, excelling in customer experience and add-on coverage options. This ranking reflects a 40-year-old male driver with good credit and no driving violations. Progressive's ranking for your profile depends on your coverage needs.
### Who Is Progressive Car Insurance Best and Worst For?
Progressive works best for drivers seeking cheap rates with a DUI, newer car coverage, extensive add-on coverage options and excellent overall service.
Young drivers and military members should consider other companies first. Military members should choose USAA, which outpaces Progressive in affordability, customer experience and coverage options.
_Note: Teen drivers under 18 are subject to additional legal requirements and restrictions that vary by state. Parents should check with licensed insurance agents and review state regulations before purchasing coverage for teen drivers._

### Industry Customer Satisfaction Ratings

Rating Category | Score | Rating Scale | Rating Overview

### Reddit and Forum Customer Satisfaction
Reddit users and forum members appreciate Progressive's low rates, easy-to-use app and helpful customer service representatives. Many drivers value features like Snapshot and the simplicity of switching coverage.
Common complaints include Progressive rate increases without warning at policy renewal. Claims processing creates problems. Customers report adjusters ignoring calls and fighting payouts until state insurance departments intervene.
Here's what real customers are saying about their experiences on forums:
### Pricing and Value
General thoughts on pricing initially are positive, but rate increases over time kill long-term value according to forum users:
_"Progressive hooks you with great rates, then slowly bleeds you dry with renewal increases. Despite no claims, I saved 65% by switching after years of steady hikes."_
### Claims Processing
Claims processing is generally negative in terms of sentiment and lacks responsiveness, which is a common problem with larger insurers:
_"When you actually need Progressive, they disappear. I filed at 2 p.m. on a Friday and didn't hear back until Monday, while the other driver's insurance had me in a rental car the same day."_
### Customer Service
Agent service while generally positive, also has mixed experiences which likely can be attributed to variations in different areas:
_“My experience has always been great. When I had to call to report that I had been in an accident, their first question was always 'Are you OK? have you been hurt?'”_
_"Getting through to Progressive feels like a full-time job - different reps tell you different things, nobody returns calls, and when they do answer, they act like you're bothering them."_
### Digital Experience
Progressive's online resources are extremely well-received, with a rating of [4.8 out of 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/progressive/id349731802?see-all=reviews) on the Apple App Store and [4.6 out of 5](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonevalley.progressive&hl=en_US&pli=1) on Google Play. While this is the case, the responsiveness when it comes to claims is a common issue even through online channels:
_"Progressive's app and website work great for paying bills and checking your policy, but good luck using them when something actually goes wrong with your claim."_
### Trust and Reputation
As is with many larger insurers, trust varies widely and there is often negative sentiment online with Progressive not being an exception:
_"Progressive fights you on everything - they'll change their tune real quick when the state insurance department gets involved, which tells you everything you need to know."_
### Coverage Options
People enjoy the amount of coverage options for add-ons at their disposal, but lack of understanding in terms of coverage and general responsiveness and reimbursing for claims again is a recurring issue:
_"Progressive offers all the bells and whistles you could want in coverage options, but what's the point if they'll find every excuse not to pay when you need them?"_

REVIEWS ON FORUMS AREN’T A PERFECT GAUGE

Progressive is a good option for drivers with a DUI due to its high affordability rank (fourth overall).
### Does Progressive raise car insurance rates over time?
Yes, Progressive raises rates over time, just like other insurance companies. Several factors drive these increases beyond your control. Inflation pushes up repair costs and medical expenses, while distracted driving and severe weather lead to more frequent claims. Due to advanced technology and expensive parts, modern vehicles also cost more to fix.
Progressive also adjusts rates based on risk changes in your area, new state regulations and personal factors like credit score changes or aging into higher-risk age groups. Your rates can increase even with a clean driving record.
### Is Progressive good for young drivers?
Progressive isn't the best choice for young drivers. The company ranks 14th for affordability among the insurers we reviewed, making it expensive for an age group that already pays high premiums.
### Our Review Methodology
MoneyGeek pulled auto insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services and compared prices from 79 insurers in every U.S. ZIP code.
**Standard Driver Profile Used for Analysis**
We used a baseline driver profile to ensure consistent rate comparisons. Our standard driver has these characteristics:
  * **Age** : 40 years old, male
  * **Vehicle** : 2012 Toyota Camry LE
  * **Driving history** : Clean record
  * **Annual mileage** : 12,000 miles
  * **Credit rating** : Good
  * **License status** : Valid and active
  * **Insurance history** : Currently covered with no previous claims


We then modified specific variables, including age, driving record, credit score and military status, to determine which insurers offer the best rates for different driver categories. Our minimum coverage rates represent policies meeting state-required minimums. Full coverage includes 100/300/100 liability limits plus comprehensive and collision coverage with $1,000 deductibles.
**Company Rating System**
Our [evaluation process](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/our-methodology/) weighted three key factors:
  * **Cost (60% weight)** : We compared quotes across multiple driver profiles within each city, measuring how competitively each insurer prices its policies against local competitors.
  * **Customer satisfaction (30% weight)** : We analyzed customer feedback from multiple sources, including Google reviews, J.D. Power ratings, AM Best scores and online forums like Reddit, to assess overall service quality and customer experience.
  * **Coverage variety (10% weight)** : We evaluated each provider's coverage options, considering the breadth of available policies and any unique benefits or features.
