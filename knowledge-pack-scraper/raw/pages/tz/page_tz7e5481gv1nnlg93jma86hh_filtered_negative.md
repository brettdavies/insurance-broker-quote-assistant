**S &P Global Financial Strength** | A | AAA to D | Strong financial security characteristics
_"Progressive hooks you with great rates, then slowly bleeds you dry with renewal increases. Despite no claims, I saved 65% by switching after years of steady hikes."_
_"When you actually need Progressive, they disappear. I filed at 2 p.m. on a Friday and didn't hear back until Monday, while the other driver's insurance had me in a rental car the same day."_
_“My experience has always been great. When I had to call to report that I had been in an accident, their first question was always 'Are you OK? have you been hurt?'”_
_"Getting through to Progressive feels like a full-time job - different reps tell you different things, nobody returns calls, and when they do answer, they act like you're bothering them."_
Progressive's online resources are extremely well-received, with a rating of [4.8 out of 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/progressive/id349731802?see-all=reviews) on the Apple App Store and [4.6 out of 5](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonevalley.progressive&hl=en_US&pli=1) on Google Play. While this is the case, the responsiveness when it comes to claims is a common issue even through online channels:
_"Progressive's app and website work great for paying bills and checking your policy, but good luck using them when something actually goes wrong with your claim."_
_"Progressive fights you on everything - they'll change their tune real quick when the state insurance department gets involved, which tells you everything you need to know."_
_"Progressive offers all the bells and whistles you could want in coverage options, but what's the point if they'll find every excuse not to pay when you need them?"_
