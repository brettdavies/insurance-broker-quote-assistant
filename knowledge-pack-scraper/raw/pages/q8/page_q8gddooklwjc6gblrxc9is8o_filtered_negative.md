* Hidden Costs of Buying a Home
![Realtor reviewing costs associated with buying a home with the buyer.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/191-hidden-costs-homebuying-wide.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Saving for a down payment and getting pre-qualified for a mortgage are major financial milestones in the home-buying process. But there are more money-related matters — and [homebuying myths](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-buying-myths-busted) — to be aware of during the journey to homeownership.
In addition to a [home inspection](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-a-home-inspector-checks-for-and-whats-not-included), you might consider a [radon inspection](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/radon-is-deadly-and-undetectable-without-the-right-tools) as well as a termite inspection. This site, with [certified home inspectors](https://www.homeinspector.org/Find-An-Inspector), can help you find a reputable resource near you.
The amount you'll need for your [down payment](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-save-for-a-down-payment-on-a-house) will vary depending on the price of the home and the [type of mortgage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/compare-different-types-of-mortgages) you seek — primary residence or investment. Some lenders may offer loan programs with low down payment options, but based on the percentage of your down payment you may be required to obtain [mortgage insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/private-mortgage-insurance), which will increase your total monthly obligation. Discuss your options with your lender. Your credit score plays a substantial role in determining the mortgage options and terms available. If you want to help get your score in top shape, you may want to take a look at our tips on [how to improve your credit score](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-to-build-or-improve-credit).
* [Homeowner's insurance premium](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners)
Fees can vary based on location, type of property, mortgage lender, cost of the home and loan product. You may want to put the invoices and receipts gained during this process in the same spot where you [keep your closing documents](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-closing-documents-to-keep). Your [real estate agent](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/do-you-really-need-a-real-estate-agent-to-buy-or-sell) and lender can help estimate fees for your situation.
For many [first-time homebuyers moving from an apartment](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/house-shopping-rent-vs-buy), you may be moving into a home with more space, which means you may need or want more furniture. The desire to fill this additional space can feel like an unexpected cost of buying a home. Consider your budget when upgrading to a bigger home, as the average homeowner spends [$16,000 in new furnishings](https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/home-design-and-decor/).
Speaking of furniture, it's important not to overlook the items you already own. In the midst of purchasing a new home, moving your furniture may be the last thing on your mind. [Moving](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/moving-yourself-vs-hiring-movers) — whether you decide to use a service or do it yourself — is often overlooked and can be a hidden cost of homeownership.
Maintenance comes with homeownership. This change may be jarring for first-time home buyers, who may have previously rented and relied on landlords, who are typically responsible for repairs. As a homeowner, you’re responsible for fixing things yourself or hiring someone to do it. For a quick outdoor impact, there are many things you can do to quickly [increase the curb appeal of your home](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/increase-the-curb-appeal-of-your-home).
Home upkeep can be a great incentive to pick up a few DIY skills. Check our tips on the [pros and cons of DIY home improvements](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-to-diy-and-when-to-go-pro). Keep in mind: Home repairs often require buying tools, parts and sometimes, hiring professionals, all of which factor into the hidden costs of homeownership. With that in mind, saving and [budgeting for home maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-budget-and-save-for-home-maintenance) is an important element to consider.
If you’re coming from a condominium or an apartment, you may have had most, or all your security features handled by your homeowner’s association. As a homeowner, [security for your home](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-alarm-system-options) falls solely to you. Security items, such as alarm systems, [door locks, hinges](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-choose-a-door-lock-and-be-sure-its-secure), and security lights can be costly, so do your research to find the options best suited to you.
It’s important to note that certain loans can require buyers to maintain an escrow account for the purpose of paying expenses like property tax, [homeowners insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-homeowners-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) or the mortgage itself. While not an actual cost of buying a house, funds in an escrow account are temporarily unavailable for personal use and can feel like another hidden cost of buying a home.
When looking at potential homes, don't be afraid to ask about how old the appliances are, whether they're under warranty and whether they've needed repairs in the past. That way you can get a better idea of any [appliance maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/appliance-maintenance) that might be needed and budget accordingly. That warranty question can be an especially important one, as broken appliances can be costly unexpected expenses. That's one of the reasons why being prepared with an [emergency fund](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/build-an-emergency-fund) can help reduce stress and help mitigate potential damage.
Understanding hidden costs can make home buying seem daunting. However, millions of homes are bought and sold every year successfully. If you decide home buying is the right decision and you want additional resources on budgeting for hidden costs, it may be helpful to visit our how-to guide with tips on [budgeting for non-monthly expenses](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/how-to-budget-for-non-monthly-expenses). Best of luck in your home-buying adventure!
