Lemonade is a relatively new insurance company that launched in 2015. The company takes a modern approach to insurance: It’s a digital, direct-to-consumer company, meaning that the entire insurance purchasing process can be done online without interacting with a human agent. Instead of insurance agents, they rely on AI to provide quotes, chat with customers, and manage claims.
Lemonade offers home, auto, renters, pet, and life insurance. In 2022, they acquired pay-per-mile car insurance company Metromile, keeping Metromile’s usage-based approach, which allowed them to build out their auto insurance offerings. That business model means the company tracks driving habits and rewards those who drive less (and more safely) with lower rates.
Lemonade also prioritizes social impact and is a certified B Corp. Among other initiatives, they plant trees every year in proportion to how many miles are driven by their policyholders. They also donate unclaimed premiums at the end of each year to nonprofit organizations chosen by customers.
The company operates in the U.S. and Europe, but they currently only offer car insurance in seven states: Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Tennessee, and Texas.
I’m a senior editor and analyst at AutoInsurance.com, and while I’m currently a State Farm customer (here’s my full [State Farm review](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/)), I’ve put together this comprehensive review of Lemonade using industry research, customer reviews, and my industry experience to give you a better idea of how Lemonade works and what they offer to help you decide whether it’s the right insurance company for you.

## Quick Look: Lemonade Pros & Cons
### Pros
* Usage-based insurance rewards low mileage and safe driving
* AI-driven model provides more streamlined insurance process
* Discounts for electric and hybrid cars
### Cons
* Not ideal for people who drive more than average
* Only available in seven states
* Location services must be turned on at all times
## Who Is Lemonade Auto Insurance Best For?
Lemonade may be a good choice for those who prefer to purchase and manage insurance policies online.
Lemonade Is Best for Those Who:
* Live in Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Tennessee, or Texas
* Prefer to get a quote, purchase a policy, and manage their insurance fully online
* Drive safely and/or less than average
* Drive electric or hybrid vehicles
Lemonade Is Not Best for Those Who:
* Drive more than average or are high-risk drivers
* Live in states other than the seven listed above
* Prefer to interact with a human agent
* Are uncomfortable with the data and location sharing required by Lemonade
## How Much Does Lemonade Car Insurance Cost?
The cost of Lemonade car insurance can vary widely, as it depends on how often and how safely you drive. The company advertises rates as low as $30 per month, or $360 per year. The national average cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,399 for full coverage and $635 for minimum coverage; but if you’re a safe driver with Lemonade and drive less than average, you can expect your rates to be lower.
Since Lemonade’s rates are usage-based, they can change based on your driving habits. If you drive less or improve your driving from one year to the next, your rates may go down.
The table below shows the average rates of major national insurers so you can get an idea of how Lemonade’s rates compare:
Company | Average annual premium for full coverage | Average annual premium for minimum coverage
---|---|---
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/) | $2,605 | $840
[American Family](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/american-family/reviews/) | $1,936 | $604
[Farmers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/farmers/reviews/) | $2,979 | $1,002
[GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) | $1,731 | $517
[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $1,808 | $718
[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/) | $1,960 | $638
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) | $2,167 | $674
[Travelers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/travelers/reviews/) | $1,597 | $576
[USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/) | $1,407 | $417
If you have a violation on your record or are concerned about telematics-based insurance, Lemonade is not the best option for you. Here are some of the [best insurance options for high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/).
## Insights from Real Lemonade Policyholders
In addition to sharing my experience with Lemonade, our team analyzed real-life customer feedback and review patterns to understand what other drivers think. By analyzing over 4,000 customer reviews from major platforms like Reddit, Trustpilot, and more, we identified common themes in customer satisfaction, complaints, and overall experience. Here’s what we found:
**Category** | **Summary**
---|---
Total Reviews Analyzed | Over 4,000 (Trustpilot, Reddit, user forums)
Top 3 Positives
* Low initial premiums
* Easy app-based experience
* Fast claims (when approved)
Top 3 Negatives
* Poor customer service
* Unexpected rate increases
* Claims/cancellation frustrations
Key Takeaway | Lemonade car insurance stands out for its low initial rates and sleek, app-based experience that makes getting coverage fast and easy. Some users enjoy quick claims processing, while others have faced challenges with customer service, billing clarity, and policy management. Overall Lemonade is best for low-mileage, tech-savvy drivers who value convenience and upfront savings, but may not be ideal for those who prioritize hands-on customer support or have complex coverage needs.
**What Real Customers Say:**
“I had their renters insurance since January and opted for their car insurance last month. Fingers crossed I don’t have to file a claim, but my payment is $25/month + the per mile price. I [work from home], so adding a daily commute isn’t a concern. I can see each trip I take in the app to get an idea of how much the cost will go up. My bill will be about $36 this month. So far, it works for me.”
“I just recently had a car stolen that was found in Alabama and I live in Tennessee, I had no problems with the claim. Everything went smoothly, they called and kept in touch with me and they basically did all the heavy lifting so just my 2 cents Lemonade has been really good for me.”[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/lemonade/reviews/#citation-1)
## How You Can Save on Your Policy With Lemonade
Since Lemonade’s car insurance is based on telematics, it already bakes in a discount for drivers who drive safely and infrequently. It offers fewer discounts than most major insurers, but there are some other ways to save on your premium.
### Highlighted Discount: EVs and Hybrids
Part of Lemonade’s brand ethos is sustainability and giving back, and with that in mind, they offer a discount for [EV and hybrid vehicle owners](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/electric/). Lemonade plants trees to make up for the carbon emissions of their policyholders, so one reason they provide this discount is the lower carbon emissions produced by these eco-friendly vehicles.
In addition to a discount, Lemonade also covers emergency charging and damage to walls and portable chargers for EV and hybrid drivers.
### Other Discounts
In addition to the EV discount, Lemonade also offers:
* **Bundling discounts:** You can get a discount for bundling any combination of Lemonade products, meaning you can bundle your auto insurance with a home, renters, pet, or life insurance policy to qualify for savings.
* **Planning ahead:** Lemonade offers a discount if you sign up for a policy in advance of your coverage start date.
## Lemonade Quote and Purchase Process
Lemonade offers a straightforward quote and purchase process that can be done exclusively online or through the app. You’ll be greeted by an AI agent that will guide you through the process, which starts by entering your name and your home address.
I wasn’t able to get a quote since Lemonade is not available in my state, but if they offer policies in your area, you’ll go on to provide more details about your driving record and other details. From there, getting a quote and purchasing a policy will be easy. At any time during this process, you can submit any questions you have to the Lemonade team, and someone will get back to you.
## What Types of Auto Insurance Coverage Does Lemonade Offer?
Lemonade offers all the standard types of insurance coverage, including liability coverage, collision and comprehensive coverage (referred to as full coverage), personal injury protection, [medical payments](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/medical/), and uninsured motorist coverage.
I opt for higher liability limits and full coverage for additional financial protection and peace of mind. I recommend getting more than the minimum coverage required by your state if you can afford it as [minimum coverage is generally not enough](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/).
Lemonade offers a few additional coverage options beyond the most basic coverages:
Coverage | What it covers
---|---
Rental Car Reimbursement | Lemonade refers to this as Temporary Transportation Coverage, and it will help pay for a rental car or rideshare service if your car is being repaired.
Roadside Assistance | This covers the cost of towing, jump-starts, and more if you’re stalled on the road.
Extended Glass and Windshield | With this coverage, you’ll pay a lower, or no, deductible for glass repairs and replacements, including windshields.
## Lemonade: Customer Satisfaction
Overall, Lemonade’s customer satisfaction track record is mixed based on the sources we evaluated. It has an NAIC complaint index of 10.09, which means it receives ten times as many complaints as expected for a company of its size in the market. It’s also a higher complaint index than most major insurance companies. However, there were only seven total private passenger complaints, so it’s possible that a lack of data is skewing the ratio high.
In addition, it received a grade of C+ on the CRASH Network’s latest report, which was on par with the average score. The report surveys collision repair shops on insurers’ claims practices.
Lemonade is not rated by AM Best, but it does have an A (Exceptional) rating for financial stability from Demotech. This means that they can be trusted to pay out claims.
Category | Lemonade score
---|---
NAIC Customer Complaint Index[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/lemonade/reviews/#citation-2) |  10.09 — more complaints than average
CRASH Network Grade[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/lemonade/reviews/#citation-3) | C+ (63 out of 97)
Demotech[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/lemonade/reviews/#citation-4) | A (exceptional)
## Filing a Claim With Lemonade
You can [file a claim](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/) with Lemonade through the Lemonade mobile app. The company notes that their telematics data provides useful background information to help process claims faster, which may include things like your location and speed.
Claims can be filed quickly by following the steps in the app. Lemonade processes claims with the help of AI, which also helps speed up the process. Once you submit a claim, Lemonade AI runs dozens of anti-fraud algorithms and might instantly approve and pay out your claim. Lemonade advertises that around 40 percent of claims are handled instantly. In more complicated situations, your claim will be passed on to human members of Lemonade’s team, and processing times may vary.
## Lemonade's Website and Mobile App
Given that Lemonade is a fully digital company, their mobile tools are robust. The website is pretty minimalist, however, and provides basic information about coverages and prompts you to start the quote process for more personalized information. You can also access your account and view details of your existing policy, pay bills, and more.
There’s also a mobile app, where you can get a quote and access your account if you’re already a policyholder. You’ll also need to turn on location services in the app so the telematics work properly and you can take advantage of discounts.
I downloaded the app to test out the user interface, and it takes you through a few promotional slides about the company before you can actually do anything. On the final screen, you have the option to get a quote or sign in. Unlike a lot of other car insurance apps, you cannot access any information or services without first signing in. This may pose an inconvenience in certain situations — for example, if you’re trying to access roadside assistance and don’t know your username and password.

The app has an almost perfect rating on the Apple App Store, but its rating is noticeably lower for Android users. Many Android customers note that the app is very glitchy, sometimes not opening at all, and that the location services don’t work properly.
App Version | Rating (out of 5)
---|---
iPhone (App Store) | 4.9 stars
Android (Google Play) | 4.2 stars

## Methodology – How We Review Insurance Companies
At AutoInsurance.com, we evaluate auto insurance providers based on four key factors:
* **Price (40%):** We analyze average premiums for full and minimum coverage for good drivers with good credit, as well as various driver profiles, including those with DUIs, accidents, or low credit scores. We also consider available discounts and telematics programs.
* **Claims Handling (25%):** Policyholders expect insurance companies to process claims quickly and fairly. We evaluate claims practices through sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings when available.
* **Customer Experience (25%):** We assess how easy it is for customers to get a quote and purchase a policy, including whether they have the option to do so online. We also consider the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
* **Coverage Options (10%):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and value providers with options beyond the state required minimums, like accident forgiveness, gap coverage, rideshare coverage, and more.
