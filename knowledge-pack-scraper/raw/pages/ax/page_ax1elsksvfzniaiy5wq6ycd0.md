  * ###  How Bankrate chose the best home insurance companies in California
Caret Down Icon
To help you find the [best home insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) for you, we calculated a Bankrate Score to analyze each company across several categories. The ratings consider average annual premiums from Quadrant Information Services, available coverage, discounts, policy features and more. We also reviewed J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores to indicate how satisfied customers are with their company’s service and AM Best ratings to assess financial stability. The higher a company ranked in each category, the higher its overall Bankrate Score — 5.0 being the highest possible.

## Common California home insurance problems
While California’s cultural cachet and natural beauty make it a desirable place to put down roots, finding a policy for your forever home can be a challenge. Here are a few hurdles homeowners may encounter, and some of the driving factors behind them:
  * **Dwindling coverage options** : In the past two years, seven of California’s largest home insurance providers by market share — State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb — have either stopped accepting new home insurance policies or limited the number of new policies they’re willing to write. Since 2019, [one in five California homes](https://www.deepskyclimate.com/blog/insurers-retreat-as-2025-wildfire-risk-reaches-dangerous-levels) with extreme wildfire risk has lost coverage.
  * **High insured losses:** Insurance companies are for-profit businesses, and if they lose too much money, they can exit the market. California home insurance companies have been paying wildfire-related losses for years, most recently with the January 2025 firestorms. One estimate suggests the total insured losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires are around [$33.9 billion](https://www.insuranceinsider.com/article/2efisa8gt2mi13p0220ao/all-topics/catastrophe-losses/pcs-combined-estimate-at-33-9bn-for-palisades-and-eaton), making it the most expensive natural disaster in both California and national history.
  * **Rising rebuilding costs:** The cost of a home insurance policy is tied to the cost of rebuilding; when a home becomes more expensive to rebuild, it also becomes more expensive to insure. Rebuilding costs in the Palisades fire region alone increased by nearly 57 percent from 2017 to 2025, according to Versik, a data analytics company.
  * **Strained FAIR Plan** : The FAIR Plan is financially supported by California’s private home insurers, and if too many homes on the plan file claims at one time, it may run out of money. This happened in early 2025 for the first time since 1994, following the destructive January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles. The FAIR Plan will now recoup money from both its private insurance supporters and California homeowners insured in the private market.
  * **Keeping a policy** : Finding an insurance policy in California is one thing, but hanging onto it is another — California has one of the [highest nonrenewal rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-hard-to-get-right-now/) in the country. In 2023, homeowners had a greater than one in 100 chance of being dropped by their home insurance company.


News
Recent updates in the California homeowners insurance market
Change is afoot in the California home insurance regulation landscape. State Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's Sustainable Insurance Strategy (SIS) was designed to help entice more insurance companies to write new policies here. Bankrate's insurance editorial team is closely monitoring this rapidly evolving situation. Here are some of the recent significant changes in the California home insurance market that could affect you:
  * **July 25, 2025** :
The California Department of Insurance approves its first wildfire catastrophe model, allowing insurers to set rates based on future wildfire risks instead of only historical data. In exchange for allowing insurers to use the model to set rates, they must agree to write at least 85 percent of their market share in wildfire-stressed areas.
  * **June 1, 2025:**
State Farm’s new, higher rates take effect. In addition to home insurance, renters and condo insurance rates are also expected to rise by an average of 15 percent.
  * **May 13, 2025:**
The California Department of Insurance approved State Farm’s emergency interim rate raise. The insurer initially requested a 22 percent increase for its home insurance policies, which was negotiated down to 17 percent.
  * **Feb. 11, 2025:**
The California FAIR Plan ran out of money and levied a $1 billion assessment against the private insurance companies that support it. Under the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, insurers can now pass up to half — $500 million — of the bill along to their policyholders. With 8.3 million California households insured in the private market, the bill rounds out to about $60 per household.
  * **Feb. 3, 2025:**
State Farm requested an emergency interim rate raise, a first for the insurance giant, following the Los Angeles wildfires. The insurer claimed it was in financial distress after it accrued around $7 billion in wildfire-related losses.
  * **Jan. 7, 2025** :
Commissioner Lara issued a one-year insurance moratorium on nonrenewals for homeowners in [_fire-affected ZIP codes_](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/140-catastrophes/MandatoryOneYearMoratoriumNonRenewals.cfm).
  * **Jan. 7, 2025:**
Los Angeles experienced a series of devastating wildfires. The two largest, the Palisades and Eaton fires, burned through more than 37,000 acres.
  * **December 2024** :
The Sustainable Insurance Strategy was fully rolled out.
  * **Nov. 7, 2024** :
Allstate's 34 percent home insurance rate raise went into effect
  * **Aug. 29, 2024** :
Allstate's request for a 34 percent average rate increase was approved, affecting around 350,000 homeowners.
  * **July 12, 2024** :
Allstate filed for an average home insurance rate increase of 34 percent.
  * **July 9, 2024** :
Guard Insurance [_filed for withdrawal_](https://www.coverager.com/guard-exits-california-home-insurance-market/) from the California home insurance market.
  * **July 1, 2024** :
State Farm requested an average of 30 percent home insurance rate raise in California, citing major insolvency issues as the motivator behind the request. It also requested a 52 percent average raise for renters and a 36 percent raise for condo owners. This rate increase is still pending.
  * **March 25, 2024** :
Insurance Commissioner Lara unveiled his [_Sustainable Insurance Strategy_](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2023/upload/California-s-Sustainable-Insurance-Strategy-slides.pdf) , the most comprehensive overhaul of California insurance legislation in 30 years. The Strategy is a multi-pronged approach to incentivize insurers to resume writing new business in California and help stabilize the FAIR Plan.


### California FAIR Plan
There are still more than [100 available](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/allstate-insurance-state-farm-california/) home insurance companies in California. However, homeowners should be aware of the shift in availability. If you cannot secure insurance for your home, you may want to consider the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for homes considered high-risk. As of June 2025, the FAIR Plan insures more than [590,000 homes](https://www.cfpnet.com/key-statistics-data/), an increase of nearly 31 percent from a year prior.

## Cheapest home insurance companies in California
Not every California homeowner will be able to secure a cheap policy, particularly those in a [high-risk wildfire area](https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/media/klxe20mh/fhsz_statewide_sra_11x17_2022_2.pdf). In fact, homeowners with homes at elevated risk for wildfire damage may struggle to secure any insurance policy, let alone a cheap one. That said, getting familiar with the cheapest home insurance companies in California can be a good starting point if you’re looking for coverage on a budget.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the cheapest homeowners insurance company in California?
Caret Down Icon
Based on Bankrate’s research, Mercury offers the cheapest home insurance policies in California. On average, its policies cost an average of $784 per year.
  * ###  Does my homeowners policy include additional living expenses?
Caret Down Icon
Yes. You usually have between 20 and 30 percent of your dwelling limit earmarked for additional living expenses if you can’t live at home due to a covered loss.
  * ###  Why is home insurance so hard to get in California?
Caret Down Icon
Insurers have been leaving California in droves, making policies hard to purchase. As the remaining carriers tighten their underwriting requirements, it’s also become more difficult to hang onto your policy when it renews.

### Bankrate Scores 
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well auto and home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [NAIC](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/), were analyzed.
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

Bankrate.com is an independent, advertising-supported publisher and comparison service. We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
