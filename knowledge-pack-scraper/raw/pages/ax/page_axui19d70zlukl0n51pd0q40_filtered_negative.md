* How To Be Safe in a Hailstorm
![Hail covering a road.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/350-stay-safe-hailstorm-wide.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Hailstorms are among the most common and costly weather hazards in the U.S., posing a significant risk to crops, buildings, vehicles and outdoor furniture. By learning about hailstorms and preparing in advance, you can take important steps to help protect yourself and your property from the potential damage caused by this [severe weather event](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-stay-safe-during-a-severe-wind-event).
* **Bring pets indoors.** [Help calm and protect pets from storms](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/pet-preparedness-and-storm-anxiety) by bringing them inside or into a safe space.
* **Shelter vehicles.** When possible, move vehicles into a garage or another covered area. If you can’t move your vehicle or shelter isn’t available, consider covering it with a tarp or blankets
* **Prepare for power outages.** Hailstorms can disrupt electrical service and may be accompanied by severe weather events such as [hurricanes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/preparing-for-a-hurricane) and [tornadoes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-in-a-tornado). Consider having a backup [generator](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/which-emergency-backup-generators-is-right-for-you) available for temporary power during [power outages](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/power-outage-tips).
Help prepare your family for the hazards and inconveniences of hailstorms by creating a [disaster preparedness plan](https://www.ready.gov/plan), including a disaster survival kit and an [emergency evacuation plan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/hurricane-evacuation-plan). Also, having a [home inventory](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-inventory-how-to-create-one) of your possessions may help if you decide to file any insurance claims after a storm.
* **Take precautions when driving.** If you're [on the road during a hailstorm](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/can-you-drive-safely-in-every-type-of-severe-weather), stay in your vehicle and slow down and safely pull over, as roads may become slippery and the [hail can cause damage to vehicles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/hail-damage-car). Once you have pulled over safely, turn away from windows or cover yourself with a blanket to help protect yourself from possible broken glass.
* **Prioritize extreme damage.** If any damage is found to have caused an impending or immediate emergency such as [leaking roofs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/roof-leak) or pipes, broken windows or a weakened roof, prioritize addressing them first if it’s safe. Consider [hiring a contractor](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/protect-yourself-from-contractor-fraud) for temporary repairs to avoid damage that may lead to further, potentially expensive repairs.
* **Consider contacting your insurance company.** If you think you need to file a claim for damage related to the hailstorm, get in touch with your insurance company. If you're a State Farm customer, you can [contact your local agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) by phone, email or through the [State Farm mobile app](https://www.statefarm.com/customer-care/download-mobile-apps/state-farm-mobile-app) for questions you may have regarding hailstorms or the claim filing process.
Hailstorms can severely impact roofs. Following a strong storm, try to safely [evaluate the condition of your roof](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/roof-maintenance-for-your-home) to identify any damage and help prevent further deterioration.
You may qualify for [roofing discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners/discounts) on your [homeowner's insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners) premiums by using certain [impact-resistant roofing products](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/impact-resistant-roofing-materials). Check out the roofing materials eligible for discounts and the states where discounts are available. Premium reductions are usually not available for roofs that have been overlaid onto existing roofs, except for certain qualifying [metal roofs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/metal-roof-pros-and-cons).
For more information about roofing discounts or to review your [home and property insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners) policies, please contact your local [State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/).
