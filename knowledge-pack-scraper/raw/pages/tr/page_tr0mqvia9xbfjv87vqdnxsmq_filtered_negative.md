The Land of Lincoln. The Prairie State. Whatever you call it, if you’re driving in Illinois, you need car insurance in the form of bodily injury, property damage, and uninsured motorist coverage.
The good news for the state’s 8.5 million licensed drivers is that car insurance costs are 13 percent lower than in the rest of the country, on average. (Of course, costs will be higher if you live in a city like Chicago or Aurora.) Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about car insurance in Illinois.

## What Car Insurance Is Required in Illinois?
Illinois requires the following liability limits and [auto insurance coverages](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/).
* **Bodily injury liability per person:** $25,000
* **Bodily injury liability per accident:** $50,000
* **Property damage liability:** $20,000
* **Uninsured motorist coverage per person:** $25,000
* **Uninsured motorist coverage per accident:** $50,000[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-1)
## Is the Minimum Enough Coverage?
The [minimum car insurance coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/) in Illinois is not enough, as it won’t cover your damages and injuries in accidents you caused. It also won’t protect you financially if your car is damaged from events other than collisions, like car theft or vandalism.
[Bodily injury coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/bodily-injury/) and [property damage liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/property-damage/) only apply to the other party’s costs in accidents you caused. If someone with insurance hits you, their liability insurance will cover you under a [third-party claim](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/third-party/).
We recommend adding on [medical payments coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/medical/), along with [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/). While medical payments coverage pays for your injuries, collision and comprehensive coverage cover your property damage from collisions and non-collisions, respectively.
The limit for your collision and comprehensive coverage is your car’s actual market value. Buy as much coverage as you can afford for your liability coverage, $500,000 being considered the ideal amount of coverage.
## Average Cost of Car Insurance in Illinois
Car insurance in Illinois costs $915 a year on average, 13 percent less than the U.S. average. Liability coverage makes up the bulk of this amount at $501, followed by [collision coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/collision/) at $348 and [comprehensive coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive/) at $137.
Although these were the average rates in 2020, the last time the National Association of Insurance Commissioners published data, we’ve seen annual rates range from $277 for the cheapest car insurance all the way up to $5,327.09 for new drivers.
The cost of your car insurance depends on many factors, like if you had a speeding ticket within the past five years or are one of the many drivers with poor credit. Be sure to fully explore your car insurance rate and coverage options before insuring your car.
## Car Insurance Companies in Illinois
You have many companies to choose from when [shopping for car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/how-to-get-car-insurance/) in Illinois:
* Allstate
* American Family
* Auto-Owners
* Country Financial
* Encompass
* Erie
* Farmers
* First Chicago
* GEICO
* Grange
* Hastings Mutual
* Mercury
* Pekin
* Progressive
* Rockford Mutual
* State Farm
* Travelers
* USAA
## How to Get Lower Premiums
The best ways to save money on car insurance are to …
* **Get discounts.** Most providers offer [auto insurance discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/), such as for taking a [defensive driving course](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/defensive-driving/) or signing up for an annual policy. Ask your agent how you can save today.
* **Adjust your policy.** You can lower your limits, get rid of coverages that the law doesn’t require, or raise your [auto insurance deductible](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/deductibles/) to [lower your insurance premiums](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/lower/). But keep in mind that these actions may cost more in the long term if you have an accident.
* **Keep a clean driving record.** Drive carefully to avoid tarnishing what we assume is a perfect driving record. That includes avoiding [distracted driving](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/distracted-driving/), like texting and driving.
Switch companies. If all else fails, you may be able to save money by [switching car insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/how-to-switch-car-insurance/).
## Proof of Insurance
Driving in Illinois requires not only insurance but also [proof of insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/do-you-need-proof-of-auto-insurance/). Otherwise, how will the police officer know you really have it?
People caught [driving without insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/driving-without-insurance/) in Illinois could face fines and license suspensions.
First and second offenses | Third and subsequent offenses
---|---|---
Fine | $501-$1,000 | $1,000
License suspension | 3 months | 3 months
Reinstatement fee | $100 | $100
Proof of insurance | If you have no previous convictions and can prove coverage by the date of your court appearance, you can pay a $100 fine and receive a disposition of court supervision. | You’ll need to carry an SR-22 for 3 years from the date proof is first filed.
You can show your proof in the form of a paper or electronic ID.
## Illinois State Driving Laws
If you’ve purchased your [auto insurance policy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-policy-looks-like/) from an [agent or broker](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agent-vs-broker/), you’re ready to drive – but first make sure you’re compliant with the laws of the land in Illinois.
### Is Illinois a No-Fault State?
Illinois is not a no-fault state; it’s an at-fault state.
Say [someone hit your parked car](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-to-do-when-someone-hits-your-parked-car/) and left the scene, a classic [hit-and-run](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/hit-and-run/) — but CCTV caught the culprit speeding off. That person would be responsible for your property damages and any injuries your passengers incurred.
Even if you had some level of negligence (say you were parked in a no-parking zone), as long as you were 50 percent or less culpable for the accident, you could recover funds under Illinois’ modified comparative negligence law.
### Uninsured Motorists
Illinois is one of the few states to require [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/uninsured-motorist/), even though the Insurance Research Council estimated in 2019 that only 12 percent of the state’s drivers lacked insurance — a relatively low percentage.
### DUI Laws
If you get a DUI in Illinois, it will stay on your record for five years, with a six-month license suspension for the first offense and a mandatory interlock. If your blood alcohol concentration was 0.16 percent or higher, you could face even more punishments.
First offense | First offense, increased penalty | Second offense | Second offense, increased penalty | Third offense | Third offense, increased penalty | Fourth offense | Fourth offense, increased penalty
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Maximum fine | $2,500 | $500 | $2,500 | $1,250 or $25,000 if transporting a child under 16 | $25,000 | $2,500 or $25,000 if transporting a child under 16 | $25,000 | $5,000 or $25,000 if transporting a child under 16
Driving suspension (in months) | 6 | N/A | 12 | N/A | 12 | N/A | Lifetime | N/A
Driver’s license revocation (in years) | 1 | N/A | 5 | N/A | 10 years minimum | N/A | Lifetime | N/A
Interlock (in months) | N/A | N/A | 12 | N/A | 12 | N/A | N/A | N/A
Community service | N/A | 100 hours, plus 25 if transporting a child under 16 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 25 days if transporting a child under 16 | N/A | 25 days if transporting a child under 16
Maximum imprisonment | 1 year | Up to 6 years if transporting a child under 16 | 1 year | 2 years, or 1-3 years if transporting a child under 16 | 3-7 years | 3 months | 3-7 years | N/A
Alcohol/drug evaluation | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A
Alcohol/drug remedial education program | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A
SR-22 requirement | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A
Vehicle registration suspension | N/A | N/A | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A | Yes | N/A[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-2)
### Seat Belt Laws
No matter what seat you’re in, seat belts are mandatory for those 16 and older in Illinois, with the law under primary enforcement. That means police can pull you over merely for someone in your car not wearing their seat belt, with no other traffic violations necessary.
### Distracted Driving Laws
Illinois has a ban on handheld electronic devices for all drivers, under primary enforcement. If you’re caught driving distracted by a phone, tablet, or laptop, you will be given five points per violation and fined.
* **First offense:** $75
* **Second offense:** $100
* **Third offense:** $125
* **Fourth and subsequent offenses:** $150[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-3)
### Young Driver Laws
In Illinois, 16- and 17-year-old drivers are in their initial licensing phase for the first 12 months after obtaining their licenses. During this phase, they must adhere to a few restrictions.
* **Curfew:** From Sunday to Thursday, the curfew is 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., but it’s 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
* **Limited passengers:** During the first year of their license, or before they turn 18, drivers can only drive one passenger under age 20 unless the passengers are their siblings, children, stepsiblings, or stepchildren.
* **Clean driving record:** For the first six months of their license or until they turn 18 (whichever comes first), teen drivers need to maintain clean driving records free of convictions. If they don’t, it will delay them entering the full licensing phase.
### Statute of Limitations: Property Damage and Personal Injury Claims
You have five years to file property damage claims and two years to file personal injury claims, due to Illinois’ statutes of limitations.
### Non-Renewal and Cancellation Notification Laws
If an insurance company in Illinois cancels a policy, it must alert the customer 30 days before the expiration date, or 10 days before if the cancellation is due to nonpayment. For non-renewal of policies, the window is 30 days.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-4)
### Self-Insurance Option
If you have more than 25 vehicles, you can self-insure rather than purchasing a personal auto insurance policy. However, self-insurance is completely at the discretion of the Illinois Department of Insurance’s director, so it’s unclear how doable this is in practice.
### Inspection Requirements
The state of Illinois requires either annual or biannual emission inspections for some cars in certain counties and townships.
Vehicle criteria | Vehicles subject to Illinois Diesel Emission Inspection Program
---|---
Where it travels | Intrastate or interstate
What powers it | Diesel
Minimum gross weight | 16,000 pounds
Registered within the affected area | Yes
Age | 2 years or older
Counties | Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison, McHenry, Monroe, Will, St. Clair
Townships | Aux Sable and Goose Lake in Grundy County, Oswego in Kendall County
How often you have to get your car inspected depends on what it carries and where it drives.
* **Interstate carriers of property:** Annual inspections
* **Intrastate carriers of property:** Biannual inspections
* **Interstate carriers of passengers:** Both annually and biannually[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-5)
You can find an inspection station here: https://idot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=40e56aad7a294032b84651dc41109f79.
### SR-22s
You’ll have to maintain an SR-22 form as proof of minimum insurance if:
* You’ve had safety responsibility suspensions, unsatisfied judgment suspicions, mandatory insurance supervisions, or revocations.
* You’ve had three or more convictions for driving without insurance.
In some cases, you can request your SR-22 be waived through an affidavit.
### Defensive Driving Courses
Remember when we mentioned you could get a discount for taking a defensive driving course? In Illinois, take just one class and that discount can last up to three years. Find a class here: https://apps.ilsos.gov/adultdrivered/providerlist.
### Right to Sue
Illinois doesn’t pose a serious injury or monetary threshold you need to meet in order to sue for economic or noneconomic damages after a car accident.
### Do I Have to Report a Car Accident in Illinois?
If you are involved in a car accident that results in any injury, property damage, or death worth more than $1,500 (or $500 if any involved car wasn’t insured), you’ll have to report it within 10 days or face a license suspension.
### Discrimination Laws
Illinois allows insurance companies to base prices on both [credit scores](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/credit-scores/) and gender, so people with bad credit and [men will pay higher car insurance premiums](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/why-men-pay-more-for-car-insurance/).
### Total Loss Formula
Illinois uses the class total loss formula, so a car is deemed a total loss when the repairs would cost more than its salvage value.

## Auto Theft and Traffic Deaths
Illinois falls below the national average for [auto theft](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/auto-theft/), but above it for traffic fatalities.
### Car Theft Rates
The state’s annual car theft rate is 170 per 100,000 inhabitants, 45 percent lower than the rest of the country, according to FBI data. However, rates are higher in metropolitan areas like the St. Louis area, Davenport, Carbondale, and Chicago, as stated by the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
Metropolitan statistical area | Number of motor vehicle thefts per 100,000 inhabitants in 2020
---|---
St. Louis, MO-IL | 443

### Traffic Fatality Rates
Unfortunately, the state doesn’t fare so well in traffic fatalities. Illinois is ninth in the nation, with 1,009 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled. That’s nearly a third more than the national average, according to data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
From 2019 to 2020 alone, motor vehicle fatalities increased by 16 percent in Illinois, a high since 2007. State officials blame speeding and other risky driving behaviors. While roads that feel emptier than normal may seem safer, reckless driving still has deadly consequences.[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/#citation-6)

But whether you’re driving down the Magnificent Mile in Chicago or a rural street in Elsah, Jersey County, keep Illinois’ laws in mind to avoid sullying that perfect driving history of yours.
