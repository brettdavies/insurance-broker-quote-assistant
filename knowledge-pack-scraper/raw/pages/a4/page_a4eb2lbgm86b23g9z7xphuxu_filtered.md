### When should I place business with the FAIR Plan?

California Insurance Code section 10090(d) states that coverage is available for property insurance at the FAIR Plan that cannot be obtained through the normal insurance market.  The code defines the normal insurance market as both admitted insurers and licensed surplus line brokers.

Risks should be submitted to the FAIR Plan for coverage only after a diligent search of the normal insurance market has been made.
