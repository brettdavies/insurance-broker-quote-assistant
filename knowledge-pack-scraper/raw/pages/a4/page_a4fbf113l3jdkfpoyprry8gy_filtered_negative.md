By [Ramsey Solutions](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/umbrella-insurance-cost#authorbio)
From Mary Poppins’ flying umbrella to Hagrid’s wand-concealing brolly, magical umbrellas have been enchanting us for decades. Well, we’ve got another magical umbrella for you: It’s called _umbrella insurance_.
###  Key Takeaways
[Umbrella insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-umbrella-insurance) is like... well, an umbrella for your money. It’s a form of [liability insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/excess-liability-coverage). It protects your money from rainy-day lawsuits or large claims that exceed the coverage in your standard homeowners or auto insurance policies. All it takes is one expensive lawsuit and your finances could be looking worse than Mr. Banks’ bank in _Mary Poppins_. (And you don’t even have to be at fault. These days, people sue for all kinds of reasons.)
[![](https://cdn.ramseysolutions.net/media/3_way_universal/blog/inline-icons/insurance.png) Do you have the right insurance coverage? You could be saving hundreds! Connect with an insurance pro today! ](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance)
Umbrella insurance kicks in once you reach the [liability limit](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/personal-liability-insurance) of your [homeowners](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance-guide) or [auto policies](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/how-much-car-insurance). It will give you peace of mind knowing your nest egg  _and your lifestyle_ are protected from the elements (meaning, all the bad things that could happen).
1. **Bodily injury** covers incidents like dog bites or car accidents. Basically, anything you’re found responsible for that causes injury to others (like if the neighbor kid breaks their foot on your trampoline).
2. **Property damages** are covered if, for instance, you’re at fault for a bad car accident and are on the hook for the other person’s expensive repair costs. So if you caused a 10-car pileup on an icy interstate and people are filing claims left and right for their damaged cars, umbrella insurance has you covered.
3. **Legal fees** can add up quickly. Umbrella insurance protects you from having to shell out a ton of money for lawyers if you’re sued. (Let the insurance company line the lawyers’ pockets so you can keep your money in yours.)
4. **Slander and libel** are also covered if you’re sued for damaging someone’s reputation—even through something like an online review of a restaurant.
5. **Rental property** is also protected if you’re a landlord.
Now, you might also be wondering, [ _How much umbrella insurance do I need_](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/how-much-umbrella-insurance-do-I-need) _?_ Good question.
Whatever you decide, just make sure it covers your  _entire net worth_.
###  Here's A Tip
Your umbrella insurance should cover your  _entire net worth_.

Another scenario looks like this: You’re out walking your German shepherd, Bo, in a park. A girl with no dog manners named Krystal reaches out to pet Bo and Bo, who’s never bitten anyone in his life, bites her hand and then her thigh. While Krystal needs stitches, she isn’t hurt _that_ badly—but she takes one look at your Lululemon outfit and the rock on your finger and decides to take you for a ride. She sues you for $1 million for ongoing injuries and trauma. The judge knocks it down to $750,000, but still. Let’s hope you have umbrella insurance.
* _You own a pool_
* _You own a dog or horse_
* _You own a trampoline_
* _You’re a volunteer board member_
* _You’re a youth sports coach or official_
* _You have a teen driver_
* _You own a boat, ATV, motorcycle, or Jet Ski_
* _You’re a public figure or have a major online presence_
* _You own a rental property_
One more thing: There’s _another_ cost people tend to forget, and that’s legal fees. In each of these scenarios, you would have to pay hefty fees to lawyers to defend you—even if you win. Umbrella insurance will cover those too.
Most insurers don’t let you get a stand-alone umbrella insurance policy. You’ll need to add umbrella insurance to an  _existing policy_.
And before you can add umbrella insurance to your existing policy, you’ll need a certain amount of liability in your other policies. Most insurance companies require you to have $250,000 in [auto insurance liability](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-liability-insurance-cover) and $300,000 for your homeowners insurance.[8](https://www.iii.org/article/what-umbrella-liability) So keep in mind, you might end up paying more on your auto or home insurance [premiums](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-insurance-premium) to get umbrella insurance.
**Geico** |  **Allstate**
---|---|---
**Home Insurance Liability** |  $300,000  |  $300,000
**Auto Insurance Bodily Injury** |  $300,000/$300,000 or $250,000/$500,000  |  $250,000/$500,000
**Auto Insurance Property Damage** |  $100,000[9](https://www.geico.com/information/aboutinsurance/umbrella/#:~:text=GEICO%20requires%20a%20minimum%20bodily,qualify%20for%20an%20umbrella%20policy.) |  $100,000 [10](https://www.allstate.com/personal-umbrella-policy)
If your net worth is over $500,000 (great job!), [you need umbrella insurance](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/who-needs-umbrella-insurance). No question about it. Otherwise, it’s like storing all your money in your house and then deciding not to bother locking the door. Or running around naked. Or moving to a pig farm and refusing to wear anything but high heels. Okay, maybe that last one is a little weird, but you get the picture. When it comes to a defensive strategy for your finances, umbrella insurance is a must-have.
