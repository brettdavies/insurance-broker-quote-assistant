New York is a no-fault state. That means that every motor vehicle (car, van, truck, etc.) garaged in New York state must be covered by an insurance policy that provides the state minimum level of benefits for any occupant of the motor vehicle who is injured in a car accident, regardless of fault (with certain exceptions). These benefits are known as  _no-fault benefits._
The insurer of the vehicle that you were occupying during the accident is known as the  _no-fault carrier_. The no-fault carrier is obligated to pay the accident-related medical bills and related expenses up until the point that the benefits have either been paid in full or more commonly, been terminated by the carrier.
By law, every New York automobile insurance policy has to provide for a minimum of $50,000 in no-fault benefits. For a small additional premium, a person can purchase additional personal injury protection or APIP that increases the coverage to $150,000. Check your insurance policy to see if you have APIP and call your agent and ask that this coverage be added to your policy if it isn’t there.
You can only file an application for no-fault benefits with the insurer for the school bus or bus if you do not own a motor vehicle or live with a relative in New York who owns a motor vehicle. Only in this situation can you seek no-fault benefits from the insurer of the bus if you are not an owner, operator, or employee of an owner or operator of the bus.
Sometimes the driver of the at-fault vehicle has no regard for the law and drives away after knocking down a pedestrian without concern for the [injured pedestrian’s](https://www.greenspans-law.com/white-plains/pedestrian-accidents/) health. If the pedestrian cannot identify the vehicle, it is of critical importance that the police are notified of the incident immediately and a report filed within 24 hours of the incident.
3. If you live in New York and neither own nor reside with a relative who owns a motor vehicle, then you need to seek benefits from the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation — MVAIC
1. Driving a motor vehicle while drugged or intoxicated
2. Committing an act that would constitute a felony, or seeking to avoid lawful apprehension or arrest by a law enforcement officer
3. Operating a motor vehicle in a race or speed test
4. Operating or occupying a motor vehicle known to that person to be stolen
5. Repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining a motor vehicle if the conduct is within the course of a business of repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining a motor vehicle and the injury occurs on the business premises
* If you were injured in a motor vehicle that you own, then contact your auto insurer at the claims number provided in your policy.
* If the injury occurred while you were a passenger in a car owned by a member of your household, you are covered under the owner’s policy and are eligible for no-fault benefits through that policy.
* If you are hurt while you were a passenger in any other private passenger vehicle, the insurer for that vehicle will be obligated to furnish no-fault benefits.
For example, if you were injured while riding as a passenger in a taxicab or an airport limousine, you will need to obtain the police report of the accident. The police report will have the identity of the carrier, the name of the policyholder and in some cases, the policy number. Once you identify the no-fault carrier, you can contact the claims office for that carrier (there is usually an 800 number to report the claim). This should be done promptly—do not wait.
This is very important. You have 30 days (and that is it!) from the date of the accident to notify the carrier of the accident and your claim for no-fault benefits.
* The notice must be in writing and set forth details sufficient to identify yourself along with reasonably obtainable information regarding the time, place and circumstances of the accident.
The completed application must be returned to the no-fault carrier within  _30 days_ of the accident if the original notice (described above) was not in writing.
The carrier will assign a  _claim number_ to your case. This claim number must be provided to each of your health care providers along the following information:
Each of your providers will have you sign a form  _assignment of benefits_. Signing this form allows your doctors and other health care providers to bill the no-fault carrier directly for services rendered to you. If there is a dispute between the provider and the carrier and you have signed an assignment of benefits form, the provider and not you will be responsible for resolving the dispute.
