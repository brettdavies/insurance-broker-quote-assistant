[State Farm](/us/companies/state-farm/67041/) is preparing to expand its presence in Massachusetts by offering new homeowners, automobile, and other insurance products.

The company currently holds less than 0.29% of the market share in both homeowners and auto insurance in the state.

The insurer expects to make several products available in early 2027 through its network of captive agents. As of the beginning of September, State Farm had approximately 22,000 personal auto policies and 10,000 homeowners policies in force in Massachusetts, according to spokesperson Tom Hartmann.

“We have begun filings in the state and are in the early stages of this process,” Hartmann said. He said, “We see tremendous opportunity to meet customer needs and serve more customers in more ways” with the introduction of new fire, auto, and other insurance products.

The policies State Farm has written in Massachusetts so far have been offered on an “accommodation basis” to existing policyholders who relocated to the state, Hartmann said.

Homeowners and personal auto insurance markets in Massachusetts are largely controlled by Mapfre, an international carrier operating in 11 states. Mapfre entered the Massachusetts market by acquiring Commerce Group Inc. in 2008 and rebranded it as Mapfre U.S.A. Corp. two years later.

The company’s US headquarters remain in Webster, Massachusetts, and all U.S. acquisitions have since been consolidated under the Mapfre USA brand.

State Farm, the largest property and casualty insurer in the United States, employs more than 65,000 people nationwide, with about 13,000 based at its headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois. The company’s scale and reach position it as a significant player in the national insurance market, even as it seeks to grow its footprint in Massachusetts.

Recently, State Farm introduced a [voluntary exit program](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/state-farm-rolls-out-voluntary-exit-option-says-layoffs-in-limited-scenarios-548641.aspx) and workforce realignment process, providing employees with more options when staffing adjustments are needed in specific business areas.

The company also noted that layoffs are expected only in “limited scenarios,” with each business area determining the use of the new program based on its needs.
