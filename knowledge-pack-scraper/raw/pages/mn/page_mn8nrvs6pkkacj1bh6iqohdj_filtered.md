Florida’s 2025 roofing law allows insurers to drop coverage if your roof is 15 years or older, even if it’s in perfect condition. New code rules also require full replacements for partial damage and prioritize metal roofs in high-risk zones.

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/what-is-florida-roofing-law-changes-2025.png)

### What Changed in 2025 (and Why It Matters Now)

Florida’s 2025 roofing overhaul reshaped what it means to stay insured and compliant. Policies can now be dropped based on roof age alone. 

Even small repairs may trigger full replacements, and stricter codes favor metal or Class 4 shingles, leaving many contractors avoiding minor jobs.

**Quick Recap:**

* Roofs 15+ years old = eligible for non-renewal (even if undamaged)
* Repairs must now meet full 2025 code, even for small patches
* Metal roofs encouraged, but HOA pushback still common
* Insurance discounts require paperwork, no auto credits
* Contractors avoiding jobs under 25% damage

What’s unfolding now is the result of five years of legislative buildup, insurer exits, and policy reforms. To protect your home (and wallet), you’ll need to understand how we got here, and what’s coming next.

## What the New Florida Roof Law Means for Homeowners in 2025

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image6-1.jpg)

From insurance cancellations to unexpected upgrade costs, these changes are already being felt across the state. Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes, and how the new rules are playing out in real life.

### 1. Insurers Can Now Drop You If Your Roof Is Over 15 Years Old

Under the 2025 updates, insurers are allowed to deny or non-renew homeowners’ insurance policies based entirely on the age of the roof, 15 years or older, even if the roof is in perfect condition. 

This change is rooted in efforts to reduce risk in Florida’s unstable insurance market.

**Key Points:**

* Insurers can decline coverage at renewal based on roof age alone.
* No visible damage is required for non-renewal.
* Homeowners may keep coverage with a certified inspection showing 5+ years of roof life.
* Inspections must meet insurer requirements.

**Relevant Statute:** Florida Statute 627.7011, revised via Senate Bill 76. (Not an FBC rule, but directly affects roof compliance and insurability.)

**Conclusive Note:** If your roof is 15+ years old, a professional inspection may be your only way to stay insured.

### 2. Small Damage May Still Mean Full Replacement

Updates to the 2025 Florida Building Code now require all roofing repairs to meet modern code standards. 

If your older roof can’t accommodate partial code-compliant repairs, you may be forced into a full replacement, even if only 10–20% is damaged.

**Key Points:**

* Code requires that repaired sections match current standards.
* Full replacement is triggered if partial compliance isn’t possible.
* Older materials and structural incompatibility are common roadblocks.

**FBC Reference:** 2023 FBC Residential Section R908.1.1 (expected in 2025 code) Florida Statutes §553.884(5).

**Conclusive Note:** Even minor storm damage can now legally require a full reroof under 2025 code.

### 3. Metal Roof Requirements May Conflict With HOA Rules

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image7-1.jpg)

The 2025 FBC pushes for more resilient materials, especially Class 4 shingles and metal roofs, in high-risk areas. 

But many HOAs still enforce appearance rules that restrict these materials, putting homeowners in a legal gray zone.

**Key Points:**

* New code favors metal and impact-resistant roofs in wind zones.
* Some HOAs restrict these options based on aesthetics.
* State law allows homeowners to request exemptions or variances.
* Proof from contractors strengthens your case.

**FBC Reference:** 2025 FBC Residential Sections R301.2.1.2 & R905.10

**Conclusive Note:** If your HOA pushes back on a code-required upgrade, provide written evidence and file an appeal.

### 4. Metal Roofs Don’t Guarantee Insurance Discounts

While metal roofs are more durable and now encouraged in the FBC, they don’t automatically come with insurance premium reductions. 

Many homeowners assume discounts will apply without realizing documentation and a wind mitigation inspection are often required.

**Key Points:**

* Metal roofing upgrades must be documented for credit eligibility.
* Insurers may not apply credits unless formally requested.
* Wind mitigation forms often reference FBC-rated materials.

**FBC Reference:** Related to Florida Statutes §627.0629 (not directly an FBC clause)

**Conclusive Note:** To get the most out of a metal roof upgrade, homeowners need to file the right forms, and follow up.

### 5. Contractors Are Turning Down Small Repairs

With stricter code enforcement and higher administrative requirements under the 2025 FBC, small patch jobs now involve more effort and risk. 

As a result, many contractors are focusing solely on full roof replacements.

**Key Points:**

* Even repairs under 25% now require code-compliant materials and permits.
* Small jobs often generate less profit but require the same paperwork.
* Homeowners report difficulty finding contractors for limited repairs.

**FBC Reference:** FBC Residential Section R908 and Existing Building Section 706.1.1

**Conclusive Note:** If you only need a minor repair, expect fewer contractors to take the job, and ask upfront.

These laws didn’t just change how roofs are built, they changed how homeowners have to think, plan, and act. But reading the fine print is one thing. Living through it? That’s where the real challenges begin. 

Here’s how Florida homeowners are actually being affected by these 2025 changes.

## How Florida’s 2025 Roofing Laws Are Affecting Homeowners

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image3-2.jpg)

The 2025 roofing laws brought big promises, but in practice, they’ve led to unexpected challenges. 

Homeowners across Florida are dealing with new headaches: canceled insurance, higher costs, and contractors refusing small jobs. 

Here’s what these changes look like on the ground.

### 1. Insurers Are Cancelling Policies for Older Roofs That Seem Fine

If your roof is 15 years or older, even with no visible damage, your insurer can now drop your policy. It’s not about condition anymore; it’s about age. 

To keep coverage, many homeowners must now provide certified proof that their roof has at least five more years of life left.

### 2. Small Repairs Can Lead to Full Roof Replacements

The 2025 code requires all repairs to meet current standards. On older roofs, this isn’t always possible. 

That’s why even 10–20% damage can result in a full replacement recommendation. Many homeowners expecting a quick fix are facing far more expensive outcomes.

### 3. HOAs Are Blocking Roof Upgrades Required by the New Code

Florida’s new code encourages metal and impact-resistant shingles, but some HOAs are still enforcing outdated rules. 

Homeowners are caught between state law and HOA guidelines. You can request an exemption, but you’ll need contractor documentation to support your case.

### 4. Metal Roofs Are Rising

Metal roofing is now favored under the new code, but many homeowners wrongly assume their premiums will go down without doing anything. 

Most insurers require formal documentation before applying wind mitigation credits, so ask, submit, and follow up.

### 5. Contractors Are Turning Down Small Repairs

With more paperwork and stricter permit rules, some contractors are walking away from anything less than a full reroof. 

That’s left homeowners with minor damage struggling to get service. If you only need a partial fix, ask upfront if the contractor handles under-25% repairs.

These issues are forcing homeowners to rethink how they maintain, insure, and upgrade their roofs. The rules have changed, and waiting until a storm hits could be a costly mistake. 

So what can you do now, before the next hurricane or policy renewal? Here’s where to start.

## What Florida Homeowners Should Do Now (Before the Next Storm)

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image4-2.jpg)

With Florida’s roofing laws now fully in effect, being reactive is no longer enough. 

Whether or not you’ve seen damage, the best time to prepare is before the next storm rolls in. Here’s what every homeowner should be doing right now:

* **Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection:** Even if your roof looks fine, insurers may still demand documentation, especially if it’s over 10 years old. A formal inspection can prove your roof is insurable and may be the difference between keeping or losing your coverage.

* **Consider Upgrading to a Metal Roof:** Metal roofs are favored in the updated Florida Building Code for their wind resistance. While the upfront cost may be higher, the long-term value often includes better durability, lower maintenance, and potential insurance discounts (if properly documented).

* **Be Smart When Choosing a Contractor:** Not all contractors are created equal. Watch out for red flags like vague quotes, pressure to sign quickly, or lack of licensing. Choose professionals who pull proper permits and clearly explain what code compliance means under the new laws.

* **Review Your Insurance Policy Closely:** Pay special attention to your roof coverage. Are you covered for full replacement cost (RCV), or only actual cash value (ACV)? That difference can mean thousands out of pocket if damage occurs. Don’t wait until a claim to find out.

Taking these steps now can save you from scrambling later, when a storm hits, when rates spike, or when your policy suddenly disappears. 

## The Other “New Roof Laws” in Florida You Might’ve Missed (2020–2024)

![](https://floridaroofingandgutters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image1-1.jpg)

The 2025 roofing laws didn’t drop out of the sky. 

They were the result of five years of continuous legal updates, rising insurance costs, and mounting pressure on both homeowners and insurers. 

Here’s what led up to the changes:

### 2024: New Permit Rules and Material Bans Started Quietly Before 2025

In 2024, contractors, inspectors, and local governments began adjusting their processes ahead of the new Florida Building Code changes. 

The official law hadn’t gone into effect yet, but many counties had already begun enforcing upcoming standards, especially around roofing materials and structural requirements.

**Key changes in 2024:**

* Permit offices increased scrutiny on roofing materials and documentation.
* Some counties began rejecting permits for outdated shingle types.
* Contractors phased out roof systems that wouldn’t meet 2025 code.

**Takeaway:** Though the major law overhaul was still a year away, 2024 was when Florida quietly laid the groundwork for the statewide roofing reset.

### 2023: Roof Age Became a Legal Factor in Insurance Decisions

By 2023, the insurance industry had fully shifted its focus to risk avoidance. 

Roof age, more than visible damage, became the primary reason for coverage denials, premium hikes, and policy cancellations. Even homeowners with new or well-maintained roofs started to feel the pressure.

**Key changes in 2023:**

* Mandatory inspections for roofs over 10 years old became standard practice.
* Insurance companies began refusing to renew policies based purely on roof age.
* Premiums increased across the board, even for recently replaced roofs, due to stricter underwriting.

**Takeaway:** Roof age, not roof condition, became the key battleground for homeowners trying to stay insured in Florida.

### 2022: Mass Insurer Withdrawals Triggered New Coverage Laws

The year 2022 brought real panic to the market. Several major insurers either pulled out of Florida or shut down entirely due to the high volume of claims and legal exposure. 

Homeowners were left scrambling, forced to accept higher rates or switch to state-backed plans with limited options.

**Key changes in 2022:**

* Multiple insurers stopped writing new policies or exited the state.
* Premiums for existing policies increased dramatically, especially for homes with older roofs.
* Policy options became limited, pushing many toward Citizens Property Insurance.

**Takeaway:** 2022 exposed the fragility of Florida’s insurance market, and how directly it’s tied to roofing laws and risk assessments.

### 2020–2021: Florida’s First Big Move to End “Free Roof” Abuse

In the early years of this timeline, Florida took its first steps toward roofing law reform by addressing widespread abuse of the Assignment of Benefits (AOB) system. 

These laws were designed to stop third-party contractors from hijacking claims and filing inflated invoices without homeowner oversight.

**Key changes in 2020–2021:**

* New limits placed on how and when contractors could use AOB.
* Homeowners regained control of their claims process.
* Lawsuits against insurers required pre-suit notice and documentation.

**Takeaway:** These changes didn’t just clean up contractor abuse, they also set the tone for more oversight, more documentation, and more homeowner responsibility in the years to come.

Together, these laws set the stage for everything homeowners are now facing in 2025. 

## The Only Thing Riskier Than a Leaky Roof Is Not Knowing the Law

Whether it’s roof age restrictions, stricter repair rules, or silent policy changes buried in fine print, what you don’t know can cost you.

Don’t wait for the storm. Stay covered, stay compliant.
