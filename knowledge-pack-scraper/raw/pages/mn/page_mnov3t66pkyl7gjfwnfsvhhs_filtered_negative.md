## Financial Results
## Key Facts
* Underwriting annuities is the primary business for life insurers rather than traditional life insurance, accounting for 55.8 percent of life/annuity direct premiums written in 2024.
* Net income after taxes for the life/annuity insurance industry decreased 15.4 points from $38.5 billion in 2023 to $32.6 billion in 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
## Life/Annuity/Accident and Health Sector
Traditional life insurance products such as universal life and term life for individuals, and group life, remain an important part of the business, making up 20.9 percent of direct premiums written.
Annuities are contracts that accumulate funds or pay out a fixed or variable income stream. The income stream can be for a set period or over the lifetime of the contract holder or beneficiaries. Accident and health insurance, which includes distinctive products apart from traditional health insurance, account for 23.3 percent of direct premiums written. In addition to annuities, accident and health, and life insurance products, life insurers may offer financial services such as asset management.
Traditional health insurance, which is not included in this section and is not considered a part of the life/annuity sector, is described under [Private Health Insurance](https://www.iii.org/publications/2019-insurance-fact-book/life-health-financial-data/premiums-by-line). Health insurance pays for medical, surgical and hospital services received by the insured, as well as routine and preventive care, usually within a network format. Of the many types of plans available, most include a deductible paid by the insured, and benefits received are tax-free.
Accident and health insurance, a product provided by the life/annuity and property/casualty (P/C) sectors, encompasses a variety of specialty products related to health, such as:
* reimbursement for the time a policyholder spent in a hospital or was disabled;
* short- and long-term disability based on employment;
* long-term care; and
* critical or catastrophic illness insurance.
Accident and health insurance is not meant to replace health insurance.
