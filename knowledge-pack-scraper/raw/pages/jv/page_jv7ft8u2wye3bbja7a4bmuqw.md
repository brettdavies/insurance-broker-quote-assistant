The national average cost of car insurance in the United States as of September 2025 is $2,324 annually or $194 per month, according to Experian data based on policies sold through our automotive insurance marketplace.
Nationwide, the average cost of [minimum coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) car insurance is $1,548 annually or $129 per month. If you want more protection or your auto lender requires it, you might opt for full coverage car insurance, which includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/). The national average cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,899 annually or $242 per month.
The **cheapest states for car insurance** are Vermont, where a full coverage policy costs an average of $1,003 annually ($84 per month), followed by Maine ($108 per month) and New Hampshire ($105 per month).
The **most expensive states for car insurance** are Maryland, with an average annual premium of $4,296 ($358 per month) for full coverage, followed by Connecticut ($311 per month) and New York ($293 per month).
### Factors That Affect Car Insurance Rates
The cost of car insurance can be affected by factors such as:
  * **Age** (younger drivers generally pay more)
  * **Gender** (men typically pay more than women)
  * **Where you live** (premiums may be higher areas with high crime or a lot of accidents)
  * **The vehicle you're insuring** (new cars cost more to insure than used cars)
  * **Your driving record** (incidents and violations usually drive your costs up)


The type and amount of coverage you buy affects the cost of your car insurance. Most states require drivers to have a minimum amount of [liability insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-liability-insurance/). If your vehicle is financed or leased, you are likely required to carry full coverage as a condition of your loan or lease agreement.
While the average costs in this article are good general guideposts, the actual cost of your car insurance could differ. To help find the best rates, take the time to [compare insurance quotes](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from several insurers before buying a policy.
## How Are Car Insurance Costs Trending?
Car insurance costs have increased dramatically in the past few years. The rising cost of vehicles, parts and repairs, as well as the growing frequency of extreme weather events, have all played a role. The number of serious accidents leading to injuries, fatalities and lawsuits is also on the rise, escalating the cost of car insurance claims.

## Average Car Insurance Rates by State
Where you live isn't the only factor in your car insurance rates, but it plays a significant role. Different states have different insurance regulations and requirements, weather risks, population densities and other characteristics that can impact your [auto insurance premiums](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/factors-that-determine-your-car-insurance-rates/). Here's the average cost of full coverage car insurance by state and how it differs from the national full coverage policy average of $2,899 annually or $242 per month.

## Average Car Insurance Rates by Age and Gender
Your [gender](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-gender-impact-car-insurance-premiums/) can also influence the cost of car insurance in states where insurers can consider it. Women are statistically less likely to have serious car accidents or DUIs than men, according to the Insurance Information Institute, so they may pay less for car insurance (although this isn't always the case).
When all age groups are considered, women pay an average of $2,318 annually ($193 per month), according to Experian data. In comparison, men pay an average of $2,331 annually or $194 per month.
As you get older, your car insurance rates typically go down—sometimes considerably, as the chart below shows. Car insurance premiums generally decline steadily until you reach your mid-70s, when they tend to tick upwards again.
Average Car Insurance Cost by Age and Gender in the U.S. Age | Female | Male  
---|---|---  
Under 20 | $3,246 | $3,450  
20-29 | $2,684 | $2,762  
30-39 | $2,395 | $2,271  
40-49 | $2,293 | $2,161  
50-59 | $2,022 | $1,968  
60-69 | $1,746 | $1,721  
70-79 | $1,720 | $1,862  
80 or above | $1,810 | $2,007

## How Your Driving Record Impacts Your Insurance Costs
Practicing safe driving habits can reduce your risk of accidents or traffic citations. This can pay off in lower insurance premiums: Drivers with a "clean" driving record that shows no incidents or violations pay an average of $2,177 annually or $181 per month for car insurance. One [moving violation](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/) brings those premiums to an average of $2,512 per year.
If your driving record includes moving violations or accidents (even fender-benders where you weren't at fault), insurance companies may view you as a higher-risk driver and raise your car insurance premiums to compensate.
The chart below shows how the number and severity of infractions may impact your insurance costs. _Incidents_ include things like traffic accidents or insurance claims; _violations_ include moving violations, such as speeding tickets.
Average Car Insurance Cost by Driving Record in the U.S. Driving Record | Annual Cost  
---|---  
Clean | $2,177  
1 Incident | $2,512  
1 Violation | $2,652  
2 Incidents | $2,778  
2 Violations | $2,639  
3+ Incidents | $3,170  
3+ Violations | $3,026

## Cheapest Car Insurance Rates by Carrier
Elements such as your age, location and vehicle greatly affect the cost of car insurance, but they aren't the only factors impacting your premiums. Each insurance company uses its own criteria when determining rates, so the price you're quoted can differ widely from one insurance carrier to another.
The table below shows the cheapest full coverage auto insurance among the insurance carriers that sell the most policies nationwide.
Cheapest Full Coverage Car Insurance Carriers in the U.S. Carrier | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost  
---|---|---  
Travelers | $1,810 | $151  
Liberty Mutual | $2,440 | $203  
Nationwide | $2,492 | $208  
Root | $2,496 | $208  
Mercury | $2,581 | $215  
Source: Experian data as of September 2025  
Note: Costs above represent insurance quotes, not policy premiums
While it's impossible to know the formula each insurance provider uses to set rates, factors such as the company's projected operating costs, estimated claims expenditures, risk tolerance and profitability goals all figure into the calculations. Some companies might have higher overhead expenses than others, for example, which could mean higher premiums. Shopping around and comparing quotes from several different insurance companies for similar levels of coverage can help you find the most affordable car insurance for you.
## How to Save on Car Insurance
Whether your current car insurance premiums are above average, below average or somewhere in between, there are several steps you can take to [save on car insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs-now/).
  * **Increase your deductible.** You can choose your deductible, which is the amount you're responsible for when you file a claim. Raising the [deductible](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-does-car-insurance-deductible-work/) generally lowers your premiums. Just be sure you could afford to pay the higher deductible if necessary.
  * **Drop unnecessary coverage.** Cutting out extras such as roadside assistance or rental car reimbursement coverage could lower your car insurance rates. If your paid-off car is older and not worth very much, and you could afford to repair or replace it out of pocket, you may want to drop collision and comprehensive coverage.
  * **Look for available discounts.** Check with your car insurance company and other providers to see what discounts they offer. You could get discounts for [bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/), taking a defensive driving class or driving less than the average mileage. Your employer or an organization you belong to might offer car insurance discounts too.
  * **Improve your credit.** Insurance companies in most states can use your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-credit-based-insurance-score/) when determining your premiums. In those states, poor credit could mean paying more for auto insurance. Taking steps to [improve your consumer credit score](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/) could positively impact your credit-based insurance score, potentially saving you money on car insurance.


[Shopping around](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-compare-car-insurance-rates/) with a variety of providers can help you find lower rates on car insurance. You can get auto insurance quotes by visiting insurance company websites or contacting insurance companies. For a convenient way to explore your options, try Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). It gathers auto insurance quotes from dozens of top insurance companies so you can see which provider offers the best deal.

Experian's insurance marketplace matches users with auto insurance coverage from more than 30 carriers across 50 states and Washington, D.C.
### Average Car Insurance
Average car insurance premiums represent real policies sold through Experian's insurance marketplace. Data is reflective of policy premiums marketplace users pay.
Data in this analysis is current as of the final day of the indicated month. For state and national premiums, averages represent policies sold in the 12 complete months up to and including the indicated month unless otherwise noted. To provide an expanded sample size, averages that rely on age, gender or driving record utilize data from the latest 24 complete months.
### Cheapest Car Insurance
