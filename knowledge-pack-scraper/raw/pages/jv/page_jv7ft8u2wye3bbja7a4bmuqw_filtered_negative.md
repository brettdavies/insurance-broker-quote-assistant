Nationwide, the average cost of [minimum coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) car insurance is $1,548 annually or $129 per month. If you want more protection or your auto lender requires it, you might opt for full coverage car insurance, which includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/). The national average cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,899 annually or $242 per month.
The type and amount of coverage you buy affects the cost of your car insurance. Most states require drivers to have a minimum amount of [liability insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-liability-insurance/). If your vehicle is financed or leased, you are likely required to carry full coverage as a condition of your loan or lease agreement.
While the average costs in this article are good general guideposts, the actual cost of your car insurance could differ. To help find the best rates, take the time to [compare insurance quotes](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from several insurers before buying a policy.
Has the cost of your car insurance risen recently? Regularly taking time to compare car insurance quotes from other providers could help you find the same coverage at lower rates. Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) is a convenient way to shop around and get quotes from dozens of top insurance carriers at once.
Where you live isn't the only factor in your car insurance rates, but it plays a significant role. Different states have different insurance regulations and requirements, weather risks, population densities and other characteristics that can impact your [auto insurance premiums](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/factors-that-determine-your-car-insurance-rates/). Here's the average cost of full coverage car insurance by state and how it differs from the national full coverage policy average of $2,899 annually or $242 per month.
---|---|---
Your [gender](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-gender-impact-car-insurance-premiums/) can also influence the cost of car insurance in states where insurers can consider it. Women are statistically less likely to have serious car accidents or DUIs than men, according to the Insurance Information Institute, so they may pay less for car insurance (although this isn't always the case).

Practicing safe driving habits can reduce your risk of accidents or traffic citations. This can pay off in lower insurance premiums: Drivers with a "clean" driving record that shows no incidents or violations pay an average of $2,177 annually or $181 per month for car insurance. One [moving violation](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/) brings those premiums to an average of $2,512 per year.
The chart below shows how the number and severity of infractions may impact your insurance costs. _Incidents_ include things like traffic accidents or insurance claims; _violations_ include moving violations, such as speeding tickets.

Whether your current car insurance premiums are above average, below average or somewhere in between, there are several steps you can take to [save on car insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs-now/).
* **Increase your deductible.** You can choose your deductible, which is the amount you're responsible for when you file a claim. Raising the [deductible](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-does-car-insurance-deductible-work/) generally lowers your premiums. Just be sure you could afford to pay the higher deductible if necessary.
* **Look for available discounts.** Check with your car insurance company and other providers to see what discounts they offer. You could get discounts for [bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/), taking a defensive driving class or driving less than the average mileage. Your employer or an organization you belong to might offer car insurance discounts too.
* **Improve your credit.** Insurance companies in most states can use your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-credit-based-insurance-score/) when determining your premiums. In those states, poor credit could mean paying more for auto insurance. Taking steps to [improve your consumer credit score](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/) could positively impact your credit-based insurance score, potentially saving you money on car insurance.
[Shopping around](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-compare-car-insurance-rates/) with a variety of providers can help you find lower rates on car insurance. You can get auto insurance quotes by visiting insurance company websites or contacting insurance companies. For a convenient way to explore your options, try Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.experian.com/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). It gathers auto insurance quotes from dozens of top insurance companies so you can see which provider offers the best deal.
