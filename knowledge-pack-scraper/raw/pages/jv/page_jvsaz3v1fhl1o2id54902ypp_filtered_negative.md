![Liability Insurance: An insurance product that provides protection against claims resulting from injuries and damage to other people or property.](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/GxyOqkKhghC8lR1jf5wQUsSYIiY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale\(\):max_bytes\(150000\):strip_icc\(\):format\(webp\)/liability_insurance.asp-final-5047623e88434455a627aabe9ab2bba0.png)
##  What Is Liability Insurance?
##  Understanding the Mechanics of Liability Insurance
##  Special Considerations for Liability Insurance Coverage
* **Errors and Omissions Liability Insurance (E &O):** An [errors and omissions liability insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/errors-omissions-insurance.asp) policy covers lawsuits arising from negligent professional services or failing to perform professional duties. Lawyers, [accountants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp), architects, engineers, or any business providing a service to a client for a fee should purchase this form of insurance. An E&O policy does not cover criminal prosecution, fraudulent or dishonest acts, or claims against bodily injury. The insured, however, is covered for attorney fees, court costs, and any settlements up to the amount specified by the insurance contract.
* **Directors and Officers (D &O) Insurance: **This type of policy protects directors and officers of large companies against legal judgments and costs arising from unlawful acts, erroneous investment decisions, failure to maintain property, releasing confidential information, hiring and firing decisions, [conflicts of interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp), [gross negligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wanton-disregard.asp), and other errors. Most D&O policies exclude coverage for [fraud](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraud.asp) or other criminal acts. [Premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) depend on the company, its location, industry type, and loss experience.
##  Exploring Different Types of Liability Insurance Coverage
* **Employer’s liability and[workers' compensation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workers-compensation.asp) **are mandatory coverage for employers, which protects the business against liabilities arising from injuries or the death of an employee.2
* **[Indemnity insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indemnity_insurance.asp) **provides coverage to protect a business against negligence claims due to financial harm resulting from mistakes or failure to perform.
* **[Umbrella liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/umbrella-personal-liability-policy.asp) **policies[protect against catastrophic losses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wrap-up-insurance.asp). Coverage generally kicks in when the liability limits of other insurance are reached.
* Comprehensive general liability policies[partnership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp), joint venture, corporation, association, organization, or newly acquired business. Insurance coverage includes bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury, medical payments, and premises and operations liability. Insurers provide coverage for compensatory and general damages for lawsuits but not punitive damages.
An umbrella insurance policy is additional liability insurance coverage that is purchased and goes beyond the dollar limits of the insured's existing homeowners, auto, or [watercraft insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/watercraft-insurance.asp). Umbrella policies tend to be affordable and offered in increments of $500,000 or $1 million.
