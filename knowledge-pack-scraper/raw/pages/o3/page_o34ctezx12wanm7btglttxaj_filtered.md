These basic types of insurance make up minimum and full coverage plans. Minimum insurance is the best option for drivers looking for affordable coverage. However, minimum insurance doesn’t work for everyone — you’ll need [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/full-coverage-auto-insurance/) if you have a car loan or lease.

A full coverage policy is ideal for drivers with vehicles they can't afford to replace outright.

Understanding your needs and budget can help determine how much insurance to purchase. It’s important to note that various factors influence auto insurance premiums, such as driving record, age, gender, and vehicle make and model.

Therefore, these premiums only serve as a general guide, and individuals should get a Geico auto insurance quote to determine how much coverage they can afford.

With solid ratings and low average rates, one of the only downsides is that there aren’t many Geico auto insurance options for add-ons. Insurance companies offer add-ons so drivers can customize their policies.

Read More: [What types of car insurance coverage does Geico offer?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/what-types-of-car-insurance-coverage-does-geico-offer/)

Most companies provide at least a few, and Geico is one of them. However, Geico offers fewer options than many of its similarly-sized competitors. One crucial difference between Geico and many of its competitors is that Geico doesn’t offer gap insurance (Learn More: [Does Geico offer gap insurance?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/does-geico-offer-gap-insurance/)). If gap insurance is important to you, Geico isn’t the right company.

Gap insurance pays the difference between what you owe on a loan and what your car is worth.

Tracey L. Wells
**Licensed Insurance Agent & Agency Owner**

If you’re unsure of how much insurance you need, a Geico representative can help. Some of the available coverages are dependent on what state you live in. For example, whether you can buy PIP or MedPay coverage depends on your state (Read More: [Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Medical Coverage that Your Car Insurance Policy will Pay For](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/personal-injury-protection-pip-and-medical-coverage-that-your-car-insurance-policy-will-pay-for/)).

And while it doesn’t offer the most add-on options, Geico offers a few valuable ways to add extra protection to your policy, such as Geico’s roadside assistance comes to the rescue for situations like a flat tire, dead battery, empty gas tank, or when you need a tow (Learn More: [Best Auto Insurance for Towing and Roadside Assistance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-for-towing-and-roadside-assistance/)).

Geico also offers mechanical breakdown insurance, which pays for mechanical problems with your car that result in a trip to the repair shop. Mechanical breakdown insurance can save you thousands in repairs but does not cover maintenance issues like worn brakes.

Adding more coverage is never a bad idea, but you should only purchase what you need. Every add-on increases your monthly rates, quickly making your policy expensive.

Kristen Gryglik
**Licensed Insurance Agent**

And while companies like Uber and Lyft offer insurance for their drivers, but there are often gaps in the coverage. Geico’s [rideshare insurance coverage](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/rideshare-insurance/) fills in the gaps to better protect you while you work.

## Auto Insurance Discounts Available at Geico

## Why Geico Could be the Best Insurer for You

Our Geico insurance review found that Geico offers affordable rates compared to major competitors. The company also offers multiple discounts, ranging from good driver discounts to bundling discounts (Learn More: [Can I bundle my Geico car insurance with other policies?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/can-i-bundle-my-geico-car-insurance-with-other-policies/)). However, higher-risk drivers may have trouble getting insured by Geico, and Geico doesn’t offer as many add-on coverages as other companies.

For the majority of drivers, though, Geico is a solid choice with great business ratings and affordable rates on coverages. To find the best auto policy, [enter your ZIP code](#mdabottom) to compare quotes from multiple reputable companies in your area.
