_“The Competition Act is the expression of a social purpose, namely the establishment of more ethical trade practices calculated to afford greater protection of the consuming public. It represents the will of the people of Canada that the old maxim caveat emptor, let the purchaser beware, yield somewhat to the more enlightened view caveat venditor – let the seller beware.”_
_R. v. Colgate-Palmolive Ltd_.)
********************
_“The general impression test … must be applied from a perspective similar to that of ‘ordinary hurried purchasers’, that is, consumers who take no more than ordinary care to observe that which is staring them in the face upon their first contact with an advertisement. The courts must not conduct their analysis from the perspective of a careful and diligent consumer. … In sum, it is clear that … the ‘general impression’ test … is the impression of a commercial representation on a credulous and inexperienced consumer. … courts view the average consumer as someone who is not particularly experienced at detecting the falsehoods or subtleties found in commercial representations.”_
_Richard v. Time_)
********************
**OVERVIEW****OF MISLEADING ADVERTISING
The federal  _[Competition Act](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/competition-law/) _is the principal legislation governing misleading advertising in Canada. In addition to this federal framework legislation that applies to most businesses and industries in Canada and marketing to Canadians, many other federal and provincial laws can also apply to advertising and marketing practices in Canada, depending on the type of claim and industry sector.
These include [provincial consumer protection laws](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/advertising-law/) (e.g., the Ontario  _Consumer Protection Act_ and other provincial and territorial consumer protection statutes), sector specific legislation (e.g., relating to food and drugs, cosmetics, liquor and cannabis) and federal packaging and labelling legislation (e.g., the  _[Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/packaging-and-labelling/)_,  _[Textile Labelling Act](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/packaging-and-labelling/)_ and  _[Precious Metals Marking Act](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/packaging-and-labelling/)_).
In addition, many professional bodies and trade/professional associations self-regulate their members’ advertising and marketing activities (e.g., lawyer advertising under professional rules of conduct, other professionals including architects, chiropractors, dentists, doctors, real estate agents and brokers and others and Ad Standards, which regulates its voluntary advertising/marketing industry members through  _The Canadian Code of Advertising Standards_).
**GENERAL MISLEADING ADVERTISING SECTIONS****
OF THE _COMPETITION ACT_**
The federal  _Competition Act_, which is the primary legislation governing advertising and marketing in Canada, contains both civil and criminal misleading representation provisions that apply to false or misleading claims made to promote the supply or use of products (including services) or business interests.
Under the general civil misleading advertising section (section 74.01), it must be proven that: (i) a representation has been made; (ii) to the public; (iii) to promote a product  _or_ business interest; (iv) that is literally false or misleading (or with a false or misleading general impression); and (v) that the claim is “material” (i.e., likely to influence an average consumer into buying or using a product or otherwise altering their conduct).
Criminal misleading advertising in Canada under section 52 of the  _Competition Act_ is substantially similar, but in addition also requires that a false or misleading claim be made “knowingly or recklessly” (i.e., intentionally).
1. The misleading advertising sections of the _Competition Act_ are broad enough to apply to claims made relating to services or any business interest. The term “business interest” has been broadly interpreted by Canadian courts to include virtually any business related purpose, including by charities and non-profits.
3. Both the literal meaning and the [“general impression”](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/general-impression-test/)of an advertising or marketing claim are relevant in determining whether the claim is false or misleading in a material respect (e.g., an advertising/marketing claim that is literally true may, nevertheless, be false or misleading if the “general impression” of the claim is misleading). As such, advertisers not only need to consider whether advertising is literally true but whether the general impression of any of the material aspects of the advertising may be misleading (particularly, relating to [price claims](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/price-claims/), product/service [performance claims](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/performance-claims/)and [sales claims](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/osp-claims-sales/), all of which are consistently Canadian [Competition Bureau enforcement](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/bureau-enforcement/) priorities).
5. It is not necessary to prove that an advertising/marketing claim was made to Canadian consumers (i.e., cross-border misleading advertising by Canadians to international consumers can be caught) or was made in a publicly accessible place (i.e., the general criminal and civil misleading advertising sections of the _Competition Act_, sections 52 and 74.01, can apply to more “private” type of marketing events/seminars, telemarketing activities, etc.).
In general, the Bureau will in most cases follow the civil misleading advertising law track under section 74.01 of the _Competition Act_ in its enforcement unless certain criteria are satisfied to pursue a criminal law track, including clear and compelling evidence that misleading advertising was engaged in intentionally and that a criminal prosecution would be in the public interest.
**OTHER** _**COMPETITION ACT**_**
ADVERTISING/MARKETING LAW SECTIONS**
In addition to the “general” misleading advertising provisions discussed above, the  _Competition Act_ also contains a number of other criminal and civil provisions that either prohibit (i.e., criminal offences) or civilly regulate specific types of marketing practices.
These include [bait and switch selling](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/advertising-alphabet/b/) (section 74.02(2)), [deceptive prize notices](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/deceptive-prize-notices/) (section 53), [deceptive telemarketing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/telemarketing/) (section 52.1), [double ticketing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/advertising-alphabet/d/) (section 54), [drip pricing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/drip-pricing/) (sections 52(1.3) and 74.01(1.1)), some specific types of [electronic advertising](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/online-advertising/) (section 74.011), [multi-level marketing and pyramid selling schemes](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/pyramid-selling/) (sections 55 and 55.1), [ordinary selling price (OSP) and sales claims](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/osp-claims-sales/) (section 74.01(2)-(3)), [performance claims](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/performance-claims/) (section 74.01(1)(b)), [promotional contests (i.e., sweepstakes)](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contests/) (section 74.06), [selling products above advertised prices](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/s/) (section 74.05) and [testimonials and endorsements (i.e., influencer marketing)](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/testimonials/) (sections 52, 74.01 and 74.02).
Some of the key misleading advertising related provisions of the  _Competition Act_ are discussed below.
False or misleading price claims about products or services have consistently been one of the Canadian Competition Bureau’s top enforcement priorities. In this regard, false or misleading pricing claims can violate the general civil or criminal misleading representation provisions of the  _Competition Act_ (sections 52 or 74.01) if either a stated price is literally false or some component of the price is not stated upfront (i.e., the [general impression](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/general-impression-test/) of a price claim is misleading).
Canada’s federal  _Competition Act_, however, also includes a number of other civil and criminal price claim related provisions that either prohibit or regulate specific types of product price related advertising/marketing claims.
These include the civil [bait and switch](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/advertising-alphabet/b/) provision (section 74.04), criminal and civil [drip pricing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/drip-pricing/) provisions (sections 52(1.3) and 74.01(1.1)), civil [ordinary selling price (OSP)](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/osp-claims-sales/) provisions (sections 74.01(2)-(5)) (discussed below), criminal [double ticketing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/advertising-alphabet/d/) offence (section 54) and [sale above advertised price](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/s/) provision (section 74.05).
For more information, see: [Price Claims Under the Competition Act](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/price-claims/).
**ORDINARY SELLING PRICE****(OSP)****CLAIMS****
AND SALE CLAIMS**
The  _Competition Act_ contains [“ordinary selling price” or “OSP” provisions](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/osp-claims-sales/), which are intended to prevent advertising inflated “regular” prices in relation to sales.
Under these OSP provisions of the _Competition Act_, claims relating to the “ordinary” or “regular” price of a product or the use of similar types of terms referencing the regular price of a product/service cannot be made unless one of two alternative tests is met: (i) a “substantial volume” of the product has been sold at the stated “regular” price (or higher) within a “reasonable period” of time before or after the claim (the “volume test”) or (ii) the product has been offered for sale in good faith at that price (or higher) for a “substantial period of time” before or after the claim (the “time test”).
When reviewing ordinary selling price claims, it is also important to consider whether the comparison claim is being made to the seller’s regular price or market generally, as the  _Competition Act_ includes provisions and tests relating to both.
The  _Competition Act_ contains a standalone [civil provision](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/performance-claims/) (section 74.01(1)(b)) that prohibits product performance claims that are not based on an “adequate and proper test”.
The Competition Tribunal has set out a non-exhaustive list of factors relevant to determining whether testing is “adequate and proper”. Testing, however, does not need to be 100% reliable or the best scientific testing that could have been performed (i.e., it has been held that testing does not need to meet a test of certainty).
[Promotional contests](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contests/) (i.e., sweepstakes as they are referred to in the United States) in Canada are primarily governed by the  _Competition Act_ (mandatory disclosures under section 74.06 and the general misleading advertising provisions) and the federal  _Criminal Code_ (_Code_) (avoiding the _Code_ ’s illegal lottery provisions.
CASL (Canadian federal anti-spam law) is also often relevant when running contests and promotions in Canada, including if electronic distribution lists will be used to market the contest/promotion, the contest/promotion will include the collection of e-mails for marketing unrelated to administration of the promotion, if participants’ e-mail addresses will be shared with third parties (e.g., related entities or affiliate marketers) or participants are asked or incentivized (e.g., with bonus contest entries) to “share” the contest/promotion with friends or family. For more information about contests and CASL, see: [Contests and CASL](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contests-casl/) and [CASL Compliance Errors](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/anti-spam-compliance-errors/). For CASL checklists and precedents that we offer for sale to comply with CASL, see: [CASL Checklists and Precedents](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/anti-spam-casl-precedents-and-forms/).
Given that the improper operation of a promotional contest can lead to civil and/or criminal liability, it is prudent to have promotional contests reviewed for compliance with the  _Competition Act_ and the _Code_, as well as other relevant laws.
In this regard, the main components of a Canadian contest are generally to include both [short and long contest rules](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contest-forms/) setting out the rules for the contest, a [winner release form](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contest-forms/) (which is particularly important in higher risk promotions, such as trip contests), review of draft creative materials before the contest is launched to ensure that they are not false or misleading and, if the sponsor wants to use entrant information for e-mail or other electronic marketing, complying with the consent and other requirements of [CASL (Canadian anti-spam law)](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/anti-spam-law/).
Such agreements can be useful to shift risk where a sponsor wants to limit potential liability (e.g., misleading advertising, false or misleading influencer claims or violating CASL), particularly with unsophisticated co-sponsors or marketing partners. For more information, see: [Influencer/Co-Sponsor Agreements](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/influencer-co-sponsor-agreements/).

We offer many types of Canadian contest/sweepstakes law precedents and forms to run common types of contests in Canada. For more information, see: [Canadian Contest Precedents/Forms](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/contest-forms/).
********************
The  _Competition Act_ makes it criminal offences to engage in [deceptive telemarketing](https://www.canadianadvertisinglaw.com/telemarketing/) or telemarket unless certain required disclosure under the _Competition Act_ is made.
Under the _Competition Act_ ’s deceptive telemarketing provisions, it is a criminal offence to: (i) make materially false or misleading representations; (ii) operate a contest where the delivery of a prize is conditional on prior payment or certain disclosure is not made; (iii) offer free or below market price products, as consideration for supplying another product, unless certain disclosure is made; or (iv) offer products for sale grossly in excess of their fair market value where delivery is conditional on prior payment.
The _Competition Act_ also requires that certain disclosure be made by telemarketers both at the beginning of a call and sometime during a call.
Like the general misleading advertising provisions of the _Competition Act_, the general impression is relevant to determining whether a claim made by a telemarketer is materially false or misleading. Unlike misleading advertising generally, however, if misleading claims are made in the context of telemarketing, the Competition Bureau does not have the discretion to proceed civilly, given that the only deceptive marketing provisions are criminal offences under section 52.1.
The enforcement of the telemarketing provisions of the _Competition Act_ has been an enforcement priority for the Competition Bureau in recent years, although for the most part aimed at companies and individuals engaged in true “scams” not legitimate marketers that may have committed technical violations of the Act. Having said that, a number of individuals have been charged, convicted and imprisoned in connection with the marketing of a broad range of products, including business directories, office supplies and credit cards.
Some of the potential penalties for violating the civil deceptive marketing practices provisions under Part VII.1 of the  _Competition Act_ include Competition Tribunal or court orders to stop the conduct, publish a corrective notice, pay restitution to consumers and orders to pay AMPs.
Following 2022 amendments to the  _Competition Act_, the maximum AMPs for civil deceptive marketing increased: (i) for individuals, up to the greater of $750,000 ($1 million for each subsequent order) and three times the value of the benefit derived from the deceptive conduct; and (ii) for corporations, up to the greater of $10 million ($15 million for each subsequent order) or three times the value of the benefit derived from the deceptive conduct or, if the latter amount cannot be reasonably determined, 3% of the corporation’s annual worldwide gross revenues.
In addition, as a result of June 2024 amendments to the  _Competition Act_ (under [Bill C-59](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-59)), starting on June 20 2025, private parties will also be able to seek leave from the Competition Tribunal to commence proceedings under the civil deceptive marketing practices provisions with the only leave requirement for standing being that the proceedings are in the “public interest”.
The potential penalties for violating the general criminal misleading advertising section of the  _Competition Act_ (section 52) include, on indictment, a fine in the discretion of the court and/or imprisonment for up to 14 years and, on summary conviction, a fine of up to $200,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year.
The Competition Bureau also commonly negotiates civil consent agreements (i.e., settlements) with parties, which can include remedies not expressly set out under the  _Competition Act_ such as the requirement to adopt a [competition law compliance program](https://www.ipvancouverblog.com/canadiancompetitionlaw-competitionlawcomplianceprograms/), or seeks a prohibition order under the criminal provisions of the  _Competition Act_.
The [enforcement](https://www.ipvancouverblog.com/competition-bureau-investigation/) of the criminal and civil deceptive marketing provisions of the  _Competition Act_ is also an ongoing priority for the Competition Bureau, particularly false or misleading price claims, performance claims and ordinary selling price claims.
