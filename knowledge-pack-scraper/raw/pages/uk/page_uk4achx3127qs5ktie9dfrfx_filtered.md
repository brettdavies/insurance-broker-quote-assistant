# Insurance cancelled due to roof age - how old was your house?

I just got a letter saying my insurance will be cancelled due to roof age, unless I show proof of replacement. The home was built in summer of 2018.....I would think it's still too early for this?? Has anyone encountered this under 10 to 15 years?

Thanks in Advance!

Update: New company decision is to not cover roofs older than 5 years. QBE/Praetorian Insurance Company.

Yea, speechless.
