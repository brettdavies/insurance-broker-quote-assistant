Your Progressive [car insurance rates](/car-insurance/average-car-insurance/) may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including accidents or traffic violations on your driving record. But rates are also increasing due to economic factors affecting the entire auto insurance industry.

If your [Progressive](/reviews/car-insurance/progressive/) insurance rates keep rising, you can shop for a new insurer or take advantage of discounts such as:

* Paying in full.
* Bundling policies.
* Snapshot [telematics](/car-insurance/what-is-telematics/).

## Why did my Progressive auto insurance go up for no reason?

### 1. Standard, industry-wide rate increases

Insurance providers have to account for regular increases in year-to-year expenses, which is why you’ll often see your rate increase at [policy renewal](/car-insurance/car-insurance-renewal/) time.

### 2. Inflation and other economic factors

Inflation, increased [car repair](/car-repair/) costs due to high-tech parts and supply-chain issues, and increased frequency in serious accident claims have driven up insurance policy premiums for many drivers. According to Jerry’s research, car insurance rates have increased 26% between 2021 and 2023.

## What you can do about it

### 1. Consider switching to a new insurance company

[Comparing quotes](/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from multiple insurers before renewal is the best way to avoid or limit rate hikes.

To get a quote, you typically answer a few questions about yourself, your vehicle and your driving history. Do this with multiple providers to determine which insurer can provide the [best auto insurance](/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) coverage at the lowest rate.

### 2. Look at discount options

Even if you stick with Progressive, ensuring you’ve taken advantage of all the [car insurance discounts](/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) you may qualify for can help you significantly lower your insurance premiums.

Here are the discounts types and their average savings:

* **Snapshot Telematics Program ($231):** Personalizes your rate based on your actual driving. The safer you drive, the more you can save.
* **Good Student Discount (10%):** Available if you add a full-time student on your policy who maintains a “B” average or better.
* **Multi-car Discount (12%):** Savings for having more than one vehicle listed on your policy.
* **Online Quote Discount (7%):** Available when you quote car insurance online.
* **Sign Online Discount (9%):** Earned by signing your insurance documents online.
* **Multi-policy Discount (Varies):** Save when you have two or more policies with Progressive.
* **Continuous Insurance Discount (Varies):** Acknowledges the time you spent with your previous insurer with a discount.
* **Teen Driver Discount (Varies):** Helps offset the cost of adding a teen driver to your policy.
* **Homeowner Discount (Varies):** Offered simply for being a homeowner, regardless of whether your home is insured through Progressive.
* **Pay in Full Discount (Varies)**: Available if you pay for your policy in full up front.
* **Automatic Payment Discount (Varies):** Given for setting up automatic payments from a checking account, credit card, or debit card.
* **Paperless Discount (Varies):** Applies when you opt to receive your documents via email and is dependent upon signing your documents online.

### 3. Consider additional options to lower your current insurance price

* Raise your [deductible](/car-insurance/car-insurance-deductible/) on [comprehensive](/car-insurance/comprehensive-insurance/) and [collision coverage](/car-insurance/collision-insurance/). Drivers who choose a higher deductible can often save money on full coverage.
* Take a state-approved [defensive driving](/car-insurance/what-is-defensive-driving/) course. This option isn’t available with Progressive in every state, so check with your insurance agent to see if you qualify.
* Install an anti-theft system or park in a garage. If you decide to go with another insurance provider, they might offer comprehensive coverage discounts.

## Other factors that can make your rates go up

Here are some other reasons you might see an increase in auto insurance rates:

* **Recent [tickets or violations](/car-insurance/what-is-a-citation/):** If you’ve recently been cited for a moving violation, [filed an insurance claim](/car-insurance/car-insurance-claim/), been convicted of a [DUI](/car-insurance/what-is-a-dui/) or been in an [at-fault accident](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/), you should expect a significant rate hike. Your rate could also rise after a [not-at-fault accident](/car-insurance/not-at-fault-accident/) accident that results in a collision claim. Choosing a policy with [accident forgiveness](/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/) can help you avoid this.
* **Age:** Insurance rates peak at 18 years-old, start declining until drivers turn 75, then start to rise again, according to Progressive’s data.
* **Credit score:** Unless you live in [California](/car-insurance/california/), Hawaii or [Massachusetts](/car-insurance/massachusetts/), providers are allowed to [consider your credit score](/car-insurance/credit-based-insurance-score/) when calculating your insurance costs. If your score has recently dropped, your car insurance premium may rise.
* **Vehicle type and cost:** Your vehicle’s [actual cash value](/car-insurance/actual-cash-value-acv/) (ACV) affects your insurance rates, and so do its repair costs. The higher each is, the higher your rates will be.
* **Lapse in coverage:** Even brief [lapses in insurance coverage](/car-insurance/insurance-lapse/) can result in significant rate increases for the next several years.
* **High-risk zip code:** If you live in an area that experiences high crime rates — especially property crimes like vehicle theft — you’ll pay more for coverage than drivers living in safer neighborhoods.
* **Added a new driver or new car:** Many people don’t realize that adding drivers and vehicles to your policy often results in increased rates, especially if you add a driver with a poor driving record or an expensive vehicle.
