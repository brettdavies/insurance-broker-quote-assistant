## Texas Minimum Coverage Requirements & What They Cover

If you drive in Texas, the law says you’ve gotta have liability insurance to cover any injuries or damage you might cause in a crash. These Texas car insurance requirements help ensure you’re financially responsible if you’re at fault for someone else’s medical bills or car repairs.

You’ll need to show proof of insurance if you get pulled over, get in a wreck, or when it’s time to renew your registration—skip it, and you could end up with a fine, a suspended license, or even your car getting impounded. However, basic liability doesn’t cover your damages. That’s why many drivers add collision coverage to pay for repairs to their vehicle, regardless of fault.

In Texas, meeting the 30/60/25 liability minimum is required, but it won’t cover your own vehicle after a crash.

Comprehensive coverage protects against theft, vandalism, and weather-related damage like hail. [Personal injury protection (PIP) auto insurance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-for-personal-injury-protection-pip/) kicks in to help with your medical bills and lost wages after a crash, even if you were the one who caused it. It’s a solid backup when things go wrong and helps you meet car insurance requirements in Texas while avoiding major financial setbacks.

### Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas

To drive legally in Texas, your [auto insurance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/auto-insurance/) policy must include liability coverage with the following state-mandated minimum limits:

* $30,000 for bodily injury to one person in a single crash
* $60,000 total for bodily injuries to multiple people per accident
* $25,000 for damage to someone else’s vehicle or property

This 30/60/25 liability coverage is the minimum allowed under Texas auto insurance requirements and won’t cover your own vehicle or medical costs. You’ll need to show proof of insurance if you’re pulled over, involved in a crash, or registering your vehicle.

If you don’t meet these requirements, you could face a $350 fine the first time, up to $1,000 for repeat offenses, plus license suspension and even vehicle impoundment. The bottom line is that having this coverage isn’t optional; it’s the law.

## Comparing Texas Auto Insurance Rates by Top Providers

The monthly cost of basic and [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/full-coverage-auto-insurance/) in Texas can vary greatly. Knowing how those rates stack up makes it easier to decide what works for your budget and how much risk you’re comfortable taking on.

If you’re only trying to meet auto insurance requirements in Texas, minimum liability insurance is your baseline. USAA offers the lowest rate at $36 per month, but it only covers damage you cause to others. State Farm and Geico also offer affordable options, coming in under $65 per month for the state minimum.

However, once you get full coverage, costs rise fast—Allstate charges $313 per month, more than 8x the minimum required. If you drive a newer car or rely on your vehicle daily, companies like Travelers ($157) or Progressive ($188) offer full coverage at more manageable prices. The tradeoff is simple: the cheaper the policy, the more you’ll likely pay out of pocket if something happens.

## Texas Auto Insurance Monthly Rates by Age & Gender

If you’re shopping for coverage to meet auto insurance requirements in Texas, your age and gender play a bigger role in your monthly rate than you might think. The numbers aren’t random—they reflect how much risk insurers believe you bring to the road, and they help explain [why auto insurance rates go up](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/why-auto-insurance-rates-go-up/) for certain groups.

At 18 years old, guys pay about $333 monthly, more than some car payments. Teen girls pay less—$268—but it’s still steep. By the time you hit 30, the drop is major, with rates falling below $95, saving thousands a year.

Drivers in their 40s, 50s, and 60s see the lowest prices, with most paying under $75 monthly. It comes down to driving experience and claim history—two things young drivers haven’t had time to build yet.

With USAA, a clean record costs about $36 a month, and an accident only bumps that up to $53, which is pretty manageable. But with Travelers, a DUI more than doubles your rate—from $58 to $122—adding over $750 a year. Expect big jumps if you’re looking for [car insurance after a DUI in Texas](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-after-dui-in-texas/).

Nationwide doesn’t charge more for one accident, but a DUI takes your rate from $89 to $162. Liberty Mutual hits the hardest after a DUI, raising your premium to $185 a month, nearly $1,000 more per year. These changes show how quickly rates can shift, especially if you’re relying on Texas state minimum car insurance to stay on the road affordably.

## Penalties for Not Meeting Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas

Driving without insurance in Texas might seem like no big deal at first, but the penalties add up fast, and they stick around. What starts as a fine can quickly turn into license problems, extra fees, and higher insurance bills for years.

## Penalties for Driving Without Auto Insurance in Texas

| Offense | Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| First Offense | $175–$350 fine and possible surcharge |
| Second Offense | $350–$1,000 fine and license suspension |
| SR-22 Requirement | Required for 2 years |
| Court Fees | Extra fees may apply |
| License Reinstatement | Reinstatement fee required |
| Vehicle Impoundment | Car may be towed until proof of insurance |

Compare Rates[Start Now →](#mdatop)

A first offense carries a $175 to $350 fine, and it is reported that this means your insurance premiums will likely increase. A second offense carries a fine of $1,000, and your license can be suspended until you show valid proof of coverage that meets Texas insurance requirements.

If your license is suspended and you continue driving, you could face even harsher [consequences for driving without a license](https://www.freeadvice.com/legal/consequences-of-driving-without-a-license/), including arrest or vehicle impoundment. After a violation, you must also carry SR-22 insurance for two years, costing $500 to $1,200 more per year.

Not reporting minor accidents might seem smart, but hiding a violation can hurt more if your insurer finds out later.

Brad Larson
**Licensed Insurance Agent**

There’s also a reinstatement fee to get your license back, and court fees could be added depending on your case. If you’re pulled over again without coverage, your car might be towed on the spot, and you’ll have to pay storage costs to get it back. These penalties make it harder to stay on the road and even harder to afford insurance after the fact.

## Auto Insurance Coverage Options in Texas

If you drive in Texas, knowing what your insurance covers matters. Liability insurance is the minimum, covering injuries or damage you cause. But it won’t cover your car. That’s what collision insurance is for. It helps pay for repairs if you crash into another vehicle, a pole, or a pothole.

## Types of Auto Insurance Coverage in Texas

| Coverage Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Liability | Covers injury or damage to others (required) |
| Collision | Pays for your car damage in a crash |
| Comprehensive | Covers theft fire weather or vandalism |
| Uninsured Motorist | Covers damage if the other driver has no insurance |
| Medical Payments (MedPay) | Pays medical bills for you and passengers |
| Personal Injury Protection | Covers medical costs and lost income |
| Rental Reimbursement | Pays for rental car while yours is repaired |
| Towing & Labor | Covers roadside help like towing or jump-start |

Comprehensive coverage handles damage that isn’t from a crash, like theft, hail, or vandalism, making it worth checking out the [best auto insurance companies for comprehensive coverage](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-companies-for-comprehensive-coverage/) if you want broader protection. Uninsured motorist coverage really comes in handy if someone hits you and they don’t have insurance, or don’t have enough to cover the damage.

![Medical Payments Coverage Definition Card: Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Medical Payments Coverage Definition Card: Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas")![Medical Payments Coverage Definition Card: Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas](https://www.freeadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Medical-Payments-Coverage-FA-2.png "Medical Payments Coverage Definition Card: Auto Insurance Requirements in Texas")

MedPay and personal injury protection help with medical bills no matter who caused the accident, and PIP even covers lost wages if you’re too injured to work. Want help if your car breaks down or gets towed? That’s where towing and rental coverage come in. These options aren’t just extra. They’re practical tools to help you deal with real-life road problems.

## How to Prove Financial Responsibility in Texas

It’s not enough in Texas to have car insurance—you also need to show you’re financially responsible. The state gives you three ways to do that, each with its own rules.

* **Insurance Card:** This is the easiest and most common option. Your insurance company issues it, and you must show it if you’re pulled over or in an accident. Forgetting it can lead to fines or even losing your license.
* **Surety Bond:** This means you pay a bond company to cover any damage you might cause. It usually costs more than regular insurance and requires a clean driving history.
* **Self-Insurance:** Usually for people or businesses with lots of vehicles. You must prove to the DMV that you have enough money to cover any accidents.

Whichever option you choose, it’s how you stay on the right side of Texas law. Your proof of responsibility shows you’re covered if something goes wrong. It also helps you avoid penalties that could hit your wallet or your driving record.

## Texas Auto Insurance Factors & How to Get Covered

Shopping for auto insurance in Texas isn’t just about picking the cheapest deal. It’s about knowing what affects your rate. Where you live can make a big difference. If you’re in Houston, you might pay around $91 a month thanks to higher accident and theft rates, while drivers in Killeen or Lubbock might see rates closer to $72.

Age plays a big part, too. An 18-year-old guy could pay over $330 monthly, but by the time you’re in your 40s, it might drop to under $75. And if you’ve had a ticket or accident? That could bump your rate up fast.

Getting covered is pretty easy once you’ve got a handle on what impacts your price. Start by checking out quotes from big-name companies like Geico, State Farm, or Progressive. To drive legally, you’ll need to meet Texas auto insurance minimums, which follow the 30/60/25 liability limits, but you can always build more coverage on top.

If you want peace of mind, consider collision, comprehensive, or [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-for-uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage/).

USAA and State Farm offer the cheapest monthly minimum coverage—around $36 and $52 per month, respectively—based on driver profile and location. According to recent [State Farm insurance reviews](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/state-farm-insurance/), the company consistently earns high marks for affordability, especially for drivers meeting Texas minimum liability requirements.

### How do you not have auto insurance in Texas?

If you don’t carry insurance, you must file a surety bond or self-insure, requiring state approval and significant financial backing.

While 30/60/25 is the legal minimum, many drivers carry higher limits, plus collision and comprehensive coverage to protect their vehicle and finances.

### Do all household members need to be on car insurance in Texas?

### What happens if the driver at fault in an accident has no insurance in Texas?

If the other driver doesn’t have insurance, you’ll probably have to lean on your uninsured motorist coverage to cover the costs. They could also get hit with fines, lose their license, and be required to file an SR-22.
