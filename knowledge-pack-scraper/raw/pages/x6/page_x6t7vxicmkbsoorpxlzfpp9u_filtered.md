State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save program delivers exactly what its name promises: the safer you drive, the more you can save. While some other insurers may raise rates for risky driving, Drive Safe and Save focuses only on rewarding good driving habits. So, even if your driving isn’t perfect, the worst outcome is simply missing out on a discount. Backed by innovative tech features and mostly positive user feedback, this State Farm Drive Safe and Save review shows why it may be a compelling choice among many telematics programs on the market.

## What is State Farm Drive Safe and Save?

For drivers with [State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/state-farm/) car insurance, the Drive Safe and Save program could be a good opportunity to save money on car insurance. Like [most telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/are-telematics-programs-worth-the-discount/), Drive Safe and Save is an optional program that allows State Farm to collect data about your driving and offer discounts for safe behaviors. State Farm reports that drivers can receive an initial discount just by signing up and save [up to 30 percent](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) by participating. To get started, drivers can download State Farm’s mobile app or use the Connected Car feature if you have a 2020 or newer Ford or Lincoln vehicle.

The Drive Safe and Save app was recently integrated directly into the State Farm app, but the old, standalone app got fairly good reviews, with a rating of4.5 out of 5.0 on the App Store and 4.1 out of 5.0 from Google Play. Most Drive Safe and Save reviews noted that the app is easy to use and helps them stay on top of their driving habits. However, on both platforms, users complained that the app sometimes incorrectly scored their driving, especially if they had to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Ostensibly, the functionality of the program within State Farm’s main app hasn’t changed much, but we’ll update you if we find otherwise.

Whether you use the app or the Connected Car option, State Farm will monitor your driving habits to determine how much you could save on your car insurance. You can even connect Amazon Alexa to the program to check the status and amount of the Drive Safe and Save discount. The program is optional, and drivers who aren’t able to earn a discount because of their driving habits will not be surcharged on their [car insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) after the program period.

## How does State Farm Drive Safe and Save work?

If you want to simply drive and save, State Farm may make it easy. The company designed a [car insurance telematics](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) program that tracks certain driving behaviors and rewards you with a discount based on how safely you drive. The Drive Safe and Save app was recently integrated directly into the State Farm app, so there is no need to download a separate app anymore.

Once you install the State Farm app on your phone, you’ll likely need to grant it the required permissions to use your phone for tracking and reporting driving patterns. This will require keeping both your Bluetooth and location settings active while driving.

### Connected Car

If you drive a 2020 or newer Ford or Lincoln, you could skip the app and use State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save Connected Car option to enroll in the program:

* Add your vehicle to the “Garage” in either the FordPass or Lincoln Way app (depending on the make of your car).
* Let your State Farm agent know you want to enroll in Drive Safe and Save.
* The next time you turn on your car, you should see an in-vehicle agreement pop up. Complete the form and you’ll be enrolled!

## What does Drive Safe and Save track?

State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save program, encompassing both telematics and [usage-based](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usage-based-insurance/) components, monitors various aspects of your driving behavior and the distance you travel. This data collection is facilitated either through the State Farm app or the Connected Car system. Here’s what the program specifically tracks:

* **Acceleration:** Rapid acceleration can reduce vehicle control, heightening the risk of accidents. The program assesses how often and how severely you accelerate.
* **Annual mileage:** The distance you drive annually is also monitored. Generally, less driving can lead to lower risk and potentially larger [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). Note that some states exclude mileage and odometer readings from the program.
* **Braking:** Harsh braking might indicate risky driving practices. Gradual and controlled braking, achieved by maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles, is preferred.
* **Cornering:** The program evaluates instances of making quick or sharp turns, which can be signs of unsafe driving. Smooth and controlled cornering is indicative of safer driving habits.
* **Speed:** Adhering to speed limits is crucial for road safety. Speeding increases both the likelihood and severity of accidents. The Drive Safe and Save program tracks your speed to encourage compliance with speed limits. Specifically, the app shows you when you’ve gone over the speed limit by 8 mph or more.
* **Phone use:** Using a mobile phone while driving is a significant hazard. The program detects phone usage during driving, which can negatively impact the discount you receive.

State Farm uses the data from these tracking points to evaluate your driving patterns. Safe driving behaviors, such as avoiding harsh braking and obeying speed limits, might help lead to substantial discounts on your auto insurance through the Drive Safe and Save program.

## How do you save with State Farm Drive Safe and Save?

With State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save program, [savings on your auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) are calculated at the time of your policy renewal. The program reviews your driving data, focusing on key factors such as acceleration and braking habits. Depending on how safely you’ve driven according to these metrics, State Farm may apply a discount to your policy, which can reach up to 30 percent.

### How long do I have to use State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save?

It’s up to you how long you want to participate in the program. However, you must currently be participating in Drive Safe and Save in order to keep the discount. As soon as you disenroll, you’ll lose your discount.

## Is the Drive Safe and Save program right for me?

Determining whether State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save program aligns with your driving habits and preferences is essential for making an informed decision. By adhering to safe driving patterns, you may reap the benefits of program discounts reflected in your premium.

Furthermore, the Drive Safe and Save program could be an attractive option for those aiming to improve their driving habits. One of the key advantages is that participating in the program carries no risk of premium increases. It focuses on promoting safer driving practices rather than penalizing mistakes, as it does not track incidents like [tickets or traffic stops](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/). This aspect makes it a supportive tool for drivers seeking to enhance their on-road behaviors without the concern of potential [car insurance rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) hikes.

However, it’s important to consider certain aspects that might affect how well the program fits your individual needs and circumstances:

* **State availability:** Drive Safe and Save is not available in every state. States like [California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/), Massachusetts and Rhode Island, along with certain circumstances in North Carolina, are excluded from the program​​.
* **Distance traveled:** The program requires participants to provide odometer readings, and high annual mileage could limit the maximum discount achievable. This might be a significant consideration for those with long commutes or frequent long-distance travel​​.

Given these considerations, along with the State Farm Drive Safe and Save reviews, the program may be most beneficial for drivers who consistently exhibit safe driving behaviors, have moderate to low annual mileage and reside in states where the program is available.

## **What are people saying about State Farm Drive Safe and Save?**

According to the [2024 J.D. Power Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), State Farm received an average rating for its usage-based insurance. This aligns with our findings on Reddit and Google Play, which revealed a mix of positive and negative first-hand experiences with the Drive Safe and Save program. Some users praise the savings potential, while others raise concerns that State Farm Drive Safe and Save cheats them out of discounts by inaccurately tracking contextual driving behaviors.

#### Reddit user review

Data vs. discount

As a customer who has one, the biggest downside is the fact that you are tracked on everywhere you go with everything you do. I find it more of a pain because now it’s pointing out all of my flaws in my driving. It keeps a record of how hard you brake, how fast you accelerate, if you are speeding, if you corner too hard through a turn, and how many times you look at your phone while driving.

Is it worth the discount? Yes, I would say so but I’m not liking how State Farm could use this data that they are collecting against me in my future premium renewals.

Positive savings example

My first few weeks, my score was 95%. Thereafter I average about 98% for the last 4 months. I drive 7000 miles or less so I get low mileage discount which is factor into the Drive safe & save savings. The app measures your miles also to make sure you’re driving less than 7000 miles. ( I think I drove about 4500 miles)

Premium: $685.60

Drive Safe + Low mileage discount: $273.45 (40% discount!)

Total Premium after discount: $412.15

I hope this help future Redditor who is debating whether or not to participate in the Drive Safe program. Let me know if you have any questions, I’ll be glad to answer them.

#### Google Play user review

App misses driving context

It’d be nice if there were a way to describe events, such as braking hard for a deer running out in front of you on a dark road… Maybe there could be options- obstruction in road, car coming into lane, etc. It’d also be nice if I didn’t have to have my Power Saver mode for battery off for ONE app that is already on the unrestricted list!! It records some trips but not others, so I guess it’s just going to work that way for me.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### How do telematics work?

  Caret Down Icon

  Telematics uses a combination of GPS technology and in-app diagnostics to determine your location, traveling speed and how the driver is conducting themselves on the road. These factors may provide an auto insurer like State Farm with clear data to determine driving habits and assess risk.
* ### Can your rates go up with Drive Safe and Save?

  Caret Down Icon

  Your rate will only increase if your vehicle already has a low-mileage discount (under 7,500 miles a year) and you exceed that. In this case, you could lose the discount. If you don’t earn a discount with the program, you’ll also likely lose your participation discount.
* ### Are all cars in a household required to participate?

  Caret Down Icon

  Not all cars are required to participate. If you have multiple vehicles in your family, each car must be enrolled as a separate participant. Keep in mind that this program is policy and vehicle-specific and not driver-based. That means if several drivers in your home share a vehicle and you want to enroll it in the Drive Safe and Save telematics program, all drivers must download the State Farm app and participate.
* ### Can I turn off State Farm Drive Safe and Save?

  Caret Down Icon

  If you are wondering how to turn off the State Farm Drive Safe and Save program, your best bet is likely to call your agent. You could also choose to leave your phone’s Bluetooth and location services off when you drive, which means the app won’t be able to record a trip. You could also uninstall your State Farm app. However, there could be consequences to these actions, since you’ll still be officially enrolled. Additionally, since the app was integrated into State Farm’s app, deleting it would mean you also could not use the rest of the app’s functionality. If you want to end the program, you will likely want to contact your agent.
* ### What is a good Drive Safe and Save score?

  Caret Down Icon

  State Farm does not define a specific “good score” for its Drive Safe and Save program. The program displays a safety score ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent with 100 percent being the ideal. Factors influencing this safety score include braking, speed, mileage and phone usage, all of which are monitored to evaluate driving safety. You can view your safety score directly in your State Farm app​.
