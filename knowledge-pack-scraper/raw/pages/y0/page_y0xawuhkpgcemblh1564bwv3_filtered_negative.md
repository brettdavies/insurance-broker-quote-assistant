For new teen drivers just hitting the road, the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/how-to-shop/best-cheap-auto-insurance/) are USAA ($320 per month) and State Farm ($394 per month). For new adult drivers, the cheapest insurers are also USAA ($124 per month) and State Farm ($131 per month). In comparison, the typical teen driver might see insurance bills around $420 each month, while adults without any prior insurance history generally face rates near $161 per month.
Dive into the tables below for average rates from other companies and read on to learn more about [how to pick the best insurance company as a newbie behind the wheel](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-new-drivers/#how-to-pick-the-best-company-for-you). But remember, the "best deal" can be pretty subjective, heavily depending on your unique situation — what's cheapest on paper might not be the most cost-effective for you in reality.

To generate estimated auto insurance prices for new drivers, The Zebra's research team used two driver profiles ([methodology details](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/)). One driver is a teenager and another is a 30-year-old driver, both with full coverage and previously uninsured. The variation in the cheapest insurer for teens versus adults is due to each company's unique risk assessment model, which can lead to different pricing structures for each age group.

To find the best cheap car insurance for new drivers, The Zebra recommends you start by [comparing quotes from multiple insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/). It's also wise to ask about discounts, consider a policy with higher deductibles or lower coverage limits, and opt for a less expensive vehicle to insure.
While price is important, new drivers and their parents must consider all aspects of their insurance options. Start below with our insurance comparison checklist designed for new drivers. Already well-versed in insurance shopping? [Jump straight to our summary of the top three insurers for new drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-new-drivers/#best-companies).
✓ Accident forgiveness
✓ A good mobile app
###  Car insurance company checklist for new drivers
The Zebra's detailed insurer reviews will list data from reputable sources including A.M. Best, the NAIC, J.D. Power, [The Zebra's Customer Satisfaction survey](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/), and sites like Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot. You want an insurer that is responsive, pays out claims, and is easy to get ahold of.
Some companies offer several [coverage options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/), others may provide only one or two basic options. Still others, like Lemonade, let drivers select and pay only for the coverage they deem necessary, sometimes leading to lower rates because drivers aren't bundled into one-size-fits-all plans.**Roughly 38% of The Zebra's customers go for "basic" coverage, which is a full coverage policy with elevated liability limits, typically 50/100/50.**
##### ✓ **Accident forgiveness**
This prevents a driver's insurance rate from going up after their first at-fault accident. Especially helpful considering the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813313#:~:text=For%20young%20male%20drivers%2015,21.54%20per%20100%2C000%20licensed%20drivers.) reports accident rates are significantly higher among younger, newer drivers.
This can provide new drivers with immediate support during unforeseen breakdowns or incidents, fostering confidence on the road. [See our comparison of roadside assistance programs here.](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/)
While mostly geared towards younger drivers, many new drivers can benefit from discounts such as those related to making good grades or being a good driver. We especially like driver safety program discounts as they not only lower rates but help new drivers feel more confident and drive safer. [Read more about discounts available to new drivers here](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-new-drivers/#discounts).

Stay on their parents' auto insurance Chevron down icon
Most of the time, the young driver's parents' insurance background, credit score and driving history may lead to lower rates than the new driver would find on their own. By staying on a parent's auto insurance policy as long as possible, a young driver can save thousands of dollars per year. [College students can usually stay on their parents' policy](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-students/#car-insurance-for-college-students) as well, provided they don't drive their own car while living away from home.
Shop around Chevron down icon
Choose a moderately priced vehicle Chevron down icon
In general, new drivers looking to save money should start by driving an older vehicle. This is because picking a new or luxury vehicle — like a [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/mercedes-benz/) — combines the risks of inexperience with the high repair and replacement costs of premium cars, leading to higher rates. Another thing to keep in mind is while safety features can often reduce rates, highly specialized equipment and high-tech sensors can actually increase rates.

Bundling policies under one insurer, such as [home and auto](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/), can earn you a discount. Homeowners will save an average of $66 more than bundling with renters, as homeowners insurance yields higher revenue for insurers than renters insurance.
A [multi-car discount](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/cheap-car-insurance-multiple-vehicles/) refers to insuring multiple vehicles with the same company. If you start with two cars, it's added from the beginning; otherwise, it's applied to your policy when a second car joins the policy
By showing proof of completion of a defensive driving course to your insurer, you can earn a discount. Such courses enhance safety, reducing insurance risks and costs. We've partnered with iDriveSafely as an affordable option. Available in most states, their courses can help you maintain a good driving record and save money on car insurance. [Learn more about iDriveSafely's defensive driving classes](https://www.idrivesafely.com/?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=ins&utm_campaign=i-5714610213-drvhpp&ajs_event=Partner%20Link%20Clicked&ajs_prop_subId=cheap-car-insurance-new-drivers).
This is available to those with a [clean driving](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/best-car-insurance-good-drivers/) record — meaning no at-fault accidents or citations. It is typically added when your Motor Vehicle Report (MVR) is pulled at the inception of your policy.
Some insurers offer discounts to professions with statistically fewer claims (e.g. [teachers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/car-insurance-teachers/), [physicians](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/best-auto-insurance-doctors/), [police officers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/car-insurance-police-officers/)). Insurers often require a photocopy of your degree for eligibility.
If you're under 25 with a B average (3.0 GPA) or higher, inquire about a [good student discount](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/student-discount/) with your insurance company. They usually ask for proof in the form of a transcript every 6-12 months.

**Tip:****don't wait until your teen is fully licensed and driving before adding them to your insurance coverage.** Some insurance companies may even allow teens with a learner's permit to be included on the policy at no extra charge while they only have a permit (although state laws and insurer guidelines may vary). If you are uncertain, you can always speak with an agent before your teen is licensed to find out more about when to add a new teen driver to your policy.
[Permissive use](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/what-is-permissive-use-car-insurance/) covers occasional drivers who aren't listed on the policy but have the policyholder's permission to drive the vehicle. For example, when a friend borrows your car once to move. However, coverage details can vary among insurers. Always inquire to clarify your insurance company's specific guidelines on what they consider "regular" vs "permissive" use. All regular drivers must be added to your policy.
