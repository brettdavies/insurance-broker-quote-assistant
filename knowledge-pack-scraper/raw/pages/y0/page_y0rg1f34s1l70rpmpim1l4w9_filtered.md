## How to Apply

People may discover after they suffer a loss that they have not purchased enough insurance or the right kind of insurance coverage. It is your responsibility to purchase enough insurance and the right kinds of insurance coverage to protect you in case of an insured loss – and a licensed broker can help.

01

### Find a Broker

FAIR Plan customer service representatives legally cannot provide you advice on your coverages or limits – a licensed broker can. Insurance agents and brokers may have access to property insurers other than the FAIR Plan. If they cannot find you insurance through another insurance company, they can assist you in applying for a policy through the FAIR Plan. Additionally, you may wish to contact more than one broker to see whether they can offer you coverage through other insurers. There is no additional cost for having an insurance broker. Not all brokers are registered to work with the FAIR Plan. Find a broker [here](https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=400:50).

#### A broker may be able to:

* Find available coverage with a traditional insurance company
* Determine your property insurance coverage needs
* Estimate the fair market value of your home
* Handle changes to your policy
* Answer your questions

02

### Determine Your Eligibility

Your broker will perform a diligent search for comprehensive coverage in the traditional insurance market. If coverage is not available with another company, your broker can help you determine if the FAIR Plan is available as a temporary solution. If coverage is available in the traditional marketplace, the FAIR Plan is not right for you.

### Find the Right Coverage

The FAIR Plan’s policies are tailored to provide coverage for basic fire insurance. Work with a broker to learn if a FAIR Plan policy, along with optional supplemental coverage, fits your needs.

The FAIR Plan does not estimate the fair market value of your home or building, the cost to rebuild it, its value or the cost of labor and materials. It’s up to you to determine that with the assistance of your broker.
