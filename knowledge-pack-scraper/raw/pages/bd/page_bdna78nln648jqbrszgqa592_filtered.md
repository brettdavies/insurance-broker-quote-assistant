Very Happy with a Little Trouble Understanding Age-Based Rates

Reviewed in Pennsylvania on October 2025

I was told that my insurance goes up due to my age. Isn't that discrimination? They said that my reflexes aren't as good. I have been driving for 64 years with no accidents. I am a safe driver and am on the road daily. I feel this is unfair. No other issues.

Why we picked this company

Safeco, a Liberty Mutual company, has been in business for nearly 100 years. Safeco stands out for some of its optional offerings. If your new car is less than a year old with under 150,000 miles, Safeco’s new vehicle replacement coverage pays the value of a comparable new car if yours is stolen or totaled. Safeco also offers cash back for policyholders who remain claims-free over a six-month review period, as well as a diminishing deductible for being claims-free. The company also scored above average for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.

Pros 

* Pays cash back to customers who remain claims-free
* Many options for customizing car insurance
* Accident forgiveness available

Cons

* May not be the cheapest option for drivers with infractions on their records
* Customer reviews indicate room for improvement in customer service
* Higher-than-average number of complaints with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners

## State Farm

State Farm has the largest market share for auto insurance in the United States, providing coverage to more than 9% of drivers. The company is well known for its customer service and low rates.

## Safeco RightTrack vs. State Farm Drive Safe & Save

State Farm’s safe driving program also offers a discount of up to 30%. Drivers can earn discounts by using a mobile app on their smartphone to track their driving habits or by connecting eligible 2020 or newer model vehicles. However, the discount may disappear entirely if the app can’t collect enough driving data. Additionally, the discount may change every six months based on travel habits.

## Safeco vs. State Farm: Which is the cheapest?

Overall, State Farm Insurance rates are typically a few dollars lower than Safeco. However, numerous factors could affect the cost of your policy, including your age, driving history, ZIP code, and credit score.

In the sections that follow, you’ll see how rates from State Farm and Safeco compare based on several different factors.

### State Farm: Cheapest for drivers with a clean driving record

| --- | --- | --- |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### State Farm: Cheapest for drivers with a speeding ticket

Drivers with a speeding ticket on their record should plan to pay slightly higher rates no matter which insurance company they choose to work with. Safeco drivers typically pay a little more per month than drivers who opt for State Farm coverage.

| **Driver Type** | **Safeco** | **State Farm** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drivers with a speeding ticket | $121 | $70 |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### State Farm: Cheapest for teen drivers

The table below shows the national average teens can expect to pay for liability coverage from each insurer.

| **Driver Type** | **Safeco** | **State Farm** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 18-year-old | $192 | $56 |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### State Farm: Cheapest for senior drivers

Once you reach age 70 and older, you can expect your insurance rates to climb. This is due to the reduced faculties and increased likelihood of high medical expenses after an accident common for senior drivers. Fortunately, you can still save money by opting for State Farm coverage.

| **Driver Type** | **Safeco** | **State Farm** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Senior drivers | $78 | $40 |

## Compare coverages: Safeco vs. State Farm

When shopping for car insurance, you’ll want to consider the type of coverage options you have. Safeco and State Farm offer essential insurance products like [**bodily injury liability**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage liability, [**personal injury protection**](/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/), collision, comprehensive, and uninsured/underinsured motorist policies.

The most significant difference between Safeco and State Farm is that Safeco offers [**gap insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/), but State Farm doesn’t. Drivers insured with State Farm must purchase gap coverage from another company. While this may not seem like a big issue, having gap coverage through another company can create extra steps for resolving payouts following an accident.

The chart below provides a brief look at the general offerings of each insurer.

| **Coverage**  sort ascsort desc | **Safeco**  sort ascsort desc | **State Farm**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Safeco Insurance has high customer service ratings and a solid IQ Score. Policies cost slightly more than the national average, but the company offers plenty of discounts and the freedom to work with independent agents in your community.

No. State Farm regularly has some of the lowest premiums available. While drivers with a shaky driving record or bad credit score may pay slightly higher premiums, State Farm rates are generally very affordable.

Yes. State Farm has a solid reputation for paying claims. Most customers report being satisfied with the claims process. State Farm has a higher-than-average J.D. Power rating of 891 out of 1000.[[2]](#cite-2)

Middle-aged drivers with a clean driving record, solid credit scores, and newer vehicles with extra safety features will secure the best rates, not only from State Farm but from most insurers. If you fall outside these parameters, you can take advantage of discounts to lower your monthly premiums.
