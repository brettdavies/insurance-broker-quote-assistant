Unlike hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other natural disasters, earthquakes don't have an annual season that homeowners can prepare for. But they do hit certain parts of the country more than others.

Your [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) typically won't cover earthquakes or landslides. To protect your home and your belongings, you'll need earthquake insurance — either a standalone policy or a rider to your existing home policy.

Here's what earthquake insurance covers, how much it costs and how you can buy a solid policy.

### Does homeowners insurance cover earthquakes?

No, standard homeowners or [condo insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-condo-insurance/) will cover common perils like fire and wind, but it doesn't cover damage from earthquakes. Some policies might cover fire or other secondary damage resulting from an earthquake. To be fully protected, however, you'll need to a separate earthquake insurance policy or an rider that adds earthquake coverage to your existing policy.

This is particularly important in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada and Washington, the states where earthquakes are most common. In California, insurance companies are required to offer earthquake insurance to homeowners. The [California Earthquake Authority (CEA)](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/) is a nonprofit organization that works to provide affordable coverage to residents, though rates are still quite high.

## What does earthquake insurance cover?

Earthquake insurance can cover damage to the physical structure of your home and other non-attached structures caused by tremors or aftershocks. It can also reimburse you for damages to your belongings and pay for living expenses if you need to relocate while your home is being repaired.

An earthquake policy also pays to clear debris, stabilize the land under your home, address emergency repairs and bring your home up to code.

However, earthquake insurance typically does not cover:

* Damage to your land, such as landscaping
* Damage to vehicles, fences or pools
* Flooding, tsunamis, or secondary disasters like fires or landslides caused by earthquakes

## How much is earthquake insurance?

According to [Policygenius](https://www.policygenius.com/homeowners-insurance/is-earthquake-insurance-worth-it/), $100,000 of earthquake insurance in California, the second most earthquake-prone state after Alaska, costs between $500 and $1,000 a year.

With the statewide median home price [at just over $900,000](https://www.car.org/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2024-News-Releases/april2024sales), that means a policy could easily run you $4,500 to $9,000 a year.

Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington state are the third, fourth and fifth most earthquake-prone states, respectively, and residents also pay a premium for protection.

In other areas, it can be much more affordable: A policy in Texas averages between $500 and $800 a year, according to [LendingTree](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/earthquake-insurance/). On the East Coast, you could pay less than $300 per year.

## How to buy earthquake insurance

Earthquake insurance can be purchased in one of two ways: as a standalone policy or as a rider to your existing homeowners insurance.

Start shopping with your homeowners insurance provider. In California, state law requires homeowners insurance companies to offer earthquake insurance. Often, it's in conjunction with the California Earthquake Authority.

[Amica](https://secure.money.com/pr/k68eead71bf2), one of our [top homeowners insurance providers](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/), offers earthquake insurance as an add-on to your home coverage. Additional options include replacement cost coverage and enhanced electronics coverage that can pay for accidental damage.

* [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/hd1ed44723a0)

To get a quote, you'll need to provide some information about your home, including its age, location and construction materials.

You'll also have to choose an amount of dwelling coverage that would cover rebuilding your home. If you're getting your homeowners insurance and earthquake insurance from the same company, your dwelling limits are typically the same across both policies.   
  
Both renters and owners will need to choose a coverage limit for belongings and agree to a deductible. Unlike homeowners insurance, which typically has a flat, dollar-amount deductible, the deductible for earthquake insurance is typically 10% to 25% of your homeowners or renters policy's dwelling coverage.

While your homeowners insurance company is a good place to start when shopping for earthquake insurance, you should get quotes from several other providers to get the best rate.

## Earthquake insurance FAQs

### Is earthquake insurance worth it?

Earthquake insurance can be expensive and you may never need to use it. But it's still cheaper than paying for repairs and replacements out of pocket.

### Does renters insurance cover earthquakes?

No, standard [renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-renters-insurance/) does not cover earthquake damage. While your landlord will be responsible for damages to the structure of the building, you'll need separate earthquake insurance or an add-on to your renters policy to get reimbursed for damage to your possessions and to cover living expenses if you're temporarily forced to relocate.

### Which insurance companies offer earthquake insurance?

Many top homeowners insurance companies also offer earthquake coverage, including [Allstate](https://secure.money.com/pr/l6c7f2d6a72c), [Amica](https://secure.money.com/pr/k68eead71bf2), [AAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/w1235ad7f962), [Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/w111bf99698d), [Foremost](https://secure.money.com/pr/jd2a65c3ff63), [Liberty Mutual](https://secure.money.com/pr/y80b05fe2b33), [Mercury](https://secure.money.com/pr/u377b4cf3b9a), [Nationwide](https://secure.money.com/pr/t1970a747e53), [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/g2ecdbd1039f), [State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/select/best-homeinsurance-options-cnbc/?mf_ct_campaign=cnbc-homeins-statefarm-spl-lp&product-name=State+Farm+Home+Insurance&sub-id=PLACESUBIDHERE) and [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/hd1ed44723a0).
