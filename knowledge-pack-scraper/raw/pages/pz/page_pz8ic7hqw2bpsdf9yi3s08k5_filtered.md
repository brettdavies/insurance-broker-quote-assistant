## Can Foreigners Get Car Insurance in the U.S.?

Yes, foreigners can get car insurance in the United States, but the process differs from what U.S. citizens experience. Anyone driving in the U.S. must have car insurance, except in New Hampshire and Virginia where it's optional (though still recommended).

Key Points for International Drivers:

* **Long-term residents**: Need to purchase a policy from a US insurance company
* **Short-term visitors**: Can often get coverage through rental car companies
* **Student visa holders**: Eligible for regular policies with potential student discounts
* **Work visa holders**: Can get standard coverage with proper documentation

The main challenge isn't eligibility—it's finding insurers that work with foreign licenses and understand international drivers' needs.

## How to Get Car Insurance for Non-U.S. Citizens

Foreign drivers can get car insurance in the U.S., even without a local license, but it requires more documentation than standard applications. Here's what you need to know.

1. 1

   Gather the Right Documents

   Most car insurance companies require a valid driver's license from your home country, an International Driving Permit (IDP) depending on the state, identification such as a passport or visa and vehicle registration if you already own or lease a car.
2. 2

   Look for Insurers That Accept Foreign Licenses

   Not all insurance providers offer coverage if you don't have a U.S. license. Some specialize in working with international drivers or may allow coverage based on your foreign driving history. State Farm, Progressive and Farmers are the best options.
3. 3

   Understand State Coverage Requirements

   Every [state has minimum coverage rules](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/) for all drivers except New Hampshire and Virginia, regardless of license type. Your policy must meet these legal requirements, including bodily injury liability and property damage liability.

   **Special State Considerations**:  
   **New Hampshire & Virginia**: No mandatory insurance, but you're financially responsible for accidents  
   **Michigan**: Unique no-fault system with unlimited PIP benefits  
   **Florida**: No-fault state requiring PIP coverage  
   **California**: Prohibits using credit scores for rate calculation (benefit for international drivers)
4. 4

   Choose the Right Coverage Level

   While minimum coverage gets you on the road legally, it may not protect you financially after an accident. Temporary visitors might opt for higher liability limits instead of comprehensive coverage, while those with assets back home should consider lawsuit protection. Gap insurance is essential if you owe more on your car loan than the vehicle's worth.

   **Choose Enhanced Liability If**:

   * You want better protection but need to control costs
   * You're driving a moderately valuable car
   * You have some assets to protect
   * Average cost: $85-115/month for international drivers

   **Choose Full Coverage If**:

   * You're financing or leasing a vehicle (required by lender)
   * You're driving a newer or high-value car
   * You want comprehensive financial protection
   * You can afford higher premiums for peace of mind
5. 5

   Build a U.S. Driving Record Over Time

   Getting insured with a foreign license is possible, but it can be more expensive. Over time, switching to a U.S. driver's license and maintaining a clean driving history can help lower your premiums and make it [easier to compare quotes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/).

## Car Insurance for International Students in the U.S.

International students encounter unique challenges when getting car insurance in the United States, whether they’re on an F-1, J-1 or another type of student visa.

You'll need your valid passport and current student visa, along with your I-20 (F-1 visa) or DS-2019 (J-1 visa) forms.

Your international driver's license or home country license works for most insurers, though some states require an International Driving Permit. You'll also need school enrollment verification and U.S. address documentation, whether it's a dorm assignment or off-campus lease.

### Student Driver Discounts for International Students

International students often qualify for major [insurance discounts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-discounts/) that can help balance the higher premiums foreign drivers usually pay. Good student discounts offer up to 25% off for maintaining a 3.0+ GPA. Defensive driving course completion provides additional 5 to 15% discounts, and [bundling](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/) with renters insurance creates even more savings opportunities.

## Temporary Car Insurance For Foreign Drivers

If you're only visiting the United States for a short time, you can buy insurance from your car rental company. Rental companies offer three main components: [liability insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage/), a collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance.

Coverage limits for each component may vary depending on the rental company and your personal preference. Insurance coverage from a rental company may cost up to $50 per day, depending on how much coverage you purchase.

Most visitors from Canada who are driving their own car are covered by their own insurance company. However, drivers from Mexico need to purchase additional coverage.

## Car Insurance for Foreigners Staying Long-Term

Foreign drivers staying long-term in the U.S. can find the most affordable auto insurance in Virginia and Idaho.

The cheapest and [best car insurance companies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies/) nationally may not be the same as the best companies in your state. Insurance is regulated at the state level, and insurance companies may offer different service levels across state lines. Rates from the same insurance company can vary from state to state.

For example, Progressive offers the cheapest car insurance in California. But that doesn't mean Progressive is the most inexpensive in every state. The [cheapest car insurance](https:/www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) also varies depending on your driver profile, which is influenced by your age, gender and driving history. Before purchasing an insurance policy, compare rates from multiple providers to get the best deal.

## Average Cost of Car Insurance for Foreign Drivers in the USA

State Farm offers the most affordable car insurance for international drivers at $93 per month for a full coverage policy.

The company explicitly [offers insurance policies to drivers with international licenses](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/auto-insurance-foreign-drivers), while Progressive and Farmers both allow applicants to provide information from international driver's licenses during the application process, indicating openness to offering coverage to drivers with a license from abroad.

| [Farmers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/reviews/farmers/) | $1,459 | Yes |

### International Car Insurance: FAQ

Navigating car insurance as a foreign driver in the U.S. can be challenging, but it's essential for legal and financial protection. These frequently asked questions address coverage options, eligibility and tips for securing affordable insurance.

### How much does temporary car insurance cost for foreign drivers?

Temporary car insurance for foreign drivers ranges from $15-50 per day through rental companies, or $100-200 per month for standalone temporary policies. Short-term visitors often find rental car insurance most convenient, while longer stays benefit from monthly policies with major insurers.

### Why don’t most companies offer insurance to foreign drivers?

Many insurance companies avoid international drivers because they can't access U.S. credit history or driving records, making risk assessment difficult. However, State Farm, Progressive, Farmers and several other major insurers have developed systems to work with foreign licenses and alternative documentation.

### Can international students get car insurance in the USA?

Yes, international students can get car insurance using their foreign driver's license, passport, I-20/DS-2019 forms, and International Driving Permit. State Farm, Progressive, and Farmers all offer student-friendly policies with potential discounts for good grades and defensive driving courses.

### What's the cheapest car insurance for international drivers?

State Farm offers the most affordable rates for international drivers at $93/month on average for full coverage. However, rates vary by state. Virginia offers the cheapest coverage at $38/month while Michigan is most expensive at $246/month. Progressive and Farmers are also competitive options.

### Do I need special insurance as a non-US citizen?

Non-U.S. citizens need the same minimum coverage as U.S. citizens but may pay 15-40% higher rates initially due to lack of U.S. driving history and credit. You'll need a foreign driver's license, passport, visa documentation and International Driving Permit. Rates decrease after 6-12 months of clean driving.

### Can I use my home country's car insurance in the USA?

Most international insurance policies don't provide coverage in the USA. Canadian drivers may have limited coverage for short visits, but Mexican and other international drivers need to purchase U.S.-based insurance. Check with your home country insurer, but plan to buy U.S. coverage.

### What's the best way to get coverage if I'm staying short-term?

For stays under 30 days, rental car insurance is usually most convenient at $15-50/day. For one to six months, consider [monthly policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/month-to-month-car-insurance/) from Progressive or State Farm. For longer stays, annual policies often provide better value even if you don't stay the full year.

### Car Insurance For International Drivers: Our Review Methodology

**Study Overview**

For foreign drivers, one common challenge is finding U.S. insurers that accept international licenses while providing competitive rates. We designed this study to identify which companies actually work with international drivers and what coverage costs across different states and visa situations.

**Data Sources and Depth**

We gathered 83,056 quotes from 46 insurance companies across 473 ZIP codes to find the most affordable options for drivers with foreign licenses. Our data comes from Quadrant Information Services and state departments of insurance, focusing on companies that explicitly accept international documentation.

**Driver Profile**

Our research used a 40-year-old driver with a clean record, driving a Toyota Camry LE approximately 12,000 miles annually.

We selected this profile because it represents a common scenario for international workers and long-term visa holders in the U.S. Since foreign drivers can't leverage U.S. credit history or driving records initially, this baseline helps isolate how companies price policies for international applicants.

We calculated rates across all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., adjusting for each location's minimum coverage requirements and typical international driver circumstances.

**Coverage Levels and Deductibles Explained**

Before your insurance provider reimburses your claim, you need to pay your deductible out of pocket. On average, comprehensive and collision coverage, commonly referred to as “full coverage” insurance, has the most extensive financial protection.

When it comes to auto insurance, 100/300/100 refers to:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $100,000 property damage liability

Meanwhile, 50/100/50 stands for:

* $50,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability

Minimum coverage meets each state's legal requirements, including mandatory liability limits and any required coverages like personal injury protection or uninsured motorist coverage. These rates reflect the minimum cost to drive legally, but most financial advisors suggest higher limits for international drivers who might deal with language barriers or legal issues following an accident.

Your deductible is what you pay out-of-pocket before insurance covers the rest after a claim. Comprehensive coverage protects against theft, vandalism and weather damage, while collision coverage pays for accident repairs regardless of fault.
