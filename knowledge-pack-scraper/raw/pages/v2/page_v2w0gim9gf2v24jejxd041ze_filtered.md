### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Car insurance prices have almost doubled since COVID-19-related supply chain interruptions made repairs more expensive, and President Donald Trump's tariffs are expected to worsen affordability.
* As a result, more than a third of American drivers opted for a higher deductible, and another third lowered their coverage.
* Most drivers who cut down their coverage said they have less protection than they need, and drivers who increased their deductible said they couldn't afford it if something happened.

Drivers are cutting back on car insurance coverage as they brace for tariffs to drive up premiums.

Car insurance prices have increased by almost 67% over the past five years, according to the latest CPI data, as COVID-19-related supply chain interruptions made car repairs more expensive.12 Three-quarters of American drivers surveyed in April by car insurance comparison app Jerry, said policies are unaffordable. Additionally, 85% of these drivers said they cut spending on groceries and other non-essentials to afford its rising costs.3

President Donald Trump's tariffs on [steel and aluminum](https://www.investopedia.com/steel-tariffs-double-on-wednesday-here-s-why-that-matters-11747144), and a [25% tariff on imported cars](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-to-lessen-tariffs-on-automakers-11724313), are expected to [further increase the cost of car repairs and rentals](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-s-tariffs-could-make-your-car-insurance-even-more-expensive-11713931). The annual cost of insurance will climb an average of $92 due to tariffs, according to Insurify, a price comparison company.4

More than a third of drivers say they chose a higher [deductible](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-a-deductible-in-car-insurance-7486896) to lower monthly payments, while another third said they reduced their [coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/types-of-car-insurance-11680793) to make it more affordable. Those percentages are both up compared to previous surveys by Jerry.5

However, many drivers who opted for cheaper plans no longer have the protection they need.

In Jerry's April survey, over a third of drivers who opted for a higher deductible said they couldn't afford it if they needed a repair or got into an accident today. Additionally, three-fourths of drivers who bought less coverage said they now don't have the protection they think they need.
