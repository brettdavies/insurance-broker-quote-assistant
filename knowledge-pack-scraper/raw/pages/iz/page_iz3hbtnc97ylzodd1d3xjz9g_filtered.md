# Just got denied renter's insurance by Geico--anyone else?

[Living](/r/AskLosAngeles/?f=flair_name%3A%22Living%22)

Given everything that's happened, I realized how crazy I've been to not have renter's insurance. It's so cheap, and will give me a lot of piece of mind, not so much because I think my area is going to be affected by the fires (I live on Wilshire and La Brea, nowhere near any parks or brush) but because anything crazy could happen at any time and I'd like to have money to replace my stuff. I have auto insurance through GEICO, so I called them, and after being on hold for quite a while, the agent told me there is a restriction in my area and she couldn't offer me a policy at this time. I got a little angry, and all she did was repeat "I can't off you a policy at this time."

Is this even legal?? Has anyone else tried to get renter's insurance recently? What a shitty, greedy company. I want to file a complaint but don't know who I should call.
