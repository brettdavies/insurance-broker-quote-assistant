# Hurricane Deductible

*Definition:*

A hurricane deductible is the amount a homeowner must pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies to damage caused by a hurricane. It typically applies only when the National Weather Service officially declares a hurricane. The deductible is usually calculated as a percentage of the home’s insured value rather than a fixed dollar amount. This type of deductible is common in hurricane-prone states like Florida, where it helps insurers manage high-risk storm losses.

## Hurricane Deductible Information

Hurricane deductibles are designed to balance risk between homeowners and insurers in areas frequently affected by major storms. Unlike standard homeowners insurance deductibles, which are often a set dollar figure, hurricane deductibles generally range from 1% to 5% of the insured property value. For example, a homeowner with $300,000 in coverage and a 2% hurricane deductible would pay $6,000 before insurance coverage begins. The deductible applies only to damage directly caused by hurricanes, not by other storms or flooding. Understanding this deductible is essential for homeowners in coastal and high-risk areas to prepare financially for storm-related losses.

## Florida Legal Definition

Under Florida Statute §627.4025, a hurricane deductible applies to windstorm losses resulting from a hurricane declared by the National Hurricane Center. The deductible period begins when a hurricane watch or warning is issued and ends 72 hours after it is lifted. Florida law requires insurers to clearly disclose hurricane deductible amounts in homeowners insurance policies. Insurers may offer deductible options ranging from $500 to 10% of the dwelling’s insured value, but the chosen amount must be agreed upon by the policyholder. Only one hurricane deductible applies per calendar year, even if multiple storms occur.

### How It’s Used in Practice

In practice, homeowners and insurance professionals in Florida carefully review policy details to understand when and how the hurricane deductible applies. Mortgage lenders often verify that borrowers have appropriate insurance with a compliant deductible. After a hurricane, insurance adjusters assess the damage to determine if it exceeds the deductible threshold. Homeowners must pay the deductible amount before insurance payments are issued. Awareness of hurricane deductibles helps property owners budget for potential repair costs and avoid financial surprises following a major storm.
