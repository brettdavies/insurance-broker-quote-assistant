# The General Auto Insurance is a SCAM

The General Auto Insurance is a SCAM

TLDR: The General Auto Insurance lies and doesn’t disclose anything. Said I owe $455 for half a month of insurance after billing me $710/month without notice.

For anyone in the US looking for low cost insurance, avoid The General Auto Insurance. They raised my bill from $193 to $293 to $710 WITHOUT informing me. When I called for a quote while buying my new car they told me they couldn’t give me a price.

When I went to check my email after they sent me my second monthly statement, the bill was for $717. I audibly laughed and called them up, thinking it must be my 6 month premium. They informed me that because I had 7 points on my license, my monthly payment was raising to $710.

I said I wasn’t aware of points on my license. She listed offenses that I had from years ago. I said “ok, but I’d like to cancel my insurance as I was never informed of the change. No one in their right mind would pay $710/month for insurance.” She said “OK, you’re canceled.”

Then I get a letter that my bill of $455 for the half a month I received insurance from them was being sent to collections.

I called the PA DMV and they said they’ll send me a letter regarding points on my license. Today I get the letter and they tell me I have ZERO points on my license.

I called back to dispute them, sent emails to the original supervisor and I have yet to hear back. They’ve since sent it to their internal collections.
