> **17500**. _It is unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or association, or any employee thereof with intent directly or indirectly to dispose of real or personal property or to perform services, professional or otherwise, or anything of any nature whatsoever or to induce the public to enter into any obligation relating thereto, to make or disseminate or cause to be made or disseminated before the public in this state, or to make or disseminate or cause to be made or disseminated from this state before the public in any state, in any newspaper or other publication, or any advertising device, or by public outcry or proclamation, or in any other manner or means whatever, including over the Internet, any statement, concerning that real or personal property or those services, professional or otherwise, or concerning any circumstance or matter of fact connected with the proposed performance or disposition thereof, which is untrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or misleading, or for any person, firm, or corporation to so make or disseminate or cause to be so made or disseminated any such statement as part of a plan or scheme with the intent not to sell that personal property or those services, professional or otherwise, so advertised at the price stated therein, or as so advertised. Any violation of the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), or by both that imprisonment and fine._

Shouse Law Group has wonderful customer service. They were so pleasant and knowledgeable when I contacted them. Very helpful with any questions and concerns and I can't thank them enough for the experience I had. Definitely recommend!
Dee M.
I cannot express enough gratitude for the outstanding legal support I received from Karthik Krishnan. From the very first consultation, it was clear that he is a top-tier, highly skilled professional who genuinely cares about his clients. His unparalleled honesty, transparency, and unwavering dedication made all the difference in my case.
Mu K.
John Murray won my DMV hearing over a DUI charge I had pending and just recently won motion for military diversion against my charge. I highly recommend John, he is highly professional,motivated and competent. I walked into the courthouse with peace of mind only because I knew I had John in my corner. Thanks for all the help.
