# How Expensive Is Hurricane Insurance in Florida?
![How Expensive Is Hurricane Insurance in Florida?](https://cmslawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_1470642828-scaled.jpeg)
## Is Hurricane Insurance in Florida Too Expensive? What Homeowners Need to Know
Florida is no stranger to hurricanes. With its long coastline and tropical climate, the Sunshine State sits directly in the path of many powerful storms. For homeowners, that means hurricane insurance isn’t just an option—it’s often a necessity. But how much does it actually cost? And what can you do if your insurance company underpays, delays, or denies your claim?
In this guide, we’ll break down the average cost of hurricane insurance in Florida, explain what affects those rates, and help you understand your coverage better. If you’re facing a complicated claim, [CMS Law Group](https://cmslawgroup.com/) can help. As a Florida-based firm with extensive experience in hurricane claims, they offer legal support that can make a major difference when it counts most.
## Understanding Hurricane Insurance in Florida
Before diving into costs, it’s crucial to understand what hurricane insurance in Florida actually covers—and what it doesn’t. Contrary to what many believe, there’s no single “hurricane insurance” policy in Florida. Instead, coverage comes from a combination of policies.
Most standard homeowners’ insurance policies in Florida include windstorm coverage, which pays for damage caused by hurricane winds—like roof destruction, broken windows, or structural damage from flying debris. However, this coverage typically comes with a [hurricane deductible](https://uphelp.org/hurricane-deductibles-shift-home-repair-costs-to-consumers/?print=print), which is separate from your standard deductible and often set at a percentage of your home’s insured value (commonly 2% to 10%).
But here’s the catch—**flood damage is not included** in standard homeowner’s insurance. That means if storm surge or heavy rain from a hurricane floods your home, you won’t be covered unless you’ve purchased **separate flood insurance**. This is usually available through the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) or private insurance providers.
In short:
* **Wind = Homeowners Insurance (with hurricane deductible)**
* **Flood = Separate Flood Insurance**
Navigating these policies can be confusing, especially after a major storm. That’s why firms like CMS Law Group step in to help Florida homeowners make sense of their coverage—and fight for the claims they’re entitled to [when insurance companies underpay, delay, or deny](https://cmslawgroup.com/insurance-property-damage/).
## How Much Does Hurricane Insurance Cost in Florida?
The average cost of homeowners insurance in Florida is among the highest in the United States. Depending on your property’s location and value, the yearly premium can range from $2,000 to over $6,000. This cost includes hurricane coverage, which accounts for a significant portion of the premium.
Here are some factors that influence the cost:
### 1. Location
Proximity to the coast plays a major role in insurance costs. Homes in high-risk areas like Miami, Tampa, or Naples are more likely to experience strong hurricane impacts, so premiums tend to be significantly higher than in inland cities like Gainesville or Ocala.
### 2. Home Value and Construction
More expensive homes cost more to insure. Additionally, if your house is older or lacks hurricane-resistant features, you’ll likely pay more. On the other hand, homes with upgrades such as wind-rated windows, impact-resistant roofs, and storm shutters may qualify for discounts.
### 3. Deductibles
In Florida, hurricane deductibles are usually separate from your regular deductible and are based on a percentage of your home’s insured value. Typical hurricane deductibles range from 2% to 10%. So, if your home is insured for $300,000 and you have a 5% hurricane deductible, you’d pay $15,000 out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in.
### 4. Insurance Provider
Different companies offer different rates and coverage options. In Florida, due to high claim volumes, many national insurers have pulled back from the market. This has led to more policies being issued by state-run or regional insurers, which may be more expensive or provide limited coverage.
### 5. Claim History
If you’ve filed property insurance claims before—especially hurricane-related ones—your risk profile increases in the eyes of insurers. This often leads to higher premiums or more restrictive policy terms.
Understanding these cost drivers can help you better plan, compare policies, and potentially lower your premium where possible.
## The Added Cost of Flood Insurance
A common misconception among Florida homeowners is that hurricane insurance covers all storm-related damage. In reality, most standard homeowners’ insurance policies do not cover flooding—a major consequence of hurricanes. To protect against flood damage, you need a separate flood insurance policy, typically through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP**)** or a private insurer.
On average, NFIP flood insurance costs around $700 per year in Florida. However, if you live in a high-risk flood zone—such as coastal or low-lying areas—that cost can rise significantly, sometimes exceeding $2,000 annually depending on elevation, flood zone designation, and the structure of your home.
Without flood insurance, you could be left responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs to repair water-damaged floors, walls, furniture, electrical systems, and more. For Floridians living in hurricane-prone areas, flood insurance isn’t just a good idea—it’s often essential for full financial protection.
## Are Rates Rising?
Unfortunately, yes. Insurance premiums in Florida are increasing rapidly.
Homeowners across the state are facing a perfect storm of economic and environmental pressures that are making coverage more expensive than ever.
Over the past decade, Florida has seen more frequent and severe hurricanes. As climate change continues to fuel stronger storms, insurers face higher risks. Every time a storm causes widespread damage, insurers pay out billions in claims—leading them to raise premiums to offset future losses.
The price of labor and building materials has skyrocketed, especially after major hurricanes. Rebuilding even a modest home now costs significantly more than it did just a few years ago. Since insurance is designed to cover those costs, the premiums must reflect current market rates. This drives up the price of policies year after year.
Florida has experienced a [surge in insurance-related lawsuits](https://news.fiu.edu/2022/the-big-reason-florida-insurance-companies-are-failing-isnt-just-hurricane-risk-its-fraud-and-lawsuits), particularly involving roofing claims and contractor fraud. While not every claim is dishonest, widespread litigation adds to insurers’ operating costs. These expenses are ultimately passed down to policyholders in the form of higher premiums.
Several insurers have gone bankrupt or pulled out of Florida entirely, citing unsustainable losses. When this happens, remaining companies absorb the risk—and they often do so by significantly raising rates. Some Florida homeowners have seen their premiums double in just one renewal cycle.
As a result of all these issues, comprehensive hurricane insurance coverage in some parts of Florida now costs over $10,000 a year. For many families, that’s simply unaffordable.
## What You Can Do to Lower Your Hurricane Insurance Costs
While you can’t stop hurricanes from hitting Florida, you can take smart steps to make your insurance more affordable. Insurance companies reward homeowners who reduce risk, so investing in your home and reviewing your coverage carefully can lead to significant savings. Here’s what you can do:
### Fortify Your Home
Strengthening your home is one of the best ways to cut insurance costs. Install hurricane shutters, upgrade to impact-resistant windows, and reinforce your roof structure. These improvements reduce the likelihood of storm damage, which may make you eligible for substantial discounts from your insurer.
### Shop Around
Loyalty doesn’t always pay in the insurance world. Rates can vary widely from one company to another, so it’s worth getting quotes from multiple insurers. Reviewing your policy each year before renewal can help you avoid overpaying and find better coverage at a lower price.
### Bundle Policies
If you have auto insurance, consider bundling it with your homeowner’s insurance under one provider. Many insurers offer bundle discounts, which can shave hundreds off your total premium annually. It also simplifies payments and policy management, which is an added bonus.
### Increase Your Deductible
Opting for a higher hurricane deductible can significantly lower your monthly premium. Just be sure you have emergency savings to cover that amount if a storm causes damage. This strategy works best for those who want lower premiums and are financially prepared for out-of-pocket costs.
### Maintain a Good Credit Score
Your credit score can influence your insurance rates more than you think. In Florida, insurers often use credit history to assess risk. A strong score signals financial responsibility, which can lead to better premium offers and long-term savings. Pay bills on time and reduce debt to improve your score.
