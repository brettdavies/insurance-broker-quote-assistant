## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Virginia
How much car insurance costs in Virginia can depend on the [age of the driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/). Your age impacts how much you pay for car insurance, especially for young drivers. Less experience on the road generally translates to a higher likelihood of claims, which means higher rates. The rates below are for drivers with a clean driving record and their own car insurance policy (with the exception of 16-year-old rates).

**Bankrate’s take:** In Virginia, insurance companies can use age and gender as rating factors for car insurance. According to data from the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females), men are statistically more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors such as speeding, drunk driving and not wearing a seatbelt. Insurance companies tend to charge male drivers more for car insurance due to this risk, but as men and women get older, the premium difference between the two groups becomes minimal.
### Cost considerations for young drivers in Virginia
Very often, young drivers don’t purchase their own car insurance policy. Instead, they’re added as drivers to their parents’ or guardians’ policy. Generally, this is the cheapest way to get coverage, and it’s usually encouraged for young drivers to stay on the shared policy if they are still a member of the parents’ or guardians’ household. Once a young driver moves out and establishes their own household, they’ll likely be required to purchase their own car insurance policy.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Virginia?
Your driving record has one of the biggest impacts on your Virginia car insurance rates. If you have speeding ticket convictions, at-fault accidents or DUI convictions on your record, you are more likely to be viewed as a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) and pay higher rates for car insurance. For example, Virginia drivers with a DUI conviction on their records pay around double what a driver with a clean driving record pays. Below you can see the average cost of car insurance in Virginia for drivers with either a speeding ticket, an at-fault accident or a DUI conviction on their motor vehicle records.

## Car insurance rates in Virginia by credit tier
Virginia, like most states, allows insurers to use your credit history to calculate a [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/). This score is then used, in part, to determine your car insurance premium. [Drivers with worse credit ](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/)tend to file more claims, which makes them a higher risk for insurers. In Virginia, drivers with poor credit pay 151 percent more than drivers with excellent credit.

## Virginia car insurance rates by vehicle type
Some vehicles, like sports cars and [luxury cars](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/luxury-car-insurance/), are more expensive to insure. Liability coverage might be pricier if a vehicle has a higher statistical likelihood of an accident, while full coverage may cost more if a vehicle is more expensive to repair or replace. Of the models we analyzed in Virginia, the Honda Odyssey had the cheapest average rate at $1,913 per year for full coverage. The most expensive was a BMW 330i, at $2,588 per year. Keep in mind that this is still below the national average cost for full coverage, which is $2,671 per year.

## How to save on car insurance in Virginia
Although auto insurance premiums in Virginia are lower the national average, you might be able to save by:
  * **Periodically comparing your current rate:** Getting quotes from several car insurance companies could help you find a lower premium for the same coverage.
  * **Signing up for telematics:** Some insurance companies have [telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) that track your driving habits and discount your premium if you are a safe driver. Be aware that some providers reserve the right to raise your rates if the data show unsafe driving habits.
  * **Bundling coverage:** If you buy home, condo or renters insurance with your auto policy, you could get a discount on both. [Bundling discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) are among the most widely available and most impactful savings opportunities.
  * **Checking with your employer:** The company you work for may partner with select insurance providers. Ask your employer about affiliation discounts to find out.


Every company has its own set of discounts, so talking to your agent might be the best way to identify opportunities to save. For example, you might qualify for a loyalty discount if you’ve been insured for a specific period of time with the provider or earn a good student discount if you (or a young driver on your policy) are in high school or college and getting good grades. Most providers allow you to combine discounts to maximize your savings.

  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
