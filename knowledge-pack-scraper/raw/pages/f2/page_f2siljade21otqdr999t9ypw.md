**However, the ticket won't affect your rates until your policy renews.** So you should compare quotes when your policy is close to expiring.
## How a speeding ticket affects your insurance, by state
California has the largest increase in insurance rates after a speeding ticket.
Car insurance rates in California go up by 43% after one speeding ticket.
Drivers in Missouri, New York and West Virginia see the smallest increase in rates after one speeding ticket, at just 15%.

## When will a speeding ticket show up on insurance?
After you get a speeding ticket, the court notifies the DMV so it can update your driving record. Insurance companies typically check your record with the DMV before your policy renews. They do this to determine your rate for the next policy period.
![calendar icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_40/static/icons/calendar)
Your rates will only go up when your policy renews.
So, you shouldn't rush to switch insurance companies after a speeding ticket. Instead, wait to [shop for quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record#cheapest "Cheapest car insurance companies for bad drivers") until your current policy is about to expire.
### How multiple tickets can raise your auto insurance rates
No. of tickets | Rate increase  
---|---  
1 | 20%  
2 | 67%  
3 | 111%  
Drivers with more than one speeding ticket usually pay more for insurance than those with one ticket.
For example, one ticket increases rates with Geico by more than 20%. A second ticket raises rates by 38% more.
Drivers with two or three speeding tickets pay between 67% and 111% more than drivers with no tickets.
## How to lower insurance after a speeding ticket
The best way to find cheap car insurance after a speeding ticket is to [compare quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record "Best Cheap Car Insurance for Those With a Bad Driving Record").
There are some other options that can help. But you should always check with your insurance company to see what steps you can take to reduce your rate.
**You may be able to get your ticket dismissed by taking a[defensive driving course](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount").**
This isn't the case in all states. You can also fight the ticket in court or ask the judge for ways to keep a ticket off your record.
Some states tie citations to [points on a driver's license](https://www.valuepenguin.com/driving-points-increase-auto-insurance "Do Driving Points Increase Car Insurance Rates?"). Those points can impact how much insurance rates go up.
Insurance companies can also set rates based on your driving record instead of license points. That means efforts to reduce points, like taking a defensive driving course, might not keep your insurance rates down.
* * *
## How long does a speeding ticket affect insurance?
One speeding ticket will typically increase your insurance rates for between three and four years.
Car insurance rates go up by an average of 25% for the first two years after your ticket. Then, your insurance company will either reduce your rates to normal or reduce your penalty for the third year.
[ ![How a speeding ticket impacts your rates over time](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto/ticket_by_time_d_czbeuh) ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost#cheapest "Cheapest insurance companies")
Allstate is the only major company that charges higher rates for a driver with a 4-year-old speeding ticket.
### Cost of minimum coverage car insurance after one ticket
Time since ticket | Monthly cost | Increase  
---|---|---  
6 months | $66 | 25%  
1 year | $66 | 25%  
2 years | $66 | 25%  
3 years | $55 | 5%  
No recent ticket | $53 | —  
Different states have different laws regarding how long a ticket can stay on your driving record. In California, it only stays on your record for 39 months (three years and three months). In contrast, a citation in Virginia stays on your record for five years.
