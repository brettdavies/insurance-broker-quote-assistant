In other states, like [New Jersey](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/how-pip-works-new-jersey "/car-insurance/how-pip-works-new-jersey") and [Michigan](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/how-pip-works-michigan "/car-insurance/how-pip-works-michigan"), PIP will generally cover the injuries of anyone in your household. But in Florida, you can choose whether you want your PIP to cover just yourself or other residents in your household.

To get a [cheaper car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "/best-cheap-car-insurance") quote, you can opt for a higher deductible, of up to $1,000. You can also choose to exclude work income and whether you want your PIP to cover other residents of your household.
Florida has strict rules to follow when [filing a claim for PIP](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance"). Most importantly, treatment for any injuries must happen within two weeks of the car accident to be eligible for PIP reimbursement. Your claim will not be accepted after two weeks. Due to a high incidence of insurance fraud in the state of Florida, your insurer has up to 60 days to investigate your claim for any falsehood. Still, it must pay for your damages within 30 days, even if there is suspicion.
Considering a hospital stay after an accident could cost up to $60,000, it's wise to have a good amount of [bodily injury liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage") on your policy. While bodily injury liability is not required in Florida, it could protect you from being sued directly for excessive medical costs if you cause a major car accident.
Medical Payments or MedPay is essentially the same type of insurance as PIP, except it only covers medical bills and not lost income or other costs. It may be worth having on your [Florida car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheap-car-insurance-florida-study "/cheap-car-insurance-florida-study") policy because the limits are quite low. MedPay can add an extra $5,000 worth of coverage for around $100 per year.
