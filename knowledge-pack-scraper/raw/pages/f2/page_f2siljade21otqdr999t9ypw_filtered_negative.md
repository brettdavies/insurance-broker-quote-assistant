One speeding ticket [increases full coverage insurance rates by $41 per month](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost#raise "#raise"), on average. However, the exact amount varies based on your driving history, where you live and your insurance company's rules.
The best ways to lower your insurance rates after a ticket are to shop around for a [cheaper insurance company](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Most Affordable Insurers") or take a driver education class. Otherwise, your rates will go back down over time.
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is the cheapest major insurance company after a ticket, at $146 per month. That's an increase of just $12 per month, on average. Erie, USAA and Auto-Owners also have affordable rates after a ticket, but they're not available to everyone.
Yes, your first speeding ticket will increase your insurance rates by around 20%. However, [multiple tickets cause rates to increase much more](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost#multiple "#multiple"). Drivers with two tickets pay 67% more for full coverage. And those with three tickets pay twice as much as people with a clean record.
Most drivers can expect their rates to go up for [three to four years after a speeding ticket](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost#long "#long"). Your penalty usually decreases in the third year. Most insurance companies will offer you normal rates by the fourth year.
