## What to do immediately after a car incident

**1. Check safety first**

Your top priority is safety. Check if anyone is injured — yourself, passengers or others involved. Call 911 right away for injuries or significant damage. If it’s a major accident or if you feel unsafe, stay in your vehicle until help arrives.

**2. Secure the scene**

If it’s safe to do so, move your vehicle out of traffic to avoid further hazards and turn on your hazard lights. Remain at the scene until you’ve exchanged information and, if police were called, they have arrived and authorized you to leave.

**3. Notify the police**

In many states, you must call the police for certain types of accidents, especially if there are injuries, unsafe situations or serious property damage. A police report provides an official record and can facilitate the claims process.

## Essential information to collect after a car accident

After an accident, collecting certain information can help your insurance claim process go more smoothly. However, if you’re unable to gather these details at the scene — due to injury, stress or other reasons — that’s okay. You can still file your claim, and your insurer will assist you in obtaining the necessary information.

When possible, try to collect the following details. Focus on factual information. Using your mobile phone to take photos of documents, vehicles and the scene can be especially helpful.

Information type

Details to gather

Other driver(s)

Name, phone number, address; driver’s license number; insurance company and policy number

Vehicle(s)

Make, model, year, color; license plate number

Witness(es)

Name(s) and phone number(s)

Incident details

Date and time; exact location (intersection, street, landmark); weather conditions

Police details

Responding officer’s name and badge number; police report number

Scene documentation

Photos of damage (all vehicles, close-up and wide); photos of scene (road, signs, vehicle positions)

Description of the accident

Notes or a voice memo explaining what happened while it is still fresh in your memory

## How to file a car insurance claim

Many insurers provide various ways to start your claim, including by phone, website or mobile app — though specific options and processes can differ. For example, State Farm enables prompt claim filing via phone, website or mobile app, even if you don’t have all information gathered at the scene. Your insurer will guide you through the process and assist with any missing details. Keep your insurance card and policy number handy to speed up filing. Prompt reporting helps ensure a smoother claims process and timely assistance.

Phone

Many insurance companies, including State Farm, now offer [mobile apps](/customer-care/download-mobile-apps/state-farm-mobile-app) that can help simplify filing an auto insurance claim. Common app features may include:

* **Filing your claim** — ­submitting basic details and accident info directly from your phone.

* **Tracking claim status** — checking updates and receiving alerts about your claim.
* **Managing payments** — setting up direct deposit for quick claim payouts (if your insurer offers it).
* **Communicating with your claims representative** — chatting or messaging through secure in-app messaging.

## What to expect after filing a claim

Once you submit your claim, your insurance company may provide a unique claim number. Keep this number accessible for future reference. Many insurers assign a claim representative who may guide you through the following steps:

* Reviewing the facts you provided.
* Investigating the incident (which may include talking to others, reviewing police reports or inspecting the scene).
* Assessing your vehicle’s damage (sometimes with a mobile photo review, a [visit to a repair shop](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-choose-an-auto-body-shop-after-an-accident) or an in-person adjuster).
* Explaining your coverage, deductibles and what your auto insurance policy covers.
* [Discussing repair options](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-when-discussing-car-repairs-with-mechanic) or settlement details and assisting with payment or repairs.
