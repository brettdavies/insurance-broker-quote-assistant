Many factors affect car insurance rates, so premiums can vary widely among drivers. The national average monthly cost of car insurance is $177 for full coverage and $100 for liability-only coverage, according to Insurify data.

Car insurance costs increased by 15% in 2024, and Insurify’s data scientists predict another 4% increase in 2025, but [**comparing quotes**](/car-insurance/) can help you find cheaper premiums.

Quick Facts

* Teen drivers and drivers with DUIs typically pay the most for car insurance.
* Drivers in their 60s and drivers with clean records get the lowest rates.
* Driving safely, maintaining good credit, and comparing quotes can get you cheaper rates.

## How much is car insurance?

On average, liability-only car insurance costs $100 per month, while full coverage costs $177 per month.

From mid-2024 to early 2025, rates were stable or decreasing for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. But a recent [**Insurify report**](/car-insurance/report/) predicts that rates will increase by 4% by the end of 2025, and possibly up to 7%, depending on how insurers respond to tariffs on foreign auto parts and cars.

### Why car insurance rates are increasing so quickly

Insurers may consider personal factors when setting rates, but [**an Insurify report**](/car-insurance/report/) found other factors affect bottom lines before you even get a quote.

* **Car insurance companies are losing money.** Insurance companies are experiencing record losses, paying more in claims than they collect in premiums. Insurers pass those costs onto consumers to offset the loss.
* **Repair costs are higher than ever.** Mechanic shortages, hard-to-repair car technology, and the increasing average vehicle age contribute to rising costs.
* **Tariffs raise the cost of claim payouts.** Recent tariffs on foreign cars and parts will make buying and repairing foreign cars more expensive. It’ll even affect U.S.-made cars, as many use foreign-made parts. Insurers may increase rates to account for the higher claim payouts needed to cover car parts and repairs.
* **Climate disasters cause expensive claims.** Areas with frequent severe weather, like floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, typically have higher rates due to more expensive claims.

Important Information

Motor vehicle insurance rates rose dramatically after the pandemic and increased by 24% in 2023 alone, according to Insurify’s report. Car insurance costs rose by 15% in 2024, with an additional 4% to 7% increase expected in 2025. Rising repair costs, severe claims, and catastrophic weather all contribute to surging premiums.

## Factors that affect car insurance rates the most

Insurers consider many factors when setting premiums. [**Your driving record**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) is a major factor — the better your record, the lower your premium. Your location, credit history, age, gender, and the car you drive also affect the cost of your car insurance.[[1]](#cite-1)

## How your age affects car insurance rates

[**Teen drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) and drivers in their early 20s typically pay the highest auto insurance rates. That’s partly due to teens’ lack of experience, and the characteristics of teen fatal crashes include driver error, speeding, and night driving, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Rates typically decrease with age, but costs start to increase again slightly when drivers reach age 70. Fatal crash rates are highest for [**senior drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) older than 80, followed by drivers aged 16–19 and 20–24, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.[[3]](#cite-3) Age-related changes to vision and physical functioning, as well as diseases and medications, may affect older adults’ driving ability.

These are the national average monthly car insurance premiums by age group.

| 70s | $123 |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 50-plus partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

## Cost of car insurance by driving record

Your driving record affects your car insurance premiums significantly. Drivers with a clean record pay about 7% below average, and [**drivers with a DUI**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/) pay 67% above the national average rate, according to Insurify data.

A DUI is among the worst things that can happen to your driving record. It can increase your premium by 67%, per Insurify data. In some states, it stays on your record permanently, so avoid drinking and driving, and practice safe driving habits to lower your likelihood of an incident.

Most states have a [**driver’s license points system**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/drivers-license-points/), which assigns a point value to various traffic offenses. For instance, a Florida driver could earn three points for failing to yield or six for a hit-and-run. Accumulating 12 points in 12 months means a 30-day license suspension, and so on. Not all states use the points system, but each has a way to track violations.

#### Average Monthly Quote by Driving History

| Category | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Clean driving record | $147 |
| One speeding ticket | $224 |
| One at-fault accident | $232 |
| Reckless driving | $248 |
| One DUI | $264 |

Rate increases following an incident typically last three to five years, so ask your insurer about when you can expect a decrease or shop for new quotes around that time to find cheaper coverage.

| **Coverage Level**  sort ascsort desc | **Average Monthly Rate**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- |
| Liability only | $100 |

The coverage you choose significantly affects how much car insurance costs. A full-coverage policy costs about 105% more than liability-only coverage, according to Insurify data. New Hampshire is the only state that doesn’t require car insurance, but if you lease or finance your car, your lender may require you to [**buy full-coverage car insurance**](/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/).

State-minimum coverage typically includes bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. No-fault states typically also require personal injury protection and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/). Here’s what those cover:

  #### Bodily injury liability

  Covers costs from injuries you or another driver causes using your car

  #### Property damage liability

  Reimburses others for damage you cause to other cars, fences, buildings, etc.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/e0a53737be/health.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/e0a53737be/health.svg)

  #### Personal injury protection

  Covers medical expenses and lost wages for you and any passengers
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/5285c4cd74/uninsured-or-underinsured-motorist-coverage.svg)

  #### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

  Reimburses you in a hit-and-run or when another driver causes an accident and lacks adequate coverage

To insure against damages to your vehicle, you’ll need full coverage, which typically includes collision and comprehensive insurance. Collision insurance damages from a crash with another vehicle or object when you’re at fault, while comprehensive insurance protects you against vehicle theft, fire, floods, and things like falling trees. Some policies include glass coverage, or you can buy supplemental coverage.

“Choosing insurance limits is all about asset protection. With liability limit selection, you want to look at a few things, like ‘In the worst-case scenario, what costs would I need to cover?’ A typical fender bender with minimal bumper damage now costs more than $6,000 because of the technology. It adds up quickly!”

## Average car insurance rates by insurance company

Every insurance company has a different way of calculating premiums, though most consider the same factors. Besides personal risk factors, some factors affecting costs for all drivers include inflation, upticks in riskier driving, severe weather, and reinsurance rates. Reinsurance is basically insurance that helps insurance companies cover their losses following a year of high claims.

You can find dramatically different rates between insurers, so it’s always good to compare quotes.

The below rates are estimated rates current as of: Saturday, November 1 at 12:00 PM PDT.

## How credit history affects your car insurance premium

Most states allow insurers to use [**credit history to set rates**](/car-insurance/driver/credit/). California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Michigan don’t permit insurers to use any credit information to set auto insurance premiums. In Maryland, Oregon, and Utah, credit history can affect rates, but insurers can’t use it to deny, cancel, or non-renew your policy.

When insurers consider your credit, they’re not actually looking at your credit score. Instead, they use information in your credit history to generate a credit-based insurance score, which in turn helps them estimate your likelihood of filing a claim.

Different types of insurance scores may use different factors and weighting, but all use information from your credit report. That can include payment history, balances, credit limits, and more. Insurers use these scores to predict your likelihood of filing insurance claims.

#### Rates by Credit Tier

| Category | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Excellent | $131 |
| Good | $145 |
| Fair | $158 |
| Poor | $191 |

Insurify Tips

Curious about your credit? It used to be that you could get only one free credit report a year, but not anymore. In 2023, the federal government made permanent a pandemic-era program to make one free report available every week.[[4]](#cite-4) The Federal Trade Commission directs consumers to visit AnnualCreditReport.com to sign up.

## Other factors that affect car insurance costs

Several other factors can affect the cost of car insurance:

* **How much you drive:** The more you drive, the more opportunities you have to be in a car accident. So you’ll pay more for car insurance if you drive your car for work or have a long daily commute.
* **Selected coverages:** Many insurance companies offer additional coverages beyond liability, comprehensive, and collision coverages. Adding glass coverage, gap insurance, custom equipment coverage, [**roadside assistance**](/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-roadside-assistance/), or rental reimbursement coverage will increase your monthly premiums.
* **Your deductible:** The higher your deductible, the lower your monthly premiums. But higher deductibles also mean higher out-of-pocket costs when you file a claim, so it’s important to consider your financial situation when selecting a deductible.

## Average cost of car insurance FAQs

Shopping for car insurance can feel overwhelming when so many factors go into determining the cost of coverage. To help make the process easier and less confusing, here’s some additional information about average car insurance costs.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Nationwide, auto insurance averages $177 per month for full coverage and $100 per month for liability-only coverage. But premiums depend on various factors, including your age, location, driving history, and the type of coverage you select.

Your car insurance premiums won’t automatically decrease when you pay off your car loan. But if you were carrying [**gap insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/), which covers the difference between how much you owe on your vehicle and the insurance payout after a total loss, then you can drop that coverage after paying off your loan. This could lower your overall car insurance costs.

Not necessarily. Insurify data analysts found that [**car insurance premiums increased**](/car-insurance/rate-increases/) by an average of 15% in 2024. Insurify predicts rates will increase an additional 4% to 7% in 2025 as insurers continue grappling with profitability and new tariffs.

COUNTRY Financial has the cheapest car insurance nationwide, with liability premiums starting at $40 per month, according to Insurify data. But the cheapest car insurance company for you will depend on where you live, your driving history, the type of car you drive, and other factors. So it’s a good idea to shop around and compare rates from multiple insurance companies to identify the most affordable option.

Auto insurance tends to be cheaper once drivers reach 25 years old. Drivers in their 60s pay the lowest premiums, averaging just $85 per month for liability-only coverage and $151 per month for full coverage.

Car insurance companies are pulling out of California because of the state’s consumer-friendly legislation, Prop 103, which limits insurers’ ability to raise rates, and because of the state’s two-year freeze on insurance rate increases during the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation, in addition to rising car repair costs and wildfires in California, has prompted companies like GEICO, Progressive, and State Farm to withdraw or limit new coverage after experiencing high losses in the state.

Florida’s high risk of hurricanes and other coastal storms has hit insurers in the state hard. Companies are either pulling out of Florida or declaring insolvency — meaning they can’t pay debts they owe — to manage the risk of claims they’re experiencing from natural disasters in the state.

Compared to the national average of $138 per month, yes. But your rate depends on where you live, your driving history, your age, your credit history, your coverage levels, and more. So a $200 monthly rate might be considered cheap in New York City, where the average is $227 per month, but it’ll probably be considered expensive in Omaha, where the average is $124.

It’s helpful to use a [**calculator**](/car-insurance/calculator/) to see how your rates compare to other drivers.

Compared to the national average of $138 per month, no. But if $100 is too much for your budget, try looking for discounts, raising your deductible, and altering your coverage to save on costs. In the long term, maintain a good credit rating and a clean driving record to reduce your premium.
