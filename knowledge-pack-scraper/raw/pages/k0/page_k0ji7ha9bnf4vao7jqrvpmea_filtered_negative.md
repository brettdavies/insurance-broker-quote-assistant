Car insurance costs increased by 15% in 2024, and Insurify’s data scientists predict another 4% increase in 2025, but [**comparing quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) can help you find cheaper premiums.
From mid-2024 to early 2025, rates were stable or decreasing for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. But a recent [**Insurify report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/) predicts that rates will increase by 4% by the end of 2025, and possibly up to 7%, depending on how insurers respond to tariffs on foreign auto parts and cars.

Insurers may consider personal factors when setting rates, but [**an Insurify report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/) found other factors affect bottom lines before you even get a quote.

Insurers consider many factors when setting premiums. [**Your driving record**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) is a major factor — the better your record, the lower your premium. Your location, credit history, age, gender, and the car you drive also affect the cost of your car insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/#cite-1)
Disposable income, urban population, and [**miles driven**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/average-miles-driven-per-year/) per number of highway miles are all correlated with state auto insurance premiums.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/#cite-2) The number of [**uninsured drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) on the road also influences how insurers set rates.

To explore and download more auto insurance data, visit [**Insurify’s data center**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/data/).
[**Teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) and drivers in their early 20s typically pay the highest auto insurance rates. That’s partly due to teens’ lack of experience, and the characteristics of teen fatal crashes include driver error, speeding, and night driving, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Rates typically decrease with age, but costs start to increase again slightly when drivers reach age 70. Fatal crash rates are highest for [**senior drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) older than 80, followed by drivers aged 16–19 and 20–24, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/#cite-3) Age-related changes to vision and physical functioning, as well as diseases and medications, may affect older adults’ driving ability.
Your driving record affects your car insurance premiums significantly. Drivers with a clean record pay about 7% below average, and [**drivers with a DUI**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/) pay 67% above the national average rate, according to Insurify data.
Most states have a [**driver’s license points system**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/drivers-license-points/), which assigns a point value to various traffic offenses. For instance, a Florida driver could earn three points for failing to yield or six for a hit-and-run. Accumulating 12 points in 12 months means a 30-day license suspension, and so on. Not all states use the points system, but each has a way to track violations.

The coverage you choose significantly affects how much car insurance costs. A full-coverage policy costs about 105% more than liability-only coverage, according to Insurify data. New Hampshire is the only state that doesn’t require car insurance, but if you lease or finance your car, your lender may require you to [**buy full-coverage car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/).
State-minimum coverage typically includes bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. No-fault states typically also require personal injury protection and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/). Here’s what those cover:

Most states allow insurers to use [**credit history to set rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/credit/). California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Michigan don’t permit insurers to use any credit information to set auto insurance premiums. In Maryland, Oregon, and Utah, credit history can affect rates, but insurers can’t use it to deny, cancel, or non-renew your policy.
Curious about your credit? It used to be that you could get only one free credit report a year, but not anymore. In 2023, the federal government made permanent a pandemic-era program to make one free report available every week.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/#cite-4) The Federal Trade Commission directs consumers to visit AnnualCreditReport.com to sign up.
* **Selected coverages:** Many insurance companies offer additional coverages beyond liability, comprehensive, and collision coverages. Adding glass coverage, gap insurance, custom equipment coverage, [**roadside assistance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-roadside-assistance/), or rental reimbursement coverage will increase your monthly premiums.

* ### Do your car insurance costs decrease once your car is paid off?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Your car insurance premiums won’t automatically decrease when you pay off your car loan. But if you were carrying [**gap insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/), which covers the difference between how much you owe on your vehicle and the insurance payout after a total loss, then you can drop that coverage after paying off your loan. This could lower your overall car insurance costs.
* ### Does car insurance go down annually?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Not necessarily. Insurify data analysts found that [**car insurance premiums increased**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/rate-increases/) by an average of 15% in 2024. Insurify predicts rates will increase an additional 4% to 7% in 2025 as insurers continue grappling with profitability and new tariffs.
