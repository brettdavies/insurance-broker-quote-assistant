## About State Farm home insurance

4.7[NerdWallet rating](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/state-farm-home-insurance-review)

State Farm homeowners insurance earned 4.7 stars out of 5 for overall performance.

Founded in 1922, State Farm is now the largest homeowners insurance company in the U.S. One area where the company shines is its generous coverage for the structure of your home. Some other insurers charge extra for extended replacement coverage, while State Farm generally includes this for free.

Based on these considerations, State Farm is among NerdWallet's [Best Homeowners Insurance Companies for 2025](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-insurance-companies).

**What’s new with State Farm?**

After the Los Angeles fires in early 2025, State Farm instituted an emergency rate hike on its policyholders in [California](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/california-home-insurance). Rates went up an average of 17% for homeowners, part of an effort to restore the company’s financial stability after paying billions in fire claims. State Farm isn’t currently selling new homeowners policies in the state.

## What State Farm home insurance covers

These types of home insurance coverage generally come standard:

* ### Dwelling

  [Dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) pays to repair or rebuild the structure of your home after a covered event. It also covers attached structures, such as porches.

  **Typical amount**: Enough to rebuild your home.
* ### Other structures

  [Other structures coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/other-structures-coverage) pays to repair or rebuild stand-alone structures on your property, such as a fence or shed.

  **Typical amount**: 10% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal property

  [Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance) pays to repair or replace stolen or damaged belongings. Personal property coverage comes in one of two options: [actual cash value or replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

  **Typical amount:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Loss of use

  [Loss of use coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage), sometimes known as additional living expenses coverage, helps pay temporary living expenses while your home is being repaired. This can cover hotel stays, home rentals and meals.

  **Typical amount**: 20% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal liability

  [Personal liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-liability-insurance-homeowners) pays if you injure someone or cause property damage unintentionally or through neglect.

  **Typical amount**: $100,000 to $500,000.
* ### Medical payments

  [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners) pays to treat someone injured on your property, regardless of who’s at fault. It also pays if you, a family member or a pet injures someone away from your home.

  **Typical amount**: $1,000 to $5,000.

For more details, see [What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance)

State Farm also includes an "Increased Dwelling Limit," which automatically extends your dwelling coverage up to 20% above your chosen limit. As long as you've insured your home at least up to its estimated replacement cost, you won't pay anything to add this to your policy.

Say State Farm estimates that your home will cost $300,000 to rebuild, so that's how much dwelling coverage you've selected on your policy. If a disaster strikes your area and construction costs go up accordingly, State Farm could pay up to 20% more — or a total of $360,000 — to rebuild your home. Learn more about [extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost).

State Farm homeowners policies also generally include [replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) for your personal belongings. Having this type of coverage ensures that you can replace damaged or stolen items with brand-new ones.

Did you know...

Without replacement cost coverage, an insurance company would pay you the [actual cash value](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value) of your destroyed or stolen stuff after a claim. So if a fire destroys your 15-year-old bedroom set, you’d get a payout based on what the furniture was worth at the time of the fire — not enough to buy a brand-new set.

### Optional State Farm home insurance coverage

State Farm offers a long list of add-ons that may be available for an extra charge, including:

[**Water backup coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage) in case a drain backs up or a sump pump fails.

[**Service line coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/service-line-coverage) for damaged underground utility lines.

**Coverage for the breakdown of home systems**, such as furnaces and air conditioning units.

[**Ordinance or law coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/ordinance-or-law-coverage)to reimburse costs related to building codes or zoning laws.

[**Identity theft insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance)to help recover from fraud, cyberattacks and cyber extortion.

[**Earthquake coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance) for damage due to earth movement..

**Personal injury coverage** for libel, slander or other similar claims.

**Energy-efficient upgrade coverage** to replace a damaged water heater, air conditioner or heating unit with a more energy-efficient model.

**Home rental coverage** for homes that are rented out more than 30 nights a year.

[**Vacant home insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/unoccupied-vacant-home-insurance)for houses left unoccupied more than 30 days.

**Incidental business coverage** for people who work from home.

**Coverage for your portion of a loss** that affects all members of a homeowners association.

Before choosing any of these coverage options, read the fine print or ask your agent to talk you through the limitations and exclusions.

### What’s not covered

Like most homeowners insurance companies, State Farm won’t cover damage from flooding or earthquakes with its standard home insurance policy. You’ll need to buy separate coverage for these disasters.

Also not covered: mudslides, nuclear hazards, animal infestations, contamination, and wear and tear.

Did you know...

Most flood insurance in the U.S. is provided by the federally funded National Flood Insurance Program. However, private flood insurance may also be available to you. Learn [how to find the best flood insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/best-flood-insurance).

## Discounts

State Farm's homeowners insurance discounts vary by state. Depending on where you live, you might be able to save by:

## How to file a claim with State Farm

You can file a State Farm claim online, on the mobile app or by calling 800-732-5246. Once the claim is in progress, you can track it online or in the app. State Farm may pay you via direct deposit or check.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

In states where credit is a rating factor, we changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for homeowners with poor credit.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
