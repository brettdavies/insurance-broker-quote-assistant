## Google Search “[Your Car Insurer] NAIC Number”

The easiest way to find your insurance company’s number is to use Google.

For instance, if you want to know the number for Geico a quick Google search can help.

Type “Geico NAIC number**“** into Google, for example, to get the number for Geico.

For larger insurance companies, you might find multiple numbers. 21st Century, for example, has 12 different numbers, with one number for each of its member companies.

There’s a different number for 21st Century Auto Insurance Company of New Jersey, for example, and for 21st Century Pacific.

Pick the number that corresponds with your own provider.

## Should I check my vehicle’s proof of insurance card?

Or, you can go to your vehicle and find your proof of coverage card. This card will typically show the number for your insurer.

## Is the NAIC number on my declarations page?

The number can also be found on the declarations page of your auto insurance policy.

![State Farm](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![State Farm](/wp-content/themes/phoenix/images/front-2025/state-farm.png)

## Should I visit NAIC.org?

Another way to find it is to visit [NAIC.org](https://content.naic.org/regulator). The website, which is surprisingly dated, features a search box. Type your company name into that search box, select the business type, then click “Find a Company”.

> As mentioned above, you might see multiple numbers associated with a specific insurer.

A company’s NAIC number is good for that company nationwide, but one company may have different NAIC numbers for their affiliated companies.

A search for Geico, for example, will return multiple companies, including Geico Advantage Ins Co (# 14138), Geico Secure Ins Co (# 14137), and Government Employees Ins Co (# 22063).

Keep in mind that it covers all types of policies, including property insurance, business insurance, and car insurance, among others. Make sure you choose the company and the number that corresponds to your auto insurance policy.

## Should I call my insurer?

Alternatively, you can contact your car insurer and ask what their number is.

## What are the NAIC numbers for top insurance companies?

These numbers can vary between companies. Geico has multiple numbers for different states and regions, for example, as do most insurance companies.

Make sure you double-check NAIC.org (or your own proof of insurance card) before you use the numbers below.

**NAIC Numbers for Major Auto Insurance Companies**
