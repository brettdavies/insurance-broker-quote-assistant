##  What Is Property Insurance?
##  How Property Insurance Works
Property insurance can include a number of types of policies, such as [homeowners insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp), renters insurance, [flood insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flood-insurance.asp), and earthquake insurance. Both structural losses and personal property are usually included in a homeowners or [renters insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/insurance/renters-insurance/) policy.1 The exception is personal property that is very high value and expensive, which is usually covered by purchasing an addition to the policy called a [rider](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rider.asp). If there's a claim, the property insurance policy will reimburse the policyholder for the actual value of the damage or the [replacement cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/replacementcost.asp) to fix the problem.2
Perils covered by property insurance typically include select weather-related afflictions, such as damage caused by fire, smoke, wind, hail, the impact of snow and ice, and lightning. Property insurance also [protects against vandalism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vandalism-and-malicious-mischief-insurance.asp) and theft, covering the structure and its contents. This insurance also provides liability coverage in case someone other than the property owner or renter is injured while on the property and decides to sue. Most mortgage lenders require homeowners to have property insurance if there's an outstanding mortgage loan on the property.
Property insurance policies normally exclude damage that results from a variety of events, including tsunamis, floods, drain and sewer backups, seeping groundwater, standing water, and a number of other sources of water. [Mold](https://www.investopedia.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold-4782771) is typically not covered, nor is the damage from an earthquake. In addition, most policies will not cover extreme circumstances, such as nuclear events, acts of war, or terrorism. If your property is located in what is considered a high-risk zone, you might want to investigate [Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR)](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-fair-plan-insurance-8685586) coverage plans.
##  Understanding Property Insurance
* **Actual cash value** coverage pays the owner or renter the replacement cost minus depreciation. If the destroyed item is 10 years old, you get the value of a 10-year-old item, not a new one.
* **Extended replacement costs** will pay more than the coverage limit if the costs for construction have gone up; however, this usually won't exceed 25% of the limit. When you buy this insurance, the limit is the maximum amount of benefit the insurance company will pay for a given situation or occurrence.
##  Special Considerations
Homeowners and tenant insurance policies typically include some basic levels of coverage. However, several types of policies exist that extend beyond basic packages to include more comprehensive coverage. The greater the coverage, the more expensive the [premiums ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp)will be for the policy. Below are the most common types of homeowners policies (HO) and their coverage.
###  HO1
###  HO2
###  HO3
###  HO5
HO5 homeowners coverage includes everything in an HO3 policy but is more geared toward the structure itself and the property within the home, including furniture, appliances, clothing, and other personal items. An HO5 also doesn't cover earthquakes or floods. HO5 insurance policies are available to homes that were either built in the last 30 years or renovated in the previous 40 years, and they typically cover any damages at replacement cost.5
###  HO4
HO4 property insurance, also known as [renters insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renters-insurance.asp), covers tenants from loss of personal property and liability issues. However, it does not cover the actual house or apartment being rented, which should be covered by the landlord’s insurance policy.5
###  HO6
###  Exclusions
##  The Bottom Line
