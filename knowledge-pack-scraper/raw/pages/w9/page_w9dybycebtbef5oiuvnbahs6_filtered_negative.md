###  Consider lender requirements
###  Consider your individual needs
* [**Gap insurance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/)**:** If your insurance company deems your vehicle a total loss as the result of a covered incident, gap insurance is intended to help pay off the balance of your loan if you owe more than what the vehicle is worth. This may occur as a result of an accident or non-recoverable theft.
* [**Roadside assistance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/roadside-assistance/)**:** If you break down and need a tow, lock yourself out of your car or need assistance changing a flat tire, emergency roadside assistance coverage may be able to help.
* [**Rental reimbursement**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/does-insurance-cover-rental-cars/)**:** Rental reimbursement coverage may help pay or reimburse you for your rental car while your vehicle is repaired due to a covered claim.
* [**New vehicle replacement**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/new-car-replacement-insurance/)**:** This endorsement may be useful if you have a car that is fairly new. Normally your insurer will pay you the depreciated value of your car if it's totaled in an accident, but with this add-on, you would receive enough to purchase a new car of the same make and model.
