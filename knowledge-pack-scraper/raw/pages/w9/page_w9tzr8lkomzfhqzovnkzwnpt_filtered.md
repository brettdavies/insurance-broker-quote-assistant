I am told its easy and carriers are used to doing this  
However this is not my experience, I am running into carriers that just dont want to do it  
And some like GTL and Foresters even Gerber say we just do not do that period  
We have escalated and spoke to managers and noting they are NOT budging  
  
What m I missing?

I can see my production at every company I'm contracted with.   
  
Including Foresters and Gerber.   
  
I fired GTL years ago so I don't know what they have.

Dude you always say your upline is awesome . Why aren't they teaching you this ? FYI Gtl has nothing . You can't even pull up your clients into on policies . You have to go back to the application to get info . I used to write a good bit before cica .If cica won't take i use Gtl . Even though there hospital indemnity plans 10% more than many i use because they pay their claims fast and customer service is excellent

What? I simply asked who he needs to prove it to. I can't imagine needing to prove it to anyone.

I'm just kidding, dude. I have no idea why you'd have to prove it either outside of some IMO giving him a bump based on production.
