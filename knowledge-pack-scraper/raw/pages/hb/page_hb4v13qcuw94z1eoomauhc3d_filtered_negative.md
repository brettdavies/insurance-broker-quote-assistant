## GEICO Review Summary
[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) is one of the best insurance companies overall, earning a rating of 3.8/5 from WalletHub. It has A+ score from the Better Business Bureau and a great score from J.D. Power. GEICO, which stands for Government Employees Insurance Company, is best known for providing affordable car insurance coverage. But you don’t have to work for the government to get GEICO insurance, and you can cover much more than your car. GEICO also offers homeowners insurance, renters insurance, boat insurance, jewelry insurance, and several other types of policies.
In the sections below, you can learn more about GEICO’s insurance offerings, how they compare to policies from top competitors, and where they’re lacking. For instance, you can find out why GEICO, despite all of its great features, does have some room for improvement in the customer service and claims departments.

Now that you’re familiar with GEICO’s scores in each of our review categories, let’s see how the company compares to top competitors in a handful of key areas. Hopefully, this will help you find the best insurance company for your needs.
##  GEICO Car Insurance Pricing
**Category Rating:** **67%**(20 out of 30)
GEICO received a score of 20/30 in the cost portion of this review, as its premiums rank in the second quartile among the cheapest major car insurance companies that WalletHub evaluated.
However, it is worth noting that GEICO’s method of calculating rate quotes faced legal action from the Consumer Federation of California in 2015. The complaint alleged that GEICO’s rate-quote system unfairly targeted certain low-income motorists with deceptive and inflated insurance quotes. GEICO paid $6 million to settle the deceptive rate-quote complaint. Learn more about [WalletHub’s Methodology](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/insurance-review-methodology/78657).
##  GEICO Customer Service & Reviews
**Category Rating:** **58%**(17.5 out of 30)
* **Reviews on WalletHub**: 1.6/5
* **JD Power**: 3.2/5
* **NAIC**: 0.81
* **BBB**: A+
Customer service can be difficult to evaluate, but it is an important factor to consider when choosing an insurance company. How helpful an insurer’s customer service department is can affect how you manage your policy, how confident you are in your coverage, and how likely you are to switch carriers. That’s why customer reviews and ratings from watchdog groups can be so revealing.
All things considered, GEICO receives an average score in this category, with a few points deducted because of customer complaints. Complaints about GEICO car insurance generally revolve around three issues: slow claim response times, confusing website pages, and premium increases.
##  GEICO’s Financial Stability
**Category Rating: 100%** (7 out of 7)
* **Standard & Poor’s**: N/A
* **Moody’s**: Aa1
* **AM Best**: A++
GEICO and its affiliates have earned top marks from Moody’s, and AM Best for their financial strength and claims-paying ability. Knowing that an insurance company has the financial wherewithal to pay out claims should remove at least a measure of doubt from consumers’ minds.
##  GEICO Claims
**Category Rating:** **100%**(15 out of 15)
GEICO allows customers to file claims online or by phone. It also offers 24/7 claims support by phone, which could be helpful if you get into an accident in the middle of the night, for example. As a result, GEICO receives full marks in this category, per our grading criteria, which you can find in the Methodology section below.
This is not to say that GEICO’s claims process is perfect. There are issues from time to time, prompting customer complaints, as is the case with any insurance company. But GEICO provides all the tools needed to make the claims process as painless as possible.

Given that GEICO offers several different insurance options – including car, home and life insurance – and gives customers savings for bundling policies, it received a high score in this category. Below, we’ll delve deeper into the car insurance coverage options available from GEICO, as auto insurance is what the company is mainly known for.
GEICO offers all of the standard car insurance coverage options: liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage, collision insurance, and comprehensive coverage, for example. On top of that, GEICO offers a supplemental list of protections as well as specialty auto insurance options that help set it apart from competitors.
### Supplemental GEICO Car Insurance Coverage Options:
* **Emergency Road Service**: Covers emergency towing, jump starts, flat tires, and lockout services.

##  GEICO Transparency
**Category Rating:** **100%**(5 out of 5)
Key information is easy to find on GEICO’s website and mobile app, so it gets a good score in the transparency department from WalletHub. Furthermore, GEICO has live customer service agents available to answer any questions you might have.
## Bottom Line
[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) is a good insurance company, especially for tech-savvy, budget-conscious drivers who are comfortable buying car insurance directly from an insurance company, rather than from an individual agent. Prospective customers should also be comfortable managing the policy largely online and over the phone, rather than face to face with an agent. Fortunately, GEICO has a largely transparent, fairly easy-to-use website.
All in all, GEICO car insurance scores well in terms of pricing, ease of use, and coverage options. For example, GEICO offers a special policy to protect people driving for rideshare companies or on-demand delivery services. There are lots of discounts available, too, lending some credibility to the company’s famous tagline: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” In fact, the various discount categories could help drivers save as much as 40%.

## GEICO Insurance Review Video
## Methodology
In order to provide fair, helpful reviews of insurance companies such as GEICO that can lead consumers to the best insurance coverage for their needs, WalletHub rates each insurance company in seven major categories: Cost, Insurance Types, Customer Service & Reviews, Discounts, Claims, Financial Stability and Transparency. Below, you can find an overview of what each section in our scoring rubric entails.
1. The “Cost” section includes information about how expensive the insurance policies are. GEICO's average premiums and quartile rankings are based on data from California, the largest state GEICO operates in. Rate information is provided by Quadrant Information Services. Individual rates will be different.
2. The “Insurance Types” section examines what types of insurance policies the company offers.
3. The “Customer Service & Reviews” section measures the insurance company’s reputation as well user reviews and information from watchdog organizations.
4. The “Discounts” section examines how many and what types of discounts the company offers. It also takes into consideration whether or not there are discounts for bundling policies.
5. The “Claims” section examines the ways in which customers can make claims with the policy. It considers whether or not customers can make claims by phone or online, as well as whether or not the company has a 24/7 support line.
6. The “Financial Stability” section considers the company’s status with credit rating agencies AM Best, S&P and Moody’s.
7. The “Transparency” section measures how clearly the insurer discloses key information on its website.
The final score takes these seven categories into account and reflects how close an insurance company is to WalletHub’s definition of a 5-star insurer. For more information, please read [WalletHub’s full insurance company methodology](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/insurance-review-methodology/78657).
