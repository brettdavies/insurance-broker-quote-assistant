Yes, GEICO insurance rates are competitive, as the company is one of the 10 cheapest auto insurers nationally, according to WalletHub analysis. GEICO car insurance customers pay an average of $462 per year for coverage. GEICO's car insurance rates are based on your driving record and experience, along with factors like the type of car you drive, your ZIP code, your insurance history, and more. Your coverage and deductible choices also impact your final quote, as does your eligibility for discounts.

[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) is so cheap because it sells insurance coverage directly to consumers without middlemen and offers a [lot of discounts](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/geico-discounts/76834). Direct-to-consumer insurance allows GEICO to have significantly fewer local offices and agents, making them cheaper than companies like State Farm and Progressive. Having a smaller agent network lowers GEICO's overhead costs so they can pass those savings on to consumers.

Yes, Geico has a grace period of 9 days for late payments, when you can pay your past-due premium in order to avoid a lapse in coverage. If the grace period ends without the necessary payment being made, Geico will cancel the policy.

Geico insurance will go up by about 79% after your first accident resulting in a claim of $750 or more. If this is your second accident in less than three years, your insurance will go up at least twice as much , depending on the total cost of the claim. If you have more than two accidents in a three-year period, you can expect to pay 225% more. These surcharges will be in effect for...

Yes. GEICO is a good insurance company. GEICO has been providing insurance since 1936, boasts an A+ Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating, and is one of the cheapest major car insurance companies according to [WalletHub's research](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance).

However, GEICO's NAIC rating is 1.33, which means it has received more complaints than the average insurance company. On the other hand, it may be encouraging to note that GEICO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, which...
