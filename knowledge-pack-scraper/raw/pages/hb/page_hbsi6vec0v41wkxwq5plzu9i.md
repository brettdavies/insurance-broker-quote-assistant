##  What Is Self-Insurance? 
Self-insurance is a financial strategy where you set aside personal funds to cover potential losses instead of relying on insurance companies. This approach means that you cover costs for events like medical procedures or property damage directly from your pocket, bypassing the need for traditional insurance claims. People often self-insure without realizing it, such as when opting for higher deductibles or declining extended warranties. While self-insurance can save on premium costs, it's crucial to weigh the financial risks of unexpected high expenses.  

### Key Takeaways
  * Self-insurance means setting aside personal funds to cover potential losses instead of relying on an insurance company.  

  * It can be cost-effective for minimal expenses but carries the risk of financial strain in case of unexpected high costs.  

  * People often self-insure by choosing higher deductibles on insurance policies or declining extended warranties.  

  * Self-insurance is often unsuitable for very expensive risks unless the individual is wealthy enough to absorb potential losses.  

  * Companies may employ self-insurance for employee health benefits, retaining full risk rather than transferring it to an insurer.


##  How Self-Insurance Works 
Insurance is designed to protect against financial losses you can’t afford to bear, but for losses that you can afford, self-insurance can save money since you aren’t paying [insurance premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp). When considering self-insurance, you’re weighing the certainty of spending money on [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp) against the possibility of incurring a loss that you won’t be able to turn to insurance to pay for. 
You probably already [self-insure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-insure.asp) for certain items without even realizing it. When you choose your [deductible](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp) on an insurance policy, you’re basically self-insuring for the amount of the deductible. You’re choosing an amount of risk you’re comfortable paying for out of pocket, such as $1,000 or $5,000. Another area where people frequently self-insure is when they reject extended warranties. While a [warranty](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warranty.asp) is not technically insurance, it is similar in that it covers the cost of an adverse event. However, because most people can afford to replace or repair items like televisions and computers, they forego extended warranties and self-insure instead. 
##  Key Factors to Consider When Self-Insuring 
For very expensive risks, self-insurance only makes sense if you’re wealthy. For example, few people choose to self-insure their homes. For one, if you have a mortgage, your lender will require you to carry homeowners insurance. But even if your house is paid off, you probably don’t want the risk of having to pay out of pocket to completely rebuild it if it burns to the ground. If your [net worth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp) is high relative to the value of your house and you aren’t terribly [risk-averse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp), however, it might make more sense to forego purchasing insurance, save the few hundred dollars it would cost you every year, and keep money set aside in the unlikely event that you need to rebuild.

If you’re going to self-insure, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the worst-case scenario so you’re prepared financially. As an alternative, if the risk is too high, you might consider maintaining insurance but with a very high deductible. 
##  Self-Insurance in Action: U.S. Health Insurance Example 
In the United States, self-insurance applies especially to health insurance and may involve, for example, an employer providing certain benefits—like [health benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_benefits_%28insurance%29) or [disability benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_benefits)—to employees and funding claims from a specified pool of assets rather than through an insurance company. In self-funded health care, the employer ultimately retains the full risk of paying claims, whereas when using insurance, all risk is transferred to the insurer. 
##  The Bottom Line 
Self-insurance is a strategic option for those willing to accept the risks associated with paying for potential losses directly from their own funds. This approach may be prudent for minor expenses or when one wishes to avoid high insurance premiums for unlikely events. However, self-insurance carries the risk of unforeseen costs potentially leading to financial strain. Understanding potential worst-case scenarios and comparing them to the predictable cost of insurance premiums can help determine if self-insurance is a suitable choice. For significant risks, maintaining insurance with a high deductible might strike a balance between cost-saving and risk mitigation.
