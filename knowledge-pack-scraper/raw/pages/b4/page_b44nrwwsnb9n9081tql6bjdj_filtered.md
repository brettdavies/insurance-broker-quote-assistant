State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a great option for customers looking for flexible or with unique coverage needs. However, State Farm's average rates tend to be higher than average. Also, the company suffers from a lack of available homeowners discounts — only four discount options at present. State Farm's home insurance options enjoy good ratings from third-party agencies, and the company ranked fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Still, homeowners looking for basic insurance with no bells or whistles may wish to look for an alternative.
