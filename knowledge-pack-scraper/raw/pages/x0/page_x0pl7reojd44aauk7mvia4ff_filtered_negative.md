Non-admitted carriers are typically smaller and more specialized than admitted carriers. They often have a narrower focus, such as _offering coverage for _specific industries_ or geographic areas_.

If you're a surplus lines insurer looking to be listed on the Department's Listing of Eligible Surplus Lines Insurers, you'll need to submit a _cover letter with your contact information_ and a listing of the documents filed.
A properly executed annual statement showing a minimum of $15 million in capital and surplus is also required, along with a copy of your current Certificate of Authority from the _insurance department of your domicile state_.
