Non-admitted carriers are typically smaller and more specialized than admitted carriers. They often have a narrower focus, such as _offering coverage for _specific industries_ or geographic areas_.
Some examples of non-admitted insurance carriers include Lloyd's of London and certain Lloyd's syndicates.

RRGs are not covered by Indiana's guarantee associations, which means their liabilities are not protected in the same way as other insurance carriers.
You can find a listing of RRGs by using the Consumer Inquiry lookup at https://www.sircon.com/ComplianceExpress/Inquiry/consumerInquiry.do?nonSscrb=Y (State=Indiana, Entity Type=Company, Company Type=Registered Risk Retention Group).
