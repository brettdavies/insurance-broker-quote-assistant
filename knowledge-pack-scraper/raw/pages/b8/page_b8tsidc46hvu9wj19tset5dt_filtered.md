## Progressive vs. Allstate: rates for high-risk drivers

If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, Progressive could be a better choice than Allstate. Progressive was less expensive for those with violations in their recent driving history. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: ALLSTATE VS. PROGRESSIVE

| **Infraction** | **Progressive avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,720 | $3,006 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $2,245 | $2,290 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,201 | $3,637 |
| Reckless driving | $2,457 | $3,388 |
| Speeding ticket | $2,091 | $2,256 |

## Progressive vs. Allstate: rates by age

Auto insurance companies use a [driver's age](/auto-insurance/driver/age/) as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for [young drivers](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) under the age of 25 — due to their relative inexperience compared to [older drivers](/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/). Because every car insurance company rates age brackets in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose Allstate before Progressive: Allstate offers average yearly savings of $1,806, compared to Progressive. For drivers in theirs 20s and older, however, Progressive was cheaper.

##### RATES BY AGE: ALLSTATE VS. PROGRESSIVE

| **Age bracket** | **Progressive avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $8,248 | $6,442 |
| **20s** | $2,287 | $2,636 |
| **30s** | $1,646 | $2,636 |
| **40s** | $1,644 | $1,912 |
| **50s** | $1,542 | $1,893 |
| **60s** | $1,403 | $1,768 |

Cost aside, Progressive and Allstate each carry pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, add-ons and financial stability. Dive into the data before making your decision and be sure to shop around and [compare auto rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before purchasing a policy.

## Telematics options: Progressive vs. Allstate

For safe drivers, enrolling in a telematics program can translate to savings. Telematics programs use technology to help track your driving habits and set a rate based on its findings on the way you drive, and in some cases, mileage.

Both Progressive and Allstate offer [telematics options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/). Have a look at the options available from both companies below.

![Progressive telematics logo]()

Progressive Snapshot

[Snapshot](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/progressive-snapshot-review/) is Progressive's telematics option. The app tracks drivers' behavior while behind the wheel (including hard braking, speeding and more) to give a more accurate level of risk. Good drivers stand to save an average of $145 on their premium according to the company.

![allstate logo]()

Allstate Drivewise

[Allstate's Drivewise](/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/allstate-drivewise/) is a telematics program that uses a mobile app to track your driving behavior, which could lead to discounts for safe motorists. Drivers receive 3% cashback for signing up for Drivewise. The app-based program can be used by both policyholders and "non-customers" alike to view driving data and receive feedback.

![allstate logo]()

Allstate Milewise

Milewise is Allstate's program for [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/). This could benefit [low-mileage drivers](/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/) in particular as rates are based on the number of miles that you drive. These miles are tracked by a plug-in device. While not available in every state, Allstate has plans to continue expansion in an effort to gain more users.

### Zebra Tip: Explore telematics offerings from each company if you are a safe driver

---

Both Progressive's Snapshot and Allstate's Drivewise and Milewise are good options overall, and worth checking out for potential savings if you're a careful or low mileage driver.

## Roadside assistance: Progressive vs. Allstate

A [roadside assistance program](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) can be a great safety net to have in case of emergencies. Below you can find a quick rundown of the roadside assistance options offered by both Progressive and Allstate.

#### Progressive

Progressive partners with a company called Agero to provide roadside assistance. These services can be used for more than just your car — it also applies for boats, motorcycles or RVs. When added to your policy, Progressive's roadside assistance program offers:

* Fuel delivery
* Flat-tire changes
* Battery jump-start
* Battery recharge for EVs
* Lock-out services
* On-scene labor
* Winching services

#### Allstate

Allstate offers three types of roadside service to customers with and without an Allstate insurance plan. Annual roadside membership plans and pay-per-use plans are available, and if you have Allstate insurance, you can add roadside coverage to your policy. The pay-per-use coverage allows you to pay only for service when you need it (typically with a charge of $119 per tow and $84 for other services like tire changes, jump starts, fuel delivery and locksmith services).

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

It is normal for insurance companies, including Allstate, to require anyone in the household (of driving age) to be listed on a policy, "just in case."
