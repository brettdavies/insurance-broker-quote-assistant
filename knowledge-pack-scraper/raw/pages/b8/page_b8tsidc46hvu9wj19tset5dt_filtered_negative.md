Allstate's is **more expensive** and has lower**trust** and **customer service scores**
* * *
If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, Progressive could be a better choice than Allstate. Progressive was less expensive for those with violations in their recent driving history. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.
---|---|---
Auto insurance companies use a [driver's age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for [young drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) under the age of 25 — due to their relative inexperience compared to [older drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/). Because every car insurance company rates age brackets in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose Allstate before Progressive: Allstate offers average yearly savings of $1,806, compared to Progressive. For drivers in theirs 20s and older, however, Progressive was cheaper.

[Allstate's Drivewise](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/allstate-drivewise/) is a telematics program that uses a mobile app to track your driving behavior, which could lead to discounts for safe motorists. Drivers receive 3% cashback for signing up for Drivewise. The app-based program can be used by both policyholders and "non-customers" alike to view driving data and receive feedback.
Milewise is Allstate's program for [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/). This could benefit [low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/) in particular as rates are based on the number of miles that you drive. These miles are tracked by a plug-in device. While not available in every state, Allstate has plans to continue expansion in an effort to gain more users.
