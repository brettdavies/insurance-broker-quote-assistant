**Bankrate's take** 

Nationwide availability, low rates and options for drivers with a wide range of risk profiles could make Geico a strong option for many drivers seeking affordable auto insurance coverage. However, Geico only underwrites its auto coverage, so customers seeking a one-stop-shop for auto, home and life insurance may want to look elsewhere.

## Geico car insurance review

Geico offers affordable rates to a variety of drivers, even those with checkered driving records. While you're never guaranteed a policy, Bankrate found that Geico is willing to work with high-risk drivers and offers them competitive rates compared to other major insurers — which helped it earn the [2025 Bankrate Award for Best Car Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/).

Geico doesn't just offer low rates to high-risk drivers, safe drivers may find significant savings with Geico, too. According to Bankrate's analysis of average rates from Quadrant Information Services, a full coverage policy from Geico costs 18 percent less than the national average. And that's without factoring in its lengthy list of [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). However, Geico's insurance offerings are fairly simple and may not offer robust enough coverage for all drivers. Some key coverage types, like gap insurance, are not available.

### Pros and cons of Geico car insurance

If you’re [comparing auto insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), considering Geico’s pros and cons might help aid your decision.

Its average cost of car insurance is $2,200 per year for full coverage and $596 per year for minimum coverage.

#### How much is Geico car insurance?

Your driver profile — which encompasses [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) like your driving record, credit history (in most states) and age — gives Geico a basis for calculating your financial risk as a driver. While most driver profiles receive comparatively low rates from Geico, high risk factors like poor credit or moving violations typically correlate with higher premiums.

#### Geico car insurance quotes by age

The age of a driver and the years of driving experience they’ve accumulated may also play an important role in determining car insurance rates. Young drivers and those who are newly licensed typically pay more for car insurance than drivers with more years of experience behind the wheel. [Average insurance rates by age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) show that auto insurance premiums do tend to decrease over time until your 60s, but you may be able to find the best car insurance rate at any age by compiling [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/).

For younger drivers, staying on a parent’s policy can keep rates low. The rates shown below are based on a clean driving record.

| [Age 40](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/40-year-old/) | $2,200 | $2,697 |

## Geico home insurance review

Because Geico does not write its own home insurance policies, it did not receive a Bankrate Score for home insurance. Instead, Geico works with [non-affiliated insurance companies](https://www.geico.com/about/corporate/geico-ins-agency-companies/) to offer homeowners insurance quotes to customers nationwide, with a discount for customers who [bundle their home and auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) together. For some customers who already have auto insurance through Geico, Geico may offer the [best homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) options, but you may want to consider other carriers if you prefer to have all your coverage through the same company.

### Pros and cons of Geico homeowners insurance

If you’re considering getting [home insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) from Geico, consider the following advantages and disadvantages of choosing Geico as your home insurance provider:

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Option to service both policies in one place
* Bundling discounts may be available
* Some underwriting companies may offer competitive rates

![Red circle with an X inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/remove-circle.svg)

### Cons

* All home insurance policies written through non-affiliated companies
* Geico acts as an agent, not the insurance provider
* Coverage options may vary depending on underwriting company

* Homeowners insurance cost
* Customer satisfaction

### Geico home insurance cost

Because Geico’s home insurance policies are underwritten by a wide range of companies, there’s no available data on the average cost of a homeowners insurance policy from Geico. If you choose to get home insurance quotes through Geico, keep in mind that the national [average cost of homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) is $2,408 for $300,000 in dwelling coverage, according to Bankrate’s research.

### Geico customer satisfaction

Geico isn’t rated in J.D. Power’s property insurance studies because it issues home insurance policies through non-affiliated companies. For the same reason, any homeowners insurance complaints submitted to the NAIC by Geico customers are attached to the companies underwriting the coverage rather than Geico, which only acts as an agent for homeowners insurance. If you want to purchase home insurance through Geico, consider looking up the NAIC complaint index for the company that issues your quote.

## Geico life insurance review

Similar to its home insurance policies, [Geico life insurance](https://www.geico.com/life-insurance/) is offered through partner companies. Geico's partnered life insurance offerings are available in three policy types: term life, whole life and universal life insurance. [Term life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/term-life-insurance/) provides coverage for a specific amount of time, such as 10 or 30 years, and is typically used to replace lost income and cover future expenses if the policyholder passes away during the policy term. Customers shopping for the [best life insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/) may be able to obtain a term life insurance policy through Geico's partner companies with no medical exam, but they will likely still have to fill out a health and lifestyle questionnaire.

[Whole life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/whole-life-insurance/) and [universal life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/universal-life-insurance/) are both types of permanent life insurance. These policies do not have a policy end date as long as policy terms are fulfilled. In addition to helping with income, permanent life insurance policies could also be an integral part of estate planning. However, because Geico writes these policies through separate underwriting companies, it’s impossible to give a thorough Geico life insurance review that will apply to all customers purchasing life insurance through Geico.

## Is Geico a good insurance company?

Bankrate’s insurance editorial team is made up of licensed agents and other industry professionals with combined decades of experience in the world of insurance. Based on the findings of our Geico insurance review, we concluded that Geico may be a good option for drivers seeking a [cheap car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) with tons of availability, good digital tools and a focus on online shopping and policy management rather than brick-and-mortar agencies.

On the other hand, Geico doesn’t underwrite many other types of insurance, making the carrier a less attractive option for customers seeking a company to manage both auto and home insurance policies. If you’re looking for an insurance provider for [affordable home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/) in addition to your auto policy, you may want to look at other companies, such as Allstate or Nationwide, to see if their offers are competitive with Geico’s.

## What are real-life customers saying about Geico?

To get a better sense of how Geico policyholders feel about their provider, we looked at comments on social media, including Reddit and TikTok. As one of the nation’s largest private passenger auto insurers, with almost 12 percent of the market share, Geico receives a lot of hate online from current and former customers. But in addition to rants and complaints, we also found satisfied customers in the mix: people who’d been with Geico for years without incident and enjoyed low rates in spite of the turbulent market.

### Reddit

On Reddit, we found plenty of frustrated Geico customers, many of whom cited poor communication around insurance claims and an over-emphasis on digital tools for customer service. But for some policyholders, Geico’s digital emphasis was a benefit — and we noted that many customers reported staying with Geico for decades thanks to their low rates.

Never had an issue

"Have had GIECO for probably 30 years. Have never had an issue. My most recent claim was a rear end that totaled my car. They paid me promptly and even got my deductible back from the other insurance company. (This was in NJ). I did almost all the processing with them from their online portal - maybe talked to a person one or twice only. All insurance rates are high right now - increased in the past year or so. You can save even more if you bundle with apartment or homeowners insurance (do I sound like a commercial now)."

Geico price hikes

"I called around, and Geico still is the best price around for my car (Honda CRV). Been with Geico for 25 years. Bigger issue is their lack of human customer support & throwing people onto chat boxes and the runaround online."

### TikTok

Mentions of Geico on TikTok mainly center around various customer complaints and scandals, such as a [woman in Michigan](https://www.tiktok.com/@thecrazycreativeteacher/video/7365577373812624686?q=geico&t=1718046728679) whose Geico claim was denied due to paperwork she hadn’t filed when she moved to the state. In the comments of this video, we found plenty of outrage, some of which came from current or former Geico customers with similar experiences. However, we also found customers who hadn’t encountered any problems with Geico despite being with the company for years.

What Bankrate staffers have to say about Geico

***Shannon Martin, Geico customer for 15+ years***

* Consistently offers the lowest rate
* Fast glass claim repair
* Can easily make policy changes online or in the mobile app

“Since I have been an insurance agent for so long, I prefer to make policy updates without agent intervention. Geico’s mobile app and website made it easy for me to increase my liability limits and add a new truck to my policy. I did have to call in to put my Kia on a storage plan, but it was a fast transaction, and Geico is one of the few carriers left that will allow me to keep comprehensive coverage on my Soul.”

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
