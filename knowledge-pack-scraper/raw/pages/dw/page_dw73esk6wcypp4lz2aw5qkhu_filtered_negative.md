Geico vs Amica comparison Is Geico cheaper than Amica? Geico vs Amica: discounts Geico vs Amica: customer experience comparison Frequently asked questions Methodology
When looking at large insurance companies like Geico and Amica, it can be tough to differentiate the two. Both Geico and Amica offer robust coverage options and long lists of discounts, but Amica's policies are typically more customizable. Geico has the edge in terms of low average rates, but note that your exact premium will depend on several factors specific to you, like your driving record, age and ZIP code. Both carriers offer highly rated customer service, but Amica really stands out for its service record.

Based on our analysis of average premiums from Quadrant Information Services, Geico is generally cheaper than Amica. However, Geico’s coverage options are a bit sparse compared to Amica’s. For instance, Amica’s Platinum Choice Auto package offers credit monitoring, new car replacement on eligible vehicles and a zero-dollar deductible on glass. On the other hand, Geico doesn’t offer new car replacement, and if you want credit monitoring, you’ll have to purchase an identity theft policy. Based on this information, budget-conscious drivers may be more interested in Geico car insurance, and drivers looking for robust coverage options may find Amica especially appealing. Both companies were featured in the [2025 Bankrate awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/), with Geico earning Best Auto Insurance Company for High Risk Drivers while Amica tied with USAA for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall. Those who are interested in contacting Amica or getting a quote can do so by phone, email, direct mail or online at [amica.com](https://www.amica.com/).

Although average rates are essential when comparing [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), shoppers looking for top-of-the-line coverage may also want to research customer experience. To evaluate this metric, Bankrate’s team of insurance experts studied scores issued in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the [2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). In addition to J.D. Power scores, we looked at customer reviews for Geico and Amica’s mobile apps. In today’s digital world, many drivers may prefer to handle their policies electronically, which could mean that an easy-to-use mobile app is fundamental for a positive customer experience.

* ######  Is Geico or Amica better?
* ######  Which insurance company is best at paying claims?
Auto insurance is a heavily regulated industry, so both companies must follow state regulations regarding the claims process. However, Amica earned a score of 746 on the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study — one of the highest in the country. Geico was below average, with a score of 692. This indicates that Amica policyholders may be happier with the claims process than Geico policyholders. Keep in mind this doesn’t necessarily mean that Geico doesn’t honor claims and distributes unfair payouts, though.
