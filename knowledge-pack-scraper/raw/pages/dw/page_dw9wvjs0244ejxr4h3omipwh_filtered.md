Bankrate's take

State Farm’s underwriting guidelines do not allow new customers to have a [DUI in their driving history](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/). However, existing policyholders who meet certain criteria may continue their coverage with State Farm if they receive a DUI after the policy starts, but these cases are few and far between.

## Geico vs State Farm: discounts

When rates are similar between insurance companies, discount offerings may be the deciding factor. Comparing Geico vs. State Farm, Geico has [more potential discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) than State Farm, but there are a few State Farm has that Geico does not offer.

### Discounts available from both carriers

Geico and State Farm offer several discounts and some of them are very similar. Both offer [bundling](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/), good driver, defensive driver, and telematics discounts, but the stipulation and savings percentage can differ. Other discounts typical to most carriers are vehicle safety features, anti-theft devices and bundling discounts.

#### Geico discounts

* **New vehicle:** Drivers who insure a new car three model years or newer with Geico may save up to 15 percent on car insurance premiums.
* **Emergency deployment:** If a military insured has to deploy in an emergency to an imminent danger zone, they may be able to save up to 25 percent on car insurance by providing approved orders to Geico.
* **Federal employee:** Drivers who are current or retired federal employees may be able to save up to 12 percent on car insurance with Geico.

#### State Farm discounts

* **Accident-free:** Though both companies offer generous potential discounts, State Farm also offers an accident-free discount, which may reward you if you go three or more years without a claim for an accident.
* **Student away at school:** Drivers under the age of 25 who go away to college at least 100 miles away from their home and do not take a car with them may be eligible for this discount with State Farm.
* **Two telematics programs:** While Geico offers a telematics program, State Farm has two: [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) and Drive Safe and Save. Steer Clear is for drivers under 25 and prompts safe driving with videos and quizzes. Drive Safe and Save is for more experienced drivers who may save money based on signup and driving behavior.

### Geico and State Farm telematics programs

[Telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/), also called usage-based insurance, are a common method for insurance companies to assess your driving behavior. If you demonstrate safe driving, you may qualify for discounts. Geico's and State Farm’s telematics programs are app-based, so you only need to download the carrier's app to your smartphone. The app tracks various aspects of your driving, such as speed and braking. Opting into these programs could be beneficial, as some insurers provide notable discounts for safe driving habits — though some drivers may view these systems as invasive.

State Farm offers two telematics programs, but we chose to focus on [Drive Safe and Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/), as it's targeted to a more general audience than the young drive-focused [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) program.

### Customer complaints

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) produces a complaint index report to track the prevalence of complaints lodged against insurance companies. The index employs a baseline of 1.0. Scores below 1.0 indicate that a provider had fewer complaints than expected for its size, while a number of 1.0 means the company gets more complaints than expected.

#### Geico auto insurance customer complaints

Geico's low [NAIC complaint index](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=22063&:refresh) indicates a generally positive and consistent level of service for its private passenger coverage product. Its index rating has also decreased between 2021 and 2023, meaning the company may be making improvements in how it responds to customer issues and handles claims.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
