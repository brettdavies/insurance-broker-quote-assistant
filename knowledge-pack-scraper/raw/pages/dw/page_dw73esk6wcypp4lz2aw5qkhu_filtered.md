Our verdict

Based on our analysis of average premiums from Quadrant Information Services, Geico is generally cheaper than Amica. However, Geico’s coverage options are a bit sparse compared to Amica’s. For instance, Amica’s Platinum Choice Auto package offers credit monitoring, new car replacement on eligible vehicles and a zero-dollar deductible on glass. On the other hand, Geico doesn’t offer new car replacement, and if you want credit monitoring, you’ll have to purchase an identity theft policy. Based on this information, budget-conscious drivers may be more interested in Geico car insurance, and drivers looking for robust coverage options may find Amica especially appealing. Both companies were featured in the [2025 Bankrate awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/), with Geico earning Best Auto Insurance Company for High Risk Drivers while Amica tied with USAA for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall. Those who are interested in contacting Amica or getting a quote can do so by phone, email, direct mail or online at [amica.com](https://www.amica.com/).

## Geico vs. Amica comparison

In addition to possessing a larger portion of the market share, Geico has a slightly higher AM Best financial strength rating of A++ (Superior), compared to Amica’s A+ (Superior).

While Geico’s average rates are 18 percent less than the [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) nationwide, Amica’s are 42 percent more. Another factor to consider is that Amica holds the second highest spot in the [J.D. Power 2024 Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), while Geico ranked below average.

Bankrate's take

Across the board, Geico beats Amica in terms of cost, which is a factor for many drivers when shopping for auto coverage. Amica’s average rates are higher than Geico’s and often higher than the national average — sometimes significantly.

Drivers with poor credit or violations on their driving records may fall into the high-risk category and could find lower rates with Geico. Amica does offer coverage for high-risk drivers, but Geico can offer more competitive rates likely due to its larger risk pool.

Take note that not all insurance companies write car insurance policies for [drivers with DUIs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/). Getting in touch with an agent and disclosing your driving history is the best way to get an accurate quote.

## Geico vs. Amica: discounts

[Car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) offer their own set of [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). Depending on which you qualify for, you might find that your rate is cheaper than average. Below are some potential discounts you may want to consider when comparing Geico vs. Amica.

### Discounts available from both carriers

Many discounts are common amongst most carriers, but the potential savings and eligibility requirements can differ. Some discounts that Geico and Amica have in common are anti-theft, vehicle safety features, paid-in-full and automatic payment discounts, just to name a few. See below for discounts that are unique to each carrier.

| Geico Discounts | Amica Discounts |
| --- | --- |
| **Eagle discount:** Active and retired federal employees could save up to 12 percent on Geico car insurance. | **Homeownership discount:** If you own your home, you could save on your Amica car insurance (even if you insure your home with another company). |
| **Membership and employee discount:** Geico is affiliated with more than 500 professional groups, fraternities and sororities. If you’re a member of one of these groups (or a Geico employee), you may qualify for this discount. | **Adaptive headlights discount:** If your car comes equipped with adaptive headlights that help you see in low-light conditions, you may be eligible for a discount. |
| **Military discounts:** Both active duty and retired military policyholders, as well as members of the National Guard or Reserves, may save up to 15 percent on Geico auto insurance. | **Forward-collision warning:** You may receive a discount if your vehicle has a collision avoidance feature. |

### Geico and Amica telematics programs

Geico’s [DriveEasy program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/geico-driveeasy/) may help policyholders save money on their car insurance if they drive safely. Although this [telematics discount](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) isn’t available in every state, eligible drivers could earn a discount by downloading a mobile app and allowing the company to track their driving habits and provide driving tips. However, beware — if Geico deems you a risky driver, you could see your rates go up instead of down.

Amica recently introduced a telematics program called [StreetSmart](https://www.amica.com/content/microsites/streetsmart/faq.html#:~:text=No.,the%20premium%20discount%20you%20receive.). Drivers use a mobile app to track driving habits, as well. Good habits are rewarded with policy discounts or other rewards, including e-gift cards to popular retailers. Your rates will not increase based on tracking data, but your discount or policy rewards will vary depending on the driving behaviors you exhibit.

## Geico vs. Amica: customer experience comparison

Although average rates are essential when comparing [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), shoppers looking for top-of-the-line coverage may also want to research customer experience. To evaluate this metric, Bankrate’s team of insurance experts studied scores issued in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the [2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). In addition to J.D. Power scores, we looked at customer reviews for Geico and Amica’s mobile apps. In today’s digital world, many drivers may prefer to handle their policies electronically, which could mean that an easy-to-use mobile app is fundamental for a positive customer experience.

When using these metrics, Amica typically scores higher than Geico. According to J.D. Power, the 2024 industry average score for claims satisfaction is 697 out of 1,000 points. Geico scored slightly below the industry average at 692 out of 1,000. Meanwhile, Amica was the second highest-rated company, with a score of 746 out of 1,000.

In the Insurance Digital Experience Study, the industry average is 699 out of 1,000 for service and 535 out of 1,000 points for shopping experience. Amica outranked Geico for service experience, earning 724 compared to Geico’s 686 points. Amica also outranked Geico on the shopping portion, earning a score of 559 to Geico's score of 530.

When it comes to mobile experience, both companies earned high ratings in the App Store, but Geico’s mobile app may be more functional than Amica’s for Android users, based on Google Play ratings. Amica’s lower Google Play score could be due to payment processing issues, as reported by customer reviews.

|  | Geico | Amica |

| **Google Play** | 4.6 of 5 | 3.3 of 5 |

### Customer complaints

Learning how current customers feel about the customer service they receive can help you when deciding on which insurance company is right for you. The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) produces an annual complaint index report that can help. This report tracks the amount of complaints lodged against insurance companies each year and assigns the carrier a score. The score has a baseline of 1.00; scores below 1.00 indicate that a provider had fewer complaints than expected for a company its size.

#### Geico auto insurance customer complaints

Geico consistently has [fewer than the average](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=22063&:refresh) number of complaints filed against them over the past three years for car insurance, indicating that customers may be happy with the level of service they receive. When choosing an insurance company, a company that shows consistency may be more reliable.

#### Amica auto insurance customer complaints

Amica has traditionally had a long history of excelling at customer service, but its [NAIC index](https://www.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=12287&:refresh) reflects a shift in this trend over the last couple of years. Over the past three years, Amica has shown a growing level of complaints, with a slight increase in 2023 and a further spike in 2024 to just above the average for a company of its size. This trend indicates a significant shift from the company's 2022 complaint levels and may indicate that it is not prioritizing customer satisfaction as much as in the past.

## Frequently asked questions

* ###### Which insurance company is best at paying claims?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Auto insurance is a heavily regulated industry, so both companies must follow state regulations regarding the claims process. However, Amica earned a score of 746 on the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study —  one of the highest in the country. Geico was below average, with a score of 692. This indicates that Amica policyholders may be happier with the claims process than Geico policyholders. Keep in mind this doesn’t necessarily mean that Geico doesn’t honor claims and distributes unfair payouts, though.

* ###### Do Geico and Amica offer homeowners insurance?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Yes, both Geico and Amica offer [homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/). However, Geico doesn’t write its own homeowners policies but instead utilizes underwriting partners. In other words, Geico agents sell homeowners insurance policies that are written by companies that partner with Geico. This process can make it challenging to research Geico’s homeowners insurance product since you don’t know what insurance company your quote will be with until you contact Geico. Additionally, homeowners insurance may not be available in your state, whether you are with Geico or Amica. For instance, although both companies have a near-nationwide availability for homeowners insurance, neither offers this type of policy in [Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/florida/). For more information, it may be best to request a homeowners quote directly from the company.

* ###### Which car insurance company is the cheapest?

  On average, Auto-Owners, USAA and Geico have some of the cheapest car insurance premiums. However, rates are constantly in flux — the [cheapest company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) today may not be the cheapest company tomorrow. Furthermore, car insurance premiums are based on several [personal factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), some of which could include where you live, your credit, your driving history, your age, your gender and more. As such, no car insurance company is the cheapest for every driver. Instead, the best way to find the most affordable insurance company for you is to request quotes from multiple companies.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
