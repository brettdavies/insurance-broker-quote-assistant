## Average Car Insurance Expenditure in California by Age Bracket

It’s a fact of life: [as you age](/auto-insurance/driver/age/), your auto insurance premiums change. Typically, auto insurance is pricier for [young drivers](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) and [teens](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/), as auto insurance companies see newer drivers as less responsible. Rates are cheapest for California drivers in their 60s. Have a look at average rates by age below.

###### CALIFORNIA CAR INSURANCE RATES BY AGE

| Age | Average Yearly Premium |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | $7,175.12 |

#### Rates by age in California

In California, auto coverage costs $7,175 annually for a [16-year-old driver](/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-16-year-olds/), compared to $1,450 per year for a driver between [50 and 59 years](/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/) of age. It's worth noting, however, that a 16-year-old added to a parent's insurance plan will not be as expensive as a teenager getting their own policy.

If you're facing the pricey prospect of insuring a teen driver, it's worth noting California is the 34th cheapest state in which to purchase car insurance for a 16-year-old.

## Average Auto Insurance Costs in California by Credit Score

[Car insurance companies](/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) use credit score to get an idea of a potential customer's reliability. Data trends show drivers with good credit histories are often more dependable car insurance customers: they are less likely to file claims covered by auto insurance. However, **California outlaws the use of credit score as an insurance rating factor**, meaning you'll pay the same car insurance rate no matter your credit history.

###### CALIFORNIA AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY CREDIT SCORE

| Credit Tier | Average Annual Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Very Poor (300-579) | $1,649.21 |

| Good (670-739) | $1,649.21 |
| Very Good (740-799) | $1,649.21 |
| Exceptional (800-850) | $1,649.21 |
