Many don’t realize that the insurance industry is one of the country's most regulated business segments, especially in New York State. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYS DFS) wields significant control over the insurance business and has a stated goal of protecting consumers.

But what authority does the NYS DFS actually have?

* **Rate Approvals:**
* It’s a little-known fact that the NYS DFS reviews every company’s rate change requests. They review those requests for actuarial reasonableness, ensuring they are not excessive, inadequate, or discriminatory. The DFS review includes rates for all lines of insurance, including auto, home, business, health, and life insurance.
* **Regulatory Oversight:**
* Supervision to make sure insurance companies and their representatives comply with state laws and regulations
* **Licensing & Continuing Education:**
* The NYS DFS tightly controls the licensing process to ensure only capable and trustworthy agents and companies operate in the state. This is part of their commitment to consumer protection.
* Monitors and requires continuing education for licensed agents.
* **Policy Language Suitability.**
* Another crucial role of the NYS DFS is to ensure the suitability of policy language. Insurance companies must submit their policy forms and guidelines for approval before using them in their policies. This approval process, overseen by the DFS, prevents the use of inappropriate coverage forms that could disadvantage consumers, thereby ensuring the security of your insurance policies.
* **Consumer Protection & Education:**
* The enforcement of laws and regulations protects consumers from nefarious schemes and unfair trade practices.
* Provides a mechanism for consumers to submit complaints when there are disputes with representatives and carriers.

With recent events, some may be concerned that the insurance industry operates without much oversight. The opposite is the case. New York State has a reputation for being strongly pro-consumer and a challenging environment for insurance companies and agencies. All with the stated purpose of protecting the consumer.

The year 1962 was marked by historic events—from the Cuban Missile Crisis to the passing of Marilyn Monroe. But while the world focused on these headlines, Lee A. Ryan was working alongside his brothers on my grandparents' farm when an unexpected opportunity arose—an invitation to join the insurance business. With no prior experience, no clients, and limited resources, my dad took a leap of faith and partnered with Nationwide Insurance to start an agency from scratch. Operating out of his home on Karr Valley Road in Almond, NY, he built his business one relationship at a time (some of whom are still clients!), laying the foundation for what would become a lasting legacy.

Most property insurance companies offer Actual Cash Value or Replacement Cost settlement options. Typically, insurance companies will require that you insure the property to the settlement value you choose. If you select Actual Cash Value, the amount you may be required to insure the property for will be less than the corresponding Replacement Value.
