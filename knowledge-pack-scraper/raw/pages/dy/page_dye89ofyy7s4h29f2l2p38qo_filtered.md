## Progressive Auto Insurance Cost

Progressive’s car insurance rates vary depending on age and gender. Younger drivers­, 18-year-olds especially, pay the highest rates — $358 annually for females and $400 for males — because they’re more likely to be involved in car crashes, according to the province.

By age 30, rates drop sharply, with women paying about $69 and men $72, reflecting more driving experience and lower risk. The trend continues into middle age, where rates stabilize around the mid-$50s, before settling closer to $50 in the 60s.

#### If you’re filing a claim with Progressive, use the app or online portal—it speeds up scheduling your inspection and gets your payout process started right away.

Michelle Robbins
**Licensed Insurance Agent**

With a $56 minimum rate for coverage and a $150 rate for full coverage, Progressive falls somewhere in the middle of the range of quotes we received, making it a more affordable option than Allstate, Farmers, and [Liberty Mutual auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/liberty-mutual/), but still more expensive than Geico and Erie. This balance helps make Progressive a good pick for those who want low prices without cutting back on protection.

### Progressive Rates by Credit Score

When it comes to how your credit score affects your car insurance rate, Progressive lands around the middle of the pack. Drivers with good credit can expect to pay about $155 per month with Progressive, which is slightly more than Geico at $137 or Erie at $140, but less than Liberty Mutual at $165.

**Progressive Auto Insurance Monthly Rates vs. Top Competitors by Credit Score**

If your credit falls to “fair,” Progressive’s average rate rises to $181—more than American Family and [Erie Insurance](https://www.quote.com/companies/erie-insurance-review/) but less than Liberty Mutual and Allstate. With poor credit, it increases to $267, which is lower than Liberty Mutual’s $285 and Allstate’s $278, though still above Geico and Erie.

![Credit Score Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Credit Score Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review")![Credit Score Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review](https://www.quote.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Credit-Score.png "Credit Score Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review")

The table makes it clear that while Progressive isn’t always the cheapest, it remains competitive, especially for drivers with decent or improving credit. It’s a solid middle-ground option—not the lowest, not the highest—with pricing that reflects a balance of value and risk in how Progressive evaluates your credit profile.

### Progressive Rates by Driving Record

These tables show how strongly your driving record impacts what you’ll pay with Progressive, and how it stacks up against other major insurers. With a clean record, Progressive’s full coverage average of $150 per month puts it in the middle of the pack—cheaper than Allstate at $228 and Liberty Mutual at $248, but higher than Erie at just $83 or Geico at $114.

**Progressive Auto Insurance Monthly Rates by Driving Record & Coverage Level**

| Driving Record | Minimum Coverage | Full Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |

Once a ticket or accident is on your record, Progressive’s rates climb to $199 and $265, but the increases aren’t as punishing as what you’d see with [Allstate Insurance](https://www.quote.com/companies/allstate-auto-insurance-review/) or Liberty Mutual, where prices jump well above $300.

Even in more serious cases, like a DUI, Progressive averages $200 per month, which is far lower than Allstate at $385 or Geico at $309, making it one of the more forgiving options for high-risk drivers.

![Driving Record Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Driving Record Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review")![Driving Record Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review](https://www.quote.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Driving-Record.png "Driving Record Definition Card: Progressive Auto Insurance Review")

This balance indicates that Progressive may not consistently offer the absolute lowest prices, but it offers a fairer system of rate increases after mistakes on the road, providing less-than-perfect drivers a bit more breathing room compared to other insurers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Progressive Insurance rate drivers for their policies?

Progressive rates drivers using a mix of factors, including age, location, vehicle type, driving record, and coverage level. It also incorporates data from programs like Snapshot, which monitors your real-time driving behavior to influence pricing. Safer drivers typically earn lower rates, while frequent hard braking, speeding, or nighttime driving may push rates higher over time.

### How does Progressive Snapshot work, and what data does it track?

Snapshot is a telematics program that tracks how, when, and how much you drive. It records things like acceleration, braking, mileage, and the time of day you’re on the road. After a few weeks or months, Progressive uses this data to adjust your rate. Safe drivers can earn up to a 30% discount, while risky driving may cause a rate increase, especially after the monitoring period.

### Why is Progressive so cheap compared to other auto insurance companies?

Progressive often appears cheaper because of its aggressive pricing strategy, wide range of discounts, and usage-based programs like Snapshot. It’s frequently listed among the options for the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/cheap/), thanks to tools like the Name Your Price Tool that tailor coverage to your budget. Just keep in mind—cheaper rates may reflect higher deductibles or reduced coverage limits unless adjusted manually.

### How do I get an A+ on Progressive Snapshot and earn the biggest discount?

To maximize your Snapshot savings, avoid hard braking, rapid acceleration, and late-night driving (especially between midnight and 4 a.m.). Consistently driving during daylight hours, sticking to speed limits, and limiting total mileage each week can boost your discount. Drivers who maintain this pattern for the full monitoring period typically qualify for a 15% to 30% reduction on their renewal rate.

### Is Progressive good insurance for everyday drivers?

Progressive is a good fit for drivers who value digital access, flexible coverage, and plenty of discount opportunities. It’s especially well-suited for tech-savvy drivers who prefer to manage everything online. While service reviews can vary by region, most users appreciate the Snapshot program, easy policy adjustments, and competitive pricing compared to similar providers.

### How is Progressive with claims service and payout timelines?

Progressive has a streamlined process for [how to file an auto insurance claim](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/file-claims-that-win/), with most minor claims handled in a few days through its app or website. For simple fender benders, payouts often arrive within 7 days. Larger claims may take weeks, depending on documents and third-party delays. Reviews show faster results through concierge claims centers or preferred shops.

### How does the Name Your Price Tool from Progressive actually work?

The Name Your Price Tool helps you build a policy around your budget. You enter your monthly or annual price target, and Progressive adjusts the coverage options—raising deductibles, lowering limits, or removing optional add-ons—to meet that number. It doesn’t guarantee full protection, but it does make it easier to find affordable plans without starting from scratch.

### What is personal protection insurance from Progressive?

Personal Protection Insurance (PIP), also known as no-fault insurance, is offered by Progressive in states that require it. It helps cover medical expenses, lost wages, and sometimes essential services (like childcare) after an accident—regardless of who caused it. In PIP states, this coverage is often mandatory and can be a critical buffer if health insurance has high deductibles or limits.

### How long does it take to add a new car to your insurance policy with Progressive?

Progressive gives you 30 days from the date of purchase to add a new vehicle to your policy. During that time, your existing coverage (including liability and, in some cases, full coverage) automatically extends to the new car. However, if your current policy doesn’t include collision or [comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) coverage, the new vehicle won’t be covered for damage until it’s officially added.

### How much does Progressive insurance cost on average per month?

Progressive’s monthly auto insurance rates vary widely, but recent data shows an average of $105 per month for full coverage. Minimum coverage can drop closer to $56 per month, depending on your state, age, and driving record. Your final rate may be higher or lower depending on vehicle type, location, and eligibility for discounts.

Enter your ZIP code into our [free quote tool](#mdabottom) to find the best auto insurance providers for your needs and budget.

### How much is Progressive roadside assistance without adding it to my policy?

If you don’t add Progressive roadside assistance to your policy, you’ll need to pay out of pocket for each service. Costs can range from $75 to $150 per incident, depending on the service and your location, comparable to calling a local towing company directly. Adding the coverage costs about $10 to $20 per year and covers towing, flat tire changes, jump-starts, and lockout services.

### How do I cancel insurance with Progressive without a penalty?

To cancel your Progressive policy, call customer service or log in online. There’s usually no cancellation fee, unless your state permits one, often around $50 or 10% of your remaining premium.
