##  What Is Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)?
Mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is a type of mortgage insurance that is required of homeowners who take out loans backed by the [Federal Housing Administration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp) (FHA). Unlike conventional loans, which typically only require private mortgage insurance (PMI) if a home down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price, all FHA loans require MIP.
* Mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is paid by homeowners who take out loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
##  Understanding Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)
FHA mortgages require every borrower to have mortgage insurance.1 Conversely, [conventional loans](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/082616/whats-difference-between-fha-and-conventional-loans.asp) only need [private mortgage insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-insurance.asp) (PMI) policies if the down payment amount is less than 20% of the property's purchase price. Each FHA loan requires both an upfront premium of 1.75% of the loan amount and an annual premium of 0.15% to 0.75%.4 Payment of upfront premiums is at the loan issuance. Determination of the exact yearly cost comes from the loan term, amount borrowed, and [loan-to-value ratio (LTV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp).
###  Canceling Qualified Mortgage Insurance
* **For FHA loans originated between Dec. 31, 2000, and June 3, 2013**: If you have paid off at least 78% of the loan-to-value amount, you may ask the lender to cancel the MIP.6
* **For loans originated after June 3, 2013**: If you made a down payment of less than 10% of the home's value at loan origination, you must pay the MIP for the life of the loan.7 The only way to remove the qualified mortgage insurance (MIP) on an FHA loan is to [refinance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp) it into a non-FHA product.
###  Tax Implications of Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premiums
Your lender is required to send [Form 1098](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form_1098.asp) Mortgage Interest Statement to both you and the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS). This form lists your mortgage payments over the past year and can affect your [income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp). The total MIP or PMI premiums will be in box 5 of the form. If you are filing a return for tax years 2018, 2019, or 2020 and wish to claim a deduction for these premiums, you must itemize your deductions using Schedule A under the interest paid section.
