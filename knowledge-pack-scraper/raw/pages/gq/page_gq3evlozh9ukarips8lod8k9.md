# GEICO car insurance review 2025: 3.1 out of 5 stars
[C ](https://finance.yahoo.com/author/catherine-brock)

##  **GEICO rating:** 3.1 out of 5 stars
##  **Best for:** Discounts
GEICO offers a good range of coverage types, but lacks options like new car replacement and a diminishing deductible program. The company does receive a fair amount of negative commentary on review sites and scores below average on some J.D. Power satisfaction surveys, but it maintains a lower-than-average complaint rating with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
GEICO has a top-rated mobile app and maintains high credit ratings, which indicate financial strength. GEICO’s premiums are on the high side of average, but the company offers an ample selection of discounts for drivers and households to help reduce costs.

### Does GEICO offer accident forgiveness?
Yes. Known as “claim forgiveness,” GEICO allows customers to purchase this protection, but only in some states. When you have claim forgiveness, GEICO waives the surcharge normally applied after your first qualifying claim, so your rates won’t increase. The protection is limited to one claim per policy, no matter how many drivers are covered.
Drivers can purchase or earn GEICO’s claim forgiveness protection. Those who earn the coverage free of charge receive it as a loyalty reward for being a good driver and remaining with GEICO over time. Once the claim waiver is used, GEICO automatically removes the coverage and any associated premium from the policy.

### Does GEICO auto insurance include emergency roadside assistance?
GEICO offers emergency roadside service coverage for cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, and RVs. The program includes limited towing and winching, battery jump starts, tire changes if you provide the spare, limited lockout services, and fuel delivery.
Drivers can request roadside service by calling, going online, or using the GEICO mobile app. GEICO says service providers usually arrive to help within 60 minutes. Covered services are provided free of charge. Drivers can also pay for roadside services directly and submit a claim for reimbursement.

## How much does GEICO auto insurance cost?
GEICO's average annual auto insurance costs range from $1,440 for basic coverage to $2,424 for full coverage.
Basic coverage only satisfies the state’s minimum requirements. In most states, these minimums ensure you can pay for damages and injuries you cause. But basic coverage can leave you without protection for damage to your own car and insufficient protection for serious accidents. When financially possible, Yahoo Finance recommends increasing coverage beyond state-required minimums for increased financial protection.

### Average auto insurance costs for full coverage
A typical monthly premium for GEICO full coverage is $202, while the average cost across 19 major insurance companies is $190.
### Average auto insurance costs for liability-only coverage
The average cost of basic coverage with GEICO is 6.2% higher than average compared to other auto insurers. A typical monthly premium for GEICO basic coverage is $120, while the average cost of basic coverage across 19 major insurers is $113.

## How to file a claim with GEICO
You can file claims with GEICO by phone, online, or through the GEICO mobile app. Follow the steps below for an efficient claims experience.
  1. **Know your coverage and deductibles.** Depending on the type of coverage you have and your deductibles, it may not be helpful to file a claim. For example, if you don’t have collision insurance, GEICO won’t pay to repair your vehicle after you hit a mailbox. Consider keeping a copy of your policy declarations page in your car’s glovebox for quick reference.
  2. **Gather documents and evidence.** Collect basic accident information before notifying GEICO of the potential claim. You will at least need the accident date, location, and contact and insurance information for other drivers involved.
  3. **Contact your insurance company.** You can contact GEICO immediately from the accident scene — after verifying that anyone who needs medical attention is getting it. Your GEICO contact may have recommendations for additional information to gather at the scene, such as photographs and witness contact information. Do not discuss the accident details with the other driver or the other driver’s insurance company.
  4. **Respond to information requests.** While your claim is being processed, your GEICO adjuster may reach out with additional questions or information. Respond promptly to requests. It is helpful to keep a communication log, where you document conversations and important information.
  5. **Get your car repaired or receive your payment.** Your adjuster will direct you on next steps for getting your car repaired or receiving a reimbursement. Note that GEICO allows you to choose your own repair shop, but you can also opt to use a GEICO partner shop. GEICO offers a lifetime guarantee on work done by [Auto Repair Xpress](https://www.geico.com/claims/autorepair/) locations.

## Methodology
We researched the coverage details and prices for 13 auto insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each auto insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best auto insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated.
**Coverage types: 20% of score.** We examined all the coverage options available and assessed whether each insurer offered the following: new car replacement (5%), GAP insurance (5%), accident forgiveness (5%), and diminishing deductible (5%).
**Average cost: 40% of score.** The average cost was generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points and includes more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. These estimates are for policies with full coverage for the average policyholder who owns one car. Average policyholder here is defined as a 48-year-old driver, driving a 13-year-old car, in an average-income ZIP code with full coverage.
**Customer satisfaction: 30% of score.** We factored in information from three major sources: 1) National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaints (10%), in which we took the total number of complaints each company had over a three-year period (2022-2024), 2) CRASH scores (10%) from the Crash Network which share how well each company ensures quality repairs and customer service, and 3) J.D. Power scores (10%) from the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the U.S. Auto Insurance Study.
**Discounts: 10% of score.** We gave points for each type of discount that each auto insurer offers.
All app ratings were accurate at the time of publication.
