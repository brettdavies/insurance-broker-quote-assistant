[ Compliance  ](https://saifr.ai/blog/tag/compliance)
In my [last blog](https://saifr.ai/blog/general-compliance-requirements-for-insurance-advertising), I provided a general overview of state regulation of insurance product advertising. With that blog post as background, let’s consider additional regulatory requirements that specifically impact advertising life insurance policies and annuity contracts.
* For example, a term life insurance policy may be sold under the marketing name of “New Family Protection.” The advertisement can use the marketing name if it is augmented by “term life insurance” to read: “New Family Protection Term Life Insurance Policy” in the first section or title of the advertisement. Thereafter in the ad, it can use the marketing name by itself.
* Similarly, an annuity may be sold under the name “Retirement Growth,” but the advertisement must first refer to this as “Retirement Growth Annuity.”
* The specified terms include “investment,” “investment plan,” “deposit,” “expansion plan,” “profit,” “profit sharing,” “interest plan,” “savings,” “savings plan,” “private pension plan,” “retirement plan.” In addition, some state regulations have additional trigger words.
* The ratings can help consumers understand the financial strength of the insurance company. Since the guarantees for payment of life insurance death benefits or annuity values are based primarily on the financial strength of the insurance company, the ratings are a significant measure for consumers. There is no requirement that the ratings be included in an advertisement; but if ratings are mentioned, the NAIC Model and state regulations require that the following minimum information be provided:
It is the obligation of the insurer issuing an advertisement to comply with these regulations. In addition, an insurer is also responsible for any advertisement, even one created by a producer or agent, that mentions the insurer’s products.
