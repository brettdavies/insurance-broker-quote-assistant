# How to test a smoke detector

[Home](/home/)

3 min read

A working smoke detector can help keep you and your family safe, but a malfunctioning one may have devastating consequences. To prevent house fires, it's important to regularly test your smoke detectors to ensure they're working properly. Learn how to test a smoke detector, how often you should do it, and when to replace it.

## Why is it essential to test smoke detectors?

Smoke detectors are a vital safety device that helps alert your family to smoke and fire. But smoke detectors can wear out over time, batteries die, and devices malfunction. Testing the smoke detectors in your home assures you that they're working as they should to protect you and your family.

## Tips for testing smoke detectors

It's essential to test your smoke detectors to ensure they are working properly. To test a smoke detector:

1. Press the test button on the unit to activate it.
2. Press the button again to turn it off if it sounds its alarm properly.
3. If it doesn't, you may need to replace it, depending on the type you have.

If you have a hardwired smoke detector or a unit with a sealed ten-year lithium-ion battery that doesn't work, replace the entire unit. If you have a smoke alarm with replaceable batteries, change them and re-test it. If it still doesn't work, replace it immediately. Consider replacing it with a smoke alarm with lithium-ion batteries or a smart smoke detector.

## How do you know if a smoke detector is bad?

If you have tested a smoke alarm, it may be malfunctioning if it:

* Doesn't make a sound
* Makes chirping or beeping sounds
* Has a flashing light
* Goes off unexpectedly
* Is the subject of a safety recall

## How often should I check my smoke alarms?

How often you test a smoke alarm depends on whether it is a hardwired smoke detector or has batteries.

### Hardwired smoke detectors

If your smoke detectors are hardwired into your home's electrical system or have sealed ten-year lithium-ion batteries, you should **check them twice a year**. Try testing them in the spring and fall when you turn the clocks forward and backward or as a part of seasonal home maintenance.

### Battery powered smoke detectors

Check smoke detectors with replaceable batteries (e.g., 9-volt, "AA," etc.) quarterly and **replacing the batteries twice a year** whether they're good or not. Lithium battery smoke detectors are preferred over detectors with replaceable batteries.

## How often should you replace smoke detectors?

Most hardwired smoke detectors and units with a **sealed ten-year lithium-ion battery have a lifespan of ten years**. After that, you should replace smoke detectors even if they still work during your smoke alarm testing. If it shows signs of malfunctioning before the ten-year mark, replace it, no matter how old. Smoke detectors that use replaceable batteries may have a shorter lifecycle. No matter what type, check the manufacturer's instructions for details about when to replace it.
