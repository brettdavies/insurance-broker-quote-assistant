![Best Good Student Auto Insurance Discounts: Good Student Auto Insurance Discount Definition Card](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Best Good Student Auto Insurance Discounts: Good Student Auto Insurance Discount Definition Card")![Best Good Student Auto Insurance Discounts: Good Student Auto Insurance Discount Definition Card](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Good-Student-Auto-Insurance-Discount-2.png "Best Good Student Auto Insurance Discounts: Good Student Auto Insurance Discount Definition Card")

Below, we’ll explain the eligibility requirements for the car insurance student discount and show you how much you could save from providers that offer discounts for good grades.

### Get Good Grades in School

Before applying for a good student discount, it’s important to ensure that your grades are good enough to qualify. Generally, most [auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-is-auto-insurance/) companies want your GPA to be a 3.0 or higher to qualify for a good student discount.

* Must be a full-time high school or college student
* Must be between the ages of 16 and 25
* In the upper 20% of their class

These requirements explain how to qualify for a good student discount on car insurance at most of the top auto insurance companies. If you don’t meet them, you may be unable to get a good student discount. So, ensure you have the right GPA for a good student discount on car insurance.

### Provide Proof of Good Grades

If you meet the GPA requirements for a good student discount and your insurer offers one, submit proof of your grades to your company. This proof could be in the form of standardized test scores, school transcripts, report cards, or whatever documentation your insurance company requires.
