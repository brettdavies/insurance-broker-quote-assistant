You can typically get larger discounts for  centrally monitored security systems. When it comes to a home insurance discount, you're often better off installing traditional alarm systems than smart systems.

**[Adjust your home insurance coverage.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need "How Much Homeowners Insurance Do I Need?")** The coverage limits and types you choose can have a big impact on how much you pay for home insurance. Review your current coverage to make sure you actually need everything you're paying for.
For example, [replacement cost coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs Replacement Cost in Home Insurance") for your personal belongings can be very expensive. That's because it pays to replace your damaged belongings with brand-new items. But, if you don't mind buying used or inexpensive furniture, then this coverage may not be worth it.
**You can also consider lowering your[home insurance deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "How Do Homeowners Insurance Deductibles Work?").** A lower deductible means the insurance company pays you less to fix your home. That's why it typically results in a lower home insurance quote. However, make sure you choose a deductible you can easily pay in an emergency situation.

**[Bundle your home and car insurance policies with one company.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles")** This is typically the largest home insurance discount you can get.
For example, [State Farm customers typically save around 24%](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle#statefarm "Best overall bundle: State Farm") on their home and auto insurance bill when they buy both policies from the company.

**[Consider a home renovation project.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/home-renovation-insurance-savings "Can Renovating Your House Lower Your Insurance Costs?")** Insurance companies may lower your rates or give you a discount if you make updates to your home that make it more safe.

Yes, [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review: Auto, Home and Renters") offers a home security discount to homeowners who have smoke, fire or burglar alarms or have a home monitoring system.
Annual home insurance savings are based on the [average cost of home insurance across the U.S.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance "Average Cost of Homeowners Insurance") To find the average cost of home insurance, ValuePenguin collected quotes from top insurance companies across all 50 states. Your own savings may differ depending on the location of your home, the materials used to build it and your insurance history. Discounts from insurance companies may also fluctuate based on these factors.
