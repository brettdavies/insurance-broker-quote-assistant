## Which Progressive car insurance coverage provides windshield replacement?

While most states require drivers to carry liability coverage, it only offers property damage and bodily injury coverage. However, damages to you and your vehicle are not covered.

Collision covers damages to your vehicle from an accident. Damages include a broken windshield or broken windows from hitting another vehicle or object like a fence or tree. (For more information, read our “[Is a broken side mirror covered by car insurance?](https://www.CarInsurance.org/does-auto-insurance-cover-broken-side-mirror/)“).

[Comprehensive insurance coverage](https://www.carinsurance.org/types-of-car-insurance-coverage/) pays for damages to your vehicle unrelated to an accident. This includes fire, theft, vandalism, falling debris such as a tree limb, or acts of nature, including floods, hail, and tornados.

So, if an accident damages your windshield, collision coverage pays. However, if hail damages your windshield, comprehensive coverage pays.

[Full coverage insurance](https://www.carinsurance.org/types-of-car-insurance-coverage/) combines liability, collision, and comprehensive to protect others as well as you and your vehicle. Although most states only require liability coverage, experts recommend full coverage for better protection.

This table shows the average Progressive car insurance rates based on coverage type. Although full coverage rates are higher, more significant coverage is offered.

**Progressive Average Car Insurance Rates Based on Coverage Type**

| Type of Coverage | Annual Rates | Monthly Rates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low Coverage | $3,737.13 | $311.43 |
| Medium Coverage | $4,018.46 | $334.87 |
| High Coverage | $4,350.96 | $362.58 |

Progressive full coverage car insurance is around $50 a month higher than liability-only coverage. However, full coverage pays for damages to your vehicle from accidents, vandalism, acts of nature, and more.

## How do you file a Progressive windshield claim?

To file a Progressive claim, log into your account online, use the Progressive app, or call 1-800-776-4737. Progressive completes most glass claims within 48 hours.

Although Progressive recommends Safelite for windshield repairs or replacement, drivers can use any glass repair service they wish.

Windshield repairs usually take around 30 minutes and are completed at your home or work. However, you must take your vehicle to a repair facility for windshield replacement.

It’s important to file your claim quickly before damages to your windshield increase. A crack in your windshield makes the glass vulnerable to more significant breaks.

Not only can this cause windshield replacement instead of repairs, but you are also less protected in an accident.

If your windshield damage is significant, park in a covered area such as a garage, and use a tarp or plastic to protect the inside of your vehicle until repaired.

Remember, your car insurance rates may increase from [filing a car insurance claim](https://www.carinsurance.org/filing-a-car-insurance-claim-after-an-accident/ "filing a car insurance claim"). Find out from Progressive if your rates will change.

## What are the state laws regarding windshield repairs and replacement?

Your state laws also determine costs related to windshield repairs and replacement. According to [CarWindshields.Info](https://www.carwindshields.info/states), each state has windshield and window repair and replacement laws.

For example, Florida, Kentucky, and South Carolina require car insurance companies to provide free windshield replacement and repairs. In fact, insurance companies in Florida and South Carolina must repair or replace all windows at no cost, not just the windshield.

Additionally, car insurance companies in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York must offer $0 deductible glass coverage.

Drivers in other states are charged their deductibles for windshield replacement with Progressive. However, there is usually no charge for windshield repairs.
