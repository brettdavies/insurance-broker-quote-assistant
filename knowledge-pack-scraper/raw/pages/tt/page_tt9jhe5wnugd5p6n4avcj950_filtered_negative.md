“The rate filing for Florida Peninsula is currently still pending,” OIR press secretary Shiloh Elliott said in an email to _WESH 2 Investigates._ “The proposed effective date for the rate decrease is 10/31/2025, however that is contingent upon a thorough review by the OIR. It is important to note that not all impacted consumers will see the rate change at the same time; consumers can expect to see their rates impacted upon their policy’s renewal. Consumers should engage in conversation with their agent to determine when that is and what they can expect on their next billing cycle, should the filing be approved. “
