### Need more coverage?

If you and your broker are unable to secure a policy from another company, your broker can help you find a Difference in Conditions policy which offers additional coverages to provide the equivalent of comprehensive homeowners insurance. You may wish to ask your broker about Flood and Earthquake insurance to see if they’re right for you.

##### HOW IT WORKS

## Applying for a Policy

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.cfpnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/iStock-1188261463.jpg)

###### **01** Find a Broker

Insurance agents and brokers may have access to property insurers other than the FAIR Plan. If they cannot find you insurance through another insurance company, they can assist you in applying for a policy through the FAIR Plan. There is no additional cost for having an insurance broker.

###### **02** Determine Your Eligibility

Your broker will perform a diligent search for comprehensive coverage in the traditional marketplace to determine if the FAIR Plan is right for you. If coverage is available in the traditional marketplace, the FAIR Plan is not right for you.

###### **03** Find the Right Coverage

The FAIR Plan’s policies are tailored to provide coverage for basic fire insurance. Work with a broker to learn if a FAIR Plan policy, along with optional supplemental coverage, fits your needs.

## Do I need a FAIR Plan Policy?

The FAIR Plan is an insurer of last resort. If you cannot obtain coverage in the traditional insurance market, the FAIR Plan may be a temporary solution.

## What is the FAIR Plan?

The FAIR Plan was established so that all California property owners have access to basic fire insurance when access to coverage in the traditional market is not available through no fault of the property owner.
