# What is renters insurance?

Renters insurance may cover personal belongings damaged from a covered peril plus additional living expenses, like groceries and lodging, if you're unable to live at your residence while it's being repaired because of a covered loss. Your renters policy also includes personal liability coverage if you're legally responsible for someone else's injuries or damages. Renters insurance won't cover the actual structure you live in — that's your landlord's responsibility.
