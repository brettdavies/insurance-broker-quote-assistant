We switched from Geico to State Farm years ago, not only did our rate go down but 2 of our sons had accidents within a couple of months and we filed claims on both and saw no rise in rates.

I had AllState for 5 years, my premiums just went up and up every 6 months. No accidents in the 12 years I've been driving, not even a speeding ticket, still came out to almost $200/month for just me before i canceled. I dropped them for State Farm recently for $114/month with the exact same coverage and half the deductibles I had with Allstate, and the renewal saw my rate go down to $106/month on a financed 2023 Corolla.
Might not be the same situation for you, but you should be shopping around every couple of years apparently.

I went from Geico to All State and had my rate drop over 50% for better coverage.
Geico “can’t” change anything, but you can.

See I had the opposite problem, started with State Farm but they never stayed true to the price I was quoted. Every month it’d be $25-50 over the quote, I would call and ask why, and they’d say they’re were policies added that I didn’t need or ask about. After maybe 3 months of that I switched to GEICO and haven’t had a problem since. Maybe $5-10 fluctuation but nothing crazy.

Lucky! I had a small 2k claim on State farm and they increased it by 2x. Switched to progressive 13 years ago and it just goes down in price throughout the years.

Insurance companies love finding ways to say it’s not their problem no matter how obvious it seems.

Dude my old car insurance tried to hike mine from 320 (3 cars, 3 drivers) a month to 900 something. No tickets, not claim's. They did the whole oh that's just how it is. After having them for 20+ years. I ended up switching, about 2 years ago. Now we have 4 cars, 4 drivers and pay 550 a month.
When I switched my old insurance company still tried to pull the next month. I called the old insurance company, they said I wasn't cancel. When infact my new insurance made sure they were aware with whatever disclosure they had me send. Plus had to sign on for the old place once they got the disclosures from the new place.

Not defending insurance companies but, the tariffs have impacted every part of our autos making parts harder to get and with a higher cost. We, the consumer are paying for the tariffs.

Well then, Fuck trump and fuck GEICO too. They can raise it on offenders and new drivers. This goes against the previously well established models, being a good driver, use to mean rates stay steady.

There are a lot of factors that are contributing to this but I havent seen anyone mention data brokers, like LexisNexis. They buy your driving data (that most cars nowadays collect) from your car's manufacterer and and create a driving score for you. They combine this with your credit and insurance history to calculate a different score for you. They then sell these scores to insurance companies.
These scores are always changing, as your car is constantly saving and sending hundreds-thousands of events. For example, take a call on bluetooth while driving? Negative point. Adjust climate anytime the car isnt in park? Negative point. Brake hard or accelerate too quickly? Negative points. These are just a few examples of the massive amount of info that car manufacterers save and sell, for profit. Not all do it, but you should be aware its happening. Btw, you can request your report from LexisNexis for free. Good luck!

I was with my insurance agent from the time I was 16 till I was 30, never had an accident or pulled over, never any claims. Suddenly my yearly went up by 200$. She acted surprised when I switched. Same thing happened to my dad with the same agent, nearly 30 years with the same agent and had to switch.

Been with GEICO for 10 years and I never made a claim. My car insurance payments jumped up from $89 to $187 when I bought a 2014 used car to replace my 2010 beater last year. I stupidly stuck with it and out of nowhere they’re jacking my rates again to $210/mo. this December, so I switched to Progressive. $104/mo. for MORE coverage than I had with GEICO. Never hesitate to drop a company if they’re no longer in your best interest.

my issue is with having a SR22 on your profile. puts you as a high risk driver and premiums are higher... adversely, after removing the SR22 from profile, insurance premiums remain the same. wtf?!

The answer to your question is their cost is significantly more. The cost to repair a car has gone up and the average cost of a personal injury case has gone up, not that you drive 25% more.

I just switched from Progressive paying $134/month to GEICO to get $75/month. But I predict I’ll have to make a switch again within 5 years. They all just do this thing where they raise the rates slowly over time and punish your loyalty.

Companies are so used to the boomer mentally. "That's just how things are" "if you stay in the same company you can work up the latter blah blah"
I got a bigger salary jump from job hopping 3 times in 1 year than my mom got for staying loyal to her company of 7-8 years.

The ZeroCovidCommunity is a place where people who are passionate about reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 / Covid-19 and protecting those who are at high risk can come together with a shared vision for the future. We are here to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, share info, and support one another. Individual mitigations can be a forced response to a lack of systemic solutions, but it is the latter that should be the main subject of activism. Engineering is better than hate.
