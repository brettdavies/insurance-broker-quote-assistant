#  Tucson homeowners - curious what you pay for home insurance?
*edit: About 8 years ago, something extremely traumatic happened to me and i forgot to renew my home insurances on 2 paid off houses. I just said "eff" it until now. I know, it's stupid having no insurance; i didn't need it in those 8 years. i'm going to get policies again soon. I figure i saved maybe $10k to $12k in insurance premiums thus far.

$562 through State Farm. 1972 built, 1400 sq ft. coverage of: $210k house, $21k shop, $160k personal property, $63k loss of use. $100k liability, with a $1k deductible. A bunch of other stuff I don't understand (and not made a claim in the 28 years we have lived here). It doubled compared to last year.

Answers are all over the place. That's because the insurance rate is different depending on when the house was built, what kind of roof you have, what kind of security or sprinkler system you have, and of course your policy terms and insurance company. It's difficult to compare apples to apples here.
You will probably also get dinged for lapsed insurance, if not outright refused coverage. You will be paying more than others with similar houses, so this question will not likely be all that illuminating.
All you can really do is start contacting agencies and see what your personal picture is.

Just got renewal bill. Only went up $76. It goes up every year, but it's a lot less of an increase than last year!
$1482 through Geico (Homesite Insurance). Market valuation $410k. Built 1995, 2240 sq ft. coverage of: $369k house, $36k other structures, $184k personal property, $110k loss of use. $100k liability, with a $1k deductible.
I had 3 cars and a motorcycle with them which gave me a discount. But found I was paying them almost $500 on a 6 mo policy. Got the same coverage from Progressive for $260 for a 6 month policy! Switched my cars to Progressive, but left the motorcycle with them ($65 a yr and I still get the same discount for an auto policy with them. lol)
Discounts do help a lot. -$165 for an auto/motorcycle policy with them. -$50 Responsible motorist. -$176 for "Roof it over discount" (reroofed the house 2 yrs ago) The new shingles are pretty much impervious to hail, and wind rated up to 100mph so not having a 25 yr old roof was worth it.
Did shop around last year, but others all came in higher.

I have USAA, so $150/mo with a $500 deductible, I get a bundle discount so it's a rough estimate.
