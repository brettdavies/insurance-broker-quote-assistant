# Tucson homeowners - curious what you pay for home insurance?

Just curious what people pay for their home insurance plus the square footage (and/or current value of your house).

\*edit: About 8 years ago, something extremely traumatic happened to me and i forgot to renew my home insurances on 2 paid off houses. I just said "eff" it until now. I know, it's stupid having no insurance; i didn't need it in those 8 years. i'm going to get policies again soon. I figure i saved maybe $10k to $12k in insurance premiums thus far.
