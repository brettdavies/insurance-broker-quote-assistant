In addition to the coverage above, Allstate also includes [replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance) for your personal belongings in its default policies. With this type of insurance, you’ll receive enough of a claim payout to buy new replacements for items that are stolen or destroyed. To save money, you can choose [actual cash value coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value) instead. With that option, Allstate will reduce your claim payout for older items that have lost value over time.

### Optional Allstate home insurance coverage

In addition to standard elements of a homeowners policy, Allstate offers various optional add-ons for those seeking extra coverage. Depending on where you live, they may include:

[**Identity theft restoration**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance), which pays legal fees and other costs if someone steals your identity.

[**Water backup coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage) for damage caused by a backed-up drain or failed sump pump.

**Increased coverage for valuable items** like sports equipment, musical instruments, [jewelry](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/jewelry-insurance) or antiques. You may need to get an appraisal from a jeweler or other expert.

**Business property coverage**, which offers higher limits for business-related items stored in your home.

**Green improvement reimbursement**, which pays to replace damaged items with energy-efficient versions after a covered claim.

**Yard and garden coverage**, which raises your limits on items like trees, plants and lawn mowers.

**Electronic data recovery coverage** to pay for lost photos, videos or other files on your personal computer.

**HostAdvantage**, designed for those who temporarily rent out their homes through Airbnb or similar services. This home-sharing insurance pays out if renters destroy or steal your personal property.

[**Ordinance or law coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/ordinance-or-law-coverage), which pays to bring your home up to current building codes during covered repairs.

[**Extended replacement cost coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost) for the structure of your home, in case it costs more than expected to rebuild after a disaster.

[**Service line coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/service-line-coverage) to pay for damage to water, sewer or other lines that connect your home to public utilities.

You can also upgrade your policy with the Enhanced Package, which includes three benefits. The Deductible Rewards feature takes $100 off your deductible as soon as you sign up, plus an additional $100 off for each year you go claim-free, up to a total of $500. You’ll also get 5% off your annual renewal rate if you didn’t file a claim in the previous year. And if you do file a claim, your rates won’t go up.

You must add the Enhanced Package within 60 days of buying the policy to get all the benefits.

### What's not covered

Standard Allstate homeowners insurance policies don’t cover damage due to:

* Flooding.
* [Earthquakes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance).

## More Nerdy Perspective

When comparing quotes, look carefully at each coverage package. For example, one company’s rate may be cheaper than another because it has lower coverage limits or fewer extras. Check the deductibles, too — a higher one can save you money, but it means you’ll pay more if you ever have to make a claim. Finally, make sure you understand how each company will cover your roof. Some insurers offer actual cash value coverage for older roofs, which means you’ll get less of a payout in a claim.

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Allstate gets a middling score on this measure, drawing an average proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

**Third-party ratings.** Allstate ranked below average in J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[1] It was also under par for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study.[2]

* ### What Reddit users say about Allstate home insurance

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like home insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  Reddit comments about Allstate home insurance are largely negative. Numerous posters complain about how Allstate resolves (or fails to resolve) claims. Wind and hail damage to roofs seems to be a particular bone of contention, with many people struggling to get Allstate to pay these types of claims. Several Redditors say that even if Allstate’s rates are cheaper than the alternatives, the savings may not be worth it.

## How to file a claim with Allstate

You can file a claim through your online account, by contacting your agent or by calling the company’s claim support line at 800-255-7828.

Allstate will assign you a claim number, review the damage and offer an estimate for repairs. You can choose a contractor from Allstate’s network or hire your own to complete the repairs.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

## Allstate home insurance vs. competitors

### Allstate home insurance vs. State Farm

State Farm’s default coverage is more generous than Allstate’s, but Allstate offers more discounts. See our comparison of [Allstate vs. State Farm home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/allstate-vs-state-farm-home-insurance) to learn more about the differences.

### Allstate home insurance vs. GEICO

The main differences between Allstate and GEICO home insurance are:

**Business structure.** Allstate sells its own policies while GEICO works with third parties. When you get a homeowners insurance quote from GEICO, the company will match you with another insurer such as Homesite, Liberty Mutual or Travelers. That means your coverage and discount options may vary.

**Claim filing.** You can file a homeowners claim through Allstate’s website, but with GEICO you’ll need to work directly with the third-party insurer that underwrites your policy.

Read our [GEICO home insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/geico-home-insurance-review) for more details.

### Allstate home insurance vs. Farmers

The most important differences between Allstate and Farmers homeowners insurance are:

**Consumer complaints.** Farmers draws a low rate of complaints to state regulators, while Allstate draws an average rate.

**Availability.** Although both companies sell home insurance in most U.S. states, there are certain places where only one or the other is available. For example, Farmers doesn’t serve Alaska or Hawaii, while Allstate isn’t currently selling new policies in California or Connecticut.

### Does Allstate home insurance cover termites?

Homeowners insurance policies generally don’t cover termites or other infestations. That's because insurers consider keeping your home free of bugs a part of regular maintenance. However, your policy may cover rare scenarios such as a fire caused by termites eating through a wire. Fire is one of the disasters a standard homeowners policy covers. Learn more about [homeowners insurance and termite damage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage).

### How do I decide between home insurance from Allstate and other companies?

Although price is important, it shouldn’t be the only factor you consider when comparing home insurance quotes. Check the coverage on each policy. Are your belongings covered for their [actual cash value or their replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost)? How much dwelling coverage does each policy offer for your home? Which company has fewer consumer complaints? (NerdWallet’s [home insurance reviews](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-reviews) include information about each company’s consumer complaints.)

Read more about [how to shop for homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-to-shop-for-homeowners-insurance).

### Can you still get homeowners insurance from Allstate if you have a recent claim?

It can be hard to find a new homeowners insurance policy if you’ve filed a claim recently. Claims stay on your record up to seven years, and they’re visible to other insurers, not just your current one. Insurance companies may charge you more if you have a history of claims, or even decline to write you a policy at all. If you’re having trouble finding coverage, reach out to an [independent insurance agent](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/independent-insurance-agents) to help you shop around.

**Homeowners insurance rates methodology**

NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from various insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each U.S. state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

In states where credit is a rating factor, we changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for homeowners with poor credit.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
