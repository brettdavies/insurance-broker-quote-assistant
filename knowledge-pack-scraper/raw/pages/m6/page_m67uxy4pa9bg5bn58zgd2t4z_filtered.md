![How Long Does a DWI Affect Your Car Insurance in Texas](https://www.blasslaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-long-does-a-dwi-affect-your-car-insurance-in-texas-300x200.jpeg)

A driving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction can affect your car insurance in Texas for at least three years, although it may be much longer. Your rates going forward will depend on factors such as your age, gender, any other violations on your driving record, and which insurance company you use. Some insurance companies may even refuse to insure you at all after a DWI conviction.

## Why Does the Cost of Insurance Increase After a DWI?

When you purchase or renew an insurance policy, your insurance company will check your driving record to determine their risk of insuring you.

If you have one or more DWI convictions on your record, the insurance company will see you as a high-risk driver, so they will likely charge a steep premium to insure you. Most insurance companies look back a minimum of three years on your record to determine your risk level, but some will look up to ten years back, especially for serious violations such as a DWI.

According to [Progressive Insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dui-and-insurance/), the nationwide average insurance increase after a DWI is about 13 percent.

## SR-22 Insurance Certificates

In addition to higher insurance premiums, if you are convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) in Texas, the state will require you to obtain a special form of financial responsibility called an SR-22 insurance certificate.

Although it is called “insurance,” it is not insurance in and of itself. Instead, an SR-22 is a special certificate of financial responsibility added to an auto insurance policy for high-risk drivers.

An SR-22 and its associated costs are required for at least two years after a DWI. Failing to obtain an SR-22 or allowing it to lapse can result in losing your driving privileges and vehicle registration, according to the [Texas Department of Public Safety](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/financial-responsibility-insurance-certificate-sr-22).

### Why Do I Have to Pay for Insurance and an SR-22 Certificate?

According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, every driver of a registered vehicle in the state must obtain vehicle insurance in the following minimum amounts:

* $30,000 for bodily injury or death per person
* $60,000 for bodily injury or death per accident
* $25,000 for property damage per accident

Drivers convicted of DWI will typically pay a higher rate for this coverage with a new policy or as part of an existing one. An SR-22 certificate added to your insurance allows the state to monitor your insured status. Your insurer will report to the state when you obtain an SR-22 and if it becomes invalid for any reason.

## What Can I Do to Lower My Insurance Rates After a DWI?

Unfortunately, you will likely have to pay higher rates for at least three years after a DWI conviction. To obtain lower rates at a later date, you should start now by:

* Maintaining a good driving record
* Shopping for competitive insurance rates
* Working on improving your credit score
* Avoiding additional traffic violations

Being convicted of DWI is costly in many ways. In addition to paying higher auto insurance for years afterward, it can also have personal, professional, and social implications that negatively impact your day-to-day life.

## A DWI Arrest and Conviction Can Have Additional Costs

The cost of increased insurance is only one of the financial factors of a DWI. You may also face additional immediate and long-term financial consequences. According to the [Texas Department of Transportation](https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/division/traffic/safety/sober-safe/intoxication.html), these often include:

* First DWI — Fines of up to $2,000, incarceration in the county jail for up to 180 days, and loss of your driver’s license for up to a year
* Second DWI — Fines of up to $4,000, incarceration in the county jail for up to one year, and loss of your driver’s license for up to two years
* Third DWI — Fines of up to $10,000, incarceration in prison for up to ten years, and loss of your driver’s license for up to two years

You might also incur towing and storage fees for your vehicle, a potential threat to your employment if it requires you to have a valid license and good driving record, and the costs of making alternative transportation arrangements if your license is suspended or revoked or you are incarcerated.
