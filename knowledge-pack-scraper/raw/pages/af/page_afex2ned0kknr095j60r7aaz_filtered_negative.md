![Person signing paperwork for car rental](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/rental-reimbursement-coverage.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_When looking at your auto insurance coverage it may be confusing because the word “rental” may be used in different ways depending on your policy and insurer. When you think of rental coverage you may think of insurance that covers you when renting a car. However, there's another type of coverage called_[](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage)[** _car rental reimbursement_**](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage) _that may cover your temporary transportation needs, such as a rental car, if your personal insured vehicle has a covered loss._
Rental reimbursement coverage (sometimes called transportation expenses or substitute transportation) is an optional add-on to your existing auto insurance policy. The coverage is intended to help cover temporary transportation costs when your insured [car is in the shop](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-when-discussing-car-repairs-with-mechanic) or not drivable due to a covered loss. The coverage might help pay for a rental car, or possibly other transportation like bus fare or rideshares (Uber/Lyft), ensuring you are able to get where you need to.
If you have this coverage, its main job is to help cover the costs of substitute transportation while your insured car cannot be driven because it's being repaired. The reason for the repair must be due to a covered loss. This usually means damage covered by your policy's[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage)[comprehensive coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) (like theft, storm damage, hitting an animal) or[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage)[collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) (damage from a crash).
**Scenario**: Your car is hit by a fallen tree during a storm. It is undrivable due to the damage, but you have comprehensive coverage to cover the cost of repairs. Your policy also includes rental reimbursement coverage which allows you to [rent a car while your car is being](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-reimbursement-car-in-shop) repaired. You work miles from home, and it would be extremely inconvenient to go without a car.

* Offers coverage for [damage to the rental car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-car-insurance) or liability coverage on accidents with the rental car.
