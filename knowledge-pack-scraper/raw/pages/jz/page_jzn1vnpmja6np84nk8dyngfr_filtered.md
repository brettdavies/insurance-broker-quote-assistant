State Farm Gamerhood | Season 4 | Meet The Players

Following an impressive Season 3 with over 23-million-episode views in 2024, State Farm Gamerhoodreturns with its most ambitious season yet on August 1.

Gamerhood Season 4 cleverly intertwines the worlds of gaming, sports and entertainment in the most exciting ways the series has ever seen. This season boasts an all-star lineup featuring returning fan favorites alongside some of today’s biggest names in gaming and streaming culture, including Kai Cenat. As always, Jake from State Farm will help guide teams through the surprises Gamerhood has to offer as they compete for non-profits and charities.

 “Coming off the success of Gamerhood last year, we knew we wanted to continue the storylines that fans loved, especially the competition between Berleezy, Mark, and Ludwig,” said Alyson Griffin, Head of Marketing at State Farm. “We know this next season is going to get people talking too, with content that everyone can enjoy — whether you’re a fan of game shows, video games, or just want to unwind and watch something new — you won’t want to miss this season of Gamerhood.”

Also new this season, fans will have a chance to win limited edition, custom design Gamerhood Secretlab TITAN Evo chairs each week through the State Farm Gamerhood Fantasy League play-at-home experience. 

Fans can tune in to all five episodes of Gamerhood Season 4 every Friday in August at 6 p.m. ET on the [State Farm Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/statefarm) channel, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@statefarm/featured) and across competitors’ own streaming channels.

**All-star teams featuring beloved favorites and top creators face off for charity**

Fresh off his viral State Farm “Batman vs. Bateman” commercial, Kai Cenat will make his Gamerhood debut to compete in season 4.

“W to State Farm for letting me bring the heat to Gamerhood! This show is wild. The competition is fierce but we’re bringing the good neighbor vibes. We’re here for the fun, winning some money for charity and, you know, a little chaos to keep things entertaining for the chat,” said Kai Cenat.

Running it back from past seasons, Ludwig (Team Rift), Mark Phillips (Team Respawn) and Berleezy (Team Ragequit) return as team captains. Also joining the neighborhood this season are beloved streamers Sydeon, LuluLuvely, Cinna, JasonTheWeen, and CouRage, adding fresh faces to the competition.

**Join the action and compete for an exclusive prize**

Fans can join the excitement this season through the [State Farm Gamerhood Fantasy League](https://statefarmgamerhoodchallenge.com/), an exhilarating, interactive play-at-home experience.

Ahead of each episode, fans can compete by assembling a Fantasy League team of three Gamerhood competitors. Points are earned based on competitor performance in each episode, paired with interactive, fast-paced trivia questions that allow players to boost their score.

Each week will have its own contest and after each episode, the top six Gamerhood Fantasy League players at home will win a limited-edition, custom design Gamerhood Secretlab TITAN Evo chair. Visit the [Gamerhood website](https://statefarmgamerhoodchallenge.com/) for full contest rules.
