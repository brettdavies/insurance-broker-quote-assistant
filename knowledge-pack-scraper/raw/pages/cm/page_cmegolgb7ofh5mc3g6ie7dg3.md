## California car insurance rates by city
Car insurance rates in California [vary by city](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/). Drivers in densely populated areas tend to have higher rates. For example, drivers in Los Angeles pay 36 percent more than the state average for full coverage, and the average cost in San Francisco is 13 percent more than the state average. There are several reasons why urban customers may pay more than rural customers, namely that driving in dense traffic increases the likelihood of an accident. Other factors, such as the costs for vehicle repairs, parts and medical expenses can also impact how much drivers in a given city pay for coverage.

## California car insurance rates by vehicle type
The [type of vehicle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) you own plays a large role in determining your insurance premium. Luxury and imported cars can sometimes cost more to insure because parts are higher-end or need to be imported, and repairs are more expensive. [Different models](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-and-model/) also have different accident and theft rates, which can impact the cost of your policy. The table below shows the average rates for a range of vehicles in California. Note that a luxury car such as a BMW costs more to insure than more budget-friendly brands like Ford and Honda. The age of your vehicle also matters, as newer models may have safety updates or more complex parts and features that impact repair rates.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in California?
Caret Down Icon
The best California car insurance company is different for every driver. Some drivers may prefer a carrier offering a whole suite of financial services like home or renters insurance and banking products. Others may just need the basics. To find the best auto insurance for your coverage and budgetary needs, apply for quotes from at least three different carriers. After finding a few that work within your budget, dig into the additional benefits of each company (like a well-rated app, discount availability or 24/7 customer service). 
  * ###  What is the average cost of minimum coverage in California?
Caret Down Icon
The average cost of [minimum coverage auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) in California is $76 per month. While experts agree that maintaining higher liability limits will offer more substantial financial protection, carrying minimum coverage is always better than [driving uninsured](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/) (which is illegal). 
  * ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in California?
Caret Down Icon
The [cheapest car insurance company in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) varies from driver to driver because the price you pay for insurance is based on personal rating factors. Insurance companies look at things like your driving history, vehicle type, location and more to determine your risk. Then, they consider your risk to insure in order to generate a premium. This is the price you pay for your car insurance policy. Don’t forget to factor in all the discounts you’re eligible for when comparing quotes and purchasing coverage.
  * ###  How much insurance is required in California? 
Caret Down Icon
As of January 1, 2025, California [increased its minimum car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-minimum-coverage-increases-2025/) bodily injury liability requirements to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident and property damage liability limits to $15,000 per accident. It is one of several states to increase the minimum car insurance requirements in 2025, due to rising medical expenses and auto repair costs. However, keep in mind that experts recommend purchasing more than the state minimum insurance for great financial protection.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
