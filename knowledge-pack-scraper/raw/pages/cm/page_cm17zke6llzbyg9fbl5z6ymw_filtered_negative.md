Criminal Defense Division
[Criminal Defense](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/ "Criminal Defense") » [Vehicle Code](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/ "Vehicle Code") » 12500(a) VC - Driving Without a License
**Vehicle Code § 12500 (a)** **VC** makes it illegal to **drive** a motor vehicle in California**without a valid driver’s license**. This offense is charged either as a [**misdemeanor**](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/laws/misdemeanor/) carrying up to six months in jail and/or $1,000 _or_ as a non-criminal [**infraction**](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/infractions/) carrying up to $250.
> _**VC 12500 (a)** A person may **not drive a motor vehicle** upon a highway, unless the person then holds a **valid driver’s license** issued under this code, except those persons who are expressly exempted under this code._
* [1. DL Requirements](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/12500/#1.)
* [2. Elements of the Crime](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/12500/#2.)
* [3. Penalties](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/12500/#3.)
* [4. Defenses](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/12500/#4.)
* [5. Undocumented Immigrants](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/12500/#5.)
##  1. DL Requirements
You do _not_ need a California DL to drive in the state if you are:
* Driving an off-highway vehicle _across_ a public road;5
###  Can I drive in California with a license from another state or country?
###  Can I drive in California if I am under 18 and from another state or country?
###  If I move to California, when do I have to get a license?
An exception is if you are driving as part of your employment (such as Uber or [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) drivers, delivery drivers, etc.). Then you must obtain a state DL before you can drive for work.14
##  2. Elements of the Crime
###  Burden of Proof
###  Common Cases
###  Refusing to Show Your License
Refusing to show an officer your DL is a misdemeanor under VC 12951 _if you were driving._ It can be punished by:
Unlike some states (such as Nevada), California does not have a general “stop and identify” law. 23 This means that if you are stopped by law enforcement, you have to show your ID _only if_ you were driving.24
##  3. Penalties
##  4. Defenses
##  5. Undocumented Immigrants

12. VC 12504 (b): “Any nonresident over the age of 16 years but under the age of 18 years who is a resident of a foreign jurisdiction which requires the licensing of drivers may continue to operate a motor vehicle in this state after 10 days from his or her date of entry into this state if he or she meets both the following: (1) He or she has a valid [DL], issued by the foreign jurisdiction, in his or her immediate possession. (2) He or she has been issued and has in his or her immediate possession a nonresident minor’s certificate, which the department issues to a nonresident minor who holds a valid [DL] issued to him or her by his or her home state or country, and who files proof of financial responsibility. (c) Whenever any of the conditions for the issuance of a nonresident minor’s certificate cease to exist, the department shall cancel the certificate and require the minor to surrender it to the department.” See also:  In re V.C. (Cal. App. 3d Dist. 2013), 217 Cal. App. 4th 814, 158 Cal. Rptr. 3d 871; [ In re Shawnn F. (Cal. App. 5th Dist. 1995), 34 Cal.

23. See, for example, [Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., 542 U.S. 177 (2004)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/03-5554). Two offenses related to refusing to show an officer a DL are [Penal Code 148.9 PC – showing  _false_ identification to a peace officer](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/penal-code/148-9/), and [Vehicle Code 31 VC – providing false information to a peace officer](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/31/). Both these crimes are misdemeanors, punishable by up to six (6) months in jail and/or a hefty fine.

Shouse Law Group has wonderful customer service. They were so pleasant and knowledgeable when I contacted them. Very helpful with any questions and concerns and I can't thank them enough for the experience I had. Definitely recommend!
Dee M.
I cannot express enough gratitude for the outstanding legal support I received from Karthik Krishnan. From the very first consultation, it was clear that he is a top-tier, highly skilled professional who genuinely cares about his clients. His unparalleled honesty, transparency, and unwavering dedication made all the difference in my case.
Mu K.
John Murray won my DMV hearing over a DUI charge I had pending and just recently won motion for military diversion against my charge. I highly recommend John, he is highly professional,motivated and competent. I walked into the courthouse with peace of mind only because I knew I had John in my corner. Thanks for all the help.
