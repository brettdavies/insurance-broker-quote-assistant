## California car insurance rates by city

Car insurance rates in California [vary by city](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/). Drivers in densely populated areas tend to have higher rates. For example, drivers in Los Angeles pay 36 percent more than the state average for full coverage, and the average cost in San Francisco is 13 percent more than the state average. There are several reasons why urban customers may pay more than rural customers, namely that driving in dense traffic increases the likelihood of an accident. Other factors, such as the costs for vehicle repairs, parts and medical expenses can also impact how much drivers in a given city pay for coverage.

## Average car insurance costs by age in California

In California, the strongest [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) influencing premiums are driving record, annual mileage and years of driving experience. [Car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) with less driving experience are typically much higher than the state average. As experience is gained, rates tend to decline.

## California car insurance rates by vehicle type

The [type of vehicle](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) you own plays a large role in determining your insurance premium. Luxury and imported cars can sometimes cost more to insure because parts are higher-end or need to be imported, and repairs are more expensive. [Different models](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-and-model/) also have different accident and theft rates, which can impact the cost of your policy. The table below shows the average rates for a range of vehicles in California. Note that a luxury car such as a BMW costs more to insure than more budget-friendly brands like Ford and Honda. The age of your vehicle also matters, as newer models may have safety updates or more complex parts and features that impact repair rates.
