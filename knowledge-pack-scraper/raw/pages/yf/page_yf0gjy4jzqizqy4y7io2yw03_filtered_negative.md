* Rental Reimbursement and Travel Expenses on Road Trips
![Woman with long hair takes luggage out of her car.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/rental-reimbursement-and-travel-expenses-on-road-trips.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_An unexpected collision during a road trip can be both stressful and costly. Reimbursement and travel expenses coverage on your auto policy can help cover costs if your car has a covered loss when away from home. Understanding how this coverage works might help you manage expenses for lodging, meals and transportation needs when dealing with a covered incident while traveling._
Vacations and trips are exciting until an unexpected accident happens and you are far from home. Finding a place to stay, eating out, and securing alternate transportation may be nerve racking and hard on your budget. If you had rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage as part of your [auto insurance policy](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage), it could help with the cost and stress.
**Scenario:** Your car suffers damage from a falling tree. Damages to the car are covered by your auto policy with [comprehensive coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage). You need reliable transportation to get to work so you utilize your [rental reimbursement coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-reimbursement-coverage) to rent a car until your [car is repaired](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-when-discussing-car-repairs-with-mechanic).
**Scenario:** You are on road trip more than 50 miles from home when you get into a collision. Damages to your vehicle may be covered with your policy’s [collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) but you don’t have time to wait until your car is repaired to go home. With the travel expenses coverage on your policy, you can rent a car and return home when you planned and be reimbursed for any unexpected lodging cost or meals that you may have incurred.

First, it's important to know that rental reimbursement and travel expenses coverage are optional add-ons for your own auto insurance policy and your personal vehicle. They differ from [rental car insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-car-insurance) which you may choose to purchase when renting a car for a general trip.
Helps pay for substitute transport while **your insured car** is repaired after a covered [comprehensive](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) or [collision](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) loss.
Help reimburse lodging and food costs**if your insured vehicle** has a covered loss while you are far from home.
Helps provide coverage if [a rental car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rental-car-insurance) damaged during your rental period. Some of your own auto coverages may extend to rental cars.
Coverage varies depending on the insurance coverage you opt into. Options may include coverage of damage that occurs to the car such as [vandalism/theft](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft), coverage for damage or injuries caused while using the rental car.
* Emergency hotel stays.
* Unexpected meal costs while stranded.
* Costs to get back home or continue your trip such as bus fare, train ticket, or rental car.
* Some policies might even help cover transportation costs for a trip back later to retrieve your repaired car.
