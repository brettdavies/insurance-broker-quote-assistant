##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: TRAVELERS VS. STATE FARM

| --- | --- | --- |

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### State Farm vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers

If you have a [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/) or DWI in your past, **your rates could be lower with Travelers than with State Farm**. Every auto insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVLERS VS. STATE FARM

| **Citation** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Reckless driving | $2,895 | n/a |
| Speeding ticket | $1,983 | $1,752 |

### State Farm vs. Travelers: rates by age

Auto insurance companies use a driver's age to gauge the risk level they pose. Auto insurance policies are usually much more expensive for [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) — due to their lack of driving experience — and cheapest for middle-aged drivers. Because every car insurance company assigns rates differently, it's always a good idea to compare rates.

As a general rule, teen drivers concerned about cost should choose **Travelers** over State Farm. The former is one of the best budget choices for young drivers. See more pricing comparisons by age group below.

##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. STATE FARM

| **Age tier** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **50s** | $1,558 | $1,167 |
| **60s** | $1,485 | $1,165 |
