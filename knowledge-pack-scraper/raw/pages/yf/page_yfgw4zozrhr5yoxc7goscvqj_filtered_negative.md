If you have a [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/) or DWI in your past, **your rates could be lower with Travelers than with State Farm**. Every auto insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.
