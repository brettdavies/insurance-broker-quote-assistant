[State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/state-farm/) was founded in 1922 and holds close to 19 percent of the [market share](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for auto insurance. The company underwrites its own insurance policies and is known for offering affordable car insurance, quality customer service and a standard array of auto insurance options. It also offers a number of bundling options, specialized coverage and discount opportunities that may help drivers save money on their policies. In addition, drivers with blemishes on their driving records may find State Farm’s rates lower than its competitors.

[USAA](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/usaa/) was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas, and currently holds 6 percent of the auto insurance market share. USAA is geared toward active military, veterans and qualifying family members, and membership is required to access insurance coverage options from this company — only certain drivers are eligible. However, those who qualify for coverage may find USAA to be worth considering, as it offers robust policy options and military-focused coverage.

Our verdict

Both USAA and State Farm offer [cheap average car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) that are below the national average. One of the biggest differences between these companies is coverage eligibility. USAA coverage is exclusively available to military members, veterans and qualifying family members, while State Farm has no such restrictions. So, while USAA offers lower average rates and scores higher with third parties like [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), State Farm is much more accessible to the average driver.

## State Farm vs. USAA comparison

When comparing State Farm versus USAA, there are several important variables to consider. Average rates matter, but financial strength ratings, customer satisfaction, coverage options and discount opportunities may also be important to consider when determining which company works best for you.

## Is State Farm cheaper than USAA?

When comparing USAA versus State Farm average rates, USAA generally comes out ahead for both full and minimum coverage policies. Knowing the [average rates for car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) can be helpful, but it doesn't tell the full story. Rates vary greatly depending on your location, your driving record and multiple [other factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) as well. Although State Farm's and USAA's average rates are both competitive, you are unlikely to pay exactly the same as the average rate.

Having said that, the average rates can serve as a baseline to allow you to weigh this factor when considering the company that will give you the best coverage at the most affordable price. In the end, the best way to determine whether State Farm or USAA is more reasonably priced is to ask for quotes from both companies for the same types and levels of coverage, so you can compare the two prices.

| Driver profile | State Farm avg. full coverage premium | USAA avg. full coverage premium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Young driver (age 25)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/25-year-old/) | $3,171 | $2,696 |
| [Senior driver (age 70)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) | $2,557 | $2,279 |

Bankrate's take

Your personal factors—your credit history, age and more—all impact your premium. Your driving history also plays a big role in determining what you will pay. A clean driving record is likely to earn you the most competitive rate; if you have some recent infractions, you may pay more. Some companies, in fact, may turn you down for coverage if you have multiple moving violations. State Farm, for example, does not generally write policies for drivers with a DUI on your record. Your insurer is able to access your driving record when determining your rate, but it can be a good idea to let your agent know if you've been convicted of a violation. In some cases, you may be considered a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) and will need to find coverage with a [non-standard insurer](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/non-standard-auto-insurance/).

## State Farm vs. USAA: discounts

Car insurance companies often offer discounts for eligible drivers. [Car insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) can help drivers save on their premiums if they meet certain criteria. While both State Farm and USAA have distinctive discounts, each carrier also offers discounts that are similar.

### Discounts available from both carriers

Both State Farm and USAA offer a range of discounts that can provide [substantial savings](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) on premiums, appealing to a broad array of customers. These discounts are designed to reward responsible behaviors and circumstances that lower the insurers' risk. Key discounts offered by both companies include:

* **Multi-policy discount:** Customers who bundle multiple types of insurance policies, such as home and auto, typically enjoy reduced rates on each policy.
* **Multi-vehicle discount:** Insuring more than one vehicle with the same company can lead to savings on the overall cost of car insurance for policyholders.
* **Good student discount:** Young drivers still in school may be able to save by maintaining a "B" average or better. Both companies reward these drivers with a small discount to help offset the higher average rates paid by teens and young adults.

#### State Farm discounts

* [**Steer Clear**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/): Drivers under the age of 25 with a clean driving record for the past three years may be eligible for this program with State Farm, which could earn you a discount.
* [**Drive Safe and Save**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/): This is a [car insurance telematics](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) program through State Farm that requires enrollment. Your driving is monitored through a smartphone app and, depending on your driving habits, you may receive a discount.
* **Good driver discount**: New State Farm customers who have maintained a clean driving record for at least three years, with no moving violations or at-fault accidents, may be eligible.

#### USAA discounts

* [**SafePilot**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usaa-safepilot/): USAA’s telematics program also tracks your driving habits with an app and may assign you a personalized discount at your policy renewal.
* **Military installation**: If you store your vehicle in a garage or storage facility on base, you may receive additional savings.
* **Loyal member**: If your parents have USAA and you purchase a policy of your own, you might qualify for a loyalty discount through the MyUSAA Legacy Discount program.

### State Farm and USAA telematics programs

Telematics, or [usage-based car insurance programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usage-based-insurance/), are becoming more popular with insurers, and both State Farm and USAA offer these programs. In fact, State Farm has two, one geared toward young drivers. These programs are not complicated: they use an app you install on your smartphone, or a small device easily installed in your car, to monitor your driving in real time. Generally, the program is able to access data related to driving behaviors such as speeding, hard braking and the time of day or night you are driving. Good driving practices may earn you a significant discount. With some insurers, however, poor driving behavior may cause your premium to increase. Thankfully that’s not the case with State Farm or USAA. Here is a table showing more data regarding the two insurer's telematics programs:

|  | State Farm Drive Safe & Save | USAA SafePilot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Device** | App or in-car device | App |
| **Can it raise your rate?** | Will not negatively impact rates, per State Farm | Will not negatively impact rates, per USAA |
| **Availability** | Not available in California, Massachusetts or Rhode Island | Select states only |
| **Discount** | Up to 30% | Up to 30% |
| **What it monitors** | Acceleration, braking, cornering, speed and phone use | Phone use, hand-held or hands-free calling, harsh braking, time of day and potential accidents |

## State Farm vs. USAA: customer experience comparison

Customer satisfaction and digital tools can also make a difference when comparing potential insurance companies. When it comes to the [2024 J.D. Power Auto Claims Satisfaction study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), USAA scored higher than State Farm, but both performed above average. State Farm and USAA also both offer a robust lineup of online tools and features that give customers access to digital policy management. Both carriers offer a mobile app for access to ID cards, bill payment, roadside assistance and claims filing. However, State Farm offers additional features for on-the-go policy management, such as the ability to message an agent through the app or obtain technical assistance.

| **Google play** | 4.6 of 5 | 4.7 of 5 |

### Customer complaints

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) complaint index is one way to gain a sense of how satisfied customers are with their insurance company. The complaint index shows whether a company has more or less than the average number of complaints expected for an insurer of their size. The industry average is indicated as 1.0. A complaint index higher than this shows that a company has received more complaints than average; a lower number indicates a company that has received fewer than average complaints. This can help you to understand whether a company is effectively working with its policyholders and paying their claims in a timely manner.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
