Taking advantage of discounts is one of the easiest ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). Insurers offer many different discounts, including low-mileage discounts for people who drive less frequently.

[State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm) offers a low-mileage discount if you drive fewer than 7,500 miles per year. But savings can vary by your vehicle type, driving record, and [location](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/vehicle-model). We’ll explain everything you need to know about the State Farm low-mileage discount, how it stacks up against other insurers, and other discounts State Farm offers.

## **What Is the State Farm Low-Mileage Discount?**

You can qualify for State Farm’s [low-mileage discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/low-mileage-insurance-discount) if you drive fewer than 7,500 miles annually. Many insurers don’t offer this discount and instead focus more on [telematics](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount) programs that track your driving habits.

If you participate in State Farm’s [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save) telematics program, you could lose the low-mileage discount if you drive more than 7,500 miles within a 12-month period. Drive Safe & Save tracks mileage in most states. It also tracks driving behaviors like fast acceleration and hard braking.

## **How Much Can You Save With the State Farm Low-Mileage Discount?**

State Farm doesn’t advertise how much you can save with its low-mileage discount. But savings typically vary by your [driving record](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/driving-record), location, and [vehicle type](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/vehicle-model).

State Farm customers haven’t shared much about their experiences with the low-mileage discount on various online review sites and social media. Most online discussions are about State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save [usage-based insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) program.

While some Reddit users saved more, others found their rates increased despite driving less. Others report that you can either get the low-mileage discount or participate in the telematics program, but not both.

If you qualify for the low-mileage discount, contact your State Farm agent to find out how much you can save.
