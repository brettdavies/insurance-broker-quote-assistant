The [average cost of auto insurance in Texas](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-rates-texas-study "Texas Auto Insurance") with a clean record is $51 per month. That increases to $88 per month after a DUI that requires an SR-22 insurance policy.
If you've been convicted of certain moving violations in Texas, such as driving under the influence, or you have committed too many traffic offenses within a period of time, the state may require you to file an [SR-22 form](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Car Insurance") with the Texas DPS. This can also be called "getting SR-22 insurance", and it is often required to reinstate your license if it has been suspended due to high-risk tickets. SR-22 insurance may also be required if you display a fake license plate or commit certain drug offenses.
If you need an SR-22 filing to reinstate your license, but you don't have a vehicle registered in your name, you can get a [non-owner SR-22 insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-car-insurance-who-should-have-it "Non-owner Car Insurance") to meet the state's requirement. Non-owner SR-22 insurance in Texas provides liability coverage that meets the state's requirements and provides coverage whenever you drive a car belonging to someone else.
