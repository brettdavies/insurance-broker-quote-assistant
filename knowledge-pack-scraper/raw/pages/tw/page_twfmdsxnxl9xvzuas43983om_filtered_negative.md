## Our Expert Take
## Our Expert Take
If you’re looking to bundle home and auto insurance, we found State Farm could be a great choice as it has one of the largest bundling discounts (23%).
Beyond that, State Farm has one of the best rates for multiple levels of dwelling coverage. For instance, the insurer’s average rate for $350,000 coverage is almost $500 cheaper than the national average of the companies we analyzed.
You can get quotes online, which is more convenient than some competitors who don’t have that feature. State Farm also offers 24/7 claims service, allowing you to file claims through its app instead of calling an agent. If you prefer face-to-face interaction with an agent, you can still work with one of 19,000 State Farm agents.
It’s also easy to find a State Farm policy since the company offers home insurance in all 50 states.
#### States Available In
State Farm sells home insurance in all 50 states and Washington, DC.
* Offers optional extended replacement cost coverage, expanding your insurance limit when rebuilding costs are more than your dwelling coverage amount
* No banned dog list
* Higher-than-average complaint level to state insurance departments
* State Farm agents will be knowledgeable about the company’s products, but won’t help you compare other insurers
Great for Bundling Auto and Home Insurance

## About State Farm Homeowners Insurance
State Farm Insurance sold its first policy in 1922. The company was founded by G.J. Mecherle, a small-town farmer who believed farmers were being overcharged for insurance. The company is headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois.
State Farm has the largest home insurance and auto insurance market shares in the country.
### Who Is State Farm Homeowners Insurance For?
State Farm homeowners insurance can be for anyone looking for a well-known brand with policies in every state that offers cheaper-than-average home insurance. It’s also excellent for homeowners who want to maximize home and auto insurance bundles.
State Farm offers a combination of old-school, face-to-face insurance with the option to use technology. For instance, you can buy a home insurance policy from a local agent or obtain free quotes online. If you buy a home policy, you can use the company’s mobile app to file claims and check on your policy.
The company also offers ways to get coverage beyond standard home insurance, including inflation control. With this program, your State Farm home policy keeps pace with inflation and rising construction costs in your area, so you won’t be underinsured.

## Is State Farm Homeowners Insurance the Best Choice for You?
Home insurance price is often one of the most important factors when looking for a homeowners policy, which is one reason State Farm could be a good option.
### Price
State Farm is nearly $500 cheaper than the national average for $350,000 dwelling coverage of the companies we analyzed. Only Progressive, Westfield and Nationwide have better average rates. Those are good companies to contact for the cheapest home insurance quotes.

### Bundling Discounts
State Farm has one of the best home and auto bundling discounts. Bundling a policy is typically the largest home insurance discount.
In some cases, high-cost home insurers may have impressive bundling discounts, but you still pay more overall. However, State Farm combines a generous bundling discount with already low rates.
Here’s a look at the best bundling discounts of the companies we analyzed.

#### State Farm Home Insurance Rates Stability
State Farm’s home insurance rates have increased by 21% since 2022 for $350,000 dwelling coverage—slightly higher than the national average (19%), according to our rate analysis. Despite that increase, State Farm remains one of cheapest home insurance companies.
Nearly every home insurance company we reviewed has seen rate hikes since 2022. The causes of higher home insurance costs post-Covid were rising building and labor costs, says [George Hosfield](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/advisory-board/homeowners-insurance/george-hosfield/), senior director and general manager of home insurance solutions at LexisNexis Risk Solutions and a Forbes Advisor Advisory Board member.
Home insurance rates have largely stabilized, but Hosfield said there are forces that could wind up accelerating cost hikes again.
“We aren’t out of the woods yet with building and labor cost inflation. Depending on how economic and immigration policy pans out, it could drive additional costs due to labor availability and/or tariffs on key materials,” says Hosfield, adding that severe weather events may also play a role in higher rates.
### Does State Farm Home Insurance Have Good Customer Service?
Forbes Advisor’s Consumer Sentiment Index found State Farm customers ranked the company 6 of 7 for customer service and an overall “neutral rating” in a review of 8,728 customer insights and reviews.
We found customers liked State Farm’s bundling discounts, though they weren’t as pleased with home insurance rates and the company’s claims handling, including complaints about having claims delayed or denied.
_The Consumer Sentiment Index from Forbes Advisor uses a proprietary weighting system designed by our subject matter experts. It evaluates thousands of consumer insights and reviews from leading online forums to determine customer satisfaction at scale._
We also found that State Farm has higher-than-average complaint levels with the state insurance departments. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners collects the data, which may give a glimpse into customers’ satisfaction.
Meanwhile, State Farm received 873 points out of 1,000 points in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study. That was slightly better than the industry average (869) and followed competitors like Amica, AIG, Erie Insurance and Farmers.
In the report, J.D. Power found that severe storms resulted in many high-cost claims and prolonged claim processes, affecting customer satisfaction overall. In fact, the report said the home insurance industry had the lowest customer satisfaction in seven years.
### What Is the Financial Strength Rating of State Farm Insurance?
State Farm’s [AM Best](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/life-insurance/am-best-ratings/) financial strength rating is A++ (Superior). AM Best praised the company’s balance sheet strength and also highlighted its “strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.”
#### Why Is This Important?
You want to make sure an insurance company is stable and going to be there to pay your claims down the road. That means an insurance company’s financial strength rating is vital. You don’t want a home insurance company to go belly up after a stormy season and leave you scrambling for a new home insurer.

## Methodology
To identify the best home insurance companies, we analyzed costs around the country, policy information and complaints against insurers. We scored companies based on these factors:
**Home insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates for each insurance company for homes with dwelling coverage of $200,000, $350,000, $500,000 and $750,000 with 50% personal property coverage, 10% loss of use coverage, a $500 deductible, $1,000 guest medical coverage and $100,000 liability coverage for a 40-year-old woman with good credit.
**Source:** [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Complaints (20% of score):** We used complaint data from state insurance departments across the country. Most home insurance complaints center on claims, including delays, unsatisfactory settlements and denials.
**Source:** [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
**Availability of extended and/or guaranteed replacement cost coverage (20% of score):** Extra dwelling coverage is valuable in the event of large disasters, when construction materials and labor costs tend to spike. We gave points to companies that offer either extended or guaranteed replacement cost coverage.
**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Digital experience (10% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated home insurers on:
* If there’s a mobile app
* If you can submit claims online
* If you can pay online
* If there’s a useful website search function
* If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information
* If the company has a Facebook account that is updated regularly
* If you can get a quote online
**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Banned dog lists (10% of score):** Banned dog breed lists can make homeowners ineligible for coverage. (A company’s banned dog list might not be applicable in all states.) While any homeowners insurance company could potentially ban any dog with a biting history, not all put a ban on specific breeds.
