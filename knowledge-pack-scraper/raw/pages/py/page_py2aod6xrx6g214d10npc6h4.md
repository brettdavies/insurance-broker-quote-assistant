**Final expense**
Progressive's final expense coverage, otherwise called burial insurance, is designed to help you cover the costs of your funeral, hospital bills, etc. This type of coverage is permanent and doesn't require a medical exam.
**Short-term life**
Progressive's short-term life insurance offers coverage for a unique one-year span in case you need to bridge a gap in your coverage or are new to exploring life insurance options. Policies are available with no medical exam and can be obtained quickly. 
**Whole life**
Progressive's whole life coverage is also known as permanent life insurance because it's a policy built to last your whole life with a fixed premium rate. This type of coverage also accrues a cash value you can borrow against at your discretion.
Your independent insurance agent can help you find more information about the coverage offered by Progressive and help you decide if this insurance company is right for you.

Progressive offers several options for claims reporting. The insurance company details their auto insurance claims process on their official website as follows:
  1. **Submit your claim:** Start by filing your claim through one of Progressive's many options such as by phone, online, etc. They'll ask you for some basic info during the process. Your independent insurance agent can also do this for you.
  2. **Inspection and repair options:** A claims rep from Progressive will ask you to choose whether you want to get your vehicle repaired or receive reimbursement. From there, they'll advise on the next steps.
  3. **Schedule your repairs:** If you choose to get your vehicle repaired, the claims rep schedules the repairs at one of several local shops of your choice.
  4. **Your car is repaired:** Your vehicle then undergoes the repairs at the shop selected. Shops in Progressive's approved network offer guaranteed repairs as long as your vehicle is owned or leased by you.


If customers have other questions about filing or the claims process itself, they can contact the carrier via phone, online, live chat, email, or get in touch with their independent insurance agent.
