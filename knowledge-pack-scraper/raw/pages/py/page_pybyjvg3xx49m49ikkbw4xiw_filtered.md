**Why Allstate made our list:** Allstate offers a variety of savings programs for eligible drivers to pursue on top of a robust list of discounts. Although the company provides many upsides, it does have some of the highest average rates on our list and scored slightly below the industry average for customer satisfaction in California in the 2025 J.D. Power study.

**Why Allstate may be the best for local agents:** Allstate maintains an extensive network of agents, aiding customers who prefer live-person interactions. For others, however, the insurer offers a robust array of digital tools and conveniences. Since California is prone to extreme weather claims, having a boots-on-the-ground agent could benefit San Diego drivers.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Mercury offers San Diego drivers some of the lowest average minimum and full coverage rates. Although it continued to rank below average in J.D. Power’s latest auto insurance and auto claims studies, it did earn an A (Excellent) rating for financial strength from AM Best. Mercury doesn’t offer as many endorsements as other carriers on this list, but low-mileage drivers may be interested in Mercury’s RealDrive program. Additional discounts include a telematics program and potential savings for anti-theft devices.

**Why Mercury may be the best for rideshare coverage:** Mercury has ride-hailing coverage for San Diego drivers participating in Uber or Lyft. While many ridesharing companies offer coverage while you have a client in the vehicle, finding a company that offers coverage for when the car is being used for personal use and in the ride-hailing or period one stage of the rideshare app can be challenging. Mercury’s ride-hailing insurance provides both personal and period one coverage.

## How much is car insurance in San Diego, California?

The [average cost of car insurance in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/#:~:text=Full%20coverage%20car%20insurance%20costs,coverage%20is%20%24645%20per%20year.) is $3,102 per year for full coverage which is 14 percent more than the same level of coverage in San Diego, which is $2,727 per year. On average, California drivers pay $915 per year for minimum coverage, which is 14 percent more than what San Diego drivers pay. Premiums and coverage for car insurance can both be highly individualized, and your actual rates could vary noticeably from the San Diego average. Factors like coverage level, driving experience and driving history make premiums between drivers and carriers vary significantly.

### San Diego rates for teens

[Teenage drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/?_bypasscdn=b3a86258-8987-44a9-9d4a-f843f19c9210#:~:text=Male%20drivers%20make%20up%20about,19%20years%20old%20in%202020.) are usually considered high-risk drivers in most states and tend to pay the most for car insurance compared to other age groups. Driving skills such as avoiding road hazards and adjusting your driving to accommodate weather conditions take time to learn. Teens are often charged significantly less while they stay on their parents' policies (which is required until they are 18 anyway).

### San Diego rates for young drivers

As drivers age and develop road experience, their rates tend to decrease. Drivers in their mid-twenties are still considered young drivers, but are no longer treated as risky as teen drivers (if they've kept their driving records clean). As adult children move out and get their own policies, they may still be able to keep certain discounts geared towards newer drivers, such as the driving training discount and the good student discount. Affordable [car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) are possible, and below, you can find some of the cheapest carriers for young adults in San Diego.

### San Diego rates for adults

Once drivers hit their mid-twenties, they should start to see young driver surcharges start to drop off. Based on data from the [Insurance Institute of Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot), the rate of fatal crashes for adults remains fairly level for adults throughout their 30s through 50s. This means that [other rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) may become even more important, including your location, marital status and even where you park your car.

California is one of the many states that offer defensive driver discounts specifically for drivers over 55. This can help keep [car insurance rates for seniors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) more affordable.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
