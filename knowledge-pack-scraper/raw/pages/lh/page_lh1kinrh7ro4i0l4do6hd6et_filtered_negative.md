* If an insurance company acts negligently under the [_Stowers_ doctrine](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/understanding-the-texas-stowers-demand-doctrine-42383)
The final option for pursuing a settlement that exceeds policy limits is if the [insurance company has acted negligently](http://fvflawfirm.com/blog/can-done-abusive-negligent-adjusters-texas/) towards the at-fault driver, leaving them exposed to a large judgment. This is commonly called the _Stowers_ doctrine in Texas, after the landmark Texas court case that established the principle.
If you are willing to settle your claim against the at-fault driver for an amount of money within their insurance policy limits, and the defendant’s insurer negligently fails to do so, and you then you secure a jury verdict in excess of those policy limits, the insurance company could be liable for the full amount of damages awarded in that jury verdict, even if it exceeds the policy limits. But the law in Texas continues to make true _Stowers_ doctrine claims more and more rare, by making it more difficult than ever to prove that an insurance company was negligent.
For example, if you do not have a strong case and your settlement demands were unreasonable, the insurance company is not likely to be found negligent if it refuses to settle. Or, if the demand for settlement does not provide sufficient clarity about the amount and extent of losses, and supporting documentation about why the at-fault driver is negligent, the insurance company will probably not face sufficient pressure to invoke the _Stowers_ doctrine.
