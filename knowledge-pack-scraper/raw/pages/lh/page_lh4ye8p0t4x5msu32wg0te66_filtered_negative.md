In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to [data](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2024-active-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=342724389&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_qvFOEVMyra19iNg0QfkvfUJEIhmDGXSuBYBQR-2-J8x8hXqeLoMaCmDy2nACiaM7gu9qQizgE873xHz6jqICiOZ8TL56RiuynJ3PzxgxyqftUJlE&_hsmi=342724389) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion — more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.
The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024 [research](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-higher-property-insurance-premiums-mirror-climate-risk/) from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.
Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging [flooding](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/vermont-northeast-kingdom-flooding/) in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's [devastation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-helene-biblical-devastation-north-carolina-near-worst-case-scenario/) in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.
But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance — basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers, [according](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-is-climate-change-impacting-home-insurance-markets/?utm_campaign=Brookings%20Brief&utm_medium=email&utm_content=342549569&utm_source=hs_email) to the Brookings Institution.
