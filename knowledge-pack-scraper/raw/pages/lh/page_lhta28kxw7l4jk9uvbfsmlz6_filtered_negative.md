Drivers in [New York](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/new-york-car-insurance/) must carry car insurance to be legal behind the wheel. [Proof of coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/proof-of-insurance/) must also be carried at all times while driving. Below you’ll find the minimum insurance requirements in New York as well as some optional coverages that could offer even more protection for you and your assets.
---|---|---
$25,000 for bodily injury per person  |  $25,000 for bodily injury per person  |  $50,000 per person
$50,000 for bodily injury per accident  |  $50,000 for bodily injury per accident
$10,000 for property damage per accident  |
Bear in mind that those who [finance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-financed-vehicle/) or [lease](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-leased-vehicle/) a car could face additional insurance requirements as a part of your contract.
* * *
[**Liability coverage**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) is legally required in New York. This coverage pays for [bodily injury](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/) that you cause to another driver or their passengers in an accident in which you are [at fault](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/how-is-fault-determined-car-accident/). This coverage can also apply to expenses related to funeral costs, lost wages and pain and suffering. It should be noted that your liability coverage never pays for your injuries or property damage, so you may want to consider further coverage options to add more protection.
**[Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/)** is legally required in New York and pays for injury and lost wages that you or your passengers may suffer in the event that you are hit by an uninsured driver who is at fault.
Because New York is a [no-fault state](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/what-no-fault-insurance/), drivers are required to carry **[personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/pip-insurance/)**. PIP provides coverage for medical costs that you and your passengers incur in an accident regardless of fault. PIP will cover medical expenses such as hospital bills, rehabilitation costs, and even work loss resulting from an accident. In New York, minimum PIP coverage of $50,000 per person is required on your policy.
* * *
The term  _limits_ refers to the maximum amount that your car insurance company will pay in the event of a claim. States have the authority to set minimum limits of coverage which drivers must adhere to in order to be considered legal. For instance, New York’s PIP limits require a minimum of $50,000 per person.
Liability coverage limits are normally split into three categories: **bodily injury per person**, **bodily injury per accident**, and **property damage**. In New York, these coverage limits are written out as 25/50/10 and are explained in greater detail below.
* $25,000 in **bodily injury coverage per person** is the maximum dollar amount your insurer will pay for a single person that you injure in an auto accident.
* $50,000 in **bodily injury coverage per accident** refers to the total amount your insurer will pay for all injuries that you cause in an accident if more than one person is hurt.
* $10,000 in **property damage per accident** is the maximum amount an insurance company will pay for damage that you cause in an at-fault accident.
* $25,000 for **bodily injury coverage per person**. This is the maximum dollar amount paid out for a single person injured in your vehicle by an uninsured driver.
* $50,000 **bodily injury coverage per accident**. This is the total amount paid out for all injuries in your vehicle by an uninsured driver if more than one person is hurt.
* * *
[Car insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) in New York must notify the DMV whenever your liability coverage begins or ends. If your coverage ends and you have not purchased liability insurance, you must turn in your license plates to the DMV. If the authorities find that you or another party has been driving your uninsured vehicle, you could face the following penalties:
---|---
1-30 days  |  $8 per day
31-60 days  |  $10 per day
61-90 days  |  $12 per day
* * *
* **[Gap coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/):** Because of the rapid depreciation of most vehicles, it can be a good idea to have some built-in protection to cover the difference of the [actual cash value](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/guide/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost-value/) of your car and the amount you still owe on your loan. Sometimes known as loan/lease coverage, this is a great option for those who don’t want to be caught upside down in a loan.
* * *
New York is a diminished value state, meaning drivers are allowed to recover [diminished value](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/diminished-value-claims/) from the at-fault party’s insurance company. When your vehicle experiences an accident, even if it is fully repaired to its pre-loss condition, the resale value decreases. The involvement in a collision makes your car’s value lesser than similar vehicles that have not experienced an accident. A diminished value claim allows you to recoup the losses you might experience when selling your car.

To stay legal on the roads, having car insurance is [mandatory](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/why-is-car-insurance-mandatory/). However, it’s also just a good idea, as not carrying it can have serious financial consequences. If adding additional coverage has you concerned about rising premiums, it may be time to consider a new car insurance policy.
