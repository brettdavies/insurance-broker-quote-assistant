Over 3,000 insurance claims were filed after record-breaking rainfall hit Wisconsin in early August.
[State Farm](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/state-farm/67041/) spokesperson Ton Hartmann said the company had received 3,100 claims from policyholders. [American Family Insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/american-family-insurance/117129/) reported nearly 400 auto claims.
“We have not seen major flooding claims outside Wisconsin,” an American Family Insurance spokesperson said, as quoted by Best Wire.
On Aug. 9, Milwaukee saw 5.74 inches of rain, topping a 65-year record of 1.64 inches, National Weather Service data showed. 
The following day, Madison City recorded 2.07 inches of rainfall, 0.52 inches above its 1887 record.
No deaths had been reported as of Aug. 18, according to the Associated Press. 
Local TV station WISN said officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are expected in southeast Wisconsin this week to begin assessing damage from last weekend’s historic flooding.
WISN reported that initial estimates from Milwaukee County put public infrastructure losses at about $30 million.
Wisconsin Public Radio reported over 13,000 people in southeastern Wisconsin saw property damage from the flash floods. 
Sarah Smith, spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, told the local radio network that flood damage is not covered by standard policies and only about 10,000 residents have flood insurance.
“If you’re paying a $400 annual premium for flood insurance, and only one inch of water can cause $25,000 in damage, that’s a pretty good investment to consider,” Smith told the local radio.
Smith said vehicle owners may have better protection, as most auto insurance covers flood damage. She, however, emphasized that drivers with collision-only coverage are unlikely to be reimbursed.
BestLink data showed that State Farm and American Family Insurance Group were among the largest writers of private passenger automobile insurance in Wisconsin in 2024, ranking second and third, respectively.

State Farm accounted for 16.61% of the market, while American Family held 15.42%. 
[Progressive Insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/progressive-insurance/115985/) Group ranked first with 23.14%, while [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/berkshire-hathaway/535041/) Insurance Group and [Allstate](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/allstate/66989/) Insurance Group ranked fourth and fifth with 4.67% and 4.48%, respectively.
