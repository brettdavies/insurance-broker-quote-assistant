## Average cost of auto insurance in California by coverage level

Car insurance costs in California can differ based on the coverage limit. To legally drive, California residents must adhere to the minimum liability limits of 30/60/15.

[Liability-only insurance policies](https://www.carinsurance.com/coverage-definition/liability-car-insurance.aspx) are the most affordable option and provide the minimum coverage required in California. However, they don’t offer much protection.

While liability insurance protects you from financial loss by covering legal defense and damages if you’re found responsible for causing injury or property damage to others, it doesn’t protect your vehicle or passengers.

On the other hand, [full coverage car insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance) is more expensive, but it offers extensive protection. It helps cover your vehicle in case of accidents, theft, natural disasters, and animal collisions. Full coverage can make you feel more secure, knowing you’re well-protected if something happens.

Full coverage car insurance comprises liability, comprehensive, collision and any other coverage required by your state.

Below, you will find the rates for car insurance in California for different coverage levels.

California’s state minimum coverage costs $551 a year but doesn’t provide much protection for drivers. California drivers may purchase additional coverage, such as [comprehensive](https://www.carinsurance.com/coverage-definition/comprehensive-insurance.aspx) and [collision insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/what-is-collision-coverage-insurance), increase their liability limits, and add personal injury coverage or other endorsements for extra protection.

### How does California’s liability insurance differ from no-fault systems?

California follows a tort system, which differs significantly from no-fault systems in how claims are handled after a car accident.

In California, the driver found to be at fault for an accident is responsible for paying the other party’s damages (medical expenses, property damage, pain and suffering, etc.). Fault is determined by insurance companies or, if contested, by the courts.

California requires drivers to carry liability insurance, which covers damages to others if they are at fault in an accident. It includes bodily injury and property damage. The responsibility for paying for damages depends on who is found to be at fault. The party at fault, or their insurer, pays for the damages and injuries. You can file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver for damages if you’re the injured party.

## Calculate the cost of car insurance in California

A policy that is perfect for someone living in one ZIP code might be expensive for a driver living in another.

When determining insurance premiums, companies study crime rates, traffic conditions, car thefts and population density in different areas. This research helps them assess the associated risk and set competitive policy prices.

This means that residents in California’s higher-risk neighborhoods bear greater financial burdens than those in areas with lower risks.

### How do car insurance rates differ in urban areas compared to rural regions in California?

In California — as in most states — car insurance rates tend to be higher in densely populated urban areas than in sparsely populated rural regions. While every individual’s premium depends on several factors, such as driving record, vehicle type, age, etc., where you live can significantly impact premiums.

Urban areas like Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay Area have higher population densities. This increases the likelihood of accidents, theft and vandalism, which leads to higher premiums. Rural areas have fewer cars on the road, reducing the chances of collisions and claims and resulting in lower rates.

Cities tend to have higher crime rates, including vehicle theft and vandalism, which drives up insurance premiums. Rural areas typically experience lower crime rates, resulting in lower premiums for comprehensive coverage.

## How much is car insurance in California per month?

A full-coverage car insurance policy in California costs $201 monthly for coverage limits of 100/300/100.

Here’s how much you’ll pay in California per month for different coverage limits:

* **State minimum liability-only** coverage costs **$46** a month.
* A **liability-only** policy with limits of 50/100/50 costs **$72** a month.
* **Full coverage** policy with limits of 100/300/100 and $500 deductible costs **$201** per month.

Paying car insurance monthly can offer individuals greater budget flexibility. By spreading the cost over time, they can avoid the strain of a hefty lump sum payment and manage their expenses more comfortably.

Alternatively, paying your car insurance in full upon renewal may earn you a discount. Ultimately, the ideal choice depends on your needs and situation.

## Final thoughts on choosing car insurance in California

When it comes to car insurance, one size doesn’t fit all. Drivers prioritize different things. Some value top-notch customer service and are willing to pay extra for it. Others focus on finding the cheapest rates possible. Some look for insurance companies with user-friendly mobile apps for managing claims and payments.

Understanding your needs and finding the best insurance policy at a great price is important. So, take your time and check out different options to find the right policy for you.
