# Quick question on 3-year safe driving discount

Hello, new customer here.

I was using the online tool to create a quote, and almost had a rate I was happy with. Unfortunately, once I was prompted to enter my VIN, my premium increased by about $200, and I realized the 3-year safe driving discount was removed due to a speeding ticket I received 2 years and 10 months ago. As the coverage period is for 6 months, it is pretty unfortunate timing. My question:

If I go with the coverage I've selected, will I be able to call in after 2 months and have the discount applied, lowering my premium?

Bonus question: If I'd like to, can I opt for lower coverage for these first 2 months to reduce my cost, and then upgrade to full coverage with the discount applied after that 3-year mark has been passed?

Any advice is appreciated.
