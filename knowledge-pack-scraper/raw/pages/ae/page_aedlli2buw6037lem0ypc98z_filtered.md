#### What to Expect?

In the coming weeks, current Progressive Umbrella policyholders in **CT, DE, GA, ID, IL, ME, MD, NJ, PA, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, and WA** will receive a non-renewal notice from Progressive.

However, Progressive may be offering a replacement umbrella policy under their updated “Progressive Umbrella, by ASI” program to some eligible insureds. If you qualify for this replacement, you may receive an offer directly from Progressive to purchase a new policy. These new policies will be identifiable as they begin with letters as a prefix, unlike the current numeric legacy Progressive Umbrella policies.

One of our insurance specialists will be reaching out to you shortly to discuss your specific situation, answer any questions you may have, and provide you with available options for your umbrella insurance needs.

#### Why Progressive is Non-Renewing Personal Umbrella Policies?

Progressive is transitioning all current Progressive Umbrella policies to their updated “Progressive Umbrella, by ASI” program. This move is intended to align their umbrella product with their suite of Progressive Home offerings. They are excited to expand the availability of this upgraded program.
