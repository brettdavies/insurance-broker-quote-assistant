Here are three ways Geico policyholders can get proof of auto insurance:

* Save the insurance documents Geico mails you after you sign up for a policy, unless you’ve opted for electronic delivery.
* Print off digital copies.
* Find your digital insurance cards in Geico’s mobile app. Currently, [Massachusetts](/car-insurance/massachusetts/) and [New Hampshire](/car-insurance/new-hampshire/) do not accept the digital ID cards available through Geico Mobile as valid proof of insurance, and [New Mexico](http://car-insurance/new-mexico/) doesn’t allow digital ID cards through any insurer.

Nearly every state requires drivers to have [car insurance](/car-insurance/), though some states allow drivers to provide proof of financial responsibility instead.

## How to obtain proof of insurance from Geico

[Geico](/reviews/car-insurance/geico/) makes getting a copy of your insurance information easy. Here’s what you need to do:

### How to get a new hard copy of auto insurance proof

If you lost the paper card you were mailed or want another copy, log into your Geico My Account page and select “Auto Policy.” From there, you can view or print policy documents. You can also ask Geico to mail you another copy of your card.

For time sensitive or complex issues related to your policy, call the insurer at 800-861-8380.

### Getting an electronic proof of insurance

If you need [proof of insurance](/car-insurance/proof-of-insurance/) immediately and can’t print it off, download the Geico mobile app to access your digital ID card. Note that you’ll need your username or policy number to log in to Geico’s online account. If you don’t have this information, you may need to contact customer support, which can help you access your account.

### New auto policies: Check your mail for temporary proof of insurance and documents

If you recently bought a policy online, Geico will email you temporary insurance cards you can download. Just find the confirmation email or look for the temporary cards under your My Account Page. Most temporary cards are only valid for about a month.

Geico will also usually mail you an [insurance declaration page](/car-insurance/car-insurance-declaration-page/), insurance identification card and possibly a binder letter. This describes the types of coverage you chose and limits, your [deductibles](/car-insurance/car-insurance-deductible/), and more. All of the insurance paperwork shows when the policy is effective, your policy number and the contact information for Geico.

Any of these documents can serve as proof of insurance, but specific situations call for certain types of proof. It’s wise to keep a physical copy of your insurance ID in your car.

## What counts as auto insurance proof?

The main document you should carry when driving is your ID card because law enforcement usually asks for it. Other documents are only presented at registration or upon request.

### Law enforcement: Insurance ID card

Carry this in your vehicle as proof of insurance so it can be shown when required during traffic stops or [accidents](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/). You may also use this in Canada.

### Lienholders and leasing companies: Proof of coverage form

Show the proof of coverage which details the vehicle, policy effective and expiration dates and coverage limits.

### Courts and state DMVs: SR-22 or FR-44

Obtain an [SR-22](/car-insurance/sr-22-insurance/) or FR-44 form if required for certain driving violations. This Certificate of Financial Responsibility verifies auto insurance [liability coverage](/car-insurance/liability-car-insurance/).

### Maryland only: MD FR-19

Provide a Verification of Coverage (MD FR-19) form when requested by a letter or citation from the [Maryland](/car-insurance/maryland/) Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). This form serves as proof of insurance in Maryland.

You can get the first three documents from Geico’s online service center or by calling customer service at 800-861-8380. However, if you are a Geico policyholder and you need an SR-22 or FR-44, you need to call 877-206-0215.
