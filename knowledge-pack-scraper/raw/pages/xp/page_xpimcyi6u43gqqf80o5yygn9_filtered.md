## At a glance

Bankrate's take

Insurify isn’t an insurance company; it’s a comparison site that allows shoppers to request auto and home insurance quotes from a range of insurance carriers. While this service may offer a convenient shopping tool for some people, getting insurance coverage through Insurify may require you to fill out additional forms on carrier websites or call an agent directly.

* Company highlights

* Does not write insurance policies
* Offers quick online quotes for home and auto insurance
* Mobile app available
* Licensed insurance agency

New

What’s new with Insurify?

* In May 2023, Insurify's [CEO announced](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2023/05/insurify-raises-22m-funding.html?page=all) in an interview that the company had raised $22.4 million, which would be used to acquire properties in an effort to expand and diversify its product. The company had previously announced a $100 million Series B fundraising round, and said it planned to add new products such as pet insurance, travel insurance and small business insurance.
* In March 2023, Insurify announced that it was [purchasing Inspop USA](https://insurify.com/press/news/insurify-to-acquire-compare-com/), which owns the website Compare.com, a pioneer in the U.S. online auto insurance comparison market. This purchase will expand Insurify's reach and enable the company to deliver a more robust shopping experience to consumers across the U.S.

## Insurify car insurance review

Insurify is not a [car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/), but it offers shoppers a quick way to compare quotes from multiple carriers by filling out basic information via the Insurify website or app. While Insurify doesn’t make a full list of its partner companies public, major insurers like Progressive, Liberty Mutual and Nationwide may offer auto insurance through Insurify, along with smaller regional carriers. However, some major carriers — like State Farm — won’t offer quotes through Insurify.

If you’re looking for a new auto insurance provider and prefer to [compare rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) on your own rather than working with an independent agent, a comparison site like Insurify could offer advantages. Insurify offers the ability to compare quotes in one place and reach out to an agent for assistance if you need it — and because Insurify is a licensed agency, it offers access to quotes for all standard coverages, including liability, collision and comprehensive insurance. However, you may need to visit carrier websites and fill out additional forms in order to get [actual quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/), and the rates and customer service you receive through Insurify will vary based on your location, driver profile and the carrier you sign up with, if any.

### Pros and cons of Insurify car insurance

Insurify’s biggest draws are convenience and affordability. By using Insurify’s AI technology to compare insurance quotes based on your profile, you may be able to quickly narrow down the [cheapest car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) for you. However, those advantages are balanced against some downsides of using Insurify’s comparison service.

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Lets you compare multiple car insurance quotes
* Partners with over 75 insurance companies
* Quick, user-friendly sign-up process

![Red circle with an X inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/remove-circle.svg)

### Cons

* Doesn’t underwrite its own policies
* Quotes may change once you finalize your policy with your insurer of choice
* Quotes may be limited or not visible on Insurify’s site

### Insurify car insurance cost

Insurify advertises that its customers save an average of $717 per year when switching car insurance companies. However, because Insurify acts as an agency and doesn’t write its own insurance policies, no data is available to show the average rates quoted to Insurify shoppers. The [cost of auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) through Insurify will depend on which insurance companies you find quotes with, as well as the [individual rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) in your profile, such as your age, driving record and vehicle type.

### Insurify customer satisfaction

Insurify isn’t an insurance company, so customer satisfaction will largely depend on the company you choose for your auto or home insurance. Since Insurify is not the underwriter of your policy, there are no Insurify car insurance reviews. To review the customer service scores of individual companies, you can use third-party agencies. Consider looking at scores from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/) and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioner (NAIC)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) for customer satisfaction, as well as online reviews from real customers in forums like Reddit, TrustPilot and on social media.

### Insurify car insurance discounts

Each car insurance company offers [different discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), so the discounts that apply to your quote will depend on the company you choose. A few of the discounts Insurify may help drivers qualify for include:

* **Bundling discounts:** Insurify offers drivers the option to shop for auto and home insurance together, which could qualify you for a discounted rate on both types of coverage.
* **Paid in full discounts:** Some of the quotes that Insurify displays may be marked as “Pay in full only,” indicating that paying your entire annual premium upfront could earn you a lower rate.
* **Good student discounts:** Insurify asks shoppers to mark whether or not they’re a student in order to calculate possible discounts for good grades.
* **Defensive driving discounts:** If you’ve completed a defensive driving course, Insurify will take that information into account when analyzing quotes.

## Insurify home insurance review

Insurify’s home insurance offerings work the same way as their car insurance: because Insurify is an agency, not a carrier, you can only use it to find and [compare quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) from various [homeowners insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/). As a result, the coverage options, endorsements and discounts available to you will depend on which carriers you receive quotes from. Your location and other rating factors may limit the number of Insurify’s home insurance partners you’re eligible for quotes from.

### Pros and cons of Insurify homeowners insurance

Insurify’s comparison platform might help you find both the best and cheapest home insurance for your needs, but there are upsides and downsides.

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Offers a mix of national and regional insurers
* Allows you to compare numerous quotes at once
* Quoting tool is intuitive and easy to navigate

![Red circle with an X inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/remove-circle.svg)

### Cons

* Not all insurers are available in every state
* Endorsements and discounts will vary based on the insurance company you choose
* Rates could change when you finalize your quote

### Insurify home insurance cost

The [cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) from Insurify depends on which insurer or insurers the comparison service matches you with. The average annual cost of homeowners insurance for $300,000 of dwelling coverage is $2,408, but your exact quotes could vary based on your location, your home’s age and the insurance company you work with. By comparing rates from multiple companies, Insurify could help you find [more affordable home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/).

### Insurify customer satisfaction

Because Insurify is an online agency and not an insurance company, it’s not rated by third parties like J.D. Power and doesn’t have an NAIC complaint index score. However, when you receive quotes through Insurify, you can check these metrics for each quoted insurer along with reviews from real policyholders and Bankrate’s insurance editorial team.

### Insurify home insurance discounts

Each insurer that Insurify partners with will offer its own unique suite of discounts. Some of the [common home insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) that may be offered by carriers include the following:

* **Claims-free discounts:** If you have gone for a certain number of years without filing a claim — often between three and five years — you may be eligible for a discount.
* **Home safety discounts:** Installing devices such as smoke detectors, burglar alarms or a sprinkler system can often earn you a discount.
* **Bundling discounts:** Purchasing your auto insurance from the same company as your homeowners insurance may give you this common discount.
* **Restoration discounts:** Upgrading your home's infrastructure, such as electrical or plumbing systems, may save you money on your policy.
* **New roof discounts:** Aging or damaged roofs may be the cause of expensive claims, so upgrading yours could earn you some savings.
* **Paperless policy:** You can often earn this discount simply by agreeing to receive policy documents via email rather than postal mail.

## Insurify life insurance review

Along with home and auto insurance, Insurify offers a comparison service for [term life insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-term-life-insurance/). As with its other insurance products, Insurify doesn’t sell life insurance directly, but you may be able to find quotes from multiple [life insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/) to compare rates.

The convenience of getting [life insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/life-insurance-quotes/) through Insurify may be a benefit for some shoppers, especially if you don’t have experience comparing life insurance quotes. However, you won’t be able to get quotes for whole life or universal life insurance policies through Insurify, and the quotes you receive may be mixed with ads.

* Pros and cons
* Life insurance riders

### Pros and cons of Insurify life insurance

Comparing life insurance quotes through Insurify could offer advantages to some shoppers, but others might find the downsides outweigh the positives. Here are some pros and cons to keep in mind:

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Partnered with 40 life insurance carriers
* Option for a quick quote or a more in-depth quote based on additional health metrics
* Offers a life insurance calculator to help you decide how much coverage to buy

![Red circle with an X inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/remove-circle.svg)

### Cons

* Only term life insurance quotes are available
* No life insurance tab available on site for easy access to quotes
* May have to click to each carrier’s website to see rates

### Insurify life insurance riders

The [life insurance riders](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/life-insurance-riders/) available to add to your policy will depend on the company you choose. Because Insurify isn’t an insurance company, it doesn’t offer any endorsements directly, but the companies it works with might. Remember that endorsements will likely increase the [cost of your life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/life-insurance-cost/). This means that add-on coverage might not be the right choice if you are looking for the [cheapest life insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/cheap-life-insurance/) possible, but the extra coverage might be worth it for many.

Some common endorsements that you may see offered by life insurance companies include the following:

* **Return of premium:** This option allows for the return of a portion of your premium when the policy ends. If you die while the policy is active, your beneficiaries will receive this money.
* **Spousal rider:** This provides a payout if the policyholder's spouse dies.
* **Disability rider:** If the policyholder becomes disabled, this offers a monthly payout from the policy. Qualifications may vary by provider.
* **Waiver of premium:** If the policyholder becomes disabled, this endorsement would hold the requirement to pay the premium until they are well again.
* **Guaranteed insurability:** This allows the policyholder to change their coverage without the need to take an additional medical exam.
* **Accidental death:** If the policyholder dies due to an accident, beneficiaries may receive double the expected payout.

## Compare Insurify with other insurers

Shopping on a comparison platform can be helpful, but it might not be right for everyone. You may want to compare Insurify’s quote services with your options from specific insurers, including those who don’t participate in comparison platforms.

### Insurify vs. State Farm

Insurify prioritizes the convenience of comparing multiple quotes online, but State Farm’s nationwide network of local agents might offer a different benefit: personalized insurance advice from agents who understand your area. As the largest personal insurance company in the U.S., State Farm has agents in most areas as well as top-rated online and mobile tools and generally low rates. The downside: State Farm only sells insurance through captive agents, so if you want to compare quotes, you’ll need to get other quotes separate from your State Farm quote.

### Insurify vs. Auto-Owners

If you want an insurance company that combines the convenience of multi-quote comparison with the benefits of a local agent, you might want to look at Auto-Owners, which tied for a [2024 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2024/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Budget Auto Insurance Company. Auto-Owners has a wide network of local agents, but its policies are sold through independent agents which means that unlike with State Farm, you’ll have the option to ask your agent to compare Auto-Owners quotes with quotes from other companies.

### Insurify vs. Progressive

Progressive might be appealing if you prefer to get quotes online rather than working with an agent. The company offers car insurance discounts both for policyholders who get quotes online as well as those who sign their insurance policy online. Additionally, the HomeQuote Explorer tool lets you compare rates from several home insurance companies all from Progressive’s site, similar to Insurify.

## Is Insurify a good insurance company?

Insurify is not an insurance company, but it may be a good way for some shoppers to source and compare quotes for auto, home and life insurance. As a licensed insurance agency, Insurify offers online quotes comparison services to shoppers in all 50 states. While the service promises both savings and convenience, some users may find that they don’t receive many quotes and might need to fill out additional forms on carrier websites in order to get final quotes. In addition, some users may see their quotes change between the initial comparison and the finalization of their policy.

## What are real-life customers saying about Insurify?

To get a clearer picture of Insurify’s overall customer satisfaction, we looked at review aggregation sites to hear from people who used the Insurify comparison service to find home, auto or life insurance quotes. Our team analyzed Insurify insurance reviews on two sites: TrustPilot and Shopper Approved. The results were mixed; while many users rated their Insurify experience highly — especially praising Insurify’s customer service agents — others reported troubling experiences like spam calls or confusing text messages.

### TrustPilot

Insurify invites users to submit reviews to TrustPilot, with over 1,000 reviews listed on the site. While 87 percent of those reviews gave Insurify five stars, we found some critical comments highlighting customer pain points like unexpected phone calls.

No on-screen quotes

Didn’t show me any comparable rates on - screen. I had to click on each company. I’d rather just get a list saying this company can do it for this, this one for this, and so on.

### Insurify tools and benefits

While Insurify is mostly an online platform, you always have the option to call for additional help. Working with a representative over the phone could help to resolve any unexpected problems, and some shoppers might be more comfortable getting insurance quotes this way. Shoppers who want assistance over the phone can call 1-866-448-2362, while those who prefer to text can message 1-855-627-3925 for additional support.

Insurify does offer a few tools that may be useful to you as you search for the best policy. These include the following:

* **Car insurance calculator:** Insurify's [car insurance calculator](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/calculator/) allows you to input a few numbers and come up with an [estimate of your car insurance costs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). The calculator also offers sample quotes from a range of companies you might be interested in. If you have questions, however, you may want to talk to a licensed agent before you purchase your policy.
* **Helpful blog:** In addition to the benefit of being able to compare several quotes at once, Insurify offers a helpful [Insights blog](https://insurify.com/insights/) with articles about both home and car ownership.
* **Life insurance calculator:** If you aren’t sure how much life insurance to buy, Insurify offers a [life insurance calculator](https://compare.insurify.com/life/calculator) to help you decide. Keep in mind that this might only be a starting point for your shopping; you may still need to talk to an agent to determine your appropriate coverage level.
