[Non-owner insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-non-owner-car-insurance/#non-owner-insurance-defined) covers property damage and bodily injury to others. It doesn't cover damage to the car you're driving or your injuries. It excludes collision, comprehensive, accident forgiveness, roadside assistance or rental car reimbursement options.
You'll usually need to speak directly with an insurance agent to [get a quote](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-non-owner-car-insurance/#getting-non-owner-car-insurance). Companies like USAA, GEICO and Travelers offer non-owner policies. USAA coverage is exclusive to military community members.
