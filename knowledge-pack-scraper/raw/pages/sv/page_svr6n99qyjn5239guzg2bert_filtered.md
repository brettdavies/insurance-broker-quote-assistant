### What Factors Affect Progressive Car Insurance Quotes?

Every car insurance company considers multiple factors when setting rates. Here are some key factors that may affect your Progressive car insurance premium.

1. **Credit score**

Like most insurers, Progressive may consider your credit history when determining your rate. In states that permit the practice, insurers can use your credit history to create an insurance score, which indicates how likely you are to file a claim.

2. **Location**

The city, town, or ZIP code where you live will also significantly affect your rates. Some cities have higher risk factors from major weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and tornadoes. Others are densely populated, which increases the likelihood that drivers will file claims for accidents, vehicle theft, or vandalism. If you live in a high-risk area, you'll likely pay more for car insurance.

3. **Age**

Driver age also affects monthly premiums, with younger drivers usually paying more than older drivers. Teen drivers pay the most since they are the most likely to be in an accident.

4. **Driving record**

Your driving record plays a major role in what you pay for your auto insurance. Progressive will likely raise your rate if you get a speeding ticket or cause an accident. Drivers concerned about a rate increase can apply for Progressive's Accident Forgiveness program, which guarantees your rate will not increase after our first at-fault accident.

5. **Vehicle usage**

How you use your vehicle also affects how much you'll pay for car insurance. The more you drive, the more likely you are to get into an accident and file a claim; the premiums you pay will reflect this. Drivers who use their vehicles for business purposes or to drive for ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft will need to purchase additional coverage.

### Progressive Insurance for High-Risk Drivers

‍

Several factors can designate you as a high-risk driver, such as a history of parking or speeding tickets, accidents, DUI/DWI violations, being young, or a less-than-ideal credit score.

While not all auto insurance companies are willing to insure individuals with severe offenses like DUI or DWI, there is a notable exception. Progressive stands out as a major insurer that caters to high-risk drivers, especially those with a DUI or DWI on their record. Despite higher premiums associated with severe violations, Progressive secures a spot on [CNBC Select's list of the best car insurance companies for high-risk drivers.](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/)

Progressive's willingness to provide coverage for drivers with such serious violations is a distinctive feature. Additionally, Progressive offers Accident Forgiveness programs for high-risk drivers, allowing policyholders to avoid rate increases following an accident.

‍

When determining car insurance rates, car insurance companies evaluate many, many factors, including the driver’s credit score. Generally speaking, the lower the credit score, the higher the rates. Progressive’s rates are approximately $200 less than the national average for drivers with poor credit.
