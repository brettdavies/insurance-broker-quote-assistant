## Non-Owner Car Insurance: Buying Guide

Finding affordable non-owner car insurance requires comparing quotes from multiple providers since rates vary between companies. Unlike standard car insurance, most companies don't offer online quotes for non-owner insurance; you must call and speak directly with an insurance agent.

This guide walks you through the key steps to get competitive rates and proper protection, from finding insurers that specialize in non-owner policies to maximizing discounts and understanding what coverage actually protects you when driving borrowed or rented vehicles.

### How to Get the Best Cheap Non-Owner Car Insurance

Follow these steps to secure the lowest non-owner car insurance rates available:

1. 1

   Determine if you need non-owner insurance

   Non-owner car insurance makes sense for specific situations, not every driver without a car. You'll benefit from this coverage if you rent vehicles more than twice monthly, regularly borrow cars from friends or family or need an SR-22 filing to reinstate your license after violations. Drivers who rarely operate vehicles shouldn't pay for coverage they won't use. Skip non-owner insurance entirely if you drive less than twice monthly.
2. 2

   Research companies offering non-owner coverage

   Rate differences among insurers can reach up to 60% for the same coverage and driver profiles. Start with Auto-Owners, GEICO, USAA, State Farm and Travelers; our analysis shows these companies offer the most competitive rates nationwide. Get quotes from at least three companies before buying, and avoid contacting insurers that don't actively sell non-owner policies because they tend to quote higher rates to discourage this business.
3. 3

   Choose appropriate coverage levels for your driving patterns

   Choose minimum coverage if you rarely drive expensive vehicles or only need insurance to maintain continuous coverage between owned cars. State minimum [liability coverage costs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/) about 40% less than full coverage non-owner policies. Adult drivers with clean records pay $451 annually for minimum coverage versus $867 for full coverage. Consider higher liability limits only if you often borrow newer vehicles worth $40,000 or more, where state minimums won't adequately protect your assets after serious accidents.
4. 4

   Gather the necessary information

   Gather your driver's license number, Social Security number and current address before calling for quotes. You should also have details about your previous insurance history, including any coverage gaps longer than 30 days. Have documentation ready for violations, accidents or claims from the past five years, as insurers use this information for underwriting decisions. SR-22 filers should verify their state's specific filing requirements before requesting quotes to ensure accurate pricing.
5. 5

   Maximize available discounts

   Determine what discounts you qualify for and prepare to stack each one for maximum savings:

   **Defensive driving courses** reduce premiums 5% to 10% with most insurers and cost $25 to $75 to complete online. These discounts last three years before requiring course renewal. GEICO, State Farm and Travelers all honor defensive driving discounts, though you'll need a clean record for at least three years to qualify.

   **Multi-policy bundling** saves 10% to 20% on combined premiums even though you don't own a vehicle. State Farm offers bundling discounts averaging 17% when combining non-owner auto with renters insurance, while GEICO provides similar savings around 13%. **Pay-in-full discounts** save 5% to 8% with most insurers by paying your entire six-month premium upfront instead of monthly. A $468 annual GEICO policy costs $39 monthly ($468 total) or $432 if paid in full upfront, saving $36 yearly.

   **Paperless and auto-pay discounts** reduce premiums 3% to 5% through electronic billing and automatic payments. GEICO and Progressive offer the most generous paperless discounts at 5%, while State Farm provides 3%.

   **Good student discounts** save 8% to 25% for young adult drivers who maintain B averages or 3.0 GPAs. Travelers offers 8% savings for students, while State Farm provides up to 25% off for high achievers.

   **Military and federal employee discounts** reach up to 45% below competitors with USAA for military families. GEICO provides federal employee discounts up to 8% for government workers who don't qualify for USAA membership.
6. 6

   Evaluate the cheapest non-owner car insurance companies

   Check A.M. Best ratings before purchasing to confirm financial strength: GEICO, State Farm and Travelers maintain A++ ratings. Match service models to your preferences based on customer experience scores and coverage options. The cheapest insurance doesn't always provide the best value. Consider whether paying slightly more monthly buys services you'll actually use, like agent networks or broader coverage options.
7. 7

   Request multiple quotes to compare pricing and coverage options

   Call each company directly since online quotes aren't available for non-owner policies. Ask about multi-policy discounts, good driver rates and any available promotions that could lower your premium. Ensure you're comparing identical coverage limits between insurers and consider your state's minimum requirements as your baseline.
8. 8

   Review policy terms and conditions

   Understand exactly what's covered and excluded in your policy. Non-owner insurance doesn't cover the vehicle you're driving or your own injuries, only liability for damage you cause to others.
9. 9

   Purchase the policy and keep the documentation handy

   Get immediate proof of insurance after buying, especially if you need SR-22 filing. Request both physical insurance cards and digital copies through your insurer's mobile app. Keep the documentation easily accessible on your phone and in your wallet, as you'll need to show proof when renting vehicles or if you're stopped by law enforcement. SR-22 certificates are filed electronically with your state's DMV, but verify the filing was completed within three business days to prevent license suspension due to delays.

### Average Cost of Non-Owner Car Insurance

Non-owner car insurance costs less than standard policies since these policies exclude comprehensive and collision coverage. Drivers with clean records pay around $578 annually for minimum coverage non-owner policies compared to [$1,164 for standard minimum coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-the-average-cost-of-car-insurance-month-year/), cutting costs by $586 yearly.

Standard policies cost more because they protect the insured vehicle against theft, vandalism, weather damage and collision repairs. Non-owner insurance excludes these coverages since you don't own the car you're driving; the vehicle owner maintains comprehensive and collision protection.

| Driver Profile | Non-Owner Annual Rate | Standard Annual Rate | Non-Owner Annual Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean Record | $578 | $1,164 | $586 |
| Speeding Ticket | $780 | $1,543 | $763 |
| At-Fault Accident | $867 | $1,649 | $782 |
| Bad Credit | $867 | $1,884 | $1,017 |
| DUI/Major Violation | $1,271 | $1,895 | $624 |
| Show more | | | |

[Bad credit](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-bad-credit/) results in the biggest savings gap at $1,017 annually because standard policies heavily penalize poor credit scores with higher comprehensive and collision premiums, coverages that non-owner policies don't include.

[At-fault accidents](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-cheap-car-insurance-after-accident/#best-cheap-insurance-after-accident) and [speeding tickets](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/#best-high-risk-premiums) also lead to savings of $782 and $763 per year. Even [DUI convictions](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-after-a-dui/) save you $624 annually with non-owner coverage, though you'll still pay higher premiums overall because of the violation's severity.

### What Does Non-Owner Car Insurance Cover?

Non-owner car insurance, [even with SR-22 forms](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/non-owner-sr-22-insurance/), offers liability coverage for property damage and bodily injury you cause to others when driving a vehicle you don't own. This coverage covers the other driver's medical bills, vehicle repairs and property damage after at-fault accidents, shielding you from lawsuits and out-of-pocket costs.

Non-owner policies don't cover damage to the vehicle you're driving or your own injuries. Those are covered by the vehicle owner's insurance or your health insurance.

[State minimum liability limits](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/) range from $25,000 to $50,000 per person for bodily injury, with total per-accident limits between $50,000 and $100,000. Property damage coverage usually begins at $10,000 to $25,000 per accident. You can choose higher limits to protect your assets if you're involved in serious accidents.

You can add coverage for:

* Medical payments
* Personal injury protection
* [Uninsured/underinsured motorists](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-uninsured-motorist-insurance-and-do-you-need-it/)
* [Rental car liability](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/rental-car-insurance/)

### Non-Owner Car Insurance vs. Standard Car Insurance

Non-owner policies follow the driver rather than covering specific vehicles, providing only liability protection that meets state minimum requirements. Standard car insurance attaches to particular vehicles and includes comprehensive and collision coverage for physical damage. The table below compares what each policy type covers:

| Coverage | Standard Car Insurance | Non-Owner Car Insurance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Liability insurance | Yes | Yes |
| Medical payments coverage | Yes | Yes |
| Personal injury protection | Yes | Yes |
| Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage | Yes | Yes |
| [Rental car liability](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/rental-car-insurance/) | Yes | Yes |
| Collision insurance | Yes | No |
| Comprehensive insurance | Yes | No |
