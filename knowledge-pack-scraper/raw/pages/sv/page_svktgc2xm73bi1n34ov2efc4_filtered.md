## GEICO vs. Nationwide: car insurance rate comparison

Choosing a [car insurance company](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) can be tough: companies' rates differ by [driving history](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/), [age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) and [location](https://www.thezebra.com/states/).

Cheapest average rates

GEICO is cheaper on average, with a **monthly rate of $110** compared to Nationwide's **$139**. However, this can vary from person to person, so it's always a good idea to [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) from many different insurers to see which policy is most affordable.

### GEICO vs. Nationwide: pricing by credit score

If you have [very poor credit](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/), Nationwide could be the way to go. On average, Nationwide offers more affordable rates than GEICO for drivers with credit scores of less than 580. Drivers with outstanding credit — a score of 800 or better — could consider both carriers as premiums are relatively close, with a difference of just $27 per year. View common insurance rates by credit level for Nationwide and GEICO below.

##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: NATIONWIDE VS. GEICO

### GEICO vs. Nationwide: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving résumé, Nationwide could be a better choice than GEICO, though the rates are very similar to one another. Each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: NATIONWIDE VS. GEICO

| **Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Nationwide avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $1,836 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $1,475 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $2,691 |
| Reckless driving | $2,238 | $2,508 |
| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $1,469 |

### GEICO vs. Nationwide: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Nationwidel: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $116, compared to Nationwide.

##### RATES BY AGE: NATIONWIDE VS. GEICO

| **Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Nationwide avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $3,508 | $3,624 |
| **20s** | $1,438 | $1,582 |
| **30s** | $1,218 | $1,582 |
| **40s** | $1,189 | $1,151 |
| **50s** | $1,160 | $1,114 |
| **60s** | $1,065 | $1,028 |

Costs aside, GEICO and Nationwide both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and [compare rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before making a decision.

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Tie

---

Both GEICO and Nationwide can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Nationwide. They are evenly matched by The Zebra's editorial review and A.M. Best, and receive lower than the average number of complaints.  For these reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.

---

### GEICO vs. Nationwide: home insurance rate comparison

Nationwide's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,236. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.

![Cheapest average rates]()

Based on the data we have available, **Nationwide has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $119 per month**.
