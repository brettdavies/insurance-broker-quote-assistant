Both GEICO and Nationwide can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Nationwide. They are evenly matched by The Zebra's editorial review and A.M. Best, and receive lower than the average number of complaints. For these reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.
* * *
Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
Based on the data we have available, **Nationwide has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $119 per month**.

I'm sorry to hear about the damage (and the sweater!). The good news is that since you are in California, glass claims should not impact your premium. In most locations, it's up to the discretion of the insurer to raise rates based on glass claims but in California, specifically, not-at-fault claim…

Yes, when your company has to pay out on a claim, it will impact your rates. If you file a police report and have uninsured motorist property damage coverage, this coverage will pay for the damages and will be considered a not-at-fault accident. Not-at-fault accidents will stay on your record for u…
