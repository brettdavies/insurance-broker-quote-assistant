Does your friend have significant assets? And what do you mean by "some injuries but nothing major"? A family of five spending a few days in a hospital being treated for head or spinal trauma or a broken bone or two or three can get into six-figure territory quickly.
The letter could just be boilerplate and not a serious indication of a risk of loss exceeding policy limits, but if I'm your friend, I'm getting more details from the adjuster. What's the extent of the injuries being claimed? Total medical bills claimed? Property damage too (if he wrecked a high end sports car, $100K in PD limit likely isn't enough). What's been demanded? I'd want to understand all these things before responding about whether I'd contribute to a settlement (and I'm not sure I'd ever answer that question directly).

They are looking to see if there is any additional coverage or umbrella policies. The injuries likely going to exceed the limits of $250000/$500000.

Former Nj GEICO associate. NJ is a highly litigious state. The letter is advising the recipient of a concern for their limits and advising them of their rights to retain their own counsel if they so wish. 250/500/100 is generally good coverage. I would start by asking my adjuster if any demands for settlement of bodily injury/ property damage have been made/ how many people are injured/ what the injuries are. I think this is called an Excess Letter. I would ask what specifically triggered its release. Most likely CYA situation for them just in case. Your adjuster will give you a pretty generic response as they can’t get into specifics. What was the accident like- lots of cars involved, heavy damages, someone obviously injured? Most everyone in NJ car accidents is claiming neck/ back herniations, getting MRIs and injections, and have a surgical recommendations so it’s not that far off base to have an Excess concern on most claims in NJ. But a claimant more likely than not has to vault what is called the verbal threshold/ limited tort option. This requires meeting the criteria set out by the state for serious/ permanent injuries in order to be entitled to compensation. So without knowing exactly what the details are it’s impossible to tell if the concern is justified.

They're simply warning him that the claims may exceed his limits.
Your friend has pretty substantial limits. Unless there were fatalities or VERY substantial injuries involved, I don't think I would worry about it too much. If he had minimum limits, I'd be telling your friend that he should absolutely be freaking out.

Without more information we can only give generalizations. I mean, they could total a typical caddy, BMW, Range Rover etc and exceed the 100k PD easily. Or if it’s a multiple vehicle accident. It’s just simply a notification that the claim could exceed the limits. They have to notify you. What happens next is your friend will talk to their adjuster if they need to.

All the other comments on this thread have answered the question. But, OP, if I were you, I would strongly consider getting quotes for a $2M umbrella.

Why not 10 million? I looked up for NY top judgments, over $1MM is quite rare. I also looked at RLIs payouts.
If such judgments were common umbrella would cost thousands.

So geico policy (at least in Florida) on every 10/20 or 20/40 and lower we send out these excess letters. Just as kind of a "just in case." If we had something like a 25/50 and tender that then we'd send out the letter as well. I'd never even think so send out one of these on a 250/500.... it's possible it was just a mistake because it's basically a form letter where you fill out the BI limits and PD limits and the adjuster could have just been on auto pilot. I'd have him call and ask.

I just received this letter in VA, should I be worried? I’m getting all the information for my lawyer, but I’m a teacher with no money to spare 😭
