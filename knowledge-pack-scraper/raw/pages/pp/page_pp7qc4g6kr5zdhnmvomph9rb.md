* * *
### GEICO vs. Safeco: pricing by credit score
If you have [very poor credit](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/), GEICO could be the way to go. On average, GEICO offers more affordable rates than Safeco for drivers with credit scores of less than 580. Drivers with outstanding credit — a score of 800 or better — should consider GEICO as well, offering lower rates by $591. View common insurance rates by credit level for Safeco and GEICO below.
##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: SAFECO VS. GEICO
**Credit score** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $2,051 | $5,308  
Fair (580-669) | $1,358 | $2,716

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### GEICO vs. Safeco: rates for high-risk drivers
If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving résumé, GEICO could be a better choice than Safeco, though the rates are very similar to one another. Each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: SAFECO VS. GEICO
**Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $2,546  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $1,969  
DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $2,796  
Reckless driving | $2,238 | $2,853  
Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $2,512  
### GEICO vs. Safeco: rates by age
Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Safeco: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $4,257, compared to Safeco.
##### RATES BY AGE: SAFECO VS. GEICO
**Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $3,508 | $7,765  
**20s** | $1,438 | $2,566  
**30s** | $1,218 | $2,566  
**40s** | $1,189 | $2,128  
**50s** | $1,160 | $1,114  
**60s** | $1,065 | $1,028  
Costs aside, GEICO and Safeco both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and [compare rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before making a decision.

### Which company comes out on top?
#### Tie
* * *
Both GEICO and Safeco can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Safeco. GEICO excels in third-party scores but Safeco offers affordable rates and optional add-ons. For these reasons, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.
* * *
### GEICO vs. Safeco: home insurance rate comparison
Safeco's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,236. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
Cheapest average rates
Based on the data we have available, **Safeco has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $108 per month**.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### GEICO vs. Safeco: homeowners discount comparison
As with car insurance, [home insurance discounts](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/home-insurance-discounts/) can be a great way for eligible policyholders to enjoy additional savings. While both GEICO and Safeco offer homeowners discounts, neither are particularly wide-ranging. Still, as the companies tend to have more affordable rates in general, this may be less of a drawback than with other insurers. See how these discounts compare below.
GEICO VS. SAFECO: HOMEOWNERS DISCOUNT COMPARISON
Discount comparison | GEICO | Safeco  
---|---|---  
Claims free  |  |   
Recent home buyer  |  |
