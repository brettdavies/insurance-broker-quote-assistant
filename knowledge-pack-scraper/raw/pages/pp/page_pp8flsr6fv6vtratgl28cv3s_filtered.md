As a general rule, no, **Bodily Injury Liability insurance is not required in Florida**. This kind of insurance covers the medical expenses of anyone injured by the policyholder in a car accident, but the vast majority of drivers in this state are not legally required to carry such policies.

If you are injured by a negligent driver, you have the right to pursue financial compensation from them, no matter what kind of insurance they do or do not have. Our [car accident lawyers](https://www.meldonlaw.com/gainesville/car-accident-lawyer/) can help you to better understand Florida’s insurance laws so that you can get fair compensation for your injuries.

## What to Know About Bodily Injury Liability in Florida

You are not alone if you have questions about what insurance Florida requires. Here, our founder, Jeffrey Meldon, shares his wisdom on why sufficient insurance is of utmost importance if you are involved in a serious accident with injuries – no matter who causes the crash.

Whether Bodily Injury Liability (BI) coverage is required or not has three main areas of law to consider:

1. Bodily Injury Liability coverage is not required to drive an automobile in Florida legally. However, it can be required if you have been convicted of a DUI. [Under Florida Statutes § 324.023](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2023/0324.023), *“Financial responsibility for bodily injury or death,”* **you must have Bodily Injury insurance if you are convicted of a DUI**. If you were convicted on or before October 1, 2007, the minimum requirement is $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident. If you were convicted after October 1, 2007, the minimum required is $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. According to the Statute, you must have BI coverage for 3 years after the return of your driving privileges.
2. Suppose you choose to drive without BI coverage. In that case, it is important to know that Florida has a Florida Financial Responsibility Law, which requires that a person who is at fault for an accident must provide financial coverage of at least $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. This means that, if you cause an accident that results in bodily injuries to another person(s), you must either have BI insurance or post a bond for the required amount of coverage. If this “responsibility” is unmet, you can lose your driving privileges. You will also be required to make financial arrangements to pay for any judgment against you for property damage and bodily injuries before you can get your driver’s license reinstated.
3. While it is true that Bodily Injury Liability insurance is not required of most Florida drivers, drivers in certain occupations do need to carry this insurance. For example, as [Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV)](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) explains, **taxis are required to have BI insurance**, just in case the taxi driver ever causes an injury accident.

As an accident attorney who has seen the devastation caused by inadequate insurance coverage, I not only advise that you have Bodily Injury Liability but that you have more than the minimum to protect yourself and your assets fully. Specifically, I recommend a minimum of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.

## What Is the Difference Between Bodily Injury and Personal Injury in Florida?

Bodily Injury Liability insurance will cover the accident-related medical expenses of the policyholder injuries in a car accident. Personal Injury Protection will help cover **the policyholder’s own medical expenses, [regardless of who caused the traffic accident](https://www.meldonlaw.com/blog/is-florida-a-no-fault-state-car-accidents/)**.

Another difference between BI and PIP is that PIP **is required under Florida law**. All drivers must have at least $10,000 of PIP coverage.

## What Does Bodily Injury Liability Insurance Cover?

BI will cover any injuries, including fatal injuries, the policyholder inflicted on others. **It only covers bodily injuries**. To recover compensation for lost or damaged property—for example, a smashed-up car—a car accident victim must file a claim with the at-fault driver’s Property Damage Liability (PDL) insurance policy.

PDL, like PIP, **is not optional**. Florida drivers are required to carry a minimum of $10,000 in PDL coverage.

## Whose Car Insurance Should You File an Accident Claim With?

If you have PIP coverage, you can file a claim with your own insurance company to seek reimbursement for medical care. If your injuries are so severe that your bills exceed your policy limits, it may be time to figure out how to get fair compensation from the at-fault party’s insurance coverage. This could mean:

* Filing a claim with their BI insurance company for your bodily injuries
* Filing a claim with their PDL insurance company for your property loss
* Suing them personally, if they do not have enough insurance coverage to pay for all of your damages

Figuring out how to file a car accident claim, who to file with, and how much your claim is worth is not easy.
