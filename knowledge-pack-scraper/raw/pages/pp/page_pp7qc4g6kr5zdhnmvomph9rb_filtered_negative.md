Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-vs-safeco/)
In general, Safeco provides good homeowners insurance coverage at relatively affordable rates. The company offers all of the basic coverage types one would expect, plus additional options for [valuable items](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/scheduled-personal-property-coverage/) and [equipment breakdowns](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/equipment-breakdown-coverage/). The company tends to be among the cheapest home insurance providers, which could certainly be appealing for some. However, customer satisfaction scores remain below average, meaning that customers looking for a high level of service may be disappointed.

* **The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey — N/A:** Safeco was not included in The Zebra's homeowners insurance customer survey.
* **Financial strength — Excellent:** Safeco's excellent financial strength — tracked by AM Best — indicates a strong ability to pay out claims.
* **NAIC rating — Poor:** The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) received more complaints than average regarding Safeco in 2020.

Both GEICO and Safeco can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Safeco. GEICO excels in third-party scores but Safeco offers affordable rates and optional add-ons. For these reasons, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.
* * *
Safeco's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,236. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
Based on the data we have available, **Safeco has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $108 per month**.

As with car insurance, [home insurance discounts](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/home-insurance-discounts/) can be a great way for eligible policyholders to enjoy additional savings. While both GEICO and Safeco offer homeowners discounts, neither are particularly wide-ranging. Still, as the companies tend to have more affordable rates in general, this may be less of a drawback than with other insurers. See how these discounts compare below.
