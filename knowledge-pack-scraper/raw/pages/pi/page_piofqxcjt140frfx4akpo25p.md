# What’s new?
Consumer Reports has updated the Privacy Policy that applies to our family of digital services, print publications, our other products, services and programs, and our associated websites, applications and digital tools.
This Privacy Policy has been revised to reflect updates in the law and in our practices.
Consumer Reports (which we refer to in this policy as “CR”, “we” or “us”) is an independent, nonprofit member organization that works side by side with consumers for truth, transparency, and fairness in the marketplace. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information through our products and services.
### Scope
This Privacy Policy covers the Consumer Reports family of digital services, print publications, websites, mobile applications, and digital tools that refer to or provide an authorized link to this Privacy Policy, and associated products, services and programs, including those related to our consumer policy and mobilization activities (collectively "CR Products"). 
### How We Collect Information
Information you give us   
You may give us different types of information when you purchase a Consumer Reports product or service or otherwise engage with us, including:   

  

  * Identifiers such as contact information, name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, mobile number, user name and password
  * Professional or employment-related information, such as the name of the business or organization you’re associated with, your title, and the business or organization's address, telephone number, and email address
  * Audio, electronic, visual or similar information such as your photograph, an audio recording or a video of you
  * Billing and payment card information where needed for payment
  * Information about you and your household, including birthday and demographic information (e.g., age, gender and geographic location)
  * Information about your experiences with specific products and services, including product models you own or considered
  * Your opinions, actions and experiences regarding various topics and consumer policy issues
  * Inferences based on the information we collect from or about you to create a profile reflecting your interests and preferences
  * Information, including search and chat query information, relevant to your product research, ownership and/or purchases.


We may match the information we collect from you directly with the information we receive about you from other sources, and use such information along with information from those other sources.
Please note that personal information you submit to a CR publication or elect to post in a public area of a digital service is public. If you don’t want people to know your name, email address, or other information that identifies you personally, do not include that information in your public posts. 
Additionally, you may choose to provide us with certain “sensitive personal information” to use in our reporting about consumer matters and in our advocacy work. We request that you not provide us with any Social Security number, financial account information, or similar sensitive personal information data when sharing your experiences with us.
Information collected when you use our products and services  
  
We and our service providers collect certain information automatically about your online activities and your devices through technical means, including through the use of [cookies, web beacons, and other technologies](https://www.consumerreports.org/customerservice/privacy-policy/cookies/). This information may include the following:
  

  * Internet or other electronic network activity information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which is a unique numerical address that identifies your computer or other device when you access the Internet), your browser, device type and operating system, name of your Internet service provider, and your browsing history (including addresses of the websites you access before and after you visit Consumer Reports).
  * Geo-location information which includes information about your real-world location at a given time based on latitude and longitude, as well as your general geographic area or more precise information about your street-level location. Geo-location information may be derived from your IP address, which can be used to identify your general geographic area at a city or postal code level, from our online and mobile websites, applications and digital tools, which may collect precise information about your computer’s or device’s geographic location, and through other means. Information about your interactions with our content, Consumer Reports ads and communications, including the areas you visit on CR digital services and which of our Consumer Reports ads and content you see on other organizations’ websites (such as the Consumer Reports Facebook page) and whether you open email messages from us or click on Consumer Reports ads served by our ad partners when you visit other websites on which our ads appear.
  * Device information, including the device type you use to access our digital services, your device’s operating system, and unique device identifier information (which is a unique alphanumeric character string associated with an individual user’s smartphone or similar handheld device).


We may use chatbots, image scans, and other automated technologies provided by third parties. Information you provide during your interaction may be processed by us and/or those third parties to provide, manage and improve our products and services. 
Information we obtain from other sources   
  
We collect additional information about you from other sources to help us correct and supplement our records, improve the quality of our products or services, and personalize your experience. These sources include service providers who provide us with your IP address in order to customize our service; payment service providers who provide us with information to process your payment; data providers who provide us with demographic, interest based and online advertising related data; organizations with which we have a business relationship to provide products and services to you; and information available through publicly available sources such as open government databases and publicly available posts on social media platforms.
The type of additional information we collect from these sources include your updated mailing address, payment card information, information from social media sources, engagement with our content (for example, comments or shares on our Facebook page), information about products and services you access through our business partners (for example, if you purchase a vehicle through our Car Buying service), information about your interests (e.g., pets, sports, travel, and cars), demographic data (e.g., age, gender, general income bracket, ethnicity, and children in household), and for certain of our consumer policy and mobilization activities, your legislative district information.

**Collection, Processing, and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**
Subject to your consent where required by applicable law, we collect, process, and disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes of providing goods or services as requested; conducting analytics; conducting research including providing consumer insights and data to manufacturers, regulators, researchers and other third parties to help improve the marketplace; informing our testing, reporting and editorial, consumer policy, and mobilization activities; activities relating to product improvement; and other collection and processing that is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about an individual. We do not use Sensitive Personal Information beyond these purposes.
Please note that personal information you submit to a CR publication or elect to post in a public area of a digital service is public. If you don’t want people to know your name, email address, or other information that identifies you personally, do not include that information in your public posts. Additionally, you may choose to provide us with certain “sensitive personal information” to use in our reporting about consumer matters and in our advocacy work. We request that you not provide us with any Social Security number, financial account information, or similar sensitive personal information data when sharing your experiences with us.
**Retention Period**
We retain each category of Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was collected. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: 
  

  * The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; 
  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you, for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services, and the length of time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need to reference your Personal Information to address issues that may arise; 
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them; and 
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position, such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations. 


We will endeavor not to keep personal information in a form that allows a Data Subject to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the permitted purposes. At the end of the applicable retention period, we may destroy, erase from our systems, or anonymize personal information as part of such efforts.

When Consumer Reports transmits information over the Internet, we work to protect the information through the use of data encryption methods.   
  
While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of information we collect via our websites and other online properties, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

### Special Terms for International Visitors
The following section applies to persons from a country outside of the United States (“Data Subjects”):
Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information   
Under applicable laws in countries other than the United States, entities like CR that act as data controllers in connection with the processing of personal information must have a lawful basis for processing that information. CR needs to collect and process certain types of personal information from Data Subjects in order to provide CR Products and otherwise comply with our legal obligations. The lawful bases that we rely upon to process the personal information held about Data Subjects are as follows:
  

  * To carry out our obligations arising from our agreements with Data Subjects, such as membership, subscriptions and donations, and to take steps at Data Subjects’ request prior to entering into such agreements.
  * To send communications to Data Subjects about our activities and offerings to the extent we have Data Subject consent or when doing so is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of Data Subjects).
  * To comply with our legal obligations.
  * For consumer policy and mobilization purposes carried out in CR’s legitimate interests and in compliance with your fundamental rights and freedoms.
  * For direct marketing purposes carried out in CR’s legitimate interests and in compliance with your fundamental rights and freedoms.


  
Retention Period  
We retain each category of Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was collected. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:  
  

  * The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; 
  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you, for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services, and the length of time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need to reference your Personal Information to address issues that may arise; 
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them; and 
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position, such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations. 

We will endeavor not to keep personal information in a form that allows a Data Subject to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the permitted purposes. At the end of the applicable retention period, we may destroy, erase from our systems, or anonymize personal information as part of such efforts.  
  
Storage and Transfer of Personal Information   
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Data Subjects’ personal information, prevent unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal information, and prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or accidental loss of, or damage to, such information.
We may process personal information in, and transfer personal information to, countries that may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal information as the country in which Data Subjects reside, and which may not have received an adequacy decision from the European Commission.
Personal information will also be processed by staff who work for us and operate outside the European Economic Area. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of administration and support services. All such staff are subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.
We restrict access to non-public personal information about Data Subjects to those of our employees and agents who need to know the information to enable us to provide services.
For more information about steps we take to protect your personal data, please click [here](https://www.consumerreports.org/customerservice/privacy-policy/protection-of-information/).  
  
Rights in relation to Personal Information   
Data Subjects have certain rights in relation to their personal information, including the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal information, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.  
These include, where certain conditions are met:
  

  * the right to request access to the personal information we hold about them
  * the right to have inaccurate information about them amended or updated
  * the right to object to processing of personal information about them
  * the right to withdraw consent at any time (where relevant)
  * the right to have personal information about them erased or to restrict processing in certain limited situations
  * the right to lodge complaints with applicable data supervisory authorities.


Data Subjects should use the contact information below to get more information and/or to make a formal request.
We will endeavor to keep the personal information we store about Data Subjects reasonably accurate and up-to-date by enabling Data Subjects to correct it by request or by logging into their account and correcting it directly. Data Subjects should notify us if any of their personal information changes or if they become aware of any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold about them.
