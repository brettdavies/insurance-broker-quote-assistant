## FALSE ADVERTISING COMPLAINTS IN THE PHILIPPINES

*A comprehensive legal primer (updated to 3 July 2025)*

> **Synopsis —** Philippine law treats false, deceptive, or misleading advertising as a consumer‐protection offense that can give rise to **administrative, civil, and criminal liability.** The principal statute is the **Consumer Act of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7394)**, supported by sector-specific laws (e.g., Food and Drug Administration Act, Insurance Code, Competition Act) and self-regulatory codes (e.g., Advertising Standards Council Code of Ethics). What follows is an all-in-one guide to the substantive rules, enforcement architecture, remedies, procedures, penalties, jurisprudence, and practical tips for complainants and advertisers alike.

---

### 1. Substantive Legal Framework

| Source of law | Key provisions related to false advertising |
| --- | --- |
| **RA 7394 (Consumer Act)**, Title III, Art. 97-109 | Defines “false, deceptive or misleading advertisement”; prohibits it; empowers the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to act *motu proprio* or on complaint; authorises civil, administrative & criminal actions. |
| **Philippine Competition Act (RA 10667)**, §4(p), §14(d) | Labels “deceptive marketing practices” as an anti-competitive act; PCC may investigate where harm transcends individual consumer injury. |
| **Food and Drug Administration Act (RA 9711)** & **Generics Act (RA 6675)** | False therapeutic claims or unsubstantiated “all-natural”/“FDA-approved” statements are violations; FDA has recall and license-revocation powers. |
| **Revised Penal Code, Art. 318 (“Other deceits”)** | Subsidiary criminal provision for fraudulent advertising where RA 7394 is inapplicable. |
| **Special sector statutes** (Insurance Code, Securities Regulation Code, BSP Consumer Protection Framework, etc.) | Misrepresentation in ads for financial and investment products creates specialised liability alongside RA 7394. |
| **ASC Code of Ethics**, **KBP Broadcast Code**, **MTRCB guidelines** | Self-regulation; violation can result in ad takedown, suspension of airtime, or refusal of prior-screening approval. |

### 2. What Counts as “False, Deceptive, or Misleading”?

A representation (text, image, audio, video, influencer post, hashtag, meta-tag, or algorithmically generated message) is unlawful if **any** of the following is true:

1. **Material falsity** – It contains an outright untruth (e.g., “0 grams sugar” when sugar is present).
2. **Half-truth or omission** – It conveys a fact but hides a qualification that would alter consumer expectations (e.g., “lifetime warranty” that actually covers only parts, not labour).
3. **Overstatement of performance/value** – Claims that cannot be substantiated by competent evidence or standard testing (the *“clinically proven to whiten in 1 week”* type of claim).
4. **Passing-off** – Suggests affiliation or certification that does not exist (displaying a counterfeit FDA Certificate of Product Registration).
5. **Bait-and-switch** – Lures consumers with a non-existent bargain to sell higher-priced goods.

*Note:* Puffery (“World’s best burger!”) is generally tolerated if clearly subjective opinion, but the line is crossed when quantifiable or verifiable attributes are invoked.

### 3. Enforcement Architecture

| Agency | Jurisdiction & Typical Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **DTI-FTEB / regional Consumer Welfare & Business Regulation Offices** | General consumer goods & services (appliances, clothing, e-commerce platforms, travel promos). |
| **FDA** | Food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices (e.g., “cures diabetes” herbal ads). |
| **Department of Agriculture / Bureau of Animal Industry** | Fertilisers, veterinary products, feeds. |
| **PCC** | Industry-wide deceptive marketing that distorts competition (e.g., concerted green-washing). |
| **BSP / Insurance Commission / SEC** | Financial products, digital banking ads, securities crowd-funding pitches. |
| **Advertising Standards Council (ASC)** | Self-regulatory pre-screening of national ads; disapproval prevents airing/printing. |

*Multiple-gate* rule: A single ad can be the subject of parallel proceedings (ASC takedown + DTI administrative fine + consumer civil damages + DOJ criminal prosecution), provided there is no double jeopardy for the criminal component.

### 4. How to File a False Advertising Complaint

| Step | What the complainant must do | Time limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 – Prepare Complaint-Affidavit** | State facts, identify ad, explain falsity, attach evidence (screenshots, receipts, lab tests, sworn consumer statements). | RA 7394 has *no prescriptive period* for administrative complaints, but civil actions must be filed **within 2 years** from discovery of the deceptive act. |
| **2 – Lodge with Proper Agency** | File at DTI regional office, FDA Center for Food Regulation, etc., depending on product. Venue is where complainant resides or where the ad was produced/seen. | None |
| **3 – Mediation (10 calendar days)** | Mandatory under DTI Mediation Rules. If settlement reached, case is closed; otherwise it escalates. | 10 days (+10-day extendible) |
| **4 – Adjudication/Administrative Hearing** | Position papers, presentation of expert evidence, chance for voluntary corrective advertising. | Decision **within 30 days** of submission for resolution. |
| **5 – Appeal** | To DTI Secretary (or agency head) within 15 days; further appeal to Court of Appeals under Rule 43. | 15 days, extendible once |

No filing fee is charged for DTI complaints; parties shoulder their own testing costs. **Online filing** via the **DTI e-Complaint Portal** and **OneFDA platform** has been fully operational since 2023, allowing attachment of large video files.

### 5. Remedies & Penalties

| Mode | Possible sanctions |
| --- | --- |
| **Administrative (DTI/FDA)** | • Fine: *₱500 – ₱300,000 per transaction* (higher range introduced by RA 11967 in 2024, adjusted every 3 years for inflation) |
| • Suspension or cancellation of business/ product-registration license |  |
| • *Corrective advertising order* (cost borne by advertiser) |  |
| • Product recall or permanent ban |  |
| **Civil (Regional Trial Court)** | • Actual damages (refund, consequential losses) |
| • Moral & exemplary damages |  |
| • Attorney’s fees |  |
| • *Class action* available under RA 7394 §6; public interest group or OFT may sue on behalf of consumers. |  |
| **Criminal (filed by DOJ upon agency referral)** | • Imprisonment: *1 month – 6 months* and/or fine *₱1,000 – ₱50,000* (ranges doubled by Art. 315 RPC if fraud proven) |
| • Accessory penalties: closure, confiscation of materials, deportation of alien offenders. |  |
| **Self-regulation (ASC/KBP)** | • “DO‐NOT-AIR” or “DO-NOT-PRINT” orders |
| • Mandatory excision of offending scenes |  |
| • Public apology notices. |  |

### 6. Evidentiary Standards

| Claim Type | Minimum supporting proof |
| --- | --- |
| Quantifiable performance (e.g., “whitens by 3 shades”) | Independent laboratory test following Philippine National Standards or ISO equivalent. |
| Price savings (e.g., “50 % off”) | Previous 30-day price history, audited by the same SKU. |
| Health or therapeutic claims | Randomised controlled clinical trial or accepted pharmacopoeial monograph reviewed by FDA’s Center for Drug Regulation. |
| Endorsements/Testimonials | Signed consent and disclosure of material connection if influencer was paid (per DTI “Guidelines on Social Media Influencer Advertising,” 2022). |

Burden of proof is **on the advertiser** once prima facie falsity is shown (RA 7394 Art. 100), making the regime *quasi-strict liability*.

### 7. Notable Jurisprudence

| Case | Gist | Take-away |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DTI v. Tsukiden Electronics (G.R. 225215, 10 Jan 2023)** | “Factory price” promo found deceptive; SC upheld DTI fine even though buyer paid the advertised amount—*harm to market integrity suffices.* | Material deception need not cause actual out-of-pocket loss. |
| **People v. HerbalBest Corp. (CA-G.R. CR-H.C. 11789, 15 Jun 2021)** | Conviction for “cancer-cure” leaflets; court stressed *ex-ante* FDA approval requirement. | Criminal liability survives even if advertising agency is ignorant of the falsity. |
| **PCC Advisory Opinion 19-03 (2024)** | Cooperative discount clubs’ exaggerated savings pitches deemed a “deceptive marketing practice” under Competition Act. | PCC can step in where market-wide deterrence is needed, separate from individual complaints. |

### 8. Digital & Cross-Border Dimensions

1. **Online platforms as “e-retailers”**
   *DTI Department Administrative Order (DAO) 21-09* makes e-commerce platforms jointly liable if they fail to delist a product within **48 hours** of a take-down notice.
2. **Geotargeted & algorithmic ads**
   The same DAO treats programmatic advertising rules as location-agnostic; a Philippine-based consumer view is enough for jurisdiction.
3. **ASEAN Co-operation**
   Enforcement can rely on the **ASEAN Cross-Border Consumer Redress Mechanism** (MOU 2022), enabling information exchange between the DTI and counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, etc.

---

### 9. Defences & Mitigating Circumstances

* **Prior ASC Clearance** – Not a full defence but can mitigate administrative fines (DTI DAO 21-02).
* **Prompt Voluntary Corrective Advertising** – Reduces fine by up to 50 %.
* **Opinion or Puffery** – Purely subjective statements immune if no reasonable consumer would interpret them literally.
* **Good-faith reliance on supplier data** – Partial defence only; diligence must be proved (e.g., certificate of analysis, random sampling).

### 10. Practical Tips for Complainants

1. **Capture the Ad** – Use screen-recording plus system date-stamp; for disappearing stories, a notarised transcript helps.
2. **Save Receipts & Chats** – Document purchase path, including check-out cart and auto-email confirmations.
3. **Lab Test Early** – If the claim is quantifiable, commission a reputable lab recognised by DTI or FDA; fees can be recoverable as damages.
4. **Consider Class Action** – If hundreds are affected (diet fad products, “crypto-trading robots” ads), collective suit increases leverage.
5. **Don’t Delay** – While the administrative complaint has no strict prescription, fresh evidence and recall value of the ad strengthen the case.

### 11. Compliance Checklist for Advertisers & Agencies

| Item | Must-do |
| --- | --- |
| **Substantiation File** | Keep dossier of studies, COAs, ASTM/ISO test results. |
| **ASC/DTI Pre-clearance (for regulated products)** | Secure clearance number; display it in TV ads from 3 seconds onwards. |
| **Influencer Contracts** | Include clause on #Ad / #Sponsored disclosure in first 3 lines of caption. |
| **Price-Off Mechanics** | Maintain 30-day price log auditable by BIR. |
| **Rapid Response SOP** | Within 24 h of complaint, deploy escalation team to review and suspend ad if needed. |

## Conclusion

False advertising in the Philippines is treated with increasing seriousness as digital commerce and influencer marketing blur the lines between content and commerce. RA 7394 remains the cornerstone, but recent amendments and sector-specific regulations have **raised fines, shortened compliance windows, and expanded liability to platforms and endorsers**.

Whether you are a consumer seeking redress or a brand crafting a campaign, **understand the multi-layered regime**—from DTI mediation to potential criminal prosecution—and act promptly.
