_A comprehensive legal primer (updated to 3 July 2025)_
* * *
---|---
**RA 7394 (Consumer Act)**, Title III, Art. 97-109 | Defines “false, deceptive or misleading advertisement”; prohibits it; empowers the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to act _motu proprio_ or on complaint; authorises civil, administrative & criminal actions.
* * *
3. **Overstatement of performance/value** – Claims that cannot be substantiated by competent evidence or standard testing (the _“clinically proven to whiten in 1 week”_ type of claim).
_Note:_ Puffery (“World’s best burger!”) is generally tolerated if clearly subjective opinion, but the line is crossed when quantifiable or verifiable attributes are invoked.
* * *
---|---
_Multiple-gate_ rule: A single ad can be the subject of parallel proceedings (ASC takedown + DTI administrative fine + consumer civil damages + DOJ criminal prosecution), provided there is no double jeopardy for the criminal component.
* * *
---|---|---
**1 – Prepare Complaint-Affidavit** | State facts, identify ad, explain falsity, attach evidence (screenshots, receipts, lab tests, sworn consumer statements). | RA 7394 has _no prescriptive period_ for administrative complaints, but civil actions must be filed **within 2 years** from discovery of the deceptive act.
* * *
---|---
**Administrative (DTI/FDA)** | • Fine: _₱500 – ₱300,000 per transaction_ (higher range introduced by RA 11967 in 2024, adjusted every 3 years for inflation)
• Suspension or cancellation of business/ product-registration license
• _Corrective advertising order_ (cost borne by advertiser)
• Product recall or permanent ban
• Moral & exemplary damages
• Attorney’s fees
• _Class action_ available under RA 7394 §6; public interest group or OFT may sue on behalf of consumers.
**Criminal (filed by DOJ upon agency referral)** | • Imprisonment: _1 month – 6 months_ and/or fine _₱1,000 – ₱50,000_ (ranges doubled by Art. 315 RPC if fraud proven)
• Accessory penalties: closure, confiscation of materials, deportation of alien offenders.
• Mandatory excision of offending scenes
• Public apology notices.
* * *
---|---
Burden of proof is **on the advertiser** once prima facie falsity is shown (RA 7394 Art. 100), making the regime _quasi-strict liability_.
* * *
---|---|---
**DTI v. Tsukiden Electronics (G.R. 225215, 10 Jan 2023)** | “Factory price” promo found deceptive; SC upheld DTI fine even though buyer paid the advertised amount— _harm to market integrity suffices._ | Material deception need not cause actual out-of-pocket loss.
**People v. HerbalBest Corp. (CA-G.R. CR-H.C. 11789, 15 Jun 2021)** | Conviction for “cancer-cure” leaflets; court stressed _ex-ante_ FDA approval requirement. | Criminal liability survives even if advertising agency is ignorant of the falsity.
* * *
1. **Online platforms as “e-retailers”** _DTI Department Administrative Order (DAO) 21-09_ makes e-commerce platforms jointly liable if they fail to delist a product within **48 hours** of a take-down notice.
2. **Geotargeted & algorithmic ads** The same DAO treats programmatic advertising rules as location-agnostic; a Philippine-based consumer view is enough for jurisdiction.
3. **ASEAN Co-operation** Enforcement can rely on the **ASEAN Cross-Border Consumer Redress Mechanism** (MOU 2022), enabling information exchange between the DTI and counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, etc.
* * *
* * *
* * *
---|---
* * *
Whether you are a consumer seeking redress or a brand crafting a campaign, **understand the multi-layered regime** —from DTI mediation to potential criminal prosecution—and act promptly.
