## Average auto insurance costs in Massachusetts by age
It's a common phenomenon: [as you grow older](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/), your auto insurance rates change.
Typically, auto insurance is more expensive for young drivers, as auto insurance companies see newer drivers as riskier.
In Massachusetts, coverage costs $5,046 annually for a [16-year-old driver](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-16-year-olds/), but just $1,030 per annum for a client in [his or her 50s](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-50-year-olds/).
If you're facing the pricey prospect of insuring a [teen driver](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/), it's worth noting Massachusetts is the 10th cheapest state in which to purchase car insurance for a 16-year-old.
###### MASSACHUSETTS AUTO INSURANCE PRICES BY AGE
**Age** | **Average Annual Premium**  
---|---  
16 | $5,045.84  
17 | $4,506.71  
18 | $4,333.67

## Average auto insurance premiums in Massachusetts by gender
While gender doesn’t make as large an impact on auto insurance premiums as state or age, it is used as a pricing factor by auto insurers.
[Men](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-for-men/) and [women](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-for-women/) pay the same amount for car insurance in Massachusetts — the state banned the use of gender as a rating factor by insurers.
If you're concerned you aren't getting the best value for your money with your current auto insurance company, the best thing to do is to compare insurance companies.
###### MASSACHUSETTS CAR INSURANCE PRICES FOR MEN AND WOMEN
**Gender** | **Average Yearly Cost**  
---|---  
Male | $1,150.90  
Female | $1,150.90  
* * *
## Average car insurance rates in Massachusetts by marriage status
One pro of getting married — in addition to the honeymoon — is the improved deal you often earn on auto insurance. In Massachusetts, however, married drivers pay the same price as single drivers because the state bars marital status as an insurance rating factor.  
  

###### MASSACHUSETTS CAR INSURANCE PREMIUMS BY MARITAL STATUS
**Marital Status** | **Average Annual Rate**  
---|---  
Single | $1,150.90  
Married | $1,150.90  
Divorced | $1,150.90  
Widowed | $1,150.90

## Average auto insurance rates in Massachusetts by credit score
Car insurers use credit as a way of determining the reliability of a prospective customer.
Data trends demonstrate motorists with exceptional credit histories are often more dependable car insurance customers: they less commonly file claims insurance companies have to reimburse.
In Massachusetts, whether you have excellent credit or poor credit doesn't matter as the state has outlawed insurance companies from using [credit history](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/) as a factor in pricing.
###### MASSACHUSETTS AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY CREDIT
**Credit Level** | **Average Annual Premium**  
---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $1,150.90  
Fair (580-669) | $1,150.90  
Good (670-739) | $1,150.90  
Very Good (740-799) | $1,150.90  
Exceptional (800-850) | $1,150.90
