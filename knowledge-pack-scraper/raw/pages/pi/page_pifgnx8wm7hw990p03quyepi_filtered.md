In Massachusetts, coverage costs $5,046 annually for a [16-year-old driver](/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-16-year-olds/), but just $1,030 per annum for a client in [his or her 50s](/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-50-year-olds/).

If you're facing the pricey prospect of insuring a [teen driver](/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/), it's worth noting Massachusetts is the 10th cheapest state in which to purchase car insurance for a 16-year-old.
