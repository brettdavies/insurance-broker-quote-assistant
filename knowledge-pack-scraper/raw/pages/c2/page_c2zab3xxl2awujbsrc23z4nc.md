Hello 
I’ve had NJM all my life (27 years old male) . I just got my renewal for 2k for one year. I never filed a single claim or have a single traffic violation. My car isn’t barely even worth 2k, 2013 honda civic. 
Should I look to change providers? If so any suggestions?

Always be shopping around once this happens. No one is gonna come to you and give you a better rate for this sorta stuff. But rates seem to be trending upwards. 
Do the same for savings accounts. Even if your bank ups their interest, they won’t tell you. Shop around.

Unfortunately you need to change. Pricing is going up across all insurances. We went from NJM to Geico and saved $1,000 on a 5 car plan. Stayed with them, until 4 months ago and then went to Progressive and saved $800.

Hi there OP. Licensed insurance agent here in NJ. If you know for sure your vehicle is only worth 2k, the first thing I'd do is drop collision if you still have full coverage. I assume there is no lien on the vehicle. If there is you have to keep full coverage. You could also drop comprehensive which covers things like glass damage, fire, flood, contact with an animal, falling object, etc. 
I'll say this, across the insurance industry the rates are ballooning because of inflation that doesn't seem to be stopping. Throw future tariffs on top and it's a recipe for much higher payouts on claims. Insurance, in general, sucks but no one has created a better system yet. It mainly sucks because you "have" to have insurance and it's an intangible product. 
Typically your highest cost coverages are Liability, Personal Injury Protection and Collision. The first two are mandatory by law. Also, call and ask about discounts. Some popular ones are defensive driving, paperless, automatic payments, paying in full. Hope this info helps a little bit! 
Edit: Additional note, hopping from insurance to insurance over and over is another way to save but insurance companies are taking that into consideration as well. So the more someone jumps around the more it could end up affecting your rates. Gotta do what's best for you though!

this is a good perspective. also I just changed carriers and was discussing rates - one agent told me that in NJ, 60% of claims come to them for the first time already represented by a lawyer. 60%!! He told me to take a look at the number of injury lawyer ads on billboards in NJ. So, while other states have rates that are coming down, business in NJ seems to be so litigious that rates are higher than elsewhere.

When people have 250k in PIP coverage, lawyers see dollar signs. They come in, get you lots of money (while lining their pockets) and do their best to exhaust your PIP coverage. Meanwhile those claims get spread across premiums and then everyone cries over rates going up. 
Being a "lifetime" customer and paying 800 dollars every 6 months over 10 years comes out to a little under 20k, but in just 1 claim, the company can lose triple that number easily. 
I don't sympathize with faceless companies, and insurance sucks, but I can understand why rates keep going up. 
And this doesn't even take into consideration how much insurance fraud happens with groups of people sharing a single vehicle and not being on the policy in NY/NJ.

So, when your car costs more than your insurance, lose the comprehensive and just carry liability to cover the other person's damage. 
Put the difference in the bank to replace your cheap POS car with that money. 
BTW, where do you get a $2k car? I've never found anything trustworthy for under about $10k. And even that has nearly doubled recently. I guess somebody forgot to Make America Great Again in that one category. 
Edit: As an old guy, I had to chuckle about the "all my life" phrase. I've been carrying car insurance for almost half a century.

Are you getting full coverage or just liability? With a car this age, you might want to consider just liability to save you a little. 
My Geico insurance on 3 cars went up 2.2k this year. I ended up going to Progressive.

Call your provider and have them go through your declarations page with you and talk over every item. When I moved from Ohio to another state in the past, I was alarmed that my rates went way up. Turns out my 100/300 and 100k collision and liability levels were cheap in Ohio but through the roof in the new state. I lowered them to 50/100 and 100k and that lowered them adequately. Don’t go to state minimums, but make sure you aren’t paying to have some things cranked up too high. 
Besides it’s good to understand each item.

Insurance aside, I assure you that a 2013 Honda Civic is worth quite more than $2k. I purchased a 2001 Civic from a dealership around 2014 for $7,800, and when I accidentally melted the engine in 2021 (long story), I was still able to sell that sucker for $1k to someone who was willing to put the engine work in. If a friend hadn't been offering me an only-slightly-in-need-of-repair 2002 Camry for $3k at the time, I'd have just spent the $4k to repair the Civic, called it a good value, and still be driving that now-24yo car today. 
Unless that thing is junked, don't undervalue yourself! 
Or do, in which case, I'll give you $2k cash for it right now

Doesn't hurt to shop around. I have NJM for my homeowners insurance, but they were more expensive than Geico for my car. I have Geico for auto.

I work for an agency called the Fig Leaf Agency in Linden. Give us a call and we can give you a quote to see if we can do better than your current policy. Insurance is going up across the board this year because I think NJ loosened the restrictions on how much companies can raise prices since it's been pretty strict for a while. Some companies have even left the state because they don't make enough business

The value of your car is only a small part of insurance costs. Liability is the bigger aspect. That is if you are at fault in an accident, your insurance may have to pay to replace the other parties car and medical expenses. So while your car may only be worth $2k, the average value of all cars has gone up.

NJM is a mutual company. 
Their quote is the price of the policy + administrative fees. Policy holders are essentially the shareholders. 
Anyone undercutting them who is a for profit is doing so by rejecting otherwise legitimate claims. That’s the only way you lower your cost and add a profit margin to your finances. You can’t make money out of nothing. 
Just shows how slimy insurance companies knowingly are.

Is that just liability? If not, you might consider drooping collision & comprehensive coverage for a 12 year old car.
