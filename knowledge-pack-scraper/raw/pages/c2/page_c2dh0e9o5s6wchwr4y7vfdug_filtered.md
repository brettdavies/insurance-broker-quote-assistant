# What do you need to get your driver's license?

To get a full driver's license, you typically must advance through the graduated driver licensing (GDL) system in your state. If you're 18 years or older, you may advance through the driver's license process faster if you have a clean driving history, pass the required tests, pay application fees, and provide all the necessary documentation. If you're younger than 18, you must hold a learner's permit and intermediate license before getting fully licensed. Steps to get a driver's license vary from state to state, so check with your state's department or bureau of motor vehicles (DMV or BMV).

## What are the requirements to get a driver's license for the first time?

The requirements depend on your age and the state where you live. Applicants are commonly required to advance through a licensing program that requires applicants to:

* Take driver's education courses
* Gain experience behind the wheel under supervision
* Pass vision, written, and driving exams
* Pay application fees
* Provide official documentation

If you're 18 and older, the requirements to get a driver's license may be less stringent than requirements for applicants under 18. No matter your age, you must meet certain criteria to advance through the [licensing program stages](https://driversed.com/trending/which-states-have-driver-licensing-restrictions-teens) of your state.

### What is a graduated driver's license (GDL)?

Graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws offer teens several checkpoints on the road to becoming fully licensed drivers. There's no federal GDL program in the U.S. However, [each state has a GDL program](https://www.iihs.org/topics/teenagers/graduated-licensing-laws-table) in place, with minimum age requirements for teens to obtain each level of licensing. GDL laws are designed to keep everyone safer on the road by reducing accidents involving young drivers.

## Steps to get a driver's license

1. ### Gather necessary documents

   Beyond your birth certificate and Social Security card, you may need additional documentation depending on where you live or the type of ID for which you're applying. For example, if you're getting a REAL ID, which is a form of identification that has [stricter compliance requirements](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id), there are additional required documents which may include:

   * **Proof of identity:** You may be asked to bring another form of identification besides a birth certificate. This can be a U.S. passport or other form of government-issued ID. If your address doesn't match the one listed on your ID, you may need to update this before you apply for a driver's license.
   * **Proof of residence:** If you're applying for a license for the first time, you may be required to prove your residency. For applicants still living at home, their parents or guardians can help obtain these documents. A utility bill or lease should work if you live on your own.
   * **Parental consent:** If you're under 18, you'll likely need parental consent, requiring parents or legal guardians to sign a form stating they permit their child to apply for a license. Depending on the state, you may also be required to provide other documentation, such as proof of schooling or driver's education, for a first-time driver's license. Check with your local DMV to confirm which documents are needed.
2. ### Apply for a learner's permit

   The first stage of most licensing programs is often applying for a learner's permit. You're eligible to apply for a learner's permit as early as 14 to 16 years of age depending on your state's program. In most states, to receive your permit, you must:

   * Pass a written exam
   * Provide the necessary documents
   * Pay an application fee

   If you're under age 18, you'll also need a parent or legal guardian present. A learner's permit allows drivers to gain experience behind the wheel with restrictions. Permit holders are commonly limited to driving only with an instructor, parent, or legal guardian, or a licensed adult aged 21 or older.

   New drivers with learner's permits are required to have auto insurance. Drivers under 18 are typically eligible for coverage under a parent or legal guardian's policy; they need to be listed as a driver on their policy. Learn more about [learner's permit insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/teen-drivers-learners-permit-insurance/).
3. ### Apply for an intermediate license

   After the permit stage, you can apply for an intermediate license once you've met your state's criteria. Most states require that you:

   * Hold the learner's permit for a certain amount of time, often 6-12 months
   * Complete a specified number of supervised hours behind the wheel, including day and night requirements
   * Spend a certain number of hours in driver's education courses
   * Pay an application fee
   * Provide necessary documents
   * Pass a driving test (learn about [car requirements for a driving test](https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-requirements-for-a-driving-test/))

   An intermediate license is a probationary license and carries restrictions specific to your state. It may also be referred to as a junior or provisional license. Many states have restrictions for the driver's age, the time of day you're allowed on the road, and the number and age of passengers in the vehicle, as recommended by the [National Highway and Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/teen-driving).
4. ### Apply for a full license

   The final stage of most licensing programs is applying for a regular or full driver's license. You can apply for a full license after satisfying your state's and age, testing, and/or GDL requirements. Most states require that you:

   * Hold an intermediate license for a certain amount of time (often 6-12 months) or reach a certain age (often 17 or 18)
   * Don't violate state restrictions on intermediate-licensed drivers
   * Are conviction-free throughout the probationary period
   * Provide necessary documents
   * Pay an application fee

   A full license can be earned anywhere from 16.5 years of age or older, depending on your state. Fully licensed drivers are allowed to drive without restrictions.

Pro tip:

If you're 18 years of age or older, you may be able to apply for a full license without needing to meet the criteria at each stage of the licensing program. You'll likely still be required to pass vision, written, and driving exams to receive a full license, but the process may be expedited.

## Can you switch your driver's license from state to state?

Moving to another state requires you to get a new driver's license, usually within a grace period of 30 to 90 days. The process varies by state, but there are a few general steps to follow when switching your license to a new state (Note: There may be additional requirements for drivers under 18):

1. **Gather necessary documents:** This includes your current driver's license, second form of ID, proof of new address, proof of Social Security number, and payment.
2. **Head to your local DMV:** Make an appointment before you go if you can.
3. **Take a vision exam:** Some states may require you to pass a vision test. So remember to bring your glasses or contacts.
4. **Trade in your out-of-state license:** The DMV may issue you a temporary license until your permanent one is ready.
5. **Check your mail:** If the DMV doesn't issue your permanent license immediately, you'll receive it in the mail, usually within a week or two.

## When do you need to renew your license?

Typically, you need to renew your license every four to eight years depending on your state's requirements. If you miss your expiration date, you can still renew an expired license. If your grace period has ended, the DMV may require you to retake a vision test, written exam, or even the full driving test before you can be issued a new license. Note that you can't legally drive with an expired license, and you run the risk of being disqualified from insurance coverage if you drive illegally.

The process of renewing a driver's license varies from state to state. These general steps apply to most drivers in the United States:

1. ### Complete driver's license renewal documents

   Check with your state's DMV to ensure you're filling out all necessary forms. Forms verify the information on your license, such as your address, appearance, organ donor status, and medical issues that may impact your ability to drive.
2. ### Provide necessary documentation

   You'll need to bring your most recent license with you, even if it's expired and proof of new address or name change. If your previous license has expired, you'll also need to bring an additional form of identification, such as your passport, birth certificate, or Social Security card.
3. ### Take a vision test

   Some states require an updated vision test each time you renew, while others require regular eye exams from seniors.
4. ### Pay the license renewal fee

   Driver's license renewal fees range, depending on your state. If your previous license has expired, you may have to pay a fine. Check with your state DMV for costs.

## Do you need proof of insurance to renew a license?

Most states don't require [proof of insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/proof-of-insurance/) to renew a license, but some need to see proof of insurance before you can take your first driving test. You'll need to provide proof of insurance to your state's DMV when registering a car, and it's illegal to [drive without insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/driving-without-insurance/) in most states.
