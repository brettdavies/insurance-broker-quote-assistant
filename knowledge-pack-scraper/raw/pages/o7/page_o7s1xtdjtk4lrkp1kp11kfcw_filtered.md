## Personalize Your Coverage With AARP Homeowners Insurance from The Hartford

Standard homeowners insurance helps protect your home and belongings if they’re damaged in the event of a covered loss. The Hartford offers customizable [home insurance coverage](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/coverage) options to meet your unique needs.

Most home insurance companies offer policies to help protect your home and the structures directly attached to it. [Dwelling coverage](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/home-dwelling) helps pay the costs to repair or rebuild your home and its attached structures if they’re damaged in a covered loss, like fire, hail or lightning.

[Personal property coverage](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/personal-property) covers losses of your personal belongings, like furniture, clothing and appliances. You can purchase additional [valuable items blanket coverage](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/valuable-items-blanket) for your expensive items, like jewelry, artwork or collectibles.

If someone who is not a resident of your household suffers an injury or property damage for which you are legally responsible, [personal liability protection](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability) can help cover your legal defense costs and any court judgments against you, up to your policy limits.

Homeowners insurance protects structures that are not directly attached to your home. For example, if your detached garage is damaged, [other structures coverage](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/other-structures-coverage) can help with the repair costs.

Loss of Use Coverage helps pay for your living expenses, up to your policy limits, if your home is unlivable after suffering a loss. If your house has significant fire damage, this type of homeowners insurance covers your stay in a hotel while the repairs are being done.

Medical payments coverage helps pay emergency medical bills if someone who isn’t a resident of your household is injured on your property. Insurance also covers injuries caused by a member of your family or pet, regardless of where it happens. Bills are paid, up to policy limits, whether you’re legally responsible or not.3

[Go](# "Go")

While homeowners insurance typically isn’t [required](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/required) by law, if you have a mortgage on your home, then usually the mortgage lender will require you to have home insurance.

There is no one-size-fits-all policy when it comes to home insurance. In fact, there are a number of things to consider when choosing the right [home insurance coverages for your needs](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/how-much-do-i-need), ranging from local construction costs to the value of your belongings. The Hartford is here to help make sure you and your prized possessions are protected. Call [877-422-2345](tel:877-422-2345) to learn more.

No, [flood insurance](/aarp/flood-insurance) isn’t included in standard homeowners insurance policies. You’d need to purchase a separate flood insurance policy to be protected.

No, [rental property insurance](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/rental-property-insurance) isn’t included in standard homeowners insurance policies. If you’re a [landlord](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/landlord-insurance) and own a rental unit, you’d need to purchase rental property insurance separately to help protect your property.

While the unexpected can strike at any moment, there are a number of ways you can protect your home. You can also prevent claims from occurring by installing devices like fire [sprinkler systems](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/home-security-system) and monitored alarms or even adding security systems, such as a burglar alarm. And these safety enhancements could [save you money](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/discounts) on your home insurance policy.

The average cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. is $2,341 per year, or $195 per month.2 But [homeowners insurance rates](/aarp/homeowners-insurance/rates) can vary due to several factors, like the age or location of your home.

Homeowners insurance helps offer financial protection for your home and everything inside of it when damaged by a covered loss. It also helps provide liability coverage if someone is injured on or off your property.

The Florida Hurricane Mitigation Discount can help lower your homeowners insurance policy cost.
