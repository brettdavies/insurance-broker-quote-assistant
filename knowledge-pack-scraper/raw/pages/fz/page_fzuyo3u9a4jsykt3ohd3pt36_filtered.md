Average Cost of Car Insurance in Illinois

| Type of Coverage | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full coverage | $2,497 | $208 |
| Minimum coverage | $1,163 | $97 |

Illinois law requires drivers to carry:

* Minimum liability insurance of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
* Minimum property damage coverage of $20,000 per accident
* Minimum bodily injury and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident

You typically need [full coverage car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) if your car is [financed](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-get-a-car-loan/) or [leased](/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-lease-a-vehicle-or-buy/). Full coverage adds [collision and comprehensive coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/), which protects the vehicle from damage. If your car isn't financed or leased, you could opt for [minimum coverage insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/minimum-car-insurance-by-state/); however, insurance professionals generally advise getting more coverage than the minimum to protect yourself financially.

The price you pay for car insurance may vary depending on factors such as:

* **Age** (younger drivers usually pay more)
* **Gender** (women generally pay less than men)
* **Your location within Illinois** (premiums may be higher in areas with high frequencies of car theft of accidents)
* **The vehicle you're insuring** (new cars cost more to insure than used cars)
* **Your driving record** (a history of incidents and violations usually increases your costs)

While the average costs in this article are good general guideposts, the actual cost of your car insurance in Illinois could differ. Before purchasing an auto insurance policy, take the time to [compare insurance quotes](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/illinois/) from several insurers.

## How Are Car Insurance Costs Trending?

Across the U.S., auto insurance rates have increased significantly in the past few years. Higher costs for vehicles, parts and repairs; increasingly serious injuries from auto accidents; and the growing frequency of extreme weather events all play a role. As insurance companies' costs rise, they're raising premiums to compensate for their losses.

### Average Annual Auto Insurance Premiums, 2023-2025

In Illinois, one reason car insurance rates may be higher than they used to be is because the state has the fifth-highest rate of auto theft, according to data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). Illinois also has a relatively high rate of uninsured motorists, with 16.3% of drivers in the state lacking car insurance, according to the Insurance Research Council (IRC).

If you believe you're paying too much for car insurance in Illinois, comparing insurance quotes from other providers could help you get the same coverage for less. For a convenient way to shop around, you can use Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) to gather quotes from multiple top insurance carriers all in one place.

## Average Illinois Car Insurance Rates by City

Your [location](/blogs/ask-experian/will-car-insurance-change-when-you-move/) within Illinois affects the price you'll pay for auto insurance. Different parts of Illinois pose different risks to drivers and vehicles. For instance, crowded city areas may have longer commutes, heavier traffic or higher rates of auto theft, all of which may increase the likelihood you'll need to file a car insurance claim. The costs of auto repairs and medical care are higher in some areas than others, which could lead to higher car insurance premiums.

The chart below shows how the average cost of auto insurance can vary across some of Illinois' most populous cities.

Average Auto Insurance Cost by City in Illinois

| City | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Rockford | $1,488 |
| Springfield | $1,653 |
| Peoria | $1,676 |
| Belleville | $2,037 |
| Chicago | $2,074 |

## Average Illinois Car Insurance Rates by Age and Gender

In many states, your [gender](/blogs/ask-experian/does-gender-impact-car-insurance-premiums/) can impact the price you pay for car insurance. A proposed bill under consideration in the Illinois General Assembly would prohibit insurance companies from using gender and age in setting insurance premiums. Currently, though, insurance companies in Illinois can take gender into account when determining your insurance rates.

Women are statistically less likely to be involved in serious car accidents or get DUIs, according to the Insurance Information Institute. As a result, women may pay less for car insurance—but that's not always the case.

Average Auto Insurance Cost in Illinois

| Gender | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Male | $2,064 | $172 |
| Female | $2,021 | $168 |

Note: Costs above are a blended average of full and minimum coverage policies

Differences between the cost of car insurance for men and women are typically more pronounced when age is added to the mix. [Younger drivers](/blogs/ask-experian/does-car-insurance-go-down-at-25/), particularly men, generally pay more for auto insurance than older drivers because they're less experienced and have a statistically higher rate of accidents.

As you get older, however, your auto insurance premiums usually go down—sometimes considerably, as seen in the chart below. The price of auto insurance generally declines steadily until your mid-70s; then they tend to start rising again.

Average Car Insurance Cost by Age and Gender in the U.S.

| Age | Female | Male |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Under 20 | $3,246 | $3,450 |
| 20-29 | $2,684 | $2,762 |
| 30-39 | $2,395 | $2,271 |
| 40-49 | $2,293 | $2,161 |
| 50-59 | $2,022 | $1,968 |
| 60-69 | $1,746 | $1,721 |
| 70-79 | $1,720 | $1,862 |
| 80 or above | $1,810 | $2,007 |

## How Your Driving Record Impacts Your Insurance Costs in Illinois

If you're generally a safe driver, with no accidents or citations on your driving record, you'll probably pay less for car insurance. Illinois drivers with a "clean" driving record that shows no incidents or violations pay an average of $1,874 annually for auto insurance.

Safe drivers are less likely to have accidents or indulge in risky activities like speeding. On the other hand, if your driving history includes moving violations or accidents (even ones where you weren't at fault), your car insurance provider may consider you a high-risk driver and raise your car insurance premiums accordingly.

The chart below shows how the number and severity of infractions in Illinois can affect your auto insurance premiums. *Incidents* include things like traffic accidents or insurance claims; *violations* include [moving violations](/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/), such as speeding tickets. Even with incidents and violations on your record, the cost of car insurance in Illinois remains much lower than the nationwide average for someone with a comparable driving record, as the chart below shows.

Average Car Insurance Cost by Driving Record in Illinois

| Driving Record | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Clean Record | $1,874 |
| 1 Incident | $2,160 |
| 1 Violation | $2,121 |
| 2 Incidents | $2,063 |
| 2 Violations | $2,503 |
| 3+ Incidents | $2,371 |
| 3+ Violations | $2,697 |

## Cheapest Car Insurance in Illinois

Your driving record, vehicle and age are among the major factors in the price you pay for auto insurance. However, these aren't the only elements that can impact your premiums. Because each auto insurance company uses its own formula to set premiums, the cost of car insurance can vary widely depending on the carrier you choose.

Because of these variations, shopping around and comparing quotes from several different insurance companies can help you find the most affordable car insurance for your situation. The chart below shows the cheapest full coverage auto insurance among the insurance carriers that sell the most policies in Illinois.

Cheapest Full Coverage Car Insurance Carriers in Illinois

| Carrier | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Liberty Mutual | $1,675 | $140 |
| Root | $2,108 | $176 |
| National General | $2,227 | $186 |
| GEICO | $2,230 | $186 |
| SAFECO | $2,490 | $208 |

Note: Costs above represent insurance quotes, not policy premiums

How exactly each insurance provider determines its rates isn't public information. Typically, though, factors such as the company's projected operating costs, risk tolerance, estimated claims payouts and profitability goals come into play. For example, an insurance provider with higher overhead expenses may charge more than a provider with lower overhead costs.

## How to Save on Car Insurance in Illinois

Whether your car insurance premiums are above average, below average or somewhere in the middle, there are several things you can do to [save on auto insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs-now/).

### Increase Your Deductible

The deductible is how much you're responsible for paying when you file an auto insurance claim. In most cases, insurance companies let you select a deductible between $250 and $2,000. A higher [deductible](/blogs/ask-experian/how-does-car-insurance-deductible-work/) usually translates to lower premiums. However, before raising your deductible, it's important to make sure you can afford to cover the higher amount if you file a claim. Assess the state of your financial resources, such as your [emergency fund](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-an-emergency-fund/), and ask your insurance carrier how different deductibles would impact your premiums.

### Look for Discounts

With so many ways to save on auto insurance, there may be some you aren't aware of. Start by asking your existing car insurance company if they offer any discounts you aren't taking advantage of. Then visit other providers' websites to see what discounts they offer.

For example, you can often save money by [bundling home and auto insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/), setting up automatic payments, paying your premium upfront or going paperless. A high school or college student who maintains good grades or is away at school without a car could also earn a discount. You can also check to see if your employer or any membership groups you belong to offer auto insurance discounts. Some insurance carriers also give discounts for getting insurance quotes online or signing documents online.

### Drop Unneeded Coverage

"Nice-to-have" insurance extras such as rental car reimbursement, roadside assistance coverage or windshield replacement could be expendable if you're looking to save money. For instance, you might consider canceling rental car reimbursement if you could borrow a family member's car in a pinch.

Do you own a paid-off car that's not worth very much? Dropping [collision and comprehensive coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/) could lower your premiums. If your car is totaled, collision and comprehensive coverage will only pay out the vehicle's value. Purchasing coverage may not be worth the cost for a car that's only worth a few thousand dollars. However, don't drop the coverage unless you could afford to replace or repair your vehicle out of pocket if necessary.

### Reduce Your Annual Mileage

Driving 12,000 miles or less per year is generally considered [low mileage](/blogs/ask-experian/does-mileage-affect-car-insurance/), which could qualify you for discounts on your auto insurance. Low-mileage drivers pose less risk for insurers since they're less likely to be involved in accidents. Look for ways to [reduce your mileage](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-drive-less-and-lower-car-insurance-costs/), such as walking, carpooling, biking or switching to remote work if your job allows.

Low-mileage car insurance typically requires monitoring your mileage, either by self-reporting or by installing a device in your car to track your odometer reading. Another option is [pay-per-mile car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-pay-per-mile-auto-insurance/), which charges a monthly base rate plus a per-mile charge for each additional mile you drive.

### Keep Your Driving Record Clean

Driving safely reduces your risk of accidents, which can help lower your car insurance costs. A driving history of accidents or moving violations can cause your insurer to raise your rates, so focus on keeping your record clean. Go a step further by completing a defensive driving or safe driving course, and many insurers will give you a discount on your car insurance.

### Improve Your Credit

Illinois law allows insurance companies to review your [credit-based insurance score](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-credit-based-insurance-score/) when setting your car insurance premiums. Having a poor score could mean paying more for auto insurance. Taking steps to [improve your consumer credit score](/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/) could positively impact your credit-based insurance score, too, potentially saving you money on car insurance.

### Compare Prices

Regularly [comparing quotes](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-compare-car-insurance-rates/) from multiple insurance carriers can help ensure you're not overpaying for auto insurance. It's good practice to shop around for car insurance at least once a year or whenever your policy gets close to renewal time.

You can collect car insurance quotes by visiting insurance company websites or by contacting insurance companies directly. For a more convenient way to explore your coverage options, try using Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). It gathers auto insurance quotes from multiple top insurance companies in Illinois, so you can easily see which provider offers the best rates.
