State Farm Medigap is a good option for Plan G if you live in the Western U.S., but you should compare it to other companies before you buy a plan.

Plan G is the best Medigap plan for most people, unless you became [eligible for Medicare](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-eligibility "Medicare Eligibility: Age 65 and Other Ways to Qualify") before 2020. And State Farm has cheap rates for Plan G in [many states](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-medicare-supplement-review#by-state "State Farm rates by state"). Plan F has more coverage if you qualify, but State Farm's Plan F is expensive.

---|---|---|---
[Plan N](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-plan-n "Medicare Plan N: Coverage, Cost and How It Works") | $111 | $111 | $0
[Plan A](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-plan-a "What Is Medicare Supplement Plan A?") | $133 | $141 | -$8
[Plan G](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-plan-g "What Is Medicare Supplement Plan G?") | $146 | $148 | -$2
And in several states, State Farm's rates are around the state average. It can make sense to choose State Farm in these states, even over a cheaper option, if you want [State Farm's great service](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-medicare-supplement-review#reviews "State Farm Medigap customer service and reviews").
