## Homeowners insurance perils

Some of the most common [**home insurance perils**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/named-perils/) include fire, lightning, wind, hail, water damage, freezing, theft, and liability risks.[[3]](#cite-3) But home insurance doesn’t cover all perils. For example, standard home insurance doesn’t cover earthquake or flood damage. If you want coverage for earthquakes or floods, you’ll need separate earthquake and flood insurance policies.

The most expensive perils to claim are fire and lightning, which cost an average of $83,991 per claim, according to Triple-I. The most common perils homeowners claim are wind and hail, making up 40.7% of all home insurance claims in 2022.[[2]](#cite-2)

![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/1600x1600/880c0d036a/recoop-covered-perils.png/m/1600x1600/smart/filters:quality(90))

## Homeowners insurance claims

The most common [**home insurance claims**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/how-to-file-a-home-insurance-claim/) involve the following perils: wind and hail, water damage and freezing, and fire and lightning. These three damages made up 90.2% of all claims submitted in 2022.

The average cost of a claim payout between 2018 and 2022 was $15,749, according to Triple-I.[[2]](#cite-2) Submitting claims can affect the price of your home insurance policy, as insurers will potentially see your home as a higher risk than before.

Here are the perils homeowners filed claims for in 2022, according to Triple-I.

## 2024 trends in the home insurance industry

Home insurance prices have been increasing across the country for the last few years due to a number of factors, including inflation and climate concerns. The average annual cost of home insurance in the U.S. increased from $1,984 in 2021 to $2,377 in 2023 and will likely increase to $2,522 by the end of 2024, according to Insurify data.[[1]](#cite-1)

States in areas that see a lot of extreme weather have seen the most intense increases. Florida, Oklahoma, and Louisiana are among the hardest-hit states when it comes to home insurance costs, as they face a lot of coastal flooding and tornadoes.

## Homeowners insurance policies

The most common homeowners insurance policy is the [**HO-3 policy**](/homeowners-insurance/ho3-home-insurance/), also known as the special form policy. This policy covers damage from fire, extreme weather, theft, falling trees, and personal liability, among other things. An HO-1 policy, also known as the basic form policy, is less robust. It covers fire but doesn’t include damage from fallen trees.

Companies sell various other types of home insurance policies, including specific ones for condos and mobile homes. The right policy for you depends on your location, financial situation, and coverage needs. If you have concerns about potential severe damages, an [**HO-5**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/), also known as a comprehensive form policy, might be right for you.

Common coverage limits are between $250,000 and $500,000, and typical deductibles are between $500 and $2,500. Although home insurance is a great tool for property owners, states don’t require it, so many homeowners are uninsured or underinsured.[[3]](#cite-3) Of homeowners in the U.S., 88% have insurance and 12% don’t have coverage for their homes.[[4]](#cite-4)

The most important aspect of homeowners insurance is having adequate coverage. Not purchasing enough home insurance can be extremely costly because home repairs can get expensive quickly. Talk to your insurance agent about how much home insurance coverage you actually need.

The main benefit of homeowners insurance is that it provides you with peace of mind and significant financial protection against unexpected disasters that could cause significant damage to your home and your wallet.

Most standard home insurance covers your dwelling, other structures, personal property, liability, and additional living expenses. The three main types of homeowners insurance are HO-2 (Broad Form), HO-3 (Special Form), and HO-5 (Comprehensive Form). Each policy covers increasingly more perils for homes.

Florida is the most expensive state for homeowners insurance, with an average annual premium of $5,640 for a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage. It’s the most expensive state because it’s prone to damage from hurricanes, flooding, and wind. If you live in Florida, you may also want to consider buying a separate policy for flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private insurer.
