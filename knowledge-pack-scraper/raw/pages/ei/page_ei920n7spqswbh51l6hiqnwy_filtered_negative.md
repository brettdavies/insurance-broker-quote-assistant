Some of the most common [**home insurance perils**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/named-perils/) include fire, lightning, wind, hail, water damage, freezing, theft, and liability risks.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-3) But home insurance doesn’t cover all perils. For example, standard home insurance doesn’t cover earthquake or flood damage. If you want coverage for earthquakes or floods, you’ll need separate earthquake and flood insurance policies.
The most expensive perils to claim are fire and lightning, which cost an average of $83,991 per claim, according to Triple-I. The most common perils homeowners claim are wind and hail, making up 40.7% of all home insurance claims in 2022.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-2)

The most common [**home insurance claims**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/how-to-file-a-home-insurance-claim/) involve the following perils: wind and hail, water damage and freezing, and fire and lightning. These three damages made up 90.2% of all claims submitted in 2022.
The average cost of a claim payout between 2018 and 2022 was $15,749, according to Triple-I.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-2) Submitting claims can affect the price of your home insurance policy, as insurers will potentially see your home as a higher risk than before.

Home insurance prices have been increasing across the country for the last few years due to a number of factors, including inflation and climate concerns. The average annual cost of home insurance in the U.S. increased from $1,984 in 2021 to $2,377 in 2023 and will likely increase to $2,522 by the end of 2024, according to Insurify data.[[1]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-1)
The most common homeowners insurance policy is the [**HO-3 policy**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/ho3-home-insurance/), also known as the special form policy. This policy covers damage from fire, extreme weather, theft, falling trees, and personal liability, among other things. An HO-1 policy, also known as the basic form policy, is less robust. It covers fire but doesn’t include damage from fallen trees.
Companies sell various other types of home insurance policies, including specific ones for condos and mobile homes. The right policy for you depends on your location, financial situation, and coverage needs. If you have concerns about potential severe damages, an [**HO-5**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/), also known as a comprehensive form policy, might be right for you.
Common coverage limits are between $250,000 and $500,000, and typical deductibles are between $500 and $2,500. Although home insurance is a great tool for property owners, states don’t require it, so many homeowners are uninsured or underinsured.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-3) Of homeowners in the U.S., 88% have insurance and 12% don’t have coverage for their homes.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-4)
Policies cover [**damage to your dwelling**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/dwelling-insurance/) from covered perils, such as fire, windstorms, and vandalism.
Many policies protect [**other structures**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/other-structures-coverage/), like fences and garages.
Home insurance also covers damage to your [**personal belongings**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-coverage/), like furniture and electronics.
Home insurance pays for [**legal expenses**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) if someone incurs an injury at your home.
Homeowners insurance also pays for [**temporary living costs**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use-coverage/) if your home becomes unlivable due to a covered peril.
