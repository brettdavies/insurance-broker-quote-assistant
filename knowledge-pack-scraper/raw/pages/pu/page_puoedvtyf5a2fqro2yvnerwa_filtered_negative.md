The national average premium for homeowners insurance is $2,258 per year ($188 monthly) for $300,000 of [dwelling coverage](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover#:~:text=Dwelling%20coverage%20pays%20to%20repair%20or%20rebuild%20your%20dwelling%20\(aka%20your%20house%20and%20anything%20attached%20to%20it\)%20due%20to%C2%A0damage%20from%20disasters%C2%A0\(also%20known%20as%C2%A0hazards\)).

But even if you’re not in one of those states with lower premiums, no need to panic—and for sure, no need to sell and move just to save on homeowners insurance. We’ve got ideas for you to lower your premium that _don’t_ involve job searches or moving trucks.
Older homes or those with known issues will have higher premiums. That’s logical, right? And while a time machine might come in handy here, the age of your home is pretty much one of those factors you have no control over. On the other hand, you _can_ improve its condition. First, general maintenance will make your life easier and head off future claims. Then, some insurers will give you a break on premiums for installing extra safety features like burglar alarms, smoke detectors or dead bolt locks.
We know this might sound like yet another “that’s out of my control” factor. But it’s worth knowing how much _more_ you’d be paying if your house was twice its current size—or how much you could _save_ by downsizing.
