## State Farm life insurance policies

State Farm sells term life, whole life and universal life insurance policies to individuals. All of State Farm’s term products can be converted to permanent coverage, regardless of changes to your health. Availability and policy details vary among states.

**Term life insurance.** Available options include:

* **Select Term Life.** Policies are available in 10-, 20- or 30-year terms, depending on your age, and renewable up to 95. Coverage amounts start at $100,000.
* **Instant Answer Term Life.** $50,000 of coverage is available for people between 16 and 45, lasting until age 50 or 10 years after the policy is issued, whichever is later. State Farm’s [instant answer life insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/life/best-instant-life-insurance) doesn’t require a medical exam. However, you have to complete a health questionnaire, and your answers may disqualify you from coverage.
* **Return of Premium Term Life.** Coverage starts at $100,000 and is available in 20- or 30-year terms, though you can renew the policy at increased rates. If you keep up with premiums, outlive your term and don’t renew, you’ll get your money back.

**Whole life insurance.** Policies include standard whole life, limited-pay whole life, single-premium whole life and final expense. The company’s standard whole life policy has level premiums. Its limited-pay and single-premium policies allow you to front-load the cost of the insurance so you don't need to pay during retirement. Final expense policies are available to applicants 45 to 80 years old (50 to 75 in New York). Coverage limits start at $10,000.

**Universal life insurance.** Options include survivorship and joint universal policies. These types of policies cover two individuals, typically spouses. The company’s standard universal policy offers flexible coverage and payment options.

State Farm also made our list of the [best burial insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/life/best-burial-insurance) and the [best return-of-premium policies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/life/best-return-of-premium-life-insurance) for 2025.

### State Farm life insurance riders

Depending on the policy you choose, you may be able to add the following [life insurance riders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/life-insurance-riders) to your coverage:

* **Waiver of premium for disability.** Allows you to stop paying your premiums but keep your coverage if you’re totally disabled for six months or more.
* **Guaranteed insurability option.** Lets you buy extra coverage on specific option dates without having to take another medical exam.
* **Payor insurance.** Applies to a life insurance policy for a child. If the person paying for the policy (such as a parent) dies or becomes disabled, this rider waives the premiums for a specified time period.

State Farm’s website is easy to navigate and offers basic information about each of its life insurance options.

We called State Farm to ask some basic questions about term life insurance. Because we didn’t currently have a State Farm policy or account, it took a while to get through the automated phone system and speak with a human. Once we eventually connected, the representative told us that we’d need to contact a local agent to get answers to our questions.

We also tried State Farm’s live chat feature. The conversation started with a chatbot, but we eventually got through to a live representative. Again, we were told that only our local agent could answer our questions.

State Farm has a highly rated mobile app that’s available for Apple and Android phones.

## Where State Farm stands out

State Farm has ranked #1 in J.D. Power’s annual study on customer satisfaction in the life insurance industry for the past five years (2020 to 2024). The study looks at insurers’ performance in these five areas: communication, interaction, pricing, product offerings and statements. State Farm’s track record points to a positive reputation, and customers should expect a personalized experience when working with the company.

## Where State Farm falls short

While State Farm operates nationwide, it doesn’t offer life insurance to residents of Massachusetts or Rhode Island. Its Android app also has fewer features than the app for iOS users.

## What Reddit users say about State Farm

*Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like life insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

Comments on Reddit about State Farm life insurance are mixed. Some Redditors believe State Farm’s [life insurance rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/average-life-insurance-rates) tend to be too high, though others said they were reasonable. And while some commenters praise the company for quickly paying out death benefits, others complain about agents trying to upsell additional policies that may not be necessary.

## Questions from Reddit: Our experts answer

**Are State Farm’s return-of-premium life insurance policies worth it?**

With a return-of-premium life insurance policy, you’ll get a refund of the money you paid for your policy if you’re still alive at the end of the term. But you’ll pay a price — this type of insurance tends to be significantly more expensive than a regular term policy.

**Can I get State Farm life insurance if I have a mental health condition?**

Life insurance companies won’t necessarily refuse to cover you if you have a mental health condition. However, you could end up paying more or even being declined if your condition is serious or not well managed. Not all carriers view mental illnesses the same way, so it’s smart to shop around. A [life insurance agent or broker](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-to-choose-a-life-insurance-broker-or-agent) can help you navigate your options.

* ### How we review life insurance companies

  In our life insurance reviews, our editorial team considers the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Policies offered.** There are many [types of life insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/types-of-life-insurance) on the market, and they fall into three key categories:

  + **Term life insurance** offers temporary coverage and a guaranteed payout if the policyholder dies during the term.
  + **Permanent life insurance** typically lasts a lifetime and builds cash value that can be borrowed against in the future.
  + **No-exam life insurance** issues coverage without the need for a medical exam.

  **Financial strength.** We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. For life insurance, NerdWallet typically recommends considering insurers with ratings of A- or higher. Here’s the breakdown:

  + **Exceptional:** A+, A++.
  + **Strong:** A-, A.
  + **Moderate:** B, B+.

  **Complaints.** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The [best life insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/life/best-life-insurance-companies) have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Buy online.** This indicates whether an insurer allows you to apply for and buy a policy completely online.

## Life insurance buying guide

Before you start comparing companies, choose the [type of life insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/types-of-life-insurance) you want, such as term or whole life. Decide which [life insurance riders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/life-insurance-riders), if any, you want the policy to include. Calculate [how much life insurance you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-life-insurance-do-i-need) and how long you want the coverage to last. Check that the insurers you’re considering offer the coverage you’re looking for.

When comparing rates, be sure the quotes are for the same amount of coverage over the same period of time. It’s also important to make sure the policy’s medical requirements match your needs. For example, if you want to skip the [life insurance medical exam](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/life-insurance-medical-exams) but don’t mind answering health questions, confirm that the application process for each policy you're comparing aligns with that.

Price may not be the biggest driver behind your decision to buy. Look at the number of consumer complaints each company receives, as high numbers can be a red flag about the quality of service.

#### Life insurance ratings methodology

NerdWallet’s [life insurance ratings](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-life-insurance) are based on consumer experience, complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for individual life insurance, and weighted averages of financial strength ratings, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims. Within the consumer experience category, we consider ease of communication and website transparency, which looks at the depth of policy details available online. To calculate each insurer’s rating, we adjusted the scores to a curved 5-point scale.

These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines).

#### Insurer complaints methodology

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
