# LA insurance rate for new 2025 vehicle?

[Any other question!](/r/AskLosAngeles/?f=flair_name%3A%22Any%20other%20question!%22)

I’m shopping around for car insurance for a potential new car (2025 Toyota Corolla) and got online rates from Progressive for about 605 a month, and AllState for about 700 a month.

I do have one claim back in 2022 but was not at fault and my car (2008 Toyota Corolla) was parked when another person had a medical emergency and lost control of their vehicle. My car was second in the chain of vehicles to be impacted.

Just wondering if anyone is getting similar quotes for a new 2025 vehicle in LA? I understand things vary but this seems pretty high based on what I’ve seen in other threads on Reddit. I also realize liability limits went up recently.

If anyone recommends any other car insurance companies please let me know.

I was hoping to upgrade for the newer safety features and to pass down my car to a family member but did not anticipate this high of an insurance rate. I was anticipating more so in the $300 to $500 range.

Edit: Additional info in the comments but I am a 26 female and got my license at 22. In the Culver City area. No tickets or traffic violations.

Update 1: I was also Quoted (online) 478 monthly with GEICO (2,866.38 Total Premium) Comprehensive (Excluding Collision) $500 deductible, $500 deductible/Collision Deductible Waiver. If I increased to a $1,000 deductible they quoted $404 a month.

I’ll keep shopping around. I appreciate all the great advice, thank you!
