#  LA insurance rate for new 2025 vehicle? 
[ Any other question!  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/?f=flair_name%3A%22Any%20other%20question!%22)
I’m shopping around for car insurance for a potential new car (2025 Toyota Corolla) and got online rates from Progressive for about 605 a month, and AllState for about 700 a month. 
I do have one claim back in 2022 but was not at fault and my car (2008 Toyota Corolla) was parked when another person had a medical emergency and lost control of their vehicle. My car was second in the chain of vehicles to be impacted. 
Just wondering if anyone is getting similar quotes for a new 2025 vehicle in LA? I understand things vary but this seems pretty high based on what I’ve seen in other threads on Reddit. I also realize liability limits went up recently. 
If anyone recommends any other car insurance companies please let me know. 
I was hoping to upgrade for the newer safety features and to pass down my car to a family member but did not anticipate this high of an insurance rate. I was anticipating more so in the $300 to $500 range. 
Edit: Additional info in the comments but I am a 26 female and got my license at 22. In the Culver City area. No tickets or traffic violations. 
Update 1: I was also Quoted (online) 478 monthly with GEICO (2,866.38 Total Premium) Comprehensive (Excluding Collision) $500 deductible, $500 deductible/Collision Deductible Waiver. If I increased to a $1,000 deductible they quoted $404 a month. 
I’ll keep shopping around. I appreciate all the great advice, thank you!

No clue, but $700 to insure a corolla should have us rioting in the streets.

Insurance is outrageous right now for vehicles. It might cause folks to go under or uninsured causing others to face higher rates to cover for it all.

  1. the loss from 2022 whoever you were insured by you need to call them and request a [letter of experience](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=car+insurance+letter+of+experience&cId=4e7b3870-d3cd-44f0-b1ae-e518b7255e37&iId=22179292-bbee-4cfc-8724-f3498d90dfa8) they may say oh you need to speak to your old adjuster (they likely quit) but don’t get off the phone until you receive an email with the letter 
  2. what are your quotes for what types of coverage (give the exact breakdown) because otherwise we can’t guide you 


Someone paying $600 for liability only and another paying $600 for first party coverages and such are two different scenarios

When you switch carries and get quotes 
Let’s say you had an accident a year prior with Geico as your insurance but it was again a no fault loss like (hit and run, rear ended, someone backed into your parked car or a comprehensive loss) 
[State Farm](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+car+insurance+quotes&cId=b1f68e2b-8233-4e00-ac5c-dcfb6d5a3db3&iId=274cfdbe-4fd1-4d33-8d6e-0ab0d49f51ad), progressive, and every other insurance company running quotes will see in the database you had a claim from a year ago and they “automatically assume” it’s an at-fault loss 
They can’t actually see Geico file and claim information only that a claim was filed so they assume you at fault and your quotes are higher because of that 
Showing the broker/person giving you the quote the letter of experience is Geico or whoever the insurance carrier was at the time (hey our insured was not at fault for this loss for being rear ended) it’s a quick short letter just stating no fault 
So this should satisfy them not quoting you higher at that point

Just got the same car. How could it be $605 a month for a $30,000 car? My insurance is $216 a month.

Insurance went up across the table, minimum liability is now 30k so everyone’s premiums went up, I pay just shy of 500 for full coverage on a 23 rx350 premium

I believe it, my 2022 Sonata was quoted $450 a month full coverage. Not $450/6 months, it’s $450 a month or $2700/6 months. With a full clean record driving over 10 years.

Wow, that’s insanely high! Are you young? 
Maybe consult a broker to see who can give you the best deal.

That is insane, that's probably higher than the car payment! 
I pay less than that for two cars/two drivers and the car values are about 80k. 
I would shop around, maybe look at GEICO or talk to a broker and see what they can find for you, I would say it should be closer to 200 and even that is crazy. Car insurance here is a huge fucking ripoff. When I lived in DC we paid $110 a month, I pay over triple that now with the same record.

Mine is 308 for a 2025 k5 but I have Costco insurance and I don’t think they take anymore new applications. To answer your question, that does seem like a lot.

Age and zip code matter. Example Glendale is extremely expensive. 
But your quotes seem on the extremely high side to me. Try shop around more.
