## Car insurance and earthquake damage

Your car is only covered for earthquake damage if you have [**comprehensive coverage**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/). This part of your auto policy pays for damage from events beyond your control, like natural disasters, falling objects, or theft. However, **comprehensive isn’t included automatically**.

Insurers can make exceptions for rare or catastrophic events, especially in high-risk areas, so always check your policy details to be sure.

---

## Can you add coverage right before an earthquake?

Unfortunately, no. **You can’t wait until the shaking starts to get protection,**and insurers are prepared for that. Here’s why:

* **Binding restrictions:** When a disaster is looming, insurance companies may temporarily stop allowing new policies or coverage changes. This “pause” is called a binding restriction, and it prevents last-minute updates until the risk has passed.
* **No warning:** Unlike hurricanes or snowstorms, earthquakes strike without notice. The USGS confirms there’s no reliable way to predict them, so there’s no forecast window to act on.[[1]](#footnote-1)

**Bottom line:** If you want your car covered for earthquake damage, you’ll need to add comprehensive coverage in advance.

#### Am I covered everywhere?

Earthquake damage coverage is included in the "weather-related incidents" bucket. Unless your policy has a unique stipulation, this coverage should be consistent across all major car insurance companies, in every US state. For example, if you move from [Texas](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/texas-car-insurance/) to [California](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/california-car-insurance/), where earthquakes occur more often, you would maintain earthquake coverage from your comprehensive insurance.

### [Comprehensive vs. Collision Insurance Coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-vs-collision/)

What's the difference between collision and comprehensive insurance? Our insurance experts dive into the details of each.

## How much does comprehensive coverage cost?

The cost of comprehensive coverage depends largely on your vehicle. Unlike [liability coverage,](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/)which pays for injuries or damage to others, comprehensive coverage pays to repair or replace *your* car. That means premiums are higher for vehicles that would cost more to fix or replace after a disaster, such as [wildfires](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-wildfires/), [floods](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-flood-damage/), or [hurricanes](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/natural-disasters/does-car-insurance-cover-hurricane-damage/).

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### What insurance company is the best for comprehensive coverage?

The best insurer for comprehensive coverage depends on your location, vehicle, and needs. Still, some top-rated options include[USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) (especially for military families), [State Farm](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) (for strong claims support), and [American Family](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/american-family-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) (for flexible, affordable plans). For more detailed comparisons, see our full guide to the [best insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/).

### [Homeowners Insurance and Earthquakes: What You Need to Know | The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/earthquake-insurance/)

Standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage. Find out what you need to do to make sure that you and your assets are protected.

## Do you need comprehensive insurance?

According to our data, **70%** of drivers carry full coverage, which usually includes both comprehensive and collision coverage. If you lease or finance a vehicle, this is usually required.[[2]](#footnote-2)

If your car is worth less than $4,000 and you own it outright, you might be comfortable with only the state minimum. It's really a personal choice based on your budget and your tolerance for risk. To save on premiums, consider raising your [deductible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-deductibles/)—just be sure you can afford it if you need to file a claim.

📌 In California, most earthquake insurance for homes is offered through the California Earthquake Authority, and sold alongside homeowners policies—but this doesn’t apply to cars.[[3]](#footnote-3) For your vehicle, comprehensive coverage is the key.

![earthquake damage]()

Which states are most at risk for earthquakes?

This may surprise you, but [Alaska](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/alaska-car-insurance/) takes the top spot for the most frequent earthquakes (and holds the record for the worst one on record, back in 1954 with a 6.2 magnitude quake). [California](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/california-car-insurance/) comes in second place, before [Hawaii](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/hawaii-car-insurance/), [Nevada](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/nevada-car-insurance/), and [Washington](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/washington-car-insurance/). They can even happen throughout the Midwest and southeastern United States. [[4]](#footnote-4)

## Does earthquake damage affect car insurance rates?

**Yes, filing a claim for earthquake damage can lead to a rate increase,** though typically less than a collision or liability claim. On average, you might see your premium rise by about $90 per year (or around $7 per month) for up to three years after filing.

Even if you don’t file a claim, your rates could still go up. Insurance companies often adjust premiums based on regional losses. If a major earthquake results in widespread claims, insurers may raise rates across the board.

**What to do if your premium increases:**  
If your rate jumps after a natural disaster, it’s a good time to [compare quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/). Prices vary by company, and switching providers could help lower your costs.

## How to file a car insurance claim after earthquake damage

Earthquakes can cause widespread damage, which may slow the claims process, and claims may take longer if the earthquake caused major regional damage.

**Here’s what to do if you need to [file a claim](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/):**

* Contact your insurer as soon as it’s safe to report the damage.
* Take photos or video of your car, especially if it was hit by falling debris or crushed in a garage collapse.
* Wait for the adjuster’s review and payout, minus your deductible.

## Earthquakes and car insurance: FAQs

Does car insurance go up for natural disasters?
Chevron down icon

It can. Anytime you make a claim, your premium could increase at the next renewal. Insurers also consider the overall risk in a given area, and frequent natural disasters can drive up rates over time.

Is earthquake excluded from insurance?
Chevron down icon

With car insurance, if you have comprehensive coverage, earthquake damage is usually covered under comprehensive coverage. However, homeowners insurance is different and requires a specific policy endorsement.

Is my car covered for natural disasters?
Chevron down icon

If you have comprehensive coverage, this optional part of your auto policy pays for damage caused by events outside your control, like earthquakes, wildfires, hail, or flooding. It’s not included in basic liability coverage, so you must add it separately.

Is your car covered by a renters or homeowners policy?
Chevron down icon

No. Renters and homeowners insurance cover your personal belongings and your home, but not your car. To protect your vehicle from damage (including from natural disasters), you’ll need auto insurance with comprehensive coverage.
