Multicar discounts are a great way for drivers to keep their auto insurance rates low. Although adding a second vehicle to your auto insurance policy increases your overall rate, multicar discounts can help offset this increase.
Below, we’ll provide the best car insurance discounts for multiple cars. We’ll also explore when a multicar policy is the best option and when it might be best to seek out other discounts.
## Key Takeaways
* Some auto insurance providers offer discounts of up to 25 percent for a multicar policy.
* You can share an auto insurance policy with anyone who lives at the same address.
* On average, [GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) and [Amica](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/amica/reviews/) offer the biggest discounts for a multicar policy.
* The cost of your multicar policy will depend not just on the discount percentage but also on your provider’s base rates. Full and minimum coverage averages vary significantly depending on your provider, location, vehicle type and driving history.
## How Does Multicar Insurance Work?
With multicar insurance, you insure more than one vehicle on a single auto insurance policy. Anyone who shares your address may join your multicar policy. This is typically your spouse, children or other family members, but it may include your roommates. Many providers offer special discounts for auto insurance customers who insure multiple vehicles on the same policy.
It is usually cheaper to insure all of the cars in your household under one policy than to buy separate policies for each vehicle. However, if a driver in your household has a violation on their record or you have a [teen driver](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/teens/), this will increase your premiums.
## Providers With the Best Car Insurance Discounts for Multiple Cars
Many providers offer a certain percentage discount on your premium for insuring multiple cars. The table below shows 10 providers that offer multicar discounts, along with the discount percentage.
GEICO offers a multicar policy discount of up to 25 percent — the highest percentage of all our providers below.

The company provides a wide range of exclusive perks, including dividend policies and free glass repair. While premiums may be slightly higher than some direct competitors (estimated full coverage for two cars is $3,476), loyal policyholders appreciate long-term savings through discounts, low complaint levels, and responsive claims service. Amica is especially recommended for drivers who value attentive support, multiple ways to save, and above-average digital tools for managing policies.

Progressive is the go-to for drivers wanting flexibility and customizability. Its 12 percent multi-car discount is solid, and you can add further savings by bundling policies or participating in programs like [Snapshot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/snapshot/), which rewards safe, low-mileage driving. Progressive’s biggest advantage is the depth of coverage and digital experience—features such as the “Name Your Price” tool and options like accident forgiveness appeal to policy shoppers with specific coverage needs. While Progressive’s customer satisfaction scores are average, the company excels with tech-forward solutions and reliable claims service, making it a favorite for drivers who want choices and digital convenience.

USAA is a stand-out insurer for military members, [veterans](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/veterans/), and their families, consistently offering the lowest rates for eligible multi-car households—an estimated $1,829 annually for two cars. The insurer delivers an up-to-10 percent multi-car discount alongside a suite of military-specific options: vehicle storage, deployment-friendly features, and flexible payment arrangements. Additional discounts—such as bundling, safe driver, and good student—layer further savings on already competitive rates. USAA’s consistently stellar satisfaction ratings and service focus make it the top choice for those who qualify, though eligibility is restricted to the military community.

[Read Full Review](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/)
State Farm is the largest auto insurer in the U.S. and is appealing to families who value face-to-face guidance. Its multi-car discount is comparable—up to 12 percent—and the brand’s strength lies in its large agent network, readily available to help tailor coverage, manage claims, and explain discounts. State Farm’s customer service scores are consistently above average and the company backs its policies with a robust digital platform and strong financial stability. Though estimated premiums for two vehicles run higher than GEICO or USAA ($3,814), the one-on-one agent experience and in-person service are key reasons many households choose State Farm for multi-car coverage.
#### State Farm Pricing
**Multi-Car Potential Discount** | 12%
---|---
**Estimated Monthly Premium for Two Cars** | $318
**Estimated Annual Premium for Two Cars** | $3,814
## How to Find the Cheapest Multicar Insurance
A higher discount percentage doesn’t necessarily translate to the cheapest auto insurance. Your discount will be applied to the base price, which can vary significantly depending on your insurer, driving history and location.
The table below shows the national average annual cost of full coverage car insurance for a one-car policy from major providers, along with estimated rates for insuring two vehicles on the same policy. Where available, we used each insurer’s published multi-car discount to calculate a more precise estimate. For providers without discount data, we assumed a standard 30 percent increase in total premium.
Provider | Annual full coverage (1 car) | Estimated full coverage (2 cars)
---|---|---
Allstate | $2,605 | $3,387
Amica | $2,317 | $3,476
Farmers | $2,979 | $3,873
GEICO | $1,731 | $2,597
Liberty Mutual | No data | No data
Progressive | $1,960 | $3,450
Nationwide | $1,808 | $2,350
State Farm | $2,167 | $3,814
Travelers | $1,597 | $2,938
USAA | $1,407 | $1,829
Your rates will be determined by your location, your vehicles, the number of drivers and their driving records. The national average auto insurance rate for full coverage for one car is $2,399, while [minimum coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/) costs an average of $635 per year.
## How Many Vehicles Can I Add to a Multicar Policy?
The number of vehicles you can add to your multicar policy depends on your insurer. Most multicar insurance providers let you add at least four cars to your policy, and some allow as many as nine.
If you need to insure 10 or more vehicles, you may need to speak with an insurance agent or look into a [commercial insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/commercial/) policy.
Commercial insurance sometimes comes with special discounts, such as a commercial driver’s license discount or a business expense discount.
## Other Benefits of a Multicar Insurance Policy
Along with discounts on your premiums, multicar insurance policies often come with one or more of the following benefits.
### Option for Stacked Coverage
Some states allow stacked coverage, which allows you to combine your uninsured motorist coverage limits for multiple vehicles to provide higher overall coverage. For example, if you have uninsured bodily injury limits of $50,000/$100,000 per car, with two cars on your policy, you can stack these limits to have $100,000/$200,000 if one car is involved in an accident with an uninsured motorist. Learn more about [stacked vs. unstacked coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/stacked-vs-unstacked/).
### Simplified Policy Management
A multicar insurance policy allows you to manage multiple vehicles’ insurance at once, making it easier to pay your premiums.
## Can I Customize Coverage With a Multicar Policy?
Even with multiple cars on the same policy, you can often customize coverage types for each vehicle. Depending on your provider, you’ll likely be able to add or remove the following coverage types by vehicle:
* Comprehensive
* Collision
* Emergency roadside assistance
* Rental reimbursement
For example, if you have an older, low-value car that is fully paid off, you might decide to drop comprehensive and collision coverage for that vehicle while keeping comprehensive and collision coverage for a newer vehicle.
Not all coverage types are customizable, however. The following coverage types are typically the same across all vehicles on your multicar policy:
* Liability (bodily injury and property protection)
* Personal injury protection (PIP)
* Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage
Minimum auto insurance requirements vary significantly by state. Learn more about the [liability limit requirements](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/liability-limits/) in your state.
## Other Discounts to Keep Your Rates Low
Along with multicar policy discounts, there are other common auto insurance discounts you may be able to apply to your multicar policy to keep your rates low.
* **Bundling discount:** Along with multicar discounts, some insurers offer discounts for bundling multiple policies, such as [home and auto](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/home/).
* **Safe-driving discount:** Some auto insurance providers offer discounts for those who have stayed accident-free for a certain number of years.
* **Telematics:** Drivers who practice safe habits behind the wheel or drive infrequently can save money by applying telematics discounts to their policy.
* **Car safety features:** If your car has certain [safety features](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/safety-features-new-used-car/) or an anti-theft device, you can qualify for additional savings on your premiums.
* **Young-driver discounts:** Common young-driver discounts include a good-student discount and a student-away-from-home discount.
* **Homeowner:** Drivers who own their own home are sometimes eligible for additional auto insurance discounts, even if the homeowners policy is with a different provider.
* **Paperless:** Switching to paperless billing can grant you a small discount with some providers.
* **Pay in full:** You may get lower rates by paying in full at the start of each policy year than by paying monthly.
## When not to Use a Multicar Policy
Although a multicar policy comes with benefits, it’s not always the best option. A multicar policy may end up costing you more in the following scenarios:
* **You have a vintage car.** Adding a vintage or classic car to your multicar policy typically raises the rates for all vehicles on that policy, potentially negating any financial benefit of a multicar discount. Instead, consider a provider that offers classic-car discounts or a usage-based discount for a vehicle you rarely drive. You may find that the [best classic car provider](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/classic-cars/) is not the same as the best company for your everyday vehicle.
* **Someone on the policy has a bad driving record.** If you add someone with a poor driving record — such as a driver with a history of speeding, [accidents](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/accidents/) or a [DUI](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/dui/) — you’ll likely see the rates increase for everyone on that policy. Instead, it’s best to opt for an auto insurance provider that’s known for offering low rates to those with a spotty driving record. Learn more about the [best high-risk car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/bad-record/) providers.
* **You want to insure a child who no longer lives with you.** If your child does not live at your address, they cannot be on your multicar policy. Everyone on the policy must live at the same address.
## Conclusion
If you’re looking to insure more than one vehicle, choosing an insurer that offers a multicar discount is a great way to save on your premiums. Amica and GEICO offer some of the biggest discounts for insuring multiple vehicles on the same policy (up to 25 percent).
Your multicar policy rate will depend on various factors, including your insurer, location, vehicles, and driving history of each insured driver. Even if you do not qualify for a multicar discount, there may be other ways to save, including safe-driver, telematics and young-driver discounts.
## Frequently Asked Questions

![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO and Amica offer the largest multicar savings, with discounts of up to 25 percent, while Progressive and State Farm provide multicar discounts of up to 12 percent. It’s worth noting that not all auto insurance providers that advertise multicar discounts make their discount percentage available.
Does car insurance go down with multiple cars?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Many auto insurance providers offer discounts for insuring more than one vehicle on the same policy. However, adding a second vehicle to your auto insurance policy will likely increase your overall premium.
Does GEICO have a multicar discount?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO offers a multicar discount of up to 25 percent. This is the highest discount percentage of all of our multicar discount providers.
Can one insurance policy cover multiple vehicles?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes, one auto insurance policy can cover multiple vehicles. This is known as a multicar policy. The maximum number of vehicles you can insure on one policy varies among insurers; some allow you to insure up to nine vehicles on the same policy. If you need to insure 10 or more vehicles, you may need to consider commercial insurance.
## Our Multi-Car Insurance Provider Evaluation Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we systematically review auto insurers across four main criteria—Price, Claims Handling, Customer Experience, and Coverage Options. Here’s exactly how these apply when choosing the best auto insurance for households with two or more cars on the same policy:
* **Price (40%):** We analyze average premiums using good drivers with good credit as our baseline. For this multi-car analysis:
* Rates are based on national averages for full coverage ($100,000/$300,000 bodily injury liability per person/accident; $50,000 property damage; $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist; comprehensive/collision with $500 deductible), reflecting what most families need to protect multiple vehicles.
* When an insurer publishes its multi-car discount, we apply that percentage to their one-car policy price to estimate two-car coverage. Where discount data is unavailable, we conservatively estimate that adding a second car increases the total premium by 30 percent.
* **Claims Handling (25%).** A good claims process is vital, especially when insuring multiple vehicles. We rate insurers using third-party research (including the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report), plus financial strength from agencies like AM Best and S&P. Factors we examine include:
* Speed and transparency of claims resolution, communication quality, and ease of getting both cars back on the road.
* Real customer stories and claim outcomes, when available, add further insight for multi-car families.
* **Customer Experience (25%).** Buying, using, and updating your policy should be seamless, and ease-of-use matters more for families tracking several vehicles. Our review considers:
* How easy it is to quote, insure, and manage multiple cars—whether online, with an agent, or via mobile app.
* Quality and speed of agent or support interactions.
* User ratings from the NAIC complaint index, J.D. Power, BBB, and app store reviews, tailored to multi-car policyholders’ needs.
* **Coverage Options (10%).** We look for insurers whose options meet the unique risks of multi-vehicle households. In addition to minimum legal requirements, we value companies offering full coverage, accident forgiveness, gap insurance, rideshare coverage, new car replacement, and flexible deductibles—especially those that help when claims or risks stack across more than one car.
