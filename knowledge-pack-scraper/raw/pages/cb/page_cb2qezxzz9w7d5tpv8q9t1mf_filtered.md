## How to find the best car insurance in California

The best car insurance policy is different for everyone and depends on your financial and budgetary needs. To help pinpoint the best carrier for you, review the following:

* Number 1 Icon

  ### Consider your individual needs

  Caret Down Icon 

  Do you need to insure a [teen driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/)? Or have you had [accidents](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) or speeding tickets on your driving record? Or maybe you tend to use public transportation more than your car. Every driver is different, and talking with a licensed agent can help you find the company that has the types of coverage and discounts that work best for you.

  If you have a car loan or lease, you will likely need to carry full coverage. Often, leasing companies require drivers to carry [gap coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/), which is not available with every carrier.

* Number 2 Icon

  ### Consider reviews and ratings

  Caret Down Icon 

  When it comes to customer service and claim handling, reading reviews from current customers can provide deeper insight into what to expect from the carrier. The [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/) U.S. Auto Insurance Study gauges customer satisfaction across several core dimensions, such as level of trust and price. And J.D. Power’s U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study focuses on policyholder experiences during the claims process.

  The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) Complaint Index is another tool that measures customer complaints in relation to the carrier's size. An index score of 1.00 represents an average number of complaints. Scores below 1.00 mean the carrier has had fewer complaints than average, and vice versa.

  Lastly, financial stability is another key component when considering which auto insurance company to choose. Companies like AM Best use a grading system to show their confidence level in a carrier's ability to honor its claim obligations and creditworthiness.

  ### Consider smaller companies

  Caret Down Icon 

  While big-name insurance companies get all the attention, sometimes smaller, local carriers can offer more personalized service. A [smaller company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/small-auto-insurance-companies/) may have faster response times and have unique insight into local coverage challenges. However, bigger companies may be more financially stable and have better digital tools. Getting [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) from several carriers, both big and small, can help you narrow down the options.

* ### What do you need to get car insurance in California?

  Caret Down Icon 

  In California, obtaining car insurance isn't complicated, but you will need a few key things: your driver's license number, your vehicle identification number (VIN) and the background information about your driving record. If there are other drivers on the policy, you will need their information as well, including their date of birth. Drivers with a lease or a loan will also want to have the name and address of their lender on hand.

Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D.

* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
