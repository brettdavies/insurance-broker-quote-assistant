But it has a higher-than-expected number of complaints with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for a company of its size.

## State Farm commercial auto coverage options
State Farm’s commercial car insurance plans may be a good fit if you or your employees drive for business purposes. Artisan and service contractors, farmers, ranchers, florists, and caterers often use State Farm’s commercial auto policies, according to the insurer.
Compared to personal auto insurance, commercial car insurance from State Farm typically includes more comprehensive protection and higher liability limits due to the greater risk associated with business operations.
As you shop around for commercial car insurance, you’ll find that State Farm’s offerings are similar to those of other insurance companies. But the insurer doesn’t advertise as many discounts as some insurers and doesn’t offer coverage in every state.
