# Lyft Driver Requirements
* [Rideshare Accident](https://accidentnetwork.com/category/rideshare-accident/)
[We are here to help, schedule a free consultation now](https://accidentnetwork.com/lyft-driver-requirements/#text-2)
Drivers should remain mindful of potential risks involved in rideshare driving, including accidents. Those affected by incidents with services like Lyft or Uber can seek legal advice from dedicated [rideshare accident lawyers](https://accidentnetwork.com/rideshare-accidents/). Understanding the full scope of driver qualifications helps individuals prepare effectively and safely enter this field.
A thorough background screening is mandatory. This includes checks on driving history and criminal records to ensure passenger safety. [Proof of insurance](https://accidentnetwork.com/uber-and-lyft-driver-requirements/#:~:text=Driving%20for%20Uber%20or%20driving%20for%20Lyft%20both%20require%20each%20driver%20to%20have%20their%20own%20insurance) and necessary documents must also be submitted.
![Vehicle feature requirements](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Drivers also have access to _first-party coverages_, which may include _uninsured motorist protection_ and _contingent comprehensive and collision coverage_, depending on the driver’s own insurance policy and Lyft’s terms.
* When the app is on but no ride request is accepted, Lyft usually offers [_limited liability protection_](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/all/articles/115013080548-Insurance-coverage-while-driving-with-lyft#:~:text=Coverage%20when%20the%20app%20is%20on%20and%20waiting%20for%20a%20ride%20request).
In some states, such as Michigan, additional requirements apply. Drivers must carry _property protection_ coverage and comply with state-specific insurance laws beyond the basic Lyft requirements.
