Car insurance for teens and young drivers can be expensive. In fact, our data shows that the average teen pays a whopping 85% more for car insurance than the national average for all age groups. That’s because they tend to make riskier driving decisions and have less experience than older age groups.[[1]](#cite-1)

That means it’s even more important for teens to find ways to [save on their monthly car insurance bill](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). One of the easiest ways is to take advantage of discounts. Many insurers reward good grades by offering a good student discount for young drivers with a B average or better.

Savings vary by state and insurance company, but USAA offers a good student discount of up to 10%. We break down the details of the USAA discount below, including how to qualify, how it stacks up to its competitors, and other ways to save on [USAA](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/usaa) car insurance.

## **What Is the USAA Good Student Discount?**

It can be shocking to see the rate increase when adding a newly licensed [teen](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens) or [young driver](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) to your car insurance policy. One way insurance companies help parents combat higher insurance rates is by offering discounts to young drivers.

The [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount) is a common car insurance discount that many insurers, including USAA, offer. Responsible full-time students with good grades — usually a 3.0 GPA or better — can receive this discount from USAA until [age 25](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-insurance-under-25).

It’s available in every U.S. state except Hawaii or North Carolina.

![Progressive](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/8be93b0f22/progressive.svg)![Liberty Mutual](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/21b806be35/libertymutual.svg)![Allstate](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/8e2b1b1459/allstate.svg)

## **How Much Can You Save With the USAA Good Student Discount?**

USAA advertises good student discount savings of up to 10%, but it can vary [by state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state) and other discounts you already have on your insurance policy. Other factors — such as the student’s [age](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/age), [driving record](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/driving-record), and [vehicle make and model](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/vehicle-model) — also determine how much you can save with a good student discount.

Although a good student discount could save you a decent amount, you should still brace for a potentially large rate increase when adding a teen driver. For example, some USAA customers on Reddit say their rates increased substantially, even with the good student discount.[[2]](#cite-2)

### **How does USAA’s good student discount compare to competitors?**

USAA isn’t the only well-known car insurance company offering a good student discount. Allstate, State Farm, and GEICO are just a few companies that offer it to full-time students.

The table below shows how USAA’s good student discount and average rates compare to other top competitors, according to our research.

| **Company**  sort ascsort desc | **Average Full-Coverage Premium**  sort ascsort desc | **Offers Good Student Discount?**  sort ascsort desc | **Discount Availability**  sort ascsort desc | **Maximum Discount Savings**  sort ascsort desc |

[State Farm’s good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-student-discount) is the largest discount on our list — students can earn up to 25% savings until the age of 25 with the insurer. Allstate offers the discount for any full-time student with a 2.7 GPA or better but doesn’t disclose its discount savings. Progressive offers the least savings, and only drivers 23 and younger are eligible for its good student discount.

## **How to Get the USAA Good Student Discount**

![Girl with a ponytail driving a car, viewed from the back seat. The dashboard and steering wheel are visible.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/7ff84ccc98/girl-in-purple-driving.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

Although some [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) apply to your policy automatically, getting a good student discount requires a little bit of work. You must send proof of good grades to your USAA agent to get this discount.

USAA doesn’t specify how to get and keep a good student discount on your policy. In general, you must maintain good grades and provide proof you meet the GPA qualifications at each renewal or annually to keep the discount. Meeting one of the following from your most recently completed semester usually qualifies as proof:

* Honor roll or dean’s list certificate
* Report card
* School transcript
* Top 20% class ranking

Allow a few days after submitting proof for the discount to apply. Contact your USAA agent if you need help applying the discount. You can maximize savings on your USAA auto policy by being a good driver, avoiding [tickets](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/tickets) and [accidents](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/at-fault-collisions), and taking advantage of other discounts.

## **Other USAA Discounts to Consider**

![A diverse group of four people collaborate at a library table, surrounded by books and a laptop, with shelves in the background.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/5a101e8f89/teens-studying.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

Most car insurance companies require a 3.0 GPA, or B average, or higher to get a good student discount. Allstate only requires a 2.7 GPA. Check your insurance company for details.
