California’s largest homeowners’ insurer, [State Farm](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/state-farm/67041/), has petitioned state regulators for an urgent 22% rate hike, a move that underscores the deepening instability in the state’s insurance market. The request, submitted on Monday, reflects growing financial pressures as wildfires and other natural disasters continue to drive insurance costs upward.
The [California Department of Insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/california-department-of-insurance/535034/) confirmed that it would review State Farm’s application. “State Farm General’s rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,” said department spokesman Gabriel Sanchez. “To protect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market, the department will respond with urgency and transparency.”
