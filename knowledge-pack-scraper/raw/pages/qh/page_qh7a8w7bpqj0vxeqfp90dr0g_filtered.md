With an average cost of $336/month, Progressive offers savings like multi-policy and [safe driver car insurance discounts](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/why-a-safe-driving-record-means-lower-car-insurance-rates/), potentially cutting rates by up to 50%.

* Progressive insurance offers a variety of different insurance policy options.
* The e-sign car insurance discount gives a $50 discount when initially signing up for Progressive insurance online.
* The pay-in-full discount offers a discount for any policyholder who pays their car insurance premium in one lump payment.

The accident forgiveness discount is available to policyholders who have had a Progressive car insurance policy for four years and have remained accident-free for three of those years in a row. This Progressive accident forgiveness feature ensures that if you have a qualifying accident, your rate will not increase.

![Best Progressive Car Insurance Discounts: Bundling Discount Definition Card](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Best Progressive Car Insurance Discounts: Bundling Discount Definition Card")![Best Progressive Car Insurance Discounts: Bundling Discount Definition Card](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/Images/Bundling-Discount.png "Best Progressive Car Insurance Discounts: Bundling Discount Definition Card")

With Progressive’s accident forgiveness benefit, car insurance rates remain unaffected after the first at-fault accident. The Progressive e-sign discount also provides a $50 savings for signing up online. This incentive, also known as the Progressive sign online discount, makes it easy for customers to save when purchasing coverage digitally.

Another discount is a special discount for a policyholder who pays their car insurance premium in one lump payment instead of monthly, also known as the Progressive discount for paying in full. Progressive offers many other car insurance discounts, which the company will tell you more about if you become a policyholder. These other discounts are not listed on the company’s website.

After choosing the car insurance company with the best car insurance rates, discover how well your company rates among others. Visit the A.M. Best Company website to see how highly your car insurance provider is rated. For example, Progressive has an A.M. Best rating of A+ Superior.

## Discount Opportunities With Progressive Insurance

Finding the right rate can be challenging, and you might wonder, “How do I get cheap Progressive insurance?” Progressive offers standard discounts along with state-specific options. While many competitors provide similar discounts, Progressive’s unique package tailors your policy to your needs. Here’s a list of Progressive insurance discounts:

* Advanced Premium Payments
* Multi-Policy
* Multi-Car
* Club or Organization Affiliations
* Good Driver

When you pay your premiums in advance, you will receive a discount whether you pay for the whole year or several months in advance. You are also eligible for a multi-policy discount if you bundle your house and car insurance with Progressive. Multiple-line insurance discounts can be particular.

#### Paying premiums upfront and bundling policies, like home and auto, quickly lowers insurance costs. Progressive also offers discounts for unique combinations like auto and boat or auto and RV, with the highest savings typically for auto and home bundles, which discount both policies.

Daniel Walker
 **Licensed Insurance Agent**

For example, combining auto and boat, auto and motorcycle, or auto and RV insurance can lower one policy’s rate. The best option is often bundling home and auto insurance.

Does Progressive offer a bundle discount? Yes, bundling can significantly lower premiums, often doubling discounts for home and auto policies. Even without bundling, owning a home—regardless of the insurer—can qualify you for a discount. The following table compares Progressive’s multiple policy discounts with comparable discounts of other companies, should they have one.

There are many discounts available. Some are focused on safety features installed in the vehicle, the safety history of the driver, and loyalty, but more on that later. Multi-car discounts are not just for individuals who happen to own two vehicles. Any car kept primarily at your home address can be added to the policy. This means it can belong to a spouse, a family member, or even a roommate.

> Individuals and businesses with multiple vehicles will receive discounts as well.

This is especially helpful for small transportation businesses with fleets. Your AAA and AARP membership entitles you to a club and organization discount, and if you are a good driver, you have your pick of insurers. The following table compares Progressive’s multi-vehicle policies with its competitors, including whether they should offer a discount.

* [Electronic Stability Control Car Insurance Discounts](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/electronic-stability-control-and-car-insurance/)

As you can see, every company saves for one, and Allstate offers multi-vehicle discounts. So, how does Progressive stack up against the competition? Of the percentages available, it is towards the bottom. Progressive’s available discount is higher than three companies’, tied with one, and lower than eight. Geico offers the highest discount, 25%. The Hanover and The Hartford offer the lowest discount, 5% each.

Explore more information on the [best Geico car insurance discounts](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/geico-car-insurance-discounts/).

Continuous insurance discounts also carry potentially beneficial stipulations. Progressive even looks at your loyalty to competitors. This makes switching easier, benefiting from discounts Progressive offers for new and long-time policyholders. So, if you had benefits given due to policy-holding longevity and decided to switch to Progressive, they’ll take note.

> The actual value of the continuous insurance discount provided by Progressive will be dependent upon how long you have been insured sans gaps or auto insurance policy cancellations.

Your family members may qualify for the Progressive good student discount, available to those 22 or younger with a “B” average or better. Proof of academic performance is required, offering families potential savings on premiums. In addition to the good student discount, you can explore the Progressive student discount for more savings options tailored to young drivers.

Progressive also provides the Progressive safe driver discount for clean driving records, rewarding safe driving habits with lower premiums. Additionally, Progressive employees can explore exclusive discounts. Now, let’s delve into the “non-standard” discounts.

> Non-standard discounts are becoming more common to many insurers as a way to attract good drivers or an increased number of drivers.

Some of the newer additional discounts are Progressive accident forgiveness, e-sign, disappearing deductible, and Snapshot.  Progressive offers accident forgiveness to help drivers avoid rate increases after an accident. Minor accident forgiveness ensures no rate hike for claims under $500. In contrast, significant accident forgiveness applies to customers with at least five years of loyalty and a clean driving record for the past three years.

## Defensive Driving Savings Options With Progressive

It is fair to ask yourself, “Does Progressive insurance offer discounts for defensive driving?” Fortunately, Progressive insurance [offers a defensive driver car insurance discount](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/what-is-a-defensive-driver-discount/)for qualifying drivers who complete an approved defensive driving course.

> Disappearing deductibles are 25% price reductions for every policy period that is claim-free until policy renewal.

For example, if one’s collision deductible were to be $1,000, and they have filed zero claims up to the point of their policy renewal, the new deductible would be $750. Different insurers use different names for lower deductible savings. For every 12 months that you go without an accident, your deductible will decrease.

Good drivers can also take advantage of Progressive’s Snapshot program by enrolling online when you request your quote. Progressive representatives will send you a device you install in your car that takes pictures of you as you drive (hopefully, using good driving habits). After 30 days, you could be entitled to as much as 30% off your premiums.

This program records driver information, and you may have privacy concerns. The [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/vehicle-data-privacy) monitors these issues if you’re looking for peace of mind.

Instead of paying one monthly lump sum, you can make bi-monthly payments. You may even be able to make your down payment in increments and negotiate your rate.

## Progressive’s Evolution: A Historical Overview

Progressive Insurance was founded in Ohio more than 70 years ago by Joe Lewis and Jack Green. Over the past few decades, the company has continued to grow and is today one of the most recognized insurance companies in the United States.

> The annual revenue for Progressive insurance was $15 billion in 2010 and the company is responsible for employing over 27,000 people.

Progressive is also a publicly traded company listed on the [New York Stock Exchange](https://coindataflow.com/en/stocks/exchange-nyse) as PGR. With over 10 million policies, Progressive is one of the biggest car insurance companies in the United States.

#### Progressive’s online-first approach offers customers efficient access to manage car insurance, often leading to faster service and lower rates. This digital focus sets them apart from traditional providers.

Dani Best
 **Licensed Insurance Producer**

Progressive is a competitor to the other leading car insurance providers like Allstate Insurance, [State Farm](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/companies/state-farm-car-insurance-review/ "State Farm Car Insurance Review for 2025 [See if They’re a Good Fit]") Insurance, the Farmers Insurance Group, USAA Insurance, and Nationwide Insurance. One of the main things that sets Progressive apart from some of these other car insurance providers is that it mainly sells its insurance policies over the Internet.

Know more information on our “[Allstate Car Insurance Review](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/companies/allstate-car-insurance-review/).”

This company also sells many policies via independent insurance companies and over the phone. Progressive currently has more than 30,000 independent insurance agents representing the company.

> An independent insurance agent works much differently than a private insurance company because they can try to sell many different kinds of insurance plans from many different insurance companies.

Independent agents are not as limited as private insurers. Progressive is most often recognized by its commercials. The Progressive spokeswoman, Flo, widely recognized from the question “[Who is Flo from the Progressive commercials?](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/who-is-the-progressive-car-insurance-girl/)“, shows fictional customers that by using the Progressive website, they can customize the insurance they need, name their insurance price, and compare Progressive’s insurance rates to the other leading car insurance companies.
