# Stay away from GEICO! Buyer beware, would like to share story.

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

So my auto insurance for two vehicles was going up by about 25 dollars a month to a bit over 300 a month for very good collision and comprehensive on a 2019 VW and 2024 Tesla (urban area), so I thought I'd shop around. I got a quote from GEICO for ~120 dollars a month less than what I pay with similar if not the same coverage. Seemed like a no brainer switch.

While trying to finalize the quote, they stated that because in Nov 2020, I was rear ended (DMV records show not at fault, no insurance payout/ no damage) and in 2021 my car was hit in a parking lot (DMV records show not at-fault, other party's insurance paid) my original quote for 197 dollars would jump up to 650+ dollars a month.

I don't know what logic they use in their system, but it's definitely broken. Don't get scammed! Also it takes forever to get a hold of someone, so it does feel like it is a deal of you get what you pay for.

I have no at-fault crashes, no speeding tickets, no violations, no lapse in insurance. (I'm 28 with continuous insurance since 16, 2 degrees, married, homeowner, reputable engineering job, wife works and has a degree, etc ). I'll stick to my current policy even if it's more expensive, at least they have a local office that I've never had an issue talking to someone with.
