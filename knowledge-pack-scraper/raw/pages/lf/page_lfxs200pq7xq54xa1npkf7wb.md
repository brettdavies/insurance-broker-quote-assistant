GEICO’s catchy slogan promises customers that “15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.” But is GEICO the right insurance for your needs?
According to our industry research, GEICO does offer some of the most affordable rates on the market — about 28 percent below the national average for full coverage.
That said, GEICO has few local agents and relies heavily on policyholders using its website and mobile app, and it conducts most of its operations virtually. Because of this, GEICO is best for customers who want to shop for and manage their policy online, rather than with an agent.
I’m a senior editor and analyst at AutoInsurance.com, and below, I’ll dive into the details of GEICO auto insurance based on our team’s research and personal customer experience, as well as my own experience getting a quote.

## At a Glance: GEICO’s Pros and Cons 
### Pros
  * Affordable prices and plenty of discounts
  * Easy online quote process
  * Competitive premiums for drivers with low credit
  * Good digital tools


### Cons
  * Does not underwrite its own homeowners insurance policies
  * Fewer local agents than competitors
  * Does not offer gap coverage


## Who Is GEICO Auto Insurance Best For?
Overall, GEICO is best for customers looking for inexpensive insurance who don’t mind managing their policy online.
**GEICO Is Best for You If You:**
  * Are looking for low rates
  * Want to shop and manage your policy online
  * Have bad credit, as GEICO’s rates are 26 percent below the national average for drivers with bad credit
  * Are a current or former federal government employee


**Consider Looking Elsewhere If You:**
  * Want to work with a local [agent](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agent-vs-broker/) who can help you manage your policy
  * Plan to bundle auto and homeowners insurance, as GEICO doesn’t underwrite its home policies
  * Have a [bad driving record](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/bad-record/), DUI, or at-fault accident on your record
  * Lease or finance your vehicle and require gap insurance


I decided to get a quote from GEICO because my policy with [State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) was up for renewal and I wanted to compare rates.
### GEICO Pricing by Customer Profile
Driver profile | GEICO average annual rate for full coverage | National average annual rate for full coverage  
---|---|---  
Good driver with good credit | $1,731 | $2,399  
Driver with a [DUI](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/dui/) | $4,498 | $3,305  
Driver with an at-fault accident | $2,889 | $2,812  
Driver with [bad credit](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/credit-scores/) | $2,492 | $3,377  
Drivers with a speeding ticket | $2,358 | $2,511  
25-year-old driver | $2,172 | $2,113  
Senior driver | $1,664 | $1,666  
## Insights from Real GEICO Policyholders
In addition to sharing my personal experiences with GEICO, our team analyzed real-life customer feedback and review patterns to understand what other drivers think. By analyzing over 6,000 customer reviews from major platforms like Reddit, BBB, and more, we identified common themes in customer satisfaction, complaints, and overall experience. Here’s what we found:
Category | Summary  
---|---  
Total Reviews Analyzed | Over 6,000 reviews (Yelp, BBB, Reddit, Trustpilot, and other aggregator sites)  
Top 3 Positives | 
  * Affordable rates for many drivers
  * Wide range of discounts (good student, federal employee, etc.)
  * Convenient online experience (user-friendly website/app for policy management and claims)

  
Top 3 Negatives | 
  * Rising premiums and unclear rate increases
  * Mixed claims and customer service experiences
  * Policy and billing confusion (unexpected cancellations, documentation issues, billing errors)

  
Key Takeaway | GEICO stands out for its competitive pricing, extensive discounts, and easy-to-use online tools, making it a popular choice for many drivers. While some customers have concerns about rate increases and claims service, many find GEICO’s affordability and digital convenience to be strong advantages that meet their insurance needs.  
## How Much Will You Pay for GEICO Car Insurance?
On average, [GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/) charges $1,731 annually ($144 monthly) for full coverage and $517 annually ($43 monthly) for minimum coverage. GEICO’s rates are cheaper than average — its full coverage rates are 28 percent below the national average, and its minimum coverage rates are 19 percent below the national average.
A major issue U.S. drivers face is skyrocketing auto insurance rates. According to J.D. Power, rates were up 11.2 percent on average between 2023 and 2024.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/#citation-1) At renewal, my policy with State Farm increased by about 15 percent, which aligns with these findings. That’s why I decided to get quotes from several providers, including GEICO. I actually had GEICO for my auto insurance long ago as a college student, when affordability was paramount.
I spoke with several current customers and asked how they felt about GEICO’s pricing. One person, who’s been a customer for six years, told me GEICO has raised the rate for his and his wife’s auto policy over the past couple years. However, the increases have been only around $20 monthly at each renewal, and overall, he is satisfied with GEICO’s pricing. Another customer, who’s been with GEICO for three years, also reported their prices have increased. Like me, they are on the lookout for cheaper alternatives.
GEICO gives a 15 percent discount on your policy if you’re part of the National Guard or Reserves, or if you’re an active or retired military member. Check out additional discounts from [top auto insurance companies for veterans](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/veterans/).
### How GEICO Compares With Other Companies
So how does GEICO stack up to the competition? Among the providers our team analyzed, GEICO was one of the cheapest widely available providers. Overall, it was the fourth cheapest behind USAA, Erie, and Travelers. The availability of the first two of these is limited regionally and by military affiliation, respectively.
So, while GEICO’s prices may be rising along industry trends, it’s still a company worth checking out if you’re looking for affordable coverage.
Company | Average annual premium for full coverage | Average annual premium for minimum coverage  
---|---|---  
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/reviews/) | $2,605 | $840  
[American Family](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/american-family/reviews/) | $1,936 | $604  
[Erie](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/erie/) | $1,647 | $581  
[Farmers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/farmers/reviews/) | $2,979 | $1,002  
GEICO | $1,731 | $517  
[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $1,808 | $718  
[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/) | $1,960 | $638  
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) | $2,167 | $674  
[Travelers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/travelers/reviews/) | $1,597 | $576  
[USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/) | $1,407 | $417  
National Average | $2,399 | $635  
Compare rates from GEICO to other top brands like [State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico-vs-state-farm/), [Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/) and [Liberty Mutual](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/liberty-mutual-vs-geico/).
## My Experience Getting a Quote With GEICO
It took me less than five minutes to get an [online quote](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/online/) with GEICO. After entering standard personal and vehicle information and agreeing to participate in GEICO’s safe driving program, DriveEasy, I received my initial quote.
Something I noticed is that GEICO did not ask about driving history, like accidents and violations. That means the initial quote you receive from GEICO may be lower than what the policy will actually cost.
Here’s what to expect when getting your online quote:

GEICO showed me a breakdown of premium costs and discounts in my estimated quote. It also allowed me to adjust coverage and see how changes affected my premium. I like this feature, because it gives transparency and allows you to play around with ways to lower your bill. It’s a step up compared to State Farm’s site, which requires connecting with an agent to finish the quote process.

Something I liked is that if you’re not sure about a type of coverage, you can click to find out what it means, with examples to help you understand. This is useful, especially because GEICO mainly uses its website instead of having agents you can talk to in person.
![GEICO Bodily Injury Liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F07%2F21163923%2FGEICO-9.png&w=3840&q=75)

Overall, I found GEICO’s online quote process fast and simple, and I liked the ability to customize coverage online. Other customers I spoke to agreed that GEICO’s quote and policy purchase process is straightforward and quick.
## Ways to Save on Your GEICO Policy
GEICO automatically added the following discounts to my quote:
  * **Anti-Theft Device** , which is built into my car
  * **Restraint** , for vehicle features like airbags and seatbelts
  * **Financial Responsibility** , for a history of on-time payments
  * **Good Driver** , for an accident-free history


The most significant discount was the Good Driver Discount, which GEICO says can save customers up to 22 percent on their policy (now called a Clean Driving Record discount).[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/#citation-2)
Here’s a full list of GEICO’s discounts:
  * Autopay Discount
  * Clean Driving Record Discount, if you’ve been accident-free for at least one year
  * Defensive Driver Discount, for drivers over age 50 who take an approved course
  * Driver Training Discount, for [young drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/discounts-for-teen-drivers/) who take an approved course
  * [DriveEasy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/driveeasy/) Discount, for tracking your driving behaviors with GEICO’s app
  * Early Shopper Discount, if you get a new policy from GEICO before your existing policy expires
  * Emergency Deployment Discount, for military members deployed in an imminent danger zone
  * Federal Employee Discount (Eagle Discount), for active or retired employees
  * Good Student Discount, for full-time students with a minimum 3.0 GPA
  * Homeownership Discount, if you own a home
  * Internet Quote Discount, if you start your quote online
  * Membership and Employee Discounts, for belonging to an affiliate group
  * Military Discount, for active-duty, retired, and members of the National Guard or Reserves
  * Multi-Policy Discount
  * Multi-Vehicle Discount
  * New-Vehicle Discount, for driving a car three model years old or newer
  * Paid in Full Discount
  * Paperless Discount
  * Student Away at School Discount, for drivers who live away from home to attend school full-time, as long as they don’t have regular access to a covered vehicle
  * Vehicle Equipment Discounts, which include discounts for restraint devices like airbags and seat belts, anti-lock brakes, anti-theft systems, and daytime running lights


GEICO was originally founded in 1936 as an insurance provider for government officials and military personnel. That’s where it gets its name — GEICO stands for Government Employees Insurance Company.
## What Types of Auto Insurance Coverage Does GEICO Offer?
GEICO offers all standard auto coverages, such as liability, medical payments, uninsured/underinsured motorist, collision, and comprehensive. If you can afford it, I always recommend increasing your liability limits above the state minimum, as it will protect your assets in case of a serious accident. Here’s how much increasing liability limits added to my quote*:
Liability coverage | What it pays for | Limits | How much is added to my quote  
---|---|---|---  
[Bodily injury](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/bodily-injury/) | The other party’s medical bills and damages (not your own medical bills) | $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident | About $22 per month  
[Property damage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/property-damage/) | Damage to another party’s vehicle or property (not your own vehicle) | $100,000 per accident | About $10 per month  
* Sample quote for a 30-year-old driver in Pennsylvania (me), where the bodily injury liability limits are $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident and the property damage liability limit is $5,000 per accident.
If possible, I also recommend carrying [uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/uninsured-motorist/), which protects you if you get into an accident with a driver who has no insurance or not enough insurance to cover the damages. This usually includes hit-and-runs and if you’re hit as a pedestrian (which unfortunately happens often where I live). Here’s how much it cost to add UIM to my quote:
Coverage | Limits | How much it added to my quote  
---|---|---  
Uninsured motorist bodily injury liability | $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident | $4.81 per month  
Underinsured motorist bodily injury liability | $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident | $6.14 per month  
Uninsured motorist bodily injury liability | $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident | $5.53 per month  
Underinsured motorist bodily injury liability | $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident | $33.74 per month  
In addition to the standard coverages, GEICO also offers the following:
Coverage | What it pays for | How much is added to my quote  
---|---|---  
Emergency roadside service | Roadside assistance for issues like flat tires, towing (not related to an accident), jump-starts, and lockouts (up to $100) | Less than $2 per month  
Rental reimbursement | A rental vehicle if your car is in the shop due to a covered incident | About $8 per month for $35 daily reimbursement (up to $1,050 max)About $11 per month for $50 daily reimbursement (up to $1,500 max)  
Upgraded accident forgiveness | For the first at-fault accident (of any driver on your policy), GEICO won’t raise your rates and allows you to keep your good driver discount. | About $2 per month  
GEICO is one of the few insurers that sells mechanical breakdown insurance. You can purchase this coverage if you drive a new or leased vehicle less than 15 months old and with less than 15,000 miles, and renew it up to 100,000 miles or seven years. It acts like an extended warranty, covering unexpected car repairs and mechanical issues.
GEICO does not sell gap coverage. It partners with American Modern to sell [classic car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/classic-cars/). GEICO offers Mexico auto insurance — if you travel to Mexico, GEICO offers many of the same coverage options, including its roadside assistance services.
### Cancellation Policy
GEICO does not have any cancellation fees. In order to [cancel your car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/cancellations-nonrenewals/), you must call 800-841-1587 and speak with an agent.
If you [switch car insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/how-to-switch-car-insurance/), your new provider may call and cancel the policy for you.
### Other Types of Insurance
In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells the following:
  * **Property insurance:** Homeowners, renters, landlords, mobile home, condo, and flood
  * **Business insurance:** Business owners, workers’ compensation, commercial auto, medical malpractice, general, professional, and cyber
  * **Miscellaneous insurance:** Pet, jewelry, identity protection, travel, overseas, life, and umbrella


**Note:** GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners insurance, which means if you choose to bundle auto and homeowners policies, GEICO will match you with one of its 31 partners. Your price and customer service will depend on the company GEICO matches you with (which you don’t choose yourself), so there are no guarantees you’re getting the most competitive price. Additionally, any claims will go through the partner, not GEICO itself. Because of this, I would not recommend GEICO if you’re looking to bundle your auto and homeowners policies.
## GEICO: Customer Satisfaction
Though some time has passed since I was a GEICO customer, I recall being satisfied with the service I received. However, you don’t have to take my word for it. Here’s what the data says about customer satisfaction with GEICO.
To start, GEICO received the highest possible rating from AM Best for financial strength, which means it can reliably pay out claims.
When it comes to [claims](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/) satisfaction, GEICO receives mixed to negative reviews. J.D. Power gave it a score of 692 out of 1,000, slightly below the average of 697. CRASH Network, an independently published newsletter that surveys collision repair shops, assigned GEICO a grade of C- for the third year in a row. This means some shops may find GEICO difficult to work with. I can’t speak to this personally because I never had to file a claim with GEICO.
On J.D. Power’s Insurance 2025 Insurance Shopping Study — which assesses companies on agent interaction, quote process, coverage offerings, and price — GEICO scored 17 points behind the national average. Though J.D. Power does not specify how companies score on individual factors, I imagine GEICO scored below average due to its limited number of agents, and potentially increased pricing. At the time I had GEICO, my insurance needs were basic, so the agent availability didn’t bother me. But, if you have questions about your policy or more complex insurance needs, I can see it being an issue.

## Filing a Claim With GEICO
Like I mentioned, I never had to file a claim with GEICO. However, a customer I spoke to did have to file a claim, and he reported a positive experience. After another driver hit his wife’s car while she was on her way home from work. She called GEICO and they provided friendly and helpful service. GEICO directed her to an auto body shop, provided details about her deductible, and followed up with the other driver’s insurance company to resolve the issue.
If you’re involved in an accident where the other party is at fault (for example, someone rear-ends you at a red light), you can usually file a claim with your own insurer, who will pay for the damages and then seek reimbursement from the at-fault party’s insurance company. This process is known as [subrogation](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/subrogation/). Sometimes, they can recover the cost of your deductible too.
You can begin a claim on GEICO’s mobile app, website ([geico.com/claims](http://geico.com/claims)), or by phone at (800) 841-3000. While some major insurers encourage customers to begin claims online, and even make it difficult to begin claims by phone, GEICO does not state a preference as to how customers begin claims. While GEICO received mixed third-party ratings for its claims process, customers I spoke to reported being satisfied with how GEICO managed their claims.
## Digital Tools
With a robust set of digital tools, GEICO is a good choice for customers who want to manage their policy from a computer or phone. Here’s how we used GEICO’s app in our team’s testing:
  * **Basic insurance management:** We managed our auto insurance policies through the GEICO app. This included updating our policy, accessing ID cards, getting quotes, reporting and tracking claims, and accessing the GEICO virtual assistant, which answered our questions 24/7.
  * **On the road:** While we were out and about, we found gas stations nearby and even reserved parking spots in garages (and paid in advance). If we had a problem with our car, we could’ve requested roadside assistance and ordered Lyfts to our locations through the app directly.
  * **Caring for our car:** By partnering with CARFAX, GEICO lets us know about events like vehicle recalls, upcoming scheduled maintenance, and registration renewals. With the app’s Easy Photo Estimate tool, we could receive repair estimates by uploading photos of vehicle damage directly from our phone. From there, an adjuster can access the photos, allowing us to receive payment as quickly as possible.
  * **GEICO Express:** GEICO Express is a tool for accessing certain information quickly, either by phone or computer. By providing some basic personal information, we could use this tool to update our policy, access ID cards, and make payments — all without having to log in to our account.


When I was a GEICO customer, I mainly managed my policy on the company’s website. In particular, I appreciated how easy it was to get copies of important documents. For example, my car was once towed (hazards of living in a city!), and from my phone, I was able to fax proof of insurance to the towing office in order to release my car.
GEICO’s mobile app has high ratings from both iPhone and Android users. Most negative reviews are about the DriveEasy discount program, with users mentioning that it is overly sensitive and doesn’t accurately track driving behavior. I did not use DriveEasy when I was a GEICO customer, but these reviews do give me pause.
App | Rating (out of 5)

GEICO Mobile | iPhone — 4.8 starsAndroid — 4.6 stars  
## Availability
GEICO is available in all 50 states and [Washington, D.C.](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/washington-dc/best-car-insurance/) However, since GEICO’s operations are mostly online, some states have very few or no agencies. Our team used GEICO’s “Find an Agent” locator tool to identify states where agents are sparse:

Given the amount of customers it serves, GEICO has relatively few agents — only 279 total in the U.S., an average of about 5.5 per state. GEICO can get away with having so few agents because it relies heavily on online sales. However, if a local agent is important to you, GEICO may not be a good option, particularly in states like Wisconsin and Utah. Outside of Madison and Salt Lake City in these states, there are no local agents.
On the other hand, if you live in Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Tennessee, or [New York](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/), expect a better agent-to-customer ratio. In general, GEICO may be better for those on the East Coast than any other U.S. region in terms of its local agent population.
## Bottom Line: Did I Switch and Save?
GEICO’s pricing was attractive to me, and I liked how easy it was to shop online. I also had positive experiences with GEICO when I was a customer previously.
In the end, I decided to stick with State Farm. The pricing was similar, and I value the service I get from my agent.
However, if you’re looking for an affordable policy you can purchase quickly and easily, GEICO is an excellent option.
## Company History 
Husband and wife Leo and Lilliam Goodwin founded the Government Employee Insurance Company (later renamed GEICO) in 1936 as an insurance provider for government officials and military personnel. Warren Buffett has been an investor in the company since 1951, and in 1995, his investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, acquired GEICO. Since then, the company has greatly expanded in size, having written more than 17 million policies as of 2019. Today, we know GEICO best for its memorable advertisements and catchy slogans.
## Methodology: How We Review Insurance Companies
Our goal is to offer consumers precise and impartial information. Our methodology includes the following steps for evaluating companies:
  * **Cost (40 percent):** We analyze average premiums for full and minimum coverage across multiple driver profiles, including those with strong credit and clean records, as well as individuals with DUIs, at-fault accidents, or poor credit. We also factor in available discounts. Our full coverage calculations are based on these standard policy limits: 
    * Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
    * Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
    * Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
    * Comprehensive and collision coverage: $500 deductible
  * **Claims Service (25 percent):** We examine how efficiently insurers manage claims, focusing on their speed, communication transparency, and fairness in assessing damage. Our analysis uses independent sources such as the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Survey. We also review financial strength ratings from agencies like AM Best and S&P to ensure insurers have the ability to meet claims obligations. Where applicable, firsthand experience and real customer feedback adds further insights.
  * **Customer Satisfaction (25 percent):** We evaluate the quality of the customer experience, from obtaining a quote to policy management. This includes ease of making policy changes, accessing documents, and interacting with representatives. Our assessment draws on data from sources like J.D. Power, the NAIC complaint index, Better Business Bureau ratings, and app store reviews. We also interview customers and include our own experiences, aiming to provide readers with firsthand insights.
  * **Coverage Options (10 percent):** We assess each company’s range of coverage options, with an emphasis on additional protections beyond the state-required minimums. We give extra weight to insurers that offer add-ons such as rideshare coverage, rental reimbursement, rideshare insurance, and more.

## GEICO: Frequently Asked Questions
Which company is cheaper, Progressive or GEICO?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO tends to be cheaper than Progressive. The average annual cost of a full coverage policy is $1,572 with GEICO and $1,891 with Progressive. However, the exact cost of a policy differs depending on factors like vehicle, driving history, and location. Depending on your circumstances, Progressive could be cheaper than GEICO. The best way to find out is to request a quote from both companies.
Will GEICO insurance a car that’s not in my name?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes. GEICO will insure a car that’s not in your name if you can prove you have a financial stake in the car. For example, if you live with your spouse and the vehicle is under their name, GEICO will insure it. You can also buy a non-owner car insurance policy with GEICO. Your homeowners, renters, or umbrella insurance may also cover your non-owned car, depending on your policy.
Is GEICO good at paying claims? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
GEICO is good at paying claims. The company has a large amount of money in its reserves,[8](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/#citation-8) which it uses to pay out each individual insurance claim. GEICO holds over $17 billion in its claims reserves and has an A++ rating from AM Best, which ranks companies regarding financial stability.
Does GEICO raise rates after six months? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
**RELATED:** Whether GEICO raises your rates after six months depends on a number of factors. If you get into an accident within the first six months of your policy, then your rates will increase (unless you have accident forgiveness on your policy). Other incidents, like a ticket, will also raise your premium. Your premium could also rise based on circumstances out of your control, like economic factors. If your rates go up significantly, it does not hurt to get quotes from other providers before your renewal.
