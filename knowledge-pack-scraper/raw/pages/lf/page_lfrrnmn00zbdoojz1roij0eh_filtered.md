### GEICO vs. Liberty Mutual: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving résumé, GEICO could be a better choice than Liberty Mutual. Each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.

RATES BY CITATION: LIBERTY MUTUAL VS. GEICO

| Violation | GEICO avg. annual premium | Liberty Mutual avg. annual premium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,580 | $2,112 |

| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $2,068 |

### GEICO vs. Liberty Mutual: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Liberty Mutual: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $3,051, compared to Liberty Mutual.

RATES BY AGE: LIBERTY MUTUAL VS. GEICO

| Age tier | GEICO avg. annual premium | Liberty Mutual avg. annual premium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Teens | $3,508 | $6,559 |
| 20s | $1,438 | $2,686 |
| 30s | $1,218 | $2,686 |
| 40s | $1,189 | $1,926 |
| 50s | $1,160 | $1,793 |

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Tie

---

Both GEICO and Liberty Mutual can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Liberty Mutual — especially since Liberty Mutual actually underwrites some GEICO policies. For that reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.

---

### GEICO vs. Liberty Mutual: home insurance rate comparison

Liberty Mutual's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,414. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
