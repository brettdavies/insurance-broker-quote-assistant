New York requires [Personal Injury](https://lawyer1.com/) Protection, or “no-fault,” insurance. Trying to apply this insurance without a lawyer’s help can be complicated and confusing.
##![New York Personal Injury Protection Insurance](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20980%20484'%3E%3C/svg%3E) What is PIP Coverage & When Does It Apply?
PIP insurance covers a certain amount of the costs associated with car crash injuries, like medical expenses, lost wages, and death benefits. There are limits to PIP coverage, and a [NY car accident lawyer](https://lawyer1.com/car-accident-lawyer/) can help you get maximum compensation.No-fault insurance helps New York drivers recover money for medical costs, lost wages, and benefits if you or a [loved one suffered fatal injuries](https://lawyer1.com/car-accident-lawyer/fatal-car-accident-lawyer/).
To do so, your injuries must meet a “serious injury threshold.” Serious injuries could be significant disfigurement, [bone fractures](https://lawyer1.com/broken-bone-injury-lawyer/), permanent limitation of a body organ or member, a significant limitation of a bodily function or system, or total disability for 90 days within the first 180 days after the accident.
