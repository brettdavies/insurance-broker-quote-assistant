## Why Insurance Companies Are NOT Looking Out for Your Best Interests
Posted on [August 6, 2025](https://iaccidentlawyer.com/accident-news/insurance-companies-interests/ "Why Insurance Companies Are NOT Looking Out for Your Best Interests") | Written By: [Corey Higgins](https://iaccidentlawyer.com/author/corey-higgins/)

## Profits Before People Is The Priority For Insurance Companies
When it comes to filing a claim after a car accident, many people assume that insurance companies are on their side. However, the truth is that insurance companies are primarily profit-driven businesses, and their main goal is to minimize payouts. While they may appear helpful at first, insurers often use tactics designed to reduce the value of your claim or deny it altogether. This is why understanding that insurance companies are not looking out for your best interests is crucial when navigating a personal injury claim.
### The Bottom Line Takes Precedence Over Your Financial Recovery
Insurance adjusters are trained to protect the company’s bottom line, not your financial recovery. They may pressure you into giving a recorded statement, offer a quick lowball settlement, or delay the claims process in hopes that you’ll accept less than you deserve. These strategies are designed to limit how much they pay out, even if you’re entitled to more. Knowing this, it’s important not to trust that the insurance company is on your side after an accident or injury.
### An Experienced Accident Attorney Can Navigate All The Obstacles The Insurance Companies Will Throw Your Way
If you’ve been injured in an auto accident, bicycle collision, or slip-and-fall incident, hiring a personal injury attorney can help level the playing field. An experienced lawyer will negotiate with the insurance company, collect necessary evidence, and fight to ensure you receive full compensation. Don’t fall for the myth that insurance companies are there to help—you need to protect yourself by knowing your rights and seeking professional guidance. Always remember: insurance companies are not looking out for your best interests, but a skilled attorney will.

## Why Insurance Companies Aren’t on Your Side
#### **1. They’re For-Profit Corporations**
Insurance companies exist to make money. Their primary obligation is to their shareholders—not to you. That means minimizing payouts whenever possible.
#### **2. They Use Lowball Settlement Tactics**
Initial offers are often **far below what your claim is worth**. This is a strategic move to save money. Even if they eventually increase the offer, they still come out ahead.
#### **3. They Exploit Vulnerability**
After an accident, you may be injured, stressed, or confused. Insurers know this and may pressure you to settle quickly—before you understand the full extent of your injuries or legal rights.
#### **4. They May Deny Valid Claims**
Some companies use a “deny first” strategy, rejecting claims even when they know they’re legitimate. This forces victims to fight harder or give up, saving the insurer money.
#### **5. They Use Your Words Against You**
Adjusters often contact victims early to get recorded statements. These can be twisted or taken out of context to reduce or deny your claim.

### What You Can Do to Protect Yourself
  * **Don’t give recorded statements** without legal advice
  * **Document everything** : photos, medical records, police reports
  * **Understand your policy** : coverage limits, exclusions, deductibles


**Consult a personal injury attorney** early—especially if injuries are serious or fault is disputed.
