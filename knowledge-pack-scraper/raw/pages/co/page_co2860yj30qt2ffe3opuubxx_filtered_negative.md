State Farm General, the state’s biggest home insurer, has become a punching bag after the fires due to its announcement last year that it would not renew some [ 72,000 residential and commmercial policies](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-23/state-farm-wont-renew-72-000-insurance-policies-in-california-worsening-the-states-insurance-crisis) statewide.

Mercury Insurance, one of the state’s largest home insurers, announced a week after the fires started that its initial analysis showed its losses would[ probably exceed the $150 million](https://newsroom.mercuryinsurance.com/2025-01-10-Mercury-General-Corporation-Provides-Preliminary-Information-Regarding-Recent-Wildfires-in-Southern-California) it must pay before its reinsurance kicks in and covers higher losses. It also said its reinsurance would cover any FAIR Plan assessment.
Just two days after the Palisades fire began, legislators [introduced a bill ](https://speaker.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250109-california-assembly-members-introduce-insurance-legislation-protect)that would allow the FAIR Plan to float bonds if the insurer faces “liquidity challenges.” The FAIR Plan said it supports the bill.
