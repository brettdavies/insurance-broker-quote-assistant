## Auto Insurance Company Consumer Satisfaction Ratings

Consumer satisfaction rankings are one of the most valued methods to evaluate auto insurance company quotes and whether or not an auto insurance company is highly preferred.

> Consumer satisfaction encompasses customer happiness with customer service, claims processing, premium rates, and overall perceptions of an insurance company.

Consumer Reports frequently evaluates auto insurance company options and publishes Consumer Report car insurance findings on its website and in its subscription magazine.

The auto insurance consumer reviews from Consumer Reports are based on in-depth evaluations of car insurance company performance, including accessibility to customer service, ease of filing claims, claims processing, products and services offered, and benefits provided to policyholders. It also evaluates complaints against the companies.

Read more: [How to File a Complaint Against Your Auto Insurance Company](https://www.autoinsurance.org/top-auto-insurance-companies-according-to-consumer-reports)

JD Powers and Associates also conducts an annual review of auto insurance companies and publishes its report on its website. JD Powers evaluates consumer satisfaction with auto insurance companies’ customer service, claims processing, and ease of access. Additionally, the auto insurance companies ranked are based on overall perceptions of car insurance companies and premium rates.

## Auto Insurance Company Financial Health

Financial health and stability are also extremely important qualities to evaluate when looking for highly preferred auto insurance companies. Financial health ratings are based on strong financial reserves, excellent financial business practices and, good credit ratings. Additionally, ratings take into consideration how long an insurance company has been in business.

Learn more: [How to Research Auto Insurance Companies](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-to-research-auto-insurance-companies-before-buying/)

Companies with strong financial rankings are able to tolerate large numbers of claims that occur during disasters. For example, during the spring of 2011, numerous tornadoes hit the southeastern United States, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.

> Companies with low financial health ranking were unable to pay claims and many have folded as a result.

AM Best, Fitch and Standard and Poor’s are independent financial evaluation organizations that monitor the financial health of insurance companies. They publish their findings on their websites. Rankings are based on letter grades and the highest grade issued is “A++,” which indicates superior financial stability.

Grades in the “A” range indicate excellent financial stability. Grades in the “B” range indicate good financial standing. Grades of “C” and below indicate an insurance company is financially unhealthy.

## Auto Insurance Company Consumer Complaints

When you are looking for a preferred auto insurance company, you want to avoid companies that have high numbers of consumer complaints.
