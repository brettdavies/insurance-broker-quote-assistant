## Understanding Renters Insurance

Renters insurance is a type of insurance policy designed to protect individuals who lease or rent a home.

By securing renters insurance, tenants can safeguard their belongings against risks such as theft, fire, or vandalism.

Liability coverage provides financial assistance in the event that someone is injured while visiting the rented property. This coverage may also extend to legal defense costs, should a lawsuit arise.
