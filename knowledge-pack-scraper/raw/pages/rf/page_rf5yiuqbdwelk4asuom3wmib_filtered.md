## What is a Brokerage Fee?

A brokerage fee is the cost a broker charges for their services, time and effort to find the best available policies for you within your budget. However, brokers are not only there to help you find your future policy, they are very useful because they have other valuable services to offer, are fully prepared to answer any questions or concerns and help solve any problems you may have.

## Why Should I Pay It?

Brokers play an important role. In most states, a broker must be licensed, so they are highly knowledgeable and may specialize in one or many different specific types of insurance. And since all types of insurance are in high demand, good brokers are also in high demand. Because of this, a brokerage fee can be warranted.

Brokers are efficient and will also offer other information that you will find useful in making your decision, saving you a lot of time and stress.
