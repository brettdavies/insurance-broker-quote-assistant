Why we picked this company

The fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer by market share, Allstate is available in all 50 states. The company has been in business for more than 90 years and also sells home, renters, and condo policies — so it’s a good option for those who want to save by bundling auto with another type of policy. Allstate also offers helpful optional auto coverages, like gap insurance and accident forgiveness. AM Best gives the company a high rating for financial strength, but Allstate has a higher-than-average number of complaints in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Consumer Complaint Index.

Pros 

* Ample opportunities for bundling discount
* Offers a pay-per-mile option
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* Low customer satisfaction
* Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
* Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study

## Progressive Snapshot vs. Allstate Drivewise

Both Progressive and Allstate offer a safe driver discount program based on driving habits. These programs use [**telematics tools**](/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/), such as a mobile app or vehicle plug-in device, to analyze driver habits and behavior, detect crashes, monitor phone usage while behind the wheel, and more.

The Allstate Drivewise program is smartphone-based, allowing insured drivers to track their trips and unlock significant discounts on their auto insurance premiums. It takes into account driving activity such as sudden stops, aggressive maneuvers, high speeds, driving during certain times of day, and more.

The Drivewise app also collects data on whether or not you use your phone while behind the wheel, though Allstate claims that it doesn’t use this factor to calculate performance-based policy rewards.[[2]](#cite-2)

With Progressive’s Snapshot, drivers have the option of using the insurer’s mobile app or requesting a plug-in device for their vehicle. Both devices collect data on many of the same factors to determine available discounts and policy pricing: sudden braking, aggressive driving, high speeds, driving late at night, and phone usage while behind the wheel.

Unlike Allstate’s program, Snapshot is also mileage-based. Drivers who spend less time behind the wheel can save even more with this [**usage-based insurance program**](/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/usage-based-insurance/).[[3]](#cite-3)

## Progressive vs. Allstate: Which is the cheapest?

Auto insurance through Allstate is slightly cheaper on average than coverage through Progressive. But your premiums depend on a variety of factors, including:[[4]](#cite-4)

* Driver [**age and gender**](/car-insurance/driver/age/)
* Location and ZIP code
* Coverage options
* Vehicle(s) covered
* Annual mileage
* [**Driving record**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/)
* Credit history

Teen drivers have less experience and tend to pay more on average for auto insurance coverage. However, [**senior drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) can also be at higher risk due to age-related health issues and may have higher rates when they reach their 70s.

Allstate offers slightly lower average premiums to senior drivers compared to Progressive.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

The best company for you depends on your specific needs and policy requirements.

If you’re looking for the [**cheapest auto insurance coverage**](/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/), for example, Allstate has slightly lower car insurance rates than Progressive, on average. But if you’re looking for a more versatile driver telematics program for added discounts, Progressive might be the better option to consider.

Progressive is more expensive than Allstate, on average, for most driver profiles. If you’re shopping to see how much money you can save and which insurer offers the best deal, Allstate might be the best car insurance company for you.

Though not the same, Progressive and Allstate are similar insurance companies offering various insurance coverages to drivers across the U.S. Both insurers have a variety of discounts to save money on car insurance costs and safe-driver telematics programs for added savings.

Progressive and Allstate both offer the same standard coverages, including liability, comprehensive, collision, uninsured/underinsured motorist, and PIP coverage. One of the main differences is that Progressive offers pet injury coverage for drivers, but Allstate doesn’t.
