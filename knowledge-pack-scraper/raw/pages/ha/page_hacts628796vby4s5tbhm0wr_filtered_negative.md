In a world where**38% of Americans rely on social media for news,** misleading advertising isn’t just unethical—it’s increasingly impactful.

_“When consumers see or hear an advertisement, whether it’s on the Internet, radio or television, or anywhere else, federal law says that ad must be truthful, not misleading, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence.”**— Federal Trade Commission**_
_“The key difference between false advertising and puffery is whether the advertising contains objective statements or expresses a mere opinion. Factual claims can be proven true or false. However, the line between opinion and fact is sometimes blurry. This is where having an experienced New York business litigation attorney can help.”**— Rosenbaum & Taylor P.C**_
_If you want to design visually engaging, high-converting ads the right way, check out our guide on_[ _Creative Ads Design - Examples and Inspirations_](https://cropink.com/creative-ad-designs) _._
_“The Red Bull defendants prey upon consumers by promising that, among other things, ‘Red Bull gives you wings’ by providing a mixture of ingredients that... significantly improve a consumer’s physiological and mental performance beyond what a simple cup of coffee... would do.”_ _**BeverageDaily, 2014**_
This wasn’t considered **puffery** —a legal term for exaggerated but clearly non-literal marketing. Plaintiffs claimed it crossed the line into **deception**, a claim with legal weight under consumer protection laws.
_“All future claims about the functional benefits of its products will be medically and/or scientifically supported.”_ _**BeverageDaily, 2014**_
Skechers heavily marketed its Shape-ups as shoes that could help wearers **lose weight, tone muscles, and improve overall fitness** —just by walking in them.
_“Shape up while you walk,”_ and _“Get in shape without setting foot in a gym.”_
_“Skechers’ unfounded claims went beyond stronger and more toned muscles. The company even made claims about weight loss and cardiovascular health.”_
_“One of the biggest supplement frauds in the country.”_
_“The plaintiffs’ claims are false. The flame-grilled beef patties in our advertising are the same we serve nationwide.”_
The case reflects a wider **trend in food litigation**, with **over 100 food-related lawsuits filed in 2023** —a sharp rise compared to just **19 in 2008**, according to Perkins Coie law firm data.
_“This is where advertising falls between a clear factual claim and pure puffery, making it one of the most interesting legal areas.”_
Volkswagen marketed its diesel cars—especially models like the **Jetta, Passat, Golf, Beetle, and Audi A3** —as **"clean diesel" vehicles** with **low emissions and environmentally friendly performance**.
_“We’ve totally screwed up.”_
_“We have broken the trust of our customers and the public.”_
_"This was a disingenuous advertising campaign that promised something that hasn’t been proven.”_
_“Deceptive advertising has enabled Dannon to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ordinary yogurt at inflated prices.”_
_“Lumosity preyed on consumers’ fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer’s disease.”_
