As far as I can see the website is just to request a copy of your report. No way to email or talk to them that I can find if you have questions outside of wanting a copy of the report. I will give this information to my clients though and tell them to fill it out.  
  
I wish there was a way to find a list of all diagnosis codes that cause people to fail medical underwriting. Then doing a search on the medicare and Milliman reports for each code would find the information faster for what needs fixed (well presuming it is inaccurate that is). I realize each company has their own form and the rumor I have heard is that UHC's is one that is more lenient that others (is that true?) so there likely isn't a universal list anywhere. Does anyone know of a website that compares the different underwriting requirements for the different companies' supplements?

The Medicare download data includes prescription claims, but they are only defined by an 11-digit Drug Code—no mention of the name of the drug.  
  
You can check the accuracy of the prescription by looking it up at [[EXTERNAL LINK] - National Drug Code Directory](https://dps.fda.gov/ndc) (in the Select Type dropdown, choose NDC Code).  
  
For your search term, the Drug Code from the download needs to modified. Replace the 6th digit 0 with a - and, for more precision, add a - between the 9th and 10th digits.  
  
Here's an example using Shingrix to search at FDA:  
58160082311 is the drug code in the download  
58160-823 is the actual NDC Code that you can use for your search  
58160-823-11 is the NDC Code plus packaging info for the prescribed medication  
  
(Alas, not all drugs use the xxxxx-xxx-xx format. For some drugs, you may need to use the format xxxx-xxxx-xx or xxxxx-xxxx-x to return results.)

Millman is a data warehouse and actuarial firm that primarily sells their information to carriers. DTC information is more of an accomodation and is not a profit center,  
  
Much of the information you seek is only by subscription and marketed to providers, TPA's & insurance carriers.

Well that explains that then. Thanks.
