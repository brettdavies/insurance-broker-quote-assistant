Contact the state you’re licensed in. Usually there is an online department of insurance that list people who are licensed in that state.

Thank you! I also looked there and same. Says I don’t exist so perhaps still under review. I’ll wait a couple of weeks and be more patient.

You can go to the NAIC website and find the NPN for GEICO

You are probably not fully licensed yet. When you are licensed, you will be able to access your license number and usually sent an email from the state. An NPN is created when get your first license in any state. Since nothing popped up, youre probably not licensed yet and your application is still under review by the state.

Nipr.com also is a good site. Both sircon and npr allow you to manage your licenses. Don't trust G at all to do it. Easy to do once you're in the system. What state?

Also when I go onto the Sircon thing and try to look myself up for my NPN number. It says there’s no licensee’s despite me going to get fingerprinted and completing the full CE course. As if my account doesn’t exist.

You do not need to create an account. If you know your last name and social security number you can get your license number there.

You can look up your NIPR here to register for sircon. <https://nipr.com/help/look-up-your-npn>
You can also find your insurance license on your state insurance commissioner website

Tips for succeeding at Geico careers
Looking to **succeed at GEICO**? Redditors offer insights on **training**, **job roles**, **company culture**, and **interview tips**.
### General Advice
* **Be Prepared for High Pressure**: GEICO is known for its fast-paced, high-pressure environment. ["I know a few people that currently work there, and it seems a high pressure, fast paced work environment, which is no different than my current job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/considering_job_at_geico/)
* **Network and Ask Questions**: Utilize your resources and ask questions, especially if you are new to the industry. ["Ask questions, and use your resources. We were all new once and all felt like you do."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1lv27vl/comment/n23ck3g/)
### Specific Job Roles
####  Auto Damage (AD) Adjuster
* **Training and Licensing**: GEICO provides comprehensive training and helps you get licensed, which can be a significant plus. ["GEICO pays you to get licensed in whichever state you're in if it's a field position, so if AD on either the insurance, independent, or body shop side is a career you want to pursue regardless of GEICO that is useful."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1hq8xnj/comment/m4ok484/)
* **High Stress and Workload**: Be prepared for a high-stress job with a heavy workload. ["20 pending claims is a manageable workload once you know what you're doing. Having that many on a newbie fresh out of training was a failure on your supervisor's part, though."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1kgokzh/comment/mr22znv/)
* **Customer Interaction**: You will deal with customers at their worst, which requires thick skin and good negotiation skills. ["You’re dealing with people at their worst of times, and for many customers their $10k car might be their biggest investment that they own."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1n7dy60/comment/nc7a47o/)
####  Claims Adjuster (ICS)
* **Training and Metrics**: The training is intense, and you will be graded on various metrics. ["I heard that once we have finished the licensing portion that we would go on to be trained for the calls and they would test and grade based on their criteria."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1m9t8l9/newly_hired_ics/)
* **Customer Service**: You will be on the phone with customers frequently, which can be challenging. ["You will be tasked with being on the phone with customers (if that's what kind of position you are going for) unable to give them answers because you need to wait 10 minutes just to have a supervisor override the system for you to be able to make a sale at times."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7m49q/)
* **Adaptability**: The metrics and focus areas can change frequently, so you need to be adaptable. ["The metrics and what the 'focus' is are constantly changing, which can be frustrating."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1m9t8l9/comment/n5efcyc/)
####  Sales Agent
* **Hybrid Work**: Sales agents often have a hybrid work schedule, with some days in the office and some remote. ["GEICO sales agents though, as I've worked for the G, were hybrid positions. 3 days in office with one WFH day that your supervisor would assign your team."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7m49q/)
* **High Expectations**: You will be held to high sales targets and metrics. ["You will be held to unrealistic standards that sound obtainable but in reality, are ridiculous."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7m49q/)
* **Customer Interaction**: Be prepared to handle difficult customer interactions and manipulate sales. ["You could make a sale in the most unethical of ways, and GEICO would praise you."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7m49q/)
### Company Culture
* **Turnover**: GEICO has a high turnover rate, especially in claims and sales roles. ["Turnover is zero? According to who? Everyone in corporate and customer 'facing' jobs has been laid off or terminated, tech included."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7wv7g/)
* **Management**: Many employees report issues with management, including micromanagement and lack of support. ["My field supervisor seemed annoyed when I asked questions, and was very slow to respond."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1kgokzh/gave_my_notice_ad/)
* **Benefits**: While GEICO offers some benefits like insurance discounts, they may not be as good as expected. ["Yes, you get a slight discount, but it really isn't much. It saved me about $50 off my 6 month policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1irc5zr/comment/md7m49q/)
### Interview Tips
* **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Be prepared for role-playing scenarios and take ownership of the situation. ["For any sort of role playing, take ownership of the situation/issue. Make sure to express empathy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1b8fri2/comment/ktoyuts/)
* **Be Confident and Flexible**: Show confidence, be willing to negotiate, and be flexible. ["Be friendly. Be confident. Be willing to negotiate."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1b8fri2/comment/ktoz0tb/)
* **Understand the Job**: Research the specific role and be prepared to discuss your skills and experience. ["I’ve been poking around a bit and see that most of you hate Geico and hate the role."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geico/comments/1n7dy60/adjuster_trainee/)
