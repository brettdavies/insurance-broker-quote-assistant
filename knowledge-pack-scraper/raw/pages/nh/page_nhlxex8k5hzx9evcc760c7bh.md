## What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover in Texas?
[![what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-01](https://www.planforfreedom.com/wp-client_data/21908/4977/uploads/2024/01/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-01-1024x538.jpg)](https://www.planforfreedom.com/wp-client_data/21908/4977/uploads/2024/01/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-01.jpg)Your homeowners insurance policy is actually a collection of many different coverages. This allows you to not only protect your home but other property you own and even yourself from liability. In other words, Texans are provided a wider breadth of protection at an affordable rate. Here’s how a standard home insurance policy (HO-3) breaks down its protections:
### Coverage A - Dwelling
The balk of your coverage comes from your policy’s [dwelling coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/texas-dwelling-coverage/). Here, you’ll find protection against open perils that may affect your home’s physical structure and attached structures. Some examples include the following:
  * Hail damage that damages your roof.
  * A kitchen fire that destroys your appliances, counters, cabinets, walls, etc.
  * Wind damage that causes significant damage to your siding and attached garage.


### Coverage B - Other Structures
Home insurance will also protect the [other structures](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/tx-other-structures-coverage/) on your property including fences, detached garages, sheds, and mailboxes. Just as your home is protected, your policy covering additional structures can help you restore expensive losses through affordable protection. A typical policy will cover a loss of up to 10% of your home’s value.
### Coverage C - Personal Property
Your personal possessions including electronics, clothing, furniture, etc. are also protected against named perils. [Personal property coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/personal-property-coverage/) comes with policy limits, so for more expensive valuables, you may need to purchase additional coverage options. However, most homeowners insurance policies range between 25%-50% of your home’s dwelling coverage limit.
### Coverage D - Loss of Use
In the event you were to suffer a loss in which your home is unlivable in the aftermath, your home insurance policy is there for you with [loss of use coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/loss-of-use-coverage/). It’ll cover living expenses such as hotel rooms and dining until you are capable of getting back on your feet. Most HO-3 policies will cover 20% of your home’s insured value for loss of use claims.
### Coverage E - Personal Liability
If someone is visiting your property and becomes injured, as a homeowner, unfortunately, you can be held liable. Your homeowners insurance policy provides specific protection to help mitigate medical and legal expenses related to such incidents. Your policy’s [personal liability](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/personal-liability-coverage/) limits depend on a variety of factors but homeowners are encouraged to maintain a minimum of at least $100,000 in coverage.
### Coverage F - Medical Expenses
Visitors who are injured while visiting your property can find homeowners liable for damages. Should someone become injured, your homeowners insurance policy will help pay for medical expenses with [Coverage F](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/coverage-f/) to avoid having to pay for these expenses on your own. It is important to note that this coverage does not include members of your household. For medical expenses involving members who reside in your home, you’ll need the proper health insurance policies or pay the expenses on your own. Medical expenses covered by your home insurance are typically limited to around $2,000-$5,000 worth of coverage.
### Additional Home Insurance Coverages in Texas
In addition to the standard coverages your policy provides, there are endorsements, or riders, that protect you from additional perils. For example, if you have expensive collectibles that exceed your homeowners policy’s coverage limits, scheduled personal property coverage is available for extra protection.
There are several additional examples. Some riders may protect against sump pumps and sewage backup, while other endorsements can protect against things such as a damaged utility line. Your coverage needs are unique and enrolling in personalized coverage will help you avoid expensive losses
## Why Is Home Insurance So Expensive in Texas?
There are several reasons the cost of homeowners insurance continues to rise for Texans. Not only do individual factors come into play but also regional and statewide trends. These are some common examples of perils your home may face:
  * Severe thunderstorms/windstorms
  * Hail damage
  * Wildfires
  * Tropical storms/hurricanes
  * Flooding
  * Theft
  * Water damage and freezing


It doesn’t matter where you look, there is severe weather found throughout the Lone Star State. Costly labor and materials that keep going higher mean expensive claims require higher premiums as businesses maintain revenue and profits.
But it’s also important to note that the risks you pose as a client are also looked at by each carrier differently. This means that if you are looked at ask a high risk by by some companies, you may not be by others. Always shop around to determine the lowest cost for home insurance.
## Do You Have To Have Homeowners Insurance in Texas?
