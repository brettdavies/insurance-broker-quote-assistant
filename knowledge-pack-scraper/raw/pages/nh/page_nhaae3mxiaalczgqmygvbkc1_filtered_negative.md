_**TIP:** Increasing your liability limits will increase your premium payments. Decide whether you need an increased limit before you purchase umbrella coverage._
![Who is generally covered under an umbrella insurance policy? Infographic: Umbrella Insurance](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
**TIP:** _The average homeowner’s liability coverage limits are normally $300,000 to $500,000. It is not uncommon today for a claim to exceed your liability limits. Umbrella coverage would step in once you have exhausted your underlying limits_.

An umbrella policy has its limitations, so it’s best to read and know what is not covered. Some of the disadvantages of umbrella insurance are:
* **Intentional Damages:** If you intentionally cause damage, your umbrella policy will not cover it.
**IMPORTANT!** _Make sure your umbrella coverage is over and above your underlying limits. For example, if you purchase a $1 million dollar umbrella policy, this coverage should be $1 million above your $300,000 homeowners liability, giving you a total combined coverage of $1,300,000 in liability coverage (as opposed to your underlying limits being included in the $1,000,000 which would give you only a total of $700,000)_.

**TIP:** _This cost can also be shaved by a multi-policy discount. Most insurance companies will give you a discount for having both your home and umbrella policy with them_.
Umbrella insurance coverage provides additional protection when your standard insurance is not sufficient. These true stories demonstrate how it can assist when something unexpected occurs.
John, being a businessman, was sued by a former worker for $2 million due to workplace discrimination. His standard insurance paid out $1 million, and his umbrella liability insurance settled the remaining amount. This shielded John’s personal assets.
Sara had a party in her backyard, and a guest fell and was severely injured. The medical expenses and lawsuit exceeded her $500,000 homeowner’s liability coverage. Fortunately, her umbrella liability policy provided $1 million in additional coverage, paying the balance and saving her financially.
Tom, who was a landlord, was sued for $3 million when a tenant slipped due to a faulty staircase. His umbrella insurance coverage paid the entire claim, safeguarding both his personal and business assets.

Umbrella insurance gives you extra liability protection when your home insurance, auto insurance, or renters insurance isn’t enough. It helps cover lawsuits, medical bills, and property damage, so you don’t have to pay out of pocket if your basic insurance runs out. Most insurance companies ask you to increase your liability limits before you can get umbrella coverage. [su_box title="Ove...
