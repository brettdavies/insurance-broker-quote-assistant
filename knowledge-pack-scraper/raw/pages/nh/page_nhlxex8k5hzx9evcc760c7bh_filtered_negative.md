Homeowners insurance in Texas is [among some of the highest in the United States](https://www.planforfreedom.com/texas-has-3rd-highest-home-owners-insurance-cost-in-us/). The average home insurance cost will run you **$2,255** per year or around **$188** per month. A figure that can change dramatically depending on a host of individual and statewide factors.
One of the reasons the Lone Star State has such high home insurance rates is because there are a wide variety of perils that could damage your home From the Gulf Coast cities protecting against hurricanes to Hill Country protecting against hail and even North Texas protecting against tornadoes. There are a lot of unique perils that could damage your home.
The more likely it is for your home to suffer a loss, the higher your premiums will be. Riskier homeowners pay more on average. Therefore, to get the [best home insurance](https://www.planforfreedom.com/who-has-the-best-homeowners-insurance-in-texas/), do what you can to mitigate your risk of loss.
The balk of your coverage comes from your policy’s [dwelling coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/texas-dwelling-coverage/). Here, you’ll find protection against open perils that may affect your home’s physical structure and attached structures. Some examples include the following:
Home insurance will also protect the [other structures](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/tx-other-structures-coverage/) on your property including fences, detached garages, sheds, and mailboxes. Just as your home is protected, your policy covering additional structures can help you restore expensive losses through affordable protection. A typical policy will cover a loss of up to 10% of your home’s value.
Your personal possessions including electronics, clothing, furniture, etc. are also protected against named perils. [Personal property coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/personal-property-coverage/) comes with policy limits, so for more expensive valuables, you may need to purchase additional coverage options. However, most homeowners insurance policies range between 25%-50% of your home’s dwelling coverage limit.
In the event you were to suffer a loss in which your home is unlivable in the aftermath, your home insurance policy is there for you with [loss of use coverage](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/loss-of-use-coverage/). It’ll cover living expenses such as hotel rooms and dining until you are capable of getting back on your feet. Most HO-3 policies will cover 20% of your home’s insured value for loss of use claims.
If someone is visiting your property and becomes injured, as a homeowner, unfortunately, you can be held liable. Your homeowners insurance policy provides specific protection to help mitigate medical and legal expenses related to such incidents. Your policy’s [personal liability](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/personal-liability-coverage/) limits depend on a variety of factors but homeowners are encouraged to maintain a minimum of at least $100,000 in coverage.
Visitors who are injured while visiting your property can find homeowners liable for damages. Should someone become injured, your homeowners insurance policy will help pay for medical expenses with [Coverage F](https://www.planforfreedom.com/homeowners-insurance-texas/coverage-f/) to avoid having to pay for these expenses on your own. It is important to note that this coverage does not include members of your household. For medical expenses involving members who reside in your home, you’ll need the proper health insurance policies or pay the expenses on your own. Medical expenses covered by your home insurance are typically limited to around $2,000-$5,000 worth of coverage.
