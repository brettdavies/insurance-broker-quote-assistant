# What Is PIP Insurance in Florida?
[Peter Catania](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/about-us/attorneys/peter-f-catania/) | April 11, 2025 | [Car Accidents](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/blog/category/car-accidents/)
![what is pip insurance in florida](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/car-accident.jpg)
After a car accident in Tampa, many people ask the same urgent question: What is PIP insurance in Florida—and how does it affect me right now? Knowing your rights under Florida’s no-fault insurance laws is the first step in protecting your health, your finances, and your future after a crash. At [Catania and Catania](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/), we’ve spent over three decades helping injured victims navigate Florida’s insurance laws and secure the compensation they deserve.
Whether you’re dealing with medical bills, lost wages, property damage, or pain and suffering, our team is here to provide guidance, support, and the legal expertise you need during this challenging time. Let us help you fight for the justice you deserve.
## What Is PIP Insurance?
[Personal Injury Protection (PIP)](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/blog/do-i-need-pip-coverage-if-i-have-health-insurance/) is Florida’s no-fault auto insurance. It helps you get medical care immediately after an accident, regardless of who was at fault. This is especially important after a [serious car accident in Tampa](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/tampa-car-accident-lawyer/), where delays in treatment or compensation can make recovery even harder. In Florida, all registered vehicle owners must carry this coverage. The purpose of PIP is to ensure that individuals injured in an accident can receive immediate medical treatment without waiting for a liability claim to be resolved.
Under Florida law, drivers are required to carry a minimum of $10,000 in PIP coverage. This policy is designed to provide swift financial relief for medical care and lost wages resulting from a collision, including single-vehicle crashes, rear-end accidents, or even being hit while walking or cycling. PIP also covers expenses like rehabilitation costs and funeral services, offering vital support during challenging times.
## What Does PIP Cover?
Florida’s PIP insurance provides coverage for specific types of losses after a [motor vehicle accident](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/sarasota/car-accident-lawyer/), as outlined under [Florida Statutes Section 627.736](https://m.flsenate.gov/statutes/627.736). This coverage includes:
* **Medical expenses:** This covers 80% of all necessary and reasonable medical costs, such as hospital bills, surgery, rehabilitation, diagnostic services, and ambulatory care.
* **Lost income:** Reimburses 60% of lost wages if the injuries prevent you from working.
* **Replacement services:** Includes expenses for help with tasks like housekeeping or childcare if you’re unable to perform them due to injuries.
* **Death benefits:** Provides up to $5,000 per individual.
It’s important to act quickly—Florida PIP coverage tops out at $10,000, and you must seek treatment within 14 days of the accident. If the injuries are not deemed an “emergency medical condition,” benefits may be capped at $2,500. PIP insurance is mandatory for all Florida drivers, ensuring basic coverage regardless of who is at fault. Be sure to act quickly after an accident to maximize your benefits and avoid coverage limitations.
## What Other Insurance Is Required?
In addition to PIP, Florida law mandates that drivers carry Property Damage Liability (PDL) insurance. This coverage pays for damage caused to another person’s property in an accident, such as repairs to another vehicle or personal belongings inside it.
Here’s what every Tampa driver needs to know about Florida’s minimum auto insurance requirements:
* $10,000 in PIP coverage**to help cover medical expenses after an accident.**
* $10,000 in Property Damage Liability (PDL)**to cover costs if you damage someone else’s property.**
Unlike many other states, Florida does not require Bodily Injury Liability (BIL) insurance for most drivers, though it is highly recommended. Without BIL, you may be personally responsible for medical expenses if you cause an accident that injures someone else.
Additionally, drivers may choose to purchase:
* **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UM/UIM):** Protects you if the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough insurance to cover damages or medical expenses.
* **Comprehensive and Collision Coverage:** Covers vehicle damage from accidents, theft, vandalism, or natural disasters, ensuring your car repairs are taken care of.
* **Bodily Injury Liability (BIL):** Covers medical bills, lost wages, and legal fees if you’re responsible for injuring someone in an accident.
These optional policies offer greater financial protection and peace of mind—especially after a serious crash. They can cover medical expenses, vehicle repairs, or damages caused by uninsured drivers, ensuring you’re prepared for unexpected situations on the road.
## Is Florida a No-Fault State?
Yes, Florida is a no-fault state for car insurance. This means your PIP insurance covers your initial medical costs and lost wages, no matter who caused the accident. The [Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=304F6C326F53476F8457812C84057A72) outlines the key requirements under the state’s no-fault law. Registering a vehicle in Florida requires Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL) insurance. PIP covers 80% of medical expenses up to $10,000, while PDL covers damages to another person’s property caused by you or someone driving your vehicle.
Florida’s no-fault law was designed to simplify the process, reduce legal delays, and make it easier to get care after a crash. It also allows for quicker settlements and fewer legal disputes for minor accidents; however, serious or permanent injury claims can still be filed against the at-fault driver in Florida.
## Can You Still File a Personal Injury Lawsuit Even if the Liable Party Has PIP Insurance?
Yes, you can file a [personal injury lawsuit in Florida](https://www.cataniaandcatania.com/personal-injury-resources/claim-vs-lawsuit-whats-the-difference/) even if the other driver has PIP coverage—but only under certain conditions.
Florida law allows accident victims to pursue legal action against the at-fault party if their injuries meet specific criteria. These include:
* Significant and permanent loss of an important bodily function
* Permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability
* Significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement
* The death of a loved one
If your injuries qualify, you may be able to pursue additional compensation—far beyond what PIP insurance covers in Florida. A legal team can help prove fault, document damages, and ensure you get the maximum compensation.
