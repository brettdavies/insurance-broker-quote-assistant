Political philosophy in support of social progress and reform

For other uses, see [Progressivism (disambiguation)](/wiki/Progressivism_(disambiguation) "Progressivism (disambiguation)").

**Progressivism** is a [left-leaning](/wiki/Left-right_political_spectrum "Left-right political spectrum") [political philosophy](/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy") and [reform](/wiki/Reformism "Reformism") [movement](/wiki/Political_movement "Political movement") that seeks to advance the [human condition](/wiki/Human_condition "Human condition") through [social reform](/wiki/Social_reform "Social reform").[[1]](#cite_note-1) Adherents hold that progressivism has universal application and endeavor to spread this idea to human societies everywhere. Progressivism arose during the [Age of Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") out of the belief that [civility](/wiki/Civility "Civility") in Europe was improving due to the application of new [empirical knowledge](/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence").[[2]](#cite_note-Harold_Mah_1914._p157-2)

In modern political discourse, progressivism is often associated with [social liberalism](/wiki/Social_liberalism "Social liberalism"),[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5) a left-leaning type of liberalism, and [social democracy](/wiki/Social_democracy "Social democracy").[[6]](#cite_note-auto1-6)[[7]](#cite_note-auto2-7) Within [economic progressivism](/wiki/Economic_progressivism "Economic progressivism"), there is some ideological variety on the social liberal to social democrat continuum, as well as occasionally some variance on cultural issues; examples of this include some [Christian democrat](/wiki/Christian_democracy "Christian democracy") and conservative-leaning [communitarian](/wiki/Communitarianism "Communitarianism") movements.[[8]](#cite_note-catholicnewsagency-8)[[9]](#cite_note-auto-9) While many ideologies can fall under the banner of progressivism, both the current and historical movement are characterized by a critique of unregulated capitalism, desiring a more active [democratic](/wiki/Democracy "Democracy") government to take a role in safeguarding [human rights](/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights"), bringing about [cultural development](/wiki/Cultural_evolution "Cultural evolution"), and being a [check-and-balance](/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") on corporate [monopolies](/wiki/Monopolies "Monopolies").[[6]](#cite_note-auto1-6)[[7]](#cite_note-auto2-7)

  [John Stuart Mill](/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill"), English philosopher

[Immanuel Kant](/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") identified progress as being a movement away from [barbarism](/wiki/Barbarian "Barbarian") toward [civilization](/wiki/Civilization "Civilization").[[10]](#cite_note-10) 18th-century philosopher and political scientist [Marquis de Condorcet](/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet "Marquis de Condorcet") predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of [slavery](/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"), the rise of [literacy](/wiki/Literacy "Literacy"), the lessening of [sex inequality](/wiki/Sex_inequality "Sex inequality"), [reform of prisons](/wiki/Prison_reform "Prison reform"), which at the time were harsh, and the decline of poverty.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

[Modernity](/wiki/Modernity "Modernity") or modernisation was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [classical liberals](/wiki/Classical_liberals "Classical liberals") in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernisation of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to [free markets](/wiki/Free_market "Free market") and the [free movements](/wiki/Freedom_of_movement "Freedom of movement") of people.[[12]](#cite_note-12)

In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the [Western world](/wiki/Western_world "Western world") that progress was being stifled by vast [economic inequality](/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality") between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated *[laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire")* capitalism with out-of-control monopolistic [corporations](/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"), intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, with a need for measures to address these problems.[[13]](#cite_note-13) Progressivism has influenced various political movements. [Social liberalism](/wiki/Social_liberalism "Social liberalism") was influenced by British [liberal](/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism") philosopher [John Stuart Mill](/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill")'s conception of people being "progressive beings."[[14]](#cite_note-14) British Prime Minister [Benjamin Disraeli](/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli "Benjamin Disraeli") developed [progressive conservatism](/wiki/Progressive_conservatism "Progressive conservatism") under [one-nation](/wiki/One-nation_conservatism "One-nation conservatism") [Toryism](/wiki/Toryism "Toryism").[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)

In France, the space between [social revolution](/wiki/Social_revolution "Social revolution") and the [socially conservative](/wiki/Socially_conservative "Socially conservative") *laissez-faire* [centre-right](/wiki/Centre-right "Centre-right") was filled with the emergence of [radicalism](/wiki/Radicalism_(historical) "Radicalism (historical)") which thought that [social progress](/wiki/Social_progress "Social progress") required [anti-clericalism](/wiki/Anti-clericalism "Anti-clericalism"), [humanism](/wiki/Humanism "Humanism"), and [republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism "Republicanism"). Especially anti-clericalism was the dominant influence on the [centre-left](/wiki/Centre-left "Centre-left") in many French- and Romance-speaking countries until the mid-20th century. In [Imperial Germany](/wiki/Imperial_Germany "Imperial Germany"), Chancellor [Otto von Bismarck](/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck "Otto von Bismarck") enacted various progressive [social welfare](/wiki/Social_welfare "Social welfare") measures out of [paternalistic conservative](/wiki/Paternalistic_conservative "Paternalistic conservative") motivations to distance workers from the [socialist movement](/wiki/Socialist_movement "Socialist movement") of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the [Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution").[[17]](#cite_note-17)

In 1891, the [Roman Catholic Church](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") encyclical *[Rerum novarum](/wiki/Rerum_novarum "Rerum novarum")* issued by [Pope Leo XIII](/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII "Pope Leo XIII") condemned the [exploitation of labor](/wiki/Exploitation_of_labor "Exploitation of labor") and urged support for [labor unions](/wiki/Labor_unions "Labor unions") and [government regulation](/wiki/Government_regulation "Government regulation") of businesses in the interests of [social justice](/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") while upholding the [property right](/wiki/Property_right "Property right") and criticising socialism.[[18]](#cite_note-18) A progressive [Protestant](/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") outlook called the [Social Gospel](/wiki/Social_Gospel "Social Gospel") emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and, by the mid-1890s, was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

Early 20th-century progressivism included support for American engagement in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the creation of and participation in the [League of Nations](/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations"),[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21) [compulsory sterilisation](/wiki/Compulsory_sterilisation "Compulsory sterilisation") in Scandinavia,[[22]](#cite_note-22) and [eugenics](/wiki/Eugenics "Eugenics") in Great Britain,[[23]](#cite_note-23) and the [temperance movement](/wiki/Temperance_movement "Temperance movement").[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25) Progressives believed that [progress](/wiki/Progress "Progress") was stifled by [economic inequality](/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"), inadequately regulated [monopolistic](/wiki/Monopolistic "Monopolistic") corporations, and conflict between workers and elites, arguing that corrective measures were needed.[[26]](#cite_note-26)

  [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson"), 28th [U.S. President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")

In the United States, progressivism began as an intellectual rebellion against the political philosophy of [Constitutionalism](/wiki/Constitutionalism "Constitutionalism")[[27]](#cite_note-27) as expressed by [John Locke](/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") and the [Founding Fathers of the American Republic](/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States"), whereby the authority of government depends on observing limitations on its just powers.[[28]](#cite_note-28) What began as a [social movement](/wiki/Social_movement "Social movement") in the 1890s grew into a popular [political movement](/wiki/Political_movement "Political movement") referred to as the [Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era "Progressive Era"); in the [1912 United States presidential election](/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election "1912 United States presidential election"), all three U.S. presidential candidates claimed to be progressives. While the term *progressivism* represents a range of diverse [political pressure groups](/wiki/Political_pressure_group "Political pressure group"), not always united, progressives rejected [social Darwinism](/wiki/Social_Darwinism "Social Darwinism"), believing that the problems society faced, such as [class warfare](/wiki/Class_warfare "Class warfare"), [greed](/wiki/Greed "Greed"), [poverty](/wiki/Poverty "Poverty"), [racism](/wiki/Racism "Racism") and [violence](/wiki/Violence "Violence"), could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment, and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated, and believed in a strong central government.[[29]](#cite_note-29) President [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") of the [Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") and later the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912) "Progressive Party (United States, 1912)") declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand."[[30]](#cite_note-30)

President [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)"). Progressive stances have evolved. [Imperialism](/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States, where some progressives supported [American imperialism](/wiki/American_imperialism "American imperialism") while others opposed it.[[31]](#cite_note-Nugent-31) In response to [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), President [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")'s [Fourteen Points](/wiki/Fourteen_Points "Fourteen Points") established the concept of national [self-determination](/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination") and criticised imperialist competition and colonial injustices. [Anti-imperialists](/wiki/Anti-imperialists "Anti-imperialists") supported these views in areas resisting imperial rule.[[32]](#cite_note-32)

During the period of acceptance of economic [Keynesianism](/wiki/Keynesianism "Keynesianism") (the 1930s–1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for [state intervention](/wiki/State_intervention "State intervention") in the economy. With the rise of [neoliberalism](/wiki/Neoliberalism "Neoliberalism") and challenges to state [interventionist](/wiki/Interventionism_(politics) "Interventionism (politics)") policies in the 1970s and 1980s, [centre-left](/wiki/Centre-left "Centre-left") progressive movements responded by adopting the [Third Way](/wiki/Third_Way "Third Way"), which emphasised a major role for the [market economy](/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy").[[33]](#cite_note-33)

There have been [social democrats](/wiki/Social_democrats "Social democrats") who have called for the social-democratic movement to move past Third Way.[[34]](#cite_note-34) Prominent [progressive conservative](/wiki/Progressive_conservatism "Progressive conservatism") elements in the British [Conservative Party](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)") have criticised neoliberalism.[[35]](#cite_note-35)

In the 21st century, progressives continue to favour [public policy](/wiki/Public_policy "Public policy") that they theorise will reduce or lessen the harmful effects of [economic inequality](/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality") as well as systemic [discrimination](/wiki/Discrimination "Discrimination") such as [institutional racism](/wiki/Institutional_racism "Institutional racism"); to advocate for [social safety nets](/wiki/Social_safety_net "Social safety net") and [workers' rights](/wiki/Workers%27_rights "Workers' rights"); and to oppose [corporate](/wiki/Corporate "Corporate") influence on the democratic process. The unifying theme is to call attention to the negative impacts of current institutions or ways of doing things and to advocate for [social progress](/wiki/Social_progress "Social progress"), i.e., for positive change as defined by any of several standards such as the expansion of [democracy](/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), increased [egalitarianism](/wiki/Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism") in the form of [economic](/wiki/Economic_egalitarianism "Economic egalitarianism") and [social equality](/wiki/Social_equality "Social equality") as well as improved well-being of a population. Proponents of social democracy have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.[[36]](#cite_note-36)

## Types

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Types")]

### Cultural progressivism

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cultural progressivism")]

Progressivism, in the general sense, mainly means social and cultural progressivism. The term *[cultural liberalism](/wiki/Cultural_liberalism "Cultural liberalism")* is used in a substantially similar context and can be said to be a synonym for cultural progressivism.[[37]](#cite_note-37) Unlike progressives in a broader sense, some cultural progressives may be economically [centrist](/wiki/Centrist "Centrist"), [conservative](/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism "Fiscal conservatism"), or politically [libertarian](/wiki/Libertarian "Libertarian"). The [Czech Pirate Party](/wiki/Czech_Pirate_Party "Czech Pirate Party") is classified as a (cultural or social) progressive party,[[38]](#cite_note-politicalcritique.org_8_January_2018-38) and it calls itself "economically centrist and socially liberal".[[39]](#cite_note-39)

### Economic progressivism

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Economic progressivism")]

Main article: [Economic progressivism](/wiki/Economic_progressivism "Economic progressivism")

*Economic progressivism*—also *New Progressive Economics*[[40]](#cite_note-vox20241004-40)—is a term used to distinguish it from *progressivism* in cultural fields. Economic progressives may draw from a variety of economic traditions, including [democratic capitalism](/wiki/Democratic_capitalism "Democratic capitalism"), [democratic socialism](/wiki/Democratic_socialism "Democratic socialism"), [social democracy](/wiki/Social_democracy "Social democracy"), and [social liberalism](/wiki/Social_liberalism "Social liberalism"). Overall, economic progressives' views are rooted in the concept of [social justice](/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") and the [common good](/wiki/Common_good "Common good"), and aim to improve the human condition through [government regulation](/wiki/Government_regulation "Government regulation"), [social protections](/wiki/Social_protection "Social protection") and the maintenance of [public goods](/wiki/Public_good_(economics) "Public good (economics)").[[41]](#cite_note-41) Some economic progressives may show [centre-right](/wiki/Centre-right_politics "Centre-right politics") views on cultural issues. These movements are related to [communitarian](/wiki/Communitarianism "Communitarianism") conservative movements such as [Christian democracy](/wiki/Christian_democracy "Christian democracy") and [one-nation conservatism](/wiki/One-nation_conservatism "One-nation conservatism").[[8]](#cite_note-catholicnewsagency-8)[[9]](#cite_note-auto-9)

### Techno progressivism

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Techno progressivism")]

Main article: [Techno-progressivism](/wiki/Techno-progressivism "Techno-progressivism")

An early mention of *techno-progressivism* appeared in 1999 as the removal of "all political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and self-realization".[[42]](#cite_note-42) According to techno-progressivism, scientific and technical aspects of progress are linked to ethical and social developments in society. Therefore, according to the majority of techno-progressive viewpoints, advancements in science and technology will not be considered proper progress until and unless they are accompanied by a fair distribution of the costs, risks, and rewards of these new capabilities. Many techno-progressive critics and supporters believe that while improved democracy, increased justice, decreased violence, and a broader culture of rights are all desirable, they are insufficient on their own to address the problems of modern technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by scientific and technological advancements that uphold and apply these ideals.[[43]](#cite_note-Carrico_2004-43)[[44]](#cite_note-Carrico_2005-44)[*[self-published source?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*]
