When determining premiums, car insurance companies pay close attention to your driving record. After all, past speeding tickets could indicate a lead foot, and at-fault accidents suggest high-risk driving. That means drivers with a clean record can get lower car insurance rates. Plus, many insurers offer additional savings opportunities for responsible driving.

I found that Auto-Owners, Erie, and USAA are among the most affordable companies that offer the best car insurance for drivers with a clean record. Ultimately, you'll want to consider each company's perks and get a customized quote before deciding which insurer offers the right car insurance policy for you.

## Auto-Owners

Best for affordable premiums

Company details

* AM Best: A+ (Superior)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 692/1,000 (study average 697)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.46 (Private Passenger)

Of the car insurance providers I reviewed, Auto-Owners has the lowest average monthly premiums for drivers with a clean record — just $46 for liability coverage and $80 for full coverage. The company is also a great option for families with teen drivers, due to its cheap rates for teens and three discounts for young drivers.

Auto-Owners offers several coverage add-ons, including loan or lease gap coverage, rental gap coverage, and an additional expense benefit. But the company doesn't have a usage-based program, and its mobile app has mediocre ratings.

Pros

* Cheap premiums for drivers with a clean record
* Low NAIC complaint index and a high financial strength grade
* Several optional coverage options

Cons

* Must work with an agent to get a quote
* Available in only 26 states
* Doesn't offer usage-based insurance

## Nationwide

Best for usage-based insurance

Company details

* AM Best: A (Excellent)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 728/1,000 (study average 697)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.90 (Private Passenger)

Drivers with a clean record are good candidates for usage-based programs, which use a mobile app or telematics device to monitor their driving and reward them with discounts for safe driving habits. In the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), Nationwide ranked first for its usage-based programs.

SmartRide, the company's safe-driving rewards program, offers an industry-leading discount of up to 40%. Unlike other usage-based programs, there's no risk of a premium increase for high-risk driving. Nationwide also offers a [pay-per-mile program](https://financebuzz.com/pay-per-mile-car-insurance) called SmartMiles.

Nationwide ranked fourth in the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), and the Better Business Bureau (BBB) has given the insurer an A+ rating. The company also offers a safe driver discount for policyholders who have been violation free for five years. However, its base premiums are more expensive than those of some competitors.

Pros

* Top J.D. Power ranking for its usage-based programs
* High J.D. Power rating for claims satisfaction
* Offers a safe driver discount

Cons

* Higher premiums than some competitors
* Not available in AK, HI, LA, or MA
* Below-average J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings in some regions

## Erie

Best for senior drivers

Company details

* AM Best: A+ (Superior)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 733/1,000 (study average 697)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.68 (Private Passenger)

Erie's average premiums for drivers with a clean record are among the lowest of the insurers I reviewed, and the company charges the second-lowest average full coverage premiums for drivers in their 70s. Older drivers can also qualify for several discounts, including a 55+ discount, savings for snowbirds who keep a vehicle in storage, and an accident prevention course discount.

What's more, Erie scores high for financial strength and customer satisfaction. J.D. Power ranked the company third for claims satisfaction, and Erie ranked first in the Mid-Atlantic and North Central regions for general customer satisfaction.

While Erie is available only in select states, it made our list of the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies) for Mid-Atlantic and Midwest drivers.

Pros

* Cheap premiums with discount opportunities for seniors
* Offers chances to earn rewards for safe driving
* Offers a safe driving discount

Cons

* Available in only 12 states and Washington, D.C.
* No online or mobile app claims

Read more in our [Erie review](https://financebuzz.com/erie-car-insurance-review).

## GEICO

Best for a clean driving record discount

Company details

* AM Best: A++ (Superior)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 692/1,000 (study average 697)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.75 (Private Passenger)

GEICO offers both low premiums to drivers with a clean record and a long list of discounts. The company offers a discount of up to 22% on most coverages for drivers who haven't had an accident for at least one year — many other companies offer a discount only after three or five years without a violation.

You can also [save money on car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/save-money-on-car-insurance) at GEICO by taking a defensive driving course or driver education course. Plus, GEICO's usage-based program, DriveEasy, is highly rated by J.D. Power. However, the company offers fewer optional coverages than its competitors.

Pros

* Highest financial strength grade from AM Best
* Generous clean driving record discount
* Highly rated usage-based program

Cons

* Below-average J.D. Power claims satisfaction rating
* Offers only a few coverage add-ons

## State Farm

Best for customer service

Company details

* AM Best: A++ (Superior)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 710/1,000 (study average 697)
* BBB: F
* NAIC complaints: 0.84 (Private Passenger)

State Farm's average premiums for drivers with a clean driving record sit well below the national average, and the company offers a good driver discount for new policyholders who haven't had an infraction for three years. State Farm's usage-based program, Drive Safe & Save, offers an additional savings opportunity of up to 30%, and the Steer Clear program for young drivers with a clean record offers a discount for participants who meet the requirements for their state.

State Farm is also known for providing a great customer experience — this is one of the reasons I chose the company for my auto insurance needs. Every policyholder gets a dedicated agent, claims are quick and easy with the award-winning mobile app, and I've found the roadside assistance coverage to be exceedingly fast and reliable.

J.D. Power rated State Farm highly for both claims satisfaction and general customer satisfaction across most regions. However, the insurer has an "F" rating with the BBB due to many unanswered and/or unresolved complaints on the platform.

Pros

* High marks for financial strength and customer satisfaction
* Offers a good driver discount for new customers
* Offers two usage-based savings opportunities

Cons

* Doesn't offer GAP insurance or new car replacement coverage
* Higher average rates for teen drivers than those of some competitors
* Poor BBB rating

Learn more in our [State Farm review.](https://financebuzz.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review)

## USAA

Best for military

Company details

* AM Best: A++ (Superior)
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 726/1000 (Above average)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.96 (Private Passenger)

While USAA offers car insurance only to its members, the company's premiums for drivers with a clean record are among the lowest. It also offers discounts for a clean driving record that vary by location. If you enroll in SafePilot, the company's usage-based program, you can earn a 10% discount right away and up to 30% off your renewal premium for safe driving behavior. This program received a high rating from J.D. Power.

Overall, USAA stands out for its superb third-party ratings. The company holds the top financial strength grade with AM Best and a high rating from J.D. Power for claims satisfaction.

Military members, veterans, certain federal employees, and their immediate family members are all eligible for membership.

Pros

* Excellent ratings for financial strength and claims satisfaction
* Highly rated usage-based insurance program
* Discounts for drivers with a clean record in many states

Cons

* Requires membership to buy an auto policy
* Limited general discount opportunities compared to competitors

## Why a clean driving record is important for car insurance

A [clean driving record](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-a-clean-driving-record) shows car insurance companies that you care to drive responsibly. If you have violations like speeding tickets or at-fault accidents on your record, insurers will charge you a higher premium to account for the higher risk that you'll file a claim in the future.

Nationwide, the average rate for full-coverage insurance is $186 per month. For comparison, here are the national average monthly rates for drivers with common infractions on their record:

* **At-fault accident:** $244
* **Speeding ticket:** $235
* **DUI:** $270

Remember that some auto insurance companies increase rates more drastically after a violation than others. For example, Auto-Owners increases premiums a relatively small amount, from $80 to $99 per month. But any company will likely charge more if you have an infraction on your record.

## How to maximize your savings as a good driver

Aside from remaining violation free, there are a few ways you can [lower your car insurance rate](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-lower-car-insurance) as a safe driver:

* Sign up for a telematics program that rewards you for safe driving.
* Take advantage of [discounts for good drivers](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-get-a-good-driver-discount) and safe drivers.
* Check whether you're eligible to complete a defensive driving course.
* Look for other discount opportunities, like multi-policy discounts.
* Compare car insurance quotes apples to apples to get the best deal.
* Maintain a good credit score.
* Choose a [high deductible](https://financebuzz.com/why-higher-deductible-lowers-insurance-premiums) if you can afford the higher potential out-of-pocket cost.
* Don't buy unnecessary coverage or choose higher coverage limits than you need.

## FAQs

### What is the cheapest insurance for safe drivers?

Though individual premiums vary based on age, location, and other factors, Auto-Owners has the cheapest car insurance premiums for safe drivers on average.

### Why is my car insurance so high with a clean record?

Car insurance companies consider more than just your driving record when setting premiums. For example, you may pay a higher rate if you are young, have bad credit, or live in an area with high theft rates. If you're not happy with your premium, consider getting auto insurance quotes from other companies to see if you could pay less elsewhere.

### How far back on your driving record do insurers look?

It depends on the violation, state law, and the insurer. The insurance statutes in your state may dictate a minimum and/or maximum lookback period for each type of violation. Some insurers disregard minor violations after three years even if state laws allow a longer timeframe.

  

## Bottom line

Several insurers, including Auto-Owners, Erie, and GEICO, offer low auto insurance rates for people with a clean driving record. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the other factors impacting your car insurance rate, like your age and location, as well as your coverage needs.

It's a good idea to [compare car insurance quotes](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-find-the-best-rates) from multiple companies, and this list is a great place to start. Make sure to consider any discounts you may be eligible for that your quote doesn't reflect.
