# How much does a new roof cost?

[Home](/home/)

3 min read

Getting a new roof is a significant expense, and it's important to understand how much it will cost and what the price includes so you can budget accordingly. We spoke with Kyle Shirley, owner of [Sol Vista Roofing](https://solvistaroofing.com/), to find out how much you can expect to pay for a new roof if yours is no longer getting the job done.

## What's the typical cost of a new roof?

The roofing material you choose greatly affects the cost of a new roof. Prices vary based on location, too, with a new roof in 2024 [costing anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000](https://solvistaroofing.com/blog/roof-replacement/).

## What affects the cost for a new roof?

The cost to replace a roof includes more than just the price of the shingles. Many factors affect how much you'll pay for a new roof, including:

### Material and labor costs

Some roofing materials are more expensive than others. For example, if you opt for an asphalt shingle roof, you'll pay less than if you choose concrete tiles. If the roofing company needs to bring in scaffolding or a crane to load materials onto the roof, it will likely cost you more. The cost for a new roof and the price of labor also varies significantly based on where you live.

### Existing roof type

It was common to layer a new roof on top of the existing one in the past. However, new building codes don't allow that anymore. If you have multiple layers of roofing material that you need to remove, it will be more expensive. "It takes a lot of man-hours to take those layers off," Shirley says.

### Roof size, complexity, and roof deck

The larger and more complex your roof is, the more expensive it will be to get a new one. If your roof deck is in good condition, you can put the new roof on top. However, if it's wet, rotted, or otherwise damaged, you'll have to pay to replace the deck, which will increase the total cost of the roof replacement.

## How do you know if you need a new roof?

Some clues that you need a new roof are subtle. For example, buckling or curling shingles, water damage, or sagging are signs that it may be time for a new roof. Replacing a roof can be costly, so make sure you know how often to replace your roof and [how your roof type impacts homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-roof-type-impacts-insurance/).

## Will homeowners insurance cover a new roof?

Your homeowners insurance may pay to replace [your roof in the event it was damaged](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-roof-damage/) due to a covered peril, such as a fire, hail, or a strong windstorm, up to your coverage limit. However, your insurance will typically not pay to replace your roof due to general wear, tear, and age, as that's considered normal upkeep of your home.
