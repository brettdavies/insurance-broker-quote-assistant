Founded in 1916 and headquartered in Michigan, Auto-Owners has always been dedicated to independent agents, which remains true today — you won’t be able to get a quote or purchase a policy online, which may be a benefit or a drawback depending on how you like to buy insurance.
Auto-Owners operates in 26 states and underwrites various types of insurance policies, including home, auto, business and life insurance. It was one of the [best overall auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/) in our recent evaluation, as well as one of the [best for teens](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/teens/).
The company ranks highly in many customer satisfaction metrics that I looked at for this review, and its rates tend to be lower than average. It also offers many discount opportunities and add-on coverages, making it an appealing choice if you live in one of the states where it’s available.
I’m a senior editor and analyst at AutoInsurance.com, and although I’m a State Farm customer, I’ll break down everything you need to know about Auto-Owners based on my industry knowledge and third-party research.

## Quick Look: Auto-Owners Pros & Cons
### Pros
* Lower-than-average rates
* Independent agents provide personalized service
* High customer satisfaction and claims scores from J.D. Power
### Cons
* Not available nationwide
* No online quotes
## Who Is Auto-Owners Auto Insurance Best For?
Auto-Owners is ideal for drivers who prefer working directly with independent agents and who have good driving records to take advantage of Auto-Owners’ lower-than-average rates.
#### Auto-Owners Is Best for Those Who:
* Like working with an independent agent for personalized recommendations
* Have a young driver(s) in the household
* Are looking to bundle auto insurance with other policy types, such as home and life insurance
* Need to insure alternative vehicles, such as RVs, boats or trailers
#### Auto-Owners Is Not Best for Those Who:
* Prefer to get quotes and manage their policies online
* Live in one of the 24 states where the company does not operate
Auto-Owners sells auto policies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, [Florida](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/best-car-insurance/), Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, [Michigan](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/michigan/best-car-insurance/), Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
## How Much Does Auto-Owners Car Insurance Cost?
According to the aggregated data we analyzed, Auto-Owners rates for auto insurance tend to be below average. The average annual rate for a [full coverage policy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/full-coverage/) from Auto-Owners is $1,547, compared to the national average of $2,399. Meanwhile, a [minimum coverage policy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/) costs an average of $451 per year from Auto-Owners, which is also less than the national average of $635.
Auto insurance rates vary greatly based on different factors, such as location, driving record, age and even gender, so your quoted rate may be higher or lower than these rates. However, these averages indicate that Auto-Owners policies tend to be on the more affordable side.
Minimum coverage policies will always be the cheapest option available, but I highly recommend full coverage for added peace of mind and financial protection, especially if you have a newer car. If your budget is tight, prioritize increasing your [liability limits](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/liability-limits/).
You can see how Auto-Owner’s average premium compares to major national insurers in the table below:
Company | Average annual premium for full coverage | Average annual premium for minimum coverage
---|---|---
Auto-Owners | $1,547 | $451
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/) | $2,605 | $840
[American Family](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/american-family/reviews/) | $1,936 | $604
[Farmers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/farmers/reviews/) | $2,979 | $1,002
[GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) | $1,731 | $517
[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $1,808 | $718
[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/) | $1,960 | $638
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/) | $2,167 | $674
[Travelers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/travelers/reviews/) | $1,597 | $576
[USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/) | $1,407 | $417
### Auto-Owners Rates by Driver Profile
Driver Profile | Auto-Owners Full Coverage Average | National Average
---|---|---
Clean record, good credit | $1,547 | $2,399
Speeding ticket | $2,007 | $2,511
At-fault accident | $2,246 | $2,812
Household with teen driver | $3,014 | $5,327
DUI | $3,454 | $3,305
## How You Can Save on Your Policy With Auto-Owners
Although Auto-Owners tends to have decent rates to begin with, it also offers many discount opportunities to further reduce your premium.
### Highlighted Discount: Teen Driver Monitoring
Auto-Owners doesn’t have a usage-based insurance program available to all drivers, which is a popular offering from many major insurers. However, it does have a teen driver monitoring discount, which new teen drivers can take advantage of. This works just like any other telematics discount program but is available only to teens.
In order to qualify, the young driver must have a GPS permanently installed in the vehicle they drive most often or be enrolled in an eligible mobile app. Auto-Owners doesn’t advertise how much of a discount you can get from this program, so be sure to ask an agent for details if you have a teen on your policy.
Learn more about [teen driver technology](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/safe-driving-tech-for-teens/) that helps young people stay safe on the road.
### Highlighted Discount: Bundling
Bundling is one of the most common discounts offered by nearly every insurer, but Auto-Owners offers an added bonus since it also sells life insurance policies. It has a standard multi-policy discount if you have other policies with the company besides auto, and it also has a life multi-policy discount, which rewards you specifically for having an Auto-Owners life insurance policy as one of your policies. You can also earn a bundling discount if you buy a homeowners, renters, or condo policy with Auto-Owners.
### Other Discounts
In addition to these discounts, Auto-Owners also offers:
* **Payment history:** If you pay your premiums on time for 36 months, you’ll get a discount at your next renewal.
* **Paid-in-full:** Opting to pay your policy in full can get you a discount.
* **Paperless discount:** You can save on your premium by enrolling in paperless billing and paying online.
* **Advance quote:** New customers who request a quote before the policy effective date are eligible for a discount.
* **Multi-car discount:** Get a discount if you insure more than one vehicle on your Auto-Owners policy.
* **Safety feature discount:** Earn a discount for having safety features like anti-lock brake systems, airbags or anti-theft devices.
* **Favorable loss history:** You could get a discount if you have a favorable loss history, which means you have few or no prior claims for which the insurance company needed to pay a settlement.
* **Good student discount:** Full-time students who maintain a GPA of B or higher can qualify for a discount of up to 20 percent.
* **Student away at school discount:** Students who are away at school more than 100 miles from home without a vehicle also qualify for savings.
Available discounts can vary by state, so be sure to ask the agent when you get a quote about what discounts you qualify for.
## Auto-Owners Quote and Purchase Process
Auto-Owners prides itself on working exclusively with independent [local agents](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agents/), so it doesn’t provide quotes or the ability to purchase policies online. If you live in one of the 26 states where Auto-Owners operates, you can go to its website and click on “Find an Agent” to input your ZIP code and find a local agent in your area.
A local agent will take down your information (and that of any other drivers you’re looking to add to your policy) as well as details about your vehicle. They will be able to give you personalized coverage suggestions and can help you purchase your policy if you’re ready to move ahead.
## What Types of Auto Insurance Coverage Does Auto-Owners Offer?
Auto-Owners has standard insurance coverages, including liability coverage, collision and comprehensive coverage (referred to as full coverage), medical payments, personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage.
In addition to these basic coverage options, Auto-Owners also offers the following optional add-on coverages so you can customize your policy to fit your needs:
Coverage | What it covers
---|---
Loan or Lease Gap | GAP insurance covers the difference between the market value of your vehicle and the remaining balance on your loan or lease if you total your car.
Diminished Value | If you get into an accident, your car may not be worth as much after repairs as it was pre-accident. This coverage will compensate you for that loss in value.
Additional Expense | This coverage helps pay for the cost of a rental car and other expenses you might incur if your car is being repaired due to a covered incident, including hotel and food costs.
Road Trouble Service | This covers the cost of roadside assistance if your car breaks down and you need a battery jumpstart, tire replacement, or locksmith services.
Accident Forgiveness | Car insurance rates generally increase following an accident. This coverage forgives your first at-fault accident and prevents a rate surcharge. You must have no at-fault claims or major violations during the prior 36 months to be eligible for this coverage.
Collision Coverage Advantage | Auto-Owners will waive your collision deductible if you’re involved in a crash with another driver insured by Auto-Owners.
Common Loss Deductible | If you experience damage to both your car and your house from a covered incident and both are insured with Auto-Owners, the company will lower your auto deductible by the amount of the property deductible to ease your financial burden.
If you have a violation on your record, here are some of the [best insurance options for high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/).
## Auto-Owners: Customer Satisfaction
Auto-Owners scores highly in most of the customer satisfaction metrics I looked at, which means you can generally expect a good customer experience if you choose to insure with them.
Starting with the less positive, Auto-Owners ranked slightly below-average on the J.D. Power 2024 Claims Satisfaction Study, with a score of 692 out of 1,000 (the average was 697). The claims process includes filing a claim, the estimate process, getting a payout, and the repair process.
However, the company scored highly on CRASH Network’s 2025 Insurer Report Card, making the “Honor Roll” in 14th place out of 97 with a rating of B. This means that auto repair shops generally find the insurer easy to work with when making repairs for covered incidents, which likely translates to a smoother experience for customers.
When considering financial stability, Auto-Owners is very reliable, with an A+ rating from AM Best. This means you can trust the company to pay out settlements when you file a claim for a covered repair.
Auto-Owners ranked a few points above average in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Shopping Study, with a score of 679 out of 1,000. This study evaluates customer satisfaction with the insurance purchase experience, so this ranking may be related to the company’s agent-exclusive buying process. The company ranked above average in the Central and Southwest regions, and number one in Florida after USAA (which is only available to military members, veterans, and their families) on J.D. Power’s 2024 Auto Insurance Study. This study evaluates satisfaction with an insurance carrier among existing customers.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/auto-owners/reviews/#citation-1)

## Filing a Claim With Auto-Owners
If you need to file a claim with Auto-Owners, you’ll need to do so through your local agent. The company also provides a number you can call (1-888-252-4626) after hours. If you have a glass claim, you can also file it online.
Once you report a claim, you can track its progress on the company’s online portal or mobile app. Auto-Owners doesn’t give an expected timeframe for claims resolution as every claim is different, but it does note that it provides 24-hour claim service, so you can reach someone to report a loss at any time.
Once the settlement is approved, you can also expect a quick payment by choosing an electronic payment method, including a direct deposit into your bank account, Venmo or PayPal.
## Auto-Owners's Website and Mobile App
![Auto Owners App Main Page](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F30175213%2FAuto-Owners-App-Main-Page.jpg&w=828&q=75)

I also downloaded the app to get a feel for it, but there are no other options on the home screen besides the sign-in. This could be frustrating if you need roadside assistance and have trouble signing in — many other insurers offer a roadside assistance button on their app without needing to sign in.
![Auto Owners App Login](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F30175335%2FAuto-Owners-App-Login.png&w=828&q=75)
The app has pretty low ratings on both app stores, with users reporting that it takes forever to load and is glitchy since a recent update. Apple users also report frustration that the app doesn’t work with older versions of iOS.
App Version | Rating (out of 5)
---|---
iPhone (App Store) | 2.9 stars
Android (Google Play) | 3.5 stars
Auto-Owners received below average scores in the 2024 J.D. Power Digital Experience study in both the shopping and service categories, likely due to its focus on local agents and low-rated mobile apps.

## Methodology – How We Review Insurance Companies
We assess companies on the following:
* **Pricing (40%):** We analyze average rates for minimum and full coverage for various drivers. This includes those with clean records, at-fault accidents, speeding tickets, DUIs, low credit, and households with teens. We also look at available discounts, which can help customers save even more. Full coverage averages use the following limits:
* Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
* Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
* Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
* **Customer Experience (25%):** We leverage third-party data alongside our personal experiences as auto insurance customers to provide insights into the shopping journey and the ease of engaging with providers. We also test digital tools firsthand and review customer feedback to evaluate the usability of websites, mobile apps, and online account management features.
* **Claims Handling (25%):** Since claim fulfillment is a core function of an insurance company, our assessment involves analyzing claims processes using data from sources such as AM Best, CRASH Network, and J.D. Power, as well as customer feedback and our own experiences.
* **Coverage (10%):** We prioritize companies that offer additional protections like gap coverage, rideshare, roadside assistance, classic car coverage, accident forgiveness, and more.
