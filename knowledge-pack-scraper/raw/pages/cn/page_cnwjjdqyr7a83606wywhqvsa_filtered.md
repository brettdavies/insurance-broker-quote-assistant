## [Why is GEICO so cheap?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/why-is-geico-so-cheap-1000109-2140684827/)

[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) is so cheap because it sells insurance coverage directly to consumers without middlemen and offers a [lot of discounts](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/geico-discounts/76834). Direct-to-consumer insurance allows GEICO to have significantly fewer local offices and agents, making them cheaper than companies like State Farm and Progressive. Having a smaller agent network lowers GEICO's overhead costs so they can pass those savings on to consumers.

## [How much is the GEICO marriage discount?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/geico-marriage-discount-1000123-2140700076/)

GEICO does not have a marriage discount. GEICO does, however, tend to offer lower rates to married couples over single people. Married couples also tend to qualify for more discounts, like GEICO’s multi-car and multi-policy discounts.

To get the GEICO federal employee discount of 8%, you must be an active or retired federal government employee, GS-7 or above. GEICO also offers this “Eagle Discount” to federal employees with positions that are not on the GS pay system, as long as the job is equal to GS-11 or higher. The GEICO Eagle Discount is available in most states and Washington, D.C.

If you belong to a federal organization you can get a membership discount instead. GEICO has a long [list of federal affiliates](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/organization-member/military-and-federal/), but the exact discount varies based on the organization and your location. The membership discount is also available in most states and D.C., but you can’t combine both the GEICO membership and Eagle discounts.

GEICO will ask about your employment when you get a quote online or over the phone, so you’ll know right away if you’re eligible for one of these programs.

It’s also worth noting that GEICO was founded in 1936 to serve federal employees. Their name is actually an acronym for Government Employees Insurance Co.—GEICO. You can count on them to take care of your insurance needs as a federal employee.
