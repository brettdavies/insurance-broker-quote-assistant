Yes, car insurance typically goes down at age 25 for experienced drivers with good driving records. Drivers can usually expect to pay 12% to 20% less for car insurance coverage starting at age 25, since 25-year-olds are no longer considered as high-risk as younger drivers.

You can get the State Farm Steer Clear discount by completing the company’s safe driver discount program in six months, and then continuing to meet your state’s eligibility requirements. State Farm’s Steer Clear discount encourages young people to be safer drivers, and it can save them money on their premium. Discounts vary by state.

The discount isn’t available in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Carolina or Rhode Island. There are a few minimum requirements that participants who live in eligible states must meet, too.

## State Farm Steer Clear Discount Requirements

* Be under 25 years old (in most states)
* Have a valid driver's license
* Have no at-fault accidents or moving violations in the past three years
* Successfully complete all the program requirements within 6 months of starting

## How to Get the State Farm Steer Clear Discount

1. Contact State Farm to make sure you meet the eligibility requirements.
2. Download the Steer Clear app for iOS or Android (text STEER to 42407 to receive a link). You don’t need a mobile device to participate, however, as State Farm offers the training modules on its website.
3. Use the Steer Clear app or State Farm website to complete the five training courses, which cover topics like distracted driving and special driving situations. This includes watching videos and taking quizzes about safe driving.
4. Log your driving hours over the course of at least 10 practice trips, which must include five hours of driving time, using the Steer Clear mobile app or the [trip log sheet](https://static1.st8fm.com/en_US/content_pages/1/pdf/us/steer-clear-drivers-program-log.pdf) provided by State Farm. If you use the Steer Clear app, it will track your driving habits, such as your speed, turning times, braking, and other maneuvers. It will then give you a score and feedback after each trip.
5. Sign the [Statement of Qualification](https://static1.st8fm.com/en_US/content_pages/1/pdf/us/steer-clear-drivers-program-qualification.pdf), which asserts that eligible drivers have completed the initial requirements for the Steer Clear Safe Driver Discount and that they understand they will lose the discount if they are involved in an at-fault accident or get a moving violation.
6. Finish all the program requirements within six months. If you complete the program using the app, you will receive a certificate of completion through the app, which you should send to State Farm, along with your digital trip log and Statement of Qualification. If you don’t use the app to complete the program, send your trip log and Statement of Qualification to your local State Farm agent.
7. Confirm the State Farm Steer Clear discount is being applied to your premium by checking your bill or contacting a State Farm representative.

If you continue to meet your state’s eligibility requirements, you’ll continue to get your Steer Clear Safe Driver Discount. The discount is generally available only to drivers younger than 25 years old, but older drivers who have fewer than three years of active driving experience can qualify in some states.
