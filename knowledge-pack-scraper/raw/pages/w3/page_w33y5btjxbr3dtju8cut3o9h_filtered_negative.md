The average cost of full coverage auto insurance in the U.S. is $2,399, and minimum coverage averages $635. While these figures can serve as a helpful starting point and gauge as you begin shopping for car insurance, your actual rate will depend on many other factors, like your age, the state where you reside, your driving history, and, in some states, even your credit score and gender. To find the cheapest rates, compare quotes from at least three different providers.
## The Cost of Auto Insurance: What Affects Premiums?
Factors like where you live, your age, credit score, and whether you have a speeding ticket or at-fault accident on your record all play a part in how much you’ll pay. Another important thing to consider is how much coverage you need.
National average for annual full coverage | National average for annual minimum coverage
---|---
$2,399 | $635
The average cost for full coverage auto insurance in the U.S. is $2,399. Minimum coverage runs $635 on average. Legally, most drivers are only required to meet their state’s minimum insurance requirements, but it’s in your best interest to purchase full coverage. [Minimum coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/mechanical/) typically only covers damages or injuries you cause to others, and only up to a set limit. Full coverage generally includes both collision and comprehensive coverage, which not only covers damages to your own vehicle, but also protects you from potential out-of-pocket costs.
## Average Cost by Company
USAA offers the cheapest full coverage rates at an average of $1,407 per year, followed by Travelers at $1,597 and GEICO at $1,731. These rates all fall well below the national average of $2,399. All providers offer their own unique tailoring of discounts or benefits, so compare quotes to find the best fit for you. We’ve listed the average annual rates for some of the most recognizable insurance companies below to get you started.

### Average Cost by State
The cost of insurance differs by state. Each state has its own laws regarding insurance requirements, and states with higher traffic congestion and severe weather events tend to have higher average annual coverage rates due to higher frequency of claims. Other factors that impact states’ premium prices include crime rate, cost of repairs, cost of living, and cost of medical care.

### Average Cost by Driving Record
Your driving history plays a big part in how much you pay for auto insurance. If you have an incident on your driving record, like a speeding ticket, at-fault accident, or DUI, your rates will most likely be higher. Many states also allow insurance companies to take credit scores into account when calculating premiums because research shows a correlation between credit history and the likelihood of filing claims.
Driver profile | Average annual cost of insurance | Increase over clean record, good credit
---|---|---
Speeding ticket | $2,511 | +5%
At-fault accident | $2,812 | +17%
DUI | $3,305 | +38%
Low credit | $3,377 | +41%
In California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, and Utah, insurance companies are prohibited from using credit scores as a factor for calculating insurance rates.
### Average Cost by Age
Teens are the most expensive age demographic to insure due to their lack of experience behind the wheel, higher likelihood for risky behavior, and statistically higher accident rates. As drivers gain more experience, their likelihood of accidents tend to lower, as do their rates. The average cost of insurance for a teen is $5,327 annually on average, and $2,399 for an adult.
Age | Average annual cost of insurance
---|---
Teens | $5,327
25-year olds | $2,643
Adults | $2,399
Seniors | $1,666
### Demographics
Auto insurance costs are also influenced by a variety of individual life factors, including some that you can’t control, like your age and sex.
* **Age:** First-time drivers and teen drivers are statistically more likely to get into accidents, so they have higher premiums. The good news is that their rates will reduce when they turn 25. Learn more about [auto insurance costs for teens](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/teens/).
* **Sex:** Auto insurance tends to be more expensive for [men](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/why-men-pay-more-for-car-insurance/), as they’re statistically more likely to get into car accidents. This predominantly applies to young men and teens.
* **Credit:** If you have bad credit and need auto insurance, your average annual premium and auto insurance rates will be higher than those of the same person with good credit.
* **Marital status:** Married people pay less for auto insurance than single, widowed, or divorced people.
* **Country, state, and city:** Because states have different minimum auto insurance requirements, your cost will differ greatly based on the state where you live and insure your car. Urban areas tend to be more expensive, as they have more incidents of theft, vandalism, and collisions than suburban and rural areas.
### Coverages
[What your auto insurance covers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/) affects the amount you’ll pay monthly for insurance coverage, known as your premium rates. Every state requires minimum coverage for property damage, and every state except [Florida](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/) and [New Jersey](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-jersey/) requires bodily injury [liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/liability/), but if you add supplementary coverage, your costs will go even higher.
### Driving Record
If you’ve had traffic tickets, car accidents, or a DUI citation in the past, your auto insurance costs will rise. Likewise, they’ll reduce if you have a clean driving record. Learn more about [how much auto insurance costs after an accident](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/accidents/).
### More Factors
A ton of other factors can affect the cost of car insurance, including these:
* Auto laws in your state
* Auto repair costs
* How often you drive
* Gaps in coverage
* Medical/legal costs
* Owning vs. leasing cars
* Per capita disposable income
* Population density
* Rate and form filing laws
* The distance you drive
* Traffic density
* Underwriting and loss adjustment expense
* Use of telematics
Some factors won’t affect your car insurance premium costs on their own, like having kids or retiring (unless you drive more or less as a result of either life change).
## How to Save on Car Insurance
* **Compare quotes:** Shop around and compare quotes from at least three different providers. Get to know what discounts and programs they offer. Knowledge is power. The more informed you are, the more likely you are to find the [best cheap auto insurance company](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/cheap/) to match your unique profile and needs.
* **Ask your agent about discounts:** Always ask your agents about discounts you may qualify for based on your personal profile. Many insurance companies offer safe driver discounts, military discounts, senior discounts, and more.
* **Bundle policies:** Many companies offer discounts if you bundle your auto insurance with another policy, like homeowners insurance. Not only will you save, you’ll also streamline your policies under one provider for added convenience.
* **Raise your deductible:** Raising your deductible will lower your monthly payments, but make sure that you can comfortably afford the potential out-of-pocket cost if you need to file a claim.
* **Maintain a clean driving record:** Safe driving pays off. Drivers with clean records tend to enjoy lower rates overall and may qualify for discounts over time.
## Frequently Asked Questions
How much does car insurance usually cost monthly?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
The national average monthly cost of car insurance is $200. However, it’s important to remember that insurance costs vary greatly by state and other factors, including credit score, driving history, and whether or not you live in a city.
Is $200 a month a lot for car insurance?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
If you’re paying $200 a month for full coverage auto insurance, you’re right around the national average. But keep in mind that where you live plays a big role in what you pay. For example, drivers in Wisconsin pay on average $124, while drivers in Florida pay $272. So while $200 may be the average across the U.S., depending on your state, it could be less or more.
What are some reasons the cost of auto insurance could change?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
These are some reasons that the cost of your auto insurance could change:
* You get [married](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/car-insurance-married-couples-stats/), divorced, separated, or widowed.
* Your credit score changes.
* You move cities or states.
* You get into an accident.
* You get a ticket.
* You get a DUI.
* Your license is suspended or revoked.
* You turn 25.
* You add or drop coverages.
* Your commute changes.
Are there specific car models that have higher insurance premiums?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Luxury brands like Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, and [Porsche](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/porsche/) often have higher premiums because their replacement parts are expensive. High performance cars, like sports cars and vehicles with powerful engines also tend to incur higher premium costs because they are considered more likely to be involved in an accident due to speeding and their handling. Additionally, models with a history of being targeted by thieves, like the Honda Accord or Hyundai Elantra, may have higher insurance premiums.
