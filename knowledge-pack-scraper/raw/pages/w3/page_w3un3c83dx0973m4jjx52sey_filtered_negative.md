I am bundled with SF - home, auto, umbrella.
I inquired about removing auto and was told my home would go up. However, my wind mitigation credit would also go up to offset some of that cost. Something like $9 in credit increase. The question became why am I not getting the full potential credit on wind mitigation now? The answer was IDK, corporate makes these calculators.
Insurance is a scam.

How is this a scam? They set rules to offer discounts based on activity or behavior, but they still have to mitigate costs as they need to payout when people do stupid things or bad luck happens. This is the most difficult business to predict and stay profitable. Yet if they didn't exist, most people would be screwed financially when something bad happens. And the issue is not that you screw yourself, but you screw others when you are the cause of an accident, which is why insurance is required. Not to protect you, but to protect others from you.

It used o be that agents would have physical copies of the rate manuals for whatever states they wrote in. Now they're all online. There's no reason your agent or someone on their staff couldn't open the rate manual online and see how the discounts interact. It's not hidden in the slightest.
Your agent's staff just sound untrained.

You might be right. I don't think the agent was very smart. I miss our old agent who retired. He knew everything. He always could answer our questions.

Yes. Discount matrixes in almost all states have a max cap by coverage line. This is exceedingly common.

Never heard of that before. If she qualifies for steer clear, good student and student away she should be getting those discounts. It might be taking some time for those discounts to get added. I’ve never heard of someone maxing out the lifetime discounts that doesn’t make any sense to me as an agent. Is she actually going to school 100 miles away without any car? Does she actually have. 3.0 or better.? No tickets no accidents?
Also $340 isn’t shit on a 6 month premium.

That is not the actual amount. I just gave arbitrary numbers to make it look easier to see what I'm talking about. The funny thing is that my son's insurance actually went down when he switched to progressive. Makes me think the student discounts honestly don't mean anything. She does qualify for all three. She graduated number 2 in her class. She does go to college 100 miles away and left her car behind. No tickets or accidents too. I got to drive her car down the street each week. I keep forgetting to. I'll do that today.

Don’t fall for the discounts scheme,discounts are just premium you’ll pay later. That’s why your rates increases, sure they claim raises are cost and market driven but a percentage is discount they gave you from the previous policy term.

Technically she is on my car. I have a 2005 toyota corolla. She is cheaper on my car because it's our oldest. She has the 2016 toyota corolla that she actually drives but left it behind for college.

First, State Farm agents aren’t really “agents”. They’re brainwashed into thinking State Farm’s way is the way of the industry… Liberty Mutual employees are similar. Rules/Rate filings happen monthly, and it’s not always possible to know every detail of the rate filings. These days, someone getting a rate so low that they max the discounts out I’m sure is rare, especially with kids listed on the policy, so unless they’ve run into/been asked the question before, it’s unlikely they would know this rule

For some reason, girls cannot have good students and student away at the same time. The student away is a larger discount so it’s better.

I would advise shopping your entire insurance portfolio with an independent agent. It might shock you how much State farm is screwing you.

I think shopping around can work but you need to very careful that the coverage is actually the same.

We started shopping car insurance every renewal when we caught our long term agent not routinely reviewing our policies to make sure we were getting the best insurance for the best price. We felt that should have been part of their job when they took us on as clients but here we are.

It would be impossible for agents to review every client's policies each year. It takes a lot of work to requote a whole household and only for the agent to make less money. A good agent should review every 2-3 years to determine household/property changes and requote.

find a local agent with a lot of markets and let them shop for you.
your loyalty to state farm has cost you untold hundreds, if not thousands over the years.

You want to get really bent out of shape over insurance rates stuff? My liability policy I have to carry for my work is relatively affordable through my provider- it's one of the choices I went to them- over the last couple of years they have now instituted through corporate a minimum policy cost. So because my policy is so affordable I actually get a surcharge on the policy on an annual basis now that is nearly approaching 50% of the policy cost itself. Which just blows my mind - why not just bump up the cost of the policy instead of selling me a policy at X cost and then adding a minimum policy cost surcharge on after the fact because some state Regulators somewhere decided that policy should cost some arbitrary minimum amount.
