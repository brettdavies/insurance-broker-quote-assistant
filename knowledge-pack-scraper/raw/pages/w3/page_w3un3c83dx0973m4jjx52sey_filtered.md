# State Farm actually has a cut off point for discounts

My husband, son(age 22), daughter(age 18) and myself have State Farm. My son graduated from college this year and moved out of state for a job. He got his own car insurance out there and we dropped him from our policy. He has progressive now. This info is important. Now my daughter just started college. We noticed that our insurance was not giving her all of the discounts my son always got. He had Steer Clear Safe Driver, Student Away At School, and Good Student. We kept asking why our daughter was missing one of these discounts. It took forever because our agent was getting the run around from the people above him at State Farm. Our agent didn't even know about the following: There is a cap for getting too much money off your insurance because of discounts. Our son, is a young guy and was getting charged a lot for his insurance based on this fact alone. So State Farm allowed him to get all three discounts. Our daughter is a girl, so she does not get charged as much as our son. This makes her insurance lower. If State Farm allowed us to do all three student discounts for her, she would be below the threshold of what they require her to pay.

Example: These numbers are not real numbers. I'm doing this to make it more easy to understand.

Son- Pays $600(because he is a guy). He gets 3 discounts, Good student ($30), Steer clear ($30), and Student away($30). So that is $90. The $90 gets subtracted from $600. This reduces his insurance to $510. This is what he pays.

Daughter-Pays $400(because she is a girl). She is suppose to get 3 discounts-Good student ($30), Steer clear ($30), and Student away($30). So that is $90 in total. If she got that $90 subtracted, her insurance would go down to $310. State Farm has minimum of $340 that must be paid. No one can go below that limit. So they take off one discount ($30). Now she has to pay $340.

The thing that gets me mad is that both agents at the State Farm office we go to, did not know this fact. It took them weeks to pry this info out of the hands of the the corporate office. This makes me so mad. Why have the discounts if you can't get them all? They should tell every person that has a kid that there is a limit to how much money can be taken off their insurance. I'm going to start researching other car insurance companies on Monday and find someone else to insure our cars.
