## Getting started

To discuss your insurance needs, please contact a licensed broker. Brokers may be able to offer you additional insurance options that provide more comprehensive coverage than the FAIR Plan. Additionally, you may wish to contact more than one broker to see whether they can offer you coverage through other insurers. Not all brokers are registered to work with the FAIR Plan.
