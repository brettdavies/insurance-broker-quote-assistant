## How you're covered
A typical policy in Pennsylvania may include the following [homeowners insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/):
  * **Dwelling coverage (Coverage A)** protects your home's structure (roof, walls, etc.) as well as attached structures, like a porch.
  * **Other structures coverage (Coverage B)** protects detached structures, such as a fence, shed, or detached garage.
  * **Personal property coverage (Coverage C)** protects your personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics. Certain items, like jewelry, art, and collectibles, are often only covered up to a specific limit so you may want to purchase an endorsement to schedule these items on your policy at the coverage amount needed, also known as "adding a rider."
  * **Loss of use coverage (Coverage D)** may help cover costs associated with an increase in living expenses, up to your policy's limit, if you're unable to stay in your home while it's being repaired or rebuilt due to a covered loss.
  * **Personal liability coverage (Coverage E)** protects you financially if you're legally responsible for another person's injuries or damage to their property.
  * **Medical payments to others (Coverage F)** may pay for medical expenses due to a covered occurrence.


Keep in mind, coverage under your policy is subject to exclusions and conditions within your policy. It's important to read your policy to understand the coverage provided.
Did you know?
Pennsylvania can experience intense storms caused by the [Lake Effect](https://www.weather.gov/ctp/SnowStormTypes), when cold air moves across the Great Lakes, gathering moisture and creating massive snowstorms that could cause damage to your home. Learn how [homeowners insurance covers storm damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-storm-damage/) and [roof leaks caused by winter storms](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-roof-leaks/).
### More ways to stay covered in Pennsylvania
In some cases, you can buy extra protection by adding coverage to your homeowners policy or purchasing a separate policy. If available, Pennsylvanians may want to consider:
  * **Flood** : Flooding is not typically covered under a homeowners policy. If you're concerned about flooding in your area, a [private flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) or [NFIP](https://www.progressive.com/answers/private-flood-insurance-vs-nfip/), where available, may help protect your property and belongings against flood damage.
  * **Umbrella** : An [umbrella policy](https://www.progressive.com/umbrella-insurance/) may help protect your assets if you exceed the personal liability coverage on your homeowners policy.
  * **Sump pump** : Sewage back-up or sump pump overflows aren't typically one of the standard coverages automatically included with homeowners insurance. Adding [water back-up coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-water-backup-coverage/) as an optional coverage, if available, may help in the event of sewage back-up or sump pump overflow due to heavy storms.
