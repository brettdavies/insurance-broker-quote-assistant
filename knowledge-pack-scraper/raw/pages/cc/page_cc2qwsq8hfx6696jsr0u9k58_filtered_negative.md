>  Problem with FB leads, and we've managed close to $2M in ad spend, is that people use lead forms and put fake numbers in there.
>  Usually it's just pre-populating the phone number they placed on the last form and it might be a fake or old phone number.
>  You could push them to a landing page, but that would increase your costs even more and you might as well buy DM leads.
>  You could keep costs down and just ask for a special field "Best number to reach you at" or something like that on the Facebook lead form.
>  Also, paying lead vendors hits you with a huge markup cost.
>  You can get local FE leads for $8-$12 a pop in most places.
>  So I'd add an extra 10% asking for "best number to reach them at" you're still cutting your costs by 50% when creating the leads yourself.
>  Now you have 2x the amount of leads, with 2 included phone numbers, for the same price you were paying the vendors for one.
>  Plus, add in some AI appointment setting by text and voice, and it will help save some time.
>  Then def get out there and door knock the ones that don't answer.
>  Though that option may not be long for the FE lead world. With insurance ads being added to the Special Ads Category, you likely won't be able to ask for address here shortly.
>  We're still getting ads approved without Special Ads Category, but who knows when/if it will effect FE or Medicare.
>  Agent Autopilot can do all that for $297 a month, by the way.
>  1-Click Ads Launcher
>  Text AI
>  Voice AI
>  All the Pipelines, Workflows, A2P, Setup, Integration etc is done for you.

>  Their claim was they rotate the numbers and use local. Stops you from having one number that gets spammed, then you have to go through the process of switching. I called one of my managers in San Antonio from Kixie. 10 calls, it changed the number 10 times. Used a local area code all 10 times. Showed up as SPAM all 10 times.
>  Yes, they can add new numbers, but new numbers is the issue. You have to show that number is legit to make it not show as SPAM. They are not going to do that for thousands of numbers.
>  Yes, it is an issue. Outbound dialing for telesales is brutal. The people saying differently are the ones that charge you $500/month to "manage" your Facebook campaign. They have a vested interest in making you believe you will get a 20% connect rate.
>  Now, FB leads are even more expensive to generate, so it hurts below average agents. The ELITE 1%ers can generate FB leads and call them to make a living. But, the other 99% are just wasting their money. I know this because I have agents every single day coming to me because of this. "Well, I saw so and so on social media and she seems so knowledgable. She is always posting. Her agents seem to love her program! So, I put $3,000 towards it and it did not work at all!" Social media managers just show you the ONE agent out of 100 that is getting FB leads for $6.22 per lead and closing some. They never show you the whole picture.
>  Yes, setting appointments for field agents has taken a slight "hit", but nothing major. Direct Mail often hits seniors that are NOT filling out FB forms. They are not getting blown up as much as the others. I helped an agent of mine in Virginia last week. She likes to set her own appointments, but she had an event for her daughter and could not dial. I told her I would help her dial, since we were working together to try to get her a big week. I dialed 17 leads, 5 answered, I booked all 5. That was from my cell phone (no local area code) and only dialing through them once. I could have easily gotten more by dialing through again later that day.
