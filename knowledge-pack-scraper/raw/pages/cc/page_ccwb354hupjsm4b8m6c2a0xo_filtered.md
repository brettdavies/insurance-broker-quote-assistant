## Which companies are not insuring Kias?

Allstate, State Farm and Progressive announced that they are limiting the number of new policies they offer for some Kia models.

These companies have not provided a list of models or years that they won't cover. But you may not be able to get a policy from them if your car 
doesn't have an engine immobilizer.

### How to protect your Kia from being stolen

There are a few steps that Kia owners can take to protect their car. These may also make it easier to get insurance, or earn you a discount on your insurance bill.

* **Get the Kia anti-theft software update** by calling 800-333-4542.
* **Install an aftermarket immobilizer kit.** This is the priciest option, but it will make it so your car can't be easily hot-wired.
* **Install an alarm system, or use a wheel-locking device.** Kia may reimburse you for these items. But you should call 800-333-4542 to make sure before buying an expensive system.
* **Install a car tracker** like LoJack, or hide an Apple AirTag in your car. This will help the police recover your car if it's stolen.
