The **Insurance Information Institute** (**I.I.I.**) is a [U.S.](/wiki/United_States "United States") [industry association](/wiki/Trade_association "Trade association") which exists "to improve public understanding of [insurance](/wiki/Insurance "Insurance") – what it does and how it works."[[2]](#cite_note-2) Founded in 1959, the organization is based in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City").[[3]](#cite_note-3) Since 1989 the I.I.I. has held [501(c)(6)](/wiki/501(c)_organization#501(c)(6) "501(c) organization") tax-exempt status (defined as business leagues, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and the like).[[1]](#cite_note-ProPublica-1)

The I.I.I. web site provides information for consumers, the media, researchers and the general public on a wide range of topics, including [automobile insurance](/wiki/Vehicle_insurance "Vehicle insurance"), [homeowner's insurance](/wiki/Home_insurance "Home insurance"), [life insurance](/wiki/Life_insurance "Life insurance"), [annuities](/wiki/Life_annuity "Life annuity"), [health insurance](/wiki/Health_insurance "Health insurance"), [long-term care insurance](/wiki/Long-term_care_insurance "Long-term care insurance") and [disability insurance](/wiki/Disability_insurance "Disability insurance"). The Web site also contains papers, presentations and factsheets that focus on financial results, [disasters](/wiki/Disaster "Disaster"), [climate change](/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"), and other key issues the insurance industry faces. In addition, a number of publications can be purchased via the I.I.I. store, including the *Insurance Fact Book*, the *Financial Services Fact Book*, *Insuring Your Business*, the *Insurance Handbook* and a wide variety of brochures, including "12 Ways to Lower Your Homeowners Insurance Costs".[[4]](#cite_note-4)

The institute's current president and [chief executive officer](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer "Chief executive officer"), Sean Kevelighan, assumed the post in August 2016.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Kevelighan succeeded Robert Hartwig, who had led I.I.I. since 2007; Hartwig left in order to become a faculty member in the [University of South Carolina](/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina "University of South Carolina")'s [Darla Moore School of Business](/wiki/Darla_Moore_School_of_Business "Darla Moore School of Business"), and director of the school's Risk and Uncertainty Management Center.[[6]](#cite_note-6)
