### Illinois Car Insurance Requirements

Under Illinois law, all drivers are required to carry minimum liability insurance coverage. According to the **Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/7-601)**, the minimum insurance coverage required is:

* **$25,000** for bodily injury or death per person
* **$50,000** for bodily injury or death per accident
* **$20,000** for property damage per accident

Despite these legal requirements, many drivers still operate vehicles without insurance. In these cases, victims must seek compensation elsewhere.

### What Are Your Options If the At-Fault Driver is Uninsured?

If an uninsured driver hits you in Illinois, there are several ways to seek compensation:

#### **Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)**

Illinois requires all auto insurance policies to include **Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage** unless explicitly waived in writing. This coverage helps pay for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering if an uninsured driver is at fault in an accident that injures you.

* **How Does It Work?**
  + File a claim with your own insurance company under your UM coverage.
  + Your insurance company will cover damages up to your policy limits.
* **Minimum UM Coverage in Illinois***(625 ILCS 5/143a)*:
  + $25,000 per person
  + $50,000 per accident

This coverage does not include property damage unless you have **Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD)** coverage.

#### **Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIM)**

While UIM coverage applies when the at-fault driver has insurance but insufficient coverage, some victims face uninsured and underinsured situations. If your damages exceed what the at-fault driver can pay, your UIM policy can provide additional compensation.

#### **Collision Coverage**

If your car is damaged in the accident, your **[collision coverage](/blog/2024/september/what-will-collision-insurance-cover-in-the-event/)** (if you have it) can help pay for repairs, regardless of fault. This is separate from liability and UM coverage.

#### **Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or Medical Payments Coverage (MedPay)**

PIP or MedPay coverage, if included in your policy, can help cover medical expenses regardless of fault. Illinois does not require PIP, but some policies offer **MedPay**, which can be an added layer of financial protection.

#### **Filing a Lawsuit Against the Uninsured Driver**

If you do not have UM coverage, or your damages exceed your policy limits, you may consider suing the uninsured driver for compensation. However, this can be challenging because:

* Uninsured drivers often lack sufficient assets to pay for damages.
* Collecting the awarded amount can be complicated even if you win a lawsuit.

### Consequences for Uninsured Drivers in Illinois

Driving without **insurance** in Illinois has serious consequences. If an uninsured driver is caught or involved in an accident, they may face:

* **Fines of $500 to $1,000** for driving without insurance *(625 ILCS 5/3-707)*.
* **Suspension of their driver’s license and vehicle registration**.
* **Additional fines and reinstatement fees** to get their license back.

Additionally, if they are found at fault for an accident and unable to pay damages, a court may suspend their license until a settlement is reached or payments are made.
