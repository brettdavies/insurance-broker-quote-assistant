# The Best Companies for High-Risk Car Insurance
Written by [ Jenn Jones ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/author/jenn-jones)
Updated Aug 13, 2025
Progressive, Geico and USAA are some of the best options if you need high-risk car insurance.
High-risk car insurance works the same as regular insurance, but it's for people with problems on their driving or credit record. Most companies will charge more or even not offer insurance to people they consider "high-risk."

More about Progressive
Progressive has some of the lowest minimum coverage rates for high-risk drivers.
You could pay even less if you can get some of its many discounts. If you get at least two kinds of coverage, such as home, auto or pet, with Progressive, you can get a [bundling discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundling-can-save-you-money-car-insurance "Bundling Insurance Policies Can Save 18% on Car Insurance"). You can also lower your cost by getting paperless bills, setting up automatic payments and allowing Progressive to track your driving with its [Snapshot program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review "Progressive Snapshot Review: How Does it Work?").
If you enroll in Snapshot, you’ll need to drive safely. Your rates could go up if you slam on the brakes often or speed regularly.

More about Geico
Geico has a large set of discounts on top of its lower-than-average rates.
While Geico’s rates are already on the affordable side for high-risk drivers, you could get multiple discounts, including ones for autopay, bundling and insuring two or more cars. If you’re part of a group that partners with Geico, such as a professional group, college, sorority or fraternity, you could also get a group discount.
Another way to lower your bill is by joining its [DriveEasy program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/geico-drive-easy-insurance-review "Geico DriveEasy Review: Is it Worth it?"). If you let Geico track how you drive, you earn a discount for safe driving every month. But if you don’t drive well, you could end up paying more.
If you pick Geico, you should be comfortable doing things over the phone or online because the company has very few in-person agents.
Geico’s customer satisfaction scores have also been mixed in recent years, but they improved in 2025.

More about USAA
USAA is one of the best options for car insurance for high-risk drivers, if you can get a policy.
To join USAA and get coverage, you need to have strong ties to the military.
You can be a  military member, veteran or eligible family member.
USAA is a great choice because of its cheap prices and high customer satisfaction.
USAA has extremely affordable rates to start with; you won’t find many discounts.
You could get a big discount by signing up for [USAA's SafePilot program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/usaa-safepilot-insurance-review "USAA SafePilot Review: Is It Worth It?"). It gives you an immediate discount when you sign up, and you can save more with safe driving habits. You'll also get some protection because your bill won’t go up if you drive badly.

## How to lower your high-risk car insurance rates
If you're considered a high-risk driver, your rates should go down over time if you avoid issues on the road. Events such as accidents and DUIs generally fall off your driving record after two to 10 years, depending on where you live.
But you can lower your insurance cost now by shopping around for the best rate, working to improve your credit and taking driving classes.
  * **Shop around:** Get several quotes. You may not have to pay a higher rate. 
  * **Take a driver safety or alcohol awareness course:** You could lower your insurance rate and improve your record. 
  * **Sign up for driver tracking discount programs:** Also called usage-based insurance, these let your insurance company track your driving and potentially give you lower rates if you drive safely. 
  * **Take advantage of discounts:** You can pay ahead of time, set up auto payments, bundle policies, sign up for e-statements and more to lower your bill. Talk to an agent to see which discounts you can get. 
  * **Increase your deductible: ** This can lower your monthly bill, but you’ll have to pay more if you're in an accident. 
  * **Get minimum coverage:** Get the lowest coverage required by your state or lender. The drawback is you may have to pay to repair your own car or be on the hook for more if you cause the accident. 


## How to get car insurance if you've been denied coverage
If you’re struggling to find coverage, you can apply for quotes from what are called [nonstandard companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/nonstandard-auto-insurance "What Is Nonstandard Auto Insurance?").
These are generally smaller and work with higher-risk drivers. National ones include:
  * [National General](https://www.valuepenguin.com/national-general-insurance-review "National General Auto Insurance Review: High Rates but Some Fantastic Discounts")
  * [SafeAuto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/safe-auto-insurance-review "SafeAuto Insurance Review")
  * [The General](https://www.valuepenguin.com/the-general-insurance-review "The General Auto Insurance Review: Last Chance Car Insurance")
  * [Dairyland](https://www.valuepenguin.com/dairyland-motorcycle-auto-insurance-review "Dairyland Insurance Review: Rates and Ratings")
  * [Bristol West](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bristol-west-insurance-review "Bristol West Auto Insurance Review")


  * [Acceptance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/acceptance-insurance-review "Acceptance Insurance Review")
  * [Direct Auto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/direct-general-insurance-review "Direct Auto Insurance Review")
  * [Gainsco Auto Insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/gainsco-insurance-review "Gainsco Insurance Review")
  * [Infinity](https://www.valuepenguin.com/infinity-auto-insurance-review "Infinity Auto Insurance Review")
  * [United Automobile](https://www.valuepenguin.com/united-automobile-insurance-review "United Auto Review")


Another option is to try to work with a regional company, such as  Mercury Insurance.
**If things are really bad, look at state-sponsored auto insurance plans.** Governments offer insurance for drivers who can’t find coverage elsewhere. While they tend to be expensive and don't offer great coverage, they can be a last-resort option that keeps you on the road legally.

## Frequently asked questions
### What is a high-risk driver?
A high-risk driver is someone who insurance companies think is more likely to make a claim or be in a crash than a typical driver. If you are young, have multiple tickets or accidents on your record or have let your insurance lapse, you're likely considered high-risk.
### How much is high-risk insurance?
Being high-risk could increase your rates by only 24% or, in some cases, you could pay six times as much. How much more you'll pay will depend on what makes you high-risk, how long ago the incident was and where you live.
### What is the best insurance for high-risk drivers?
Progressive and Geico are the best car insurance companies for high-risk drivers who want minimum coverage. Drivers with very bad records may need a nonstandard company like The General or SafeAuto. Or as a last resort, you could get a policy through your state's high-risk insurance plan.
## Sources and methodology
Information about insurance company products came from the websites of Progressive, Geico and USAA. Information on customer service satisfaction came from J.D. Power’s auto insurance studies from 2023, 2024 and 2025. Ratings of insurance companies’ mobile apps came from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
Rate information is from Quadrant Information Services. The average rates were found by averaging quotes from five of the largest insurance companies in the U.S. for all ZIP codes in the state of Texas.
Full coverage rates include liability coverage, plus collision and comprehensive coverage.
  * Bodily injury liability: $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident 
  * Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident 
  * Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident 
  * Uninsured and underinsured motorist property damage: $50,000 per accident 
  * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible 


These rates were publicly sourced from insurer filings and should be used for comparative purposes only. Your own rates may be different.
