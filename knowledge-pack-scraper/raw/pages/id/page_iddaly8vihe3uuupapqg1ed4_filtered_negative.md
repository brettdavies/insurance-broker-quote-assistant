You could pay even less if you can get some of its many discounts. If you get at least two kinds of coverage, such as home, auto or pet, with Progressive, you can get a [bundling discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundling-can-save-you-money-car-insurance "Bundling Insurance Policies Can Save 18% on Car Insurance"). You can also lower your cost by getting paperless bills, setting up automatic payments and allowing Progressive to track your driving with its [Snapshot program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review "Progressive Snapshot Review: How Does it Work?").
