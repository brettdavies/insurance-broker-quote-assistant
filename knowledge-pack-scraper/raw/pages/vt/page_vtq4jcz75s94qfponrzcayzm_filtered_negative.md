# Your Umbrella Insurance Policy Does Not Say What You Think It Says

Right? Except no one reads an insurance policy. I’m not just talking about Joe Six-Pack here. I’m talking about **you**, my dear reader: You, me, all of us. Why? Because our busy  and lazy lives don’t allow us time to do it. “Just give me the nutshell” is the mantra even insurance lawyers have in their personal lives.
In Maryland, [GEICO](https://www.millerandzois.com/car-accidents/insurance-claims-settlements/geico/) and [State Farm](https://www.millerandzois.com/car-accidents/insurance-claims-settlements/state-farm-claim-average-settlement-compensation-payouts/), in particular, write a lot of umbrella policies. Few of these standard policies have uninsured motorist coverage. But every victim that comes to us believes that they do.
Supporting her claim, the plaintiff cited Maryland Code § 19-504.1 of the Insurance Article. This statute requires an insurer to offer its insured, under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance (“PPMVLI”), the same amount of liability coverage for both claims made by family members and non-family members.
>  [W]hen the insured accepts a policy, he accepts all of its stipulations, provided they are legal and not contrary to public policy. Where changes from the application appear in the delivered contract, under a more stringent doctrine, the insured must examine it promptly and notify the company immediately of his refusal to accept it. If such policy is accepted or is retained an unreasonable length of time, the insured is presumed to have ratified any changes and agreed to all its terms.” Twelve Knotts, 87 Md.App. at 104, 589 A.2d 105 (quoting l2, J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 7155).
The full opinion [can be found here.](https://mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2013/48a12.pdf)
In [Bailer v. Erie,](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/md-court-of-appeals/1412414.html) a 1997 Maryland Court of Appeals case, the court looked at another umbrella insurance policy that provided coverage against false arrest, wrongful detention or imprisonment, malicious prosecution, wrongful entry or eviction, invasion of privacy, and so forth. I think it is worth talking about in this context to understand the limits of Maryland law in permitting unreasonable interpretations of umbrella policies.
This case involved an au pair who sued her host family because the creepy father was secretly videotaping her taking a shower. Erie denied the claim although it sounds like an invasion of privacy, right? Erie said the policy did not cover personal injury or property damage “expected or intended by anyone we protect.”
We can all agree that setting up the camera and filming the au pair taking a shower is an intentional act. The policy excluded intentional acts. Still, the Maryland high court found that the exclusion conflicted with the grant of insurance for “personal injury,” which included coverage for “invasion of privacy” claims. The court reasoned that under Erie’s interpretation, the exclusion would completely annihilate the coverage afforded under the policy.
So, ultimately, the court found it would be reprehensible not to provide insurance coverage for this reprehensible conduct. Ironic? Yes. But the ruling makes sense. The insurance company should be unable to give the insured coverage with one hand and take away the coverage with the other.
The court referenced its earlier decision in _Stickley v. State Farm_ case we talked about above which distinguished between primary auto liability policies and umbrella policies, noting that umbrella policies are not inherently subject to the same requirements as motor vehicle liability insurance. As a result, the Court affirmed the lower courts’ rulings, holding that the household exclusion in the umbrella policy is valid and does not contravene Maryland law, thus denying the claimants coverage under the umbrella policy for the accident in question.
