# Florida homeowners insurance

While Florida may seem like a tropical paradise, the state can experience torrential downpours and high winds all year round – not to mention all that [hurricane season](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-prepare-home-for-hurricane/) can bring from June to November. But there are plenty of people who love to call "The Sunshine State" home. According to The [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/FL/RHI725222), Florida's state population continues to climb at a steady rate -- up 5 % from 2020 to 2023. They also report that more than ten million housing units were built in the state of Florida in 2022, with almost 67% of those being owner-occupied. If you're one of the nearly seven million people who own property in Florida, learn how a Florida homeowners insurance policy can help protect your home and your assets.

## How you're covered

A typical policy in Florida may include the following [homeowners insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/):

* **Dwelling coverage (Coverage A)** protects your home's structure (roof, walls, etc.) and attached structures, like a porch.
* **Other structures coverage (Coverage B)** protects detached structures, such as a fence, shed, or detached garage.
* **Personal property coverage (Coverage C)** protects your personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics. Certain items, like jewelry, art, and collectibles, are often only covered up to a specific limit, so you may want to purchase an endorsement to schedule these items on your policy at the coverage amount needed, also known as "adding a rider."
* **Loss of use coverage (Coverage D)** may help cover costs associated with an increase in living expenses up to your policy's limit if you can't stay in your home while it's being repaired or rebuilt due to a covered loss.
* **Personal liability coverage (Coverage E)** protects you financially if you're legally responsible for another person's injuries or damage to their property.
* **Medical payments to others (Coverage F)** may pay for medical expenses due to a covered occurrence.

Keep in mind, coverage under your policy is subject to exclusions and conditions within your policy. It’s important to read your policy to understand the coverage provided.

#### Did you know?

Windstorms are not always covered under a standard homeowners insurance policy. Your Florida homeowner's insurance may also have a separate hurricane deductible, which may be higher than your policy's standard deductible. Check your policy for details about if and how your [homeowners insurance covers damage related to hurricanes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-hurricanes/).

### More ways to stay covered in Florida

In some cases, you can buy extra protection by adding coverage to your homeowners policy or purchasing a separate policy. If available, Florida homeowners may want to consider:

* **Flood**: Flooding is not typically covered under a homeowners policy. If you're concerned about flooding in your area, a [private flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) or [NFIP](https://www.progressive.com/answers/private-flood-insurance-vs-nfip/), where available, may help protect your property and belongings against flood damage.
* **Umbrella**: An [umbrella policy](https://www.progressive.com/umbrella-insurance/), where available, may help protect your assets if you exceed the personal liability coverage on your homeowners policy.
* **Sump pump**: Sewage back-up or sump pump overflows aren't typically one of the standard coverages automatically included with homeowners insurance. Adding [water back-up coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-water-backup-coverage/) as on optional coverage, if available, may help in the event of sewage back-up or sump pump overflow due to heavy storms.

## How much is homeowners insurance in Florida?

Progressive homeowners policies in Florida had an average monthly price of $206.13 or $2,473.54 for an annual policy in 2024.\*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. Remember that your [cost for homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-homeowners-insurance-cost/) in Florida varies based on many factors, including your location, type of home, and coverage limits, so that average price may not necessarily be what you pay for your unique policy.

## Helping you save on homeowners insurance in Florida

There are lots of Progressive [discounts on homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/discounts/) potentially available, including discounts for quoting in advance, [bundling](https://www.progressive.com/insurance/bundling/) your new home policy with an existing auto policy, and installing a home security system.
