Known for offering great discounts to new homeowners, Progressive also boasts strong financial health and high customer satisfaction. Its easy-to-navigate website provides instant quotes.
The mobile app also adds to the convenience of the digital experience for policyholders.
A standout feature offered by Progressive, unlike other mobile home insurers we reviewed, is its “single deductible” benefit. When you bundle mobile home and auto insurance, you’ll only have to pay one deductible for claims on either policy.
If a hailstorm damages your mobile home’s roof and your car, and you have a $500 deductible for both, you only pay one deductible, and the repairs for both are included.
Moreover, Progressive offers a discount when you bundle your mobile home and auto insurance together.
With Progressive, you can add an endorsement known as “trip collision,” which covers your mobile home and possessions during transit.

With a J.D. Power score of 868 out of 1,000, Foremost leads in customer satisfaction among the insurers we evaluated.
Foremost doesn’t offer real-time quotes on its website. Instead, after submitting the quote form, you can expect an emailed quote within a day.

Moreover, their replacement cost coverage for your home and personal property ensures that you receive new items of similar quality without any depreciation deduction.

Allstate offers standard mobile home insurance similar to other insurers, which includes actual cash or replacement cost for your home and personal items. The policy covers liability and guest medical protection as well. You can also add extra options such as water backup coverage, reimbursement for green upgrades, and electronic data recovery.

Hail, storms, and flooding are major risks for Texas mobile homes. With [PolicyOwl](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/policyowl), you can upload your current policy and instantly see if your coverage matches your needs.
## How to find the best mobile home insurance company for you
To choose the [best mobile home insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/best-mobile-home-insurance) and provider, keep these tips in mind:
  * Begin by selecting at least three companies from our extensive review and request quotes. Having several quotes will give you a better sense of mobile home insurance options and help you find coverage at a reasonable cost.
  * Identify the specific risks you want your policy to cover. Fire protection is standard, but if you live near water or mountains, you could face flooding risks. In some cases, you may need to get flood insurance separately.
  * Assess the value of your special or high-value possessions. Calculating their total worth alongside your other belongings will help you set the right policy limits and prevent unnecessary coverage costs.
  * Be sure to mention any upgrades, renovations, or significant alterations that could impact your mobile home’s value when requesting a quote.


Whether before or after asking for quotes, make sure to photograph and record serial numbers for your valuable items, appliances, and belongings you want covered. Keep these records in a fire-resistant safe or secure location to help with any future claims.

## Average Cost Of Home Insurance In Texas
None of the insurers we evaluated provide pricing on their websites, but we estimate that mobile home insurance in Texas ranges from $40 to $125 per month. This estimate is based on factors like your coverage limits, deductible, and selected options, as detailed below.
The [price of your mobile home insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/how-much-is-homeowners-insurance) policy in Texas is influenced by several factors:
  * **Replacement Cost:** The replacement value of your mobile home helps set your insurance rates.
  * **Coverage Limits:** The more coverage you need, the higher your premium may be.
  * **Location (ZIP Code):** The region where you live plays a part in shaping your insurance costs.
  * **Home Age:** The older your mobile home, the more it may influence your insurance premium.
  * **Deductible:** Choosing a higher or lower deductible will affect your insurance rates.
  * **Claims History:** Your past claims can impact how much you pay for coverage.


Every insurer we assessed offers a range of discounts for mobile home insurance, which may include bundling with your auto coverage.
## Do You Need Mobile Home Insurance In Texas?
It’s advisable to get mobile home insurance in Texas. Firstly, if you’re getting a mortgage to finance your mobile home, your lender is likely to mandate insurance coverage.
Next, whether you have a mortgage or not, homes throughout Texas are vulnerable to unpredictable threats from severe thunderstorms with damaging winds, hail, tornadoes, tropical storms, and hurricanes that can form in the Pacific Ocean.
In conclusion, make sure to consult your mobile home park or community rules to determine if insurance is mandatory for residents.
## What Does Mobile Home Insurance In Texas Not Cover?
Mobile home insurance in Texas usually excludes coverage for certain events.
### Flooding
[Flood-related damages are generally excluded from coverage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage). If flooding is a concern in your area, it’s recommended to purchase a separate flood insurance policy.
### Wear and Tear
Policies usually focus on unexpected and accidental damage, rather than the natural wear and tear that occurs with aging items.
### Earthquakes
Earthquakes may not be common in Texas, but typical mobile home insurance policies in the state do not protect against “earth movement” caused by seismic events.
### Business-Related Damage
When using your mobile home for business, damages tied to those activities may not be covered by a regular policy. In such situations, a commercial policy suited to your business may be necessary.
### Insect or Animal Infestation
Pest infestation damage is not typically included in coverage. Insurance companies expect homeowners to prevent pests as part of normal maintenance.
## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Cover?
The following protections are usually [included in a basic mobile home policy](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover):
### Dwelling Coverage
This part of the policy covers repairs or replacement of your mobile home’s structure if it’s damaged by any insured event. The coverage applies up to your chosen limit. You will also decide on a deductible, which is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before the insurer steps in for approved claims.
### The following events are usually covered:
  * [Fire](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-fire)
  * Lightning

### Coverage for Other Structures
This provision handles repair expenses for structures such as sheds, fences, or other standalone items when damage occurs due to a covered event.
### Liability Insurance
This coverage addresses claims if someone is hurt on your property and sues, or if you unintentionally damage another person’s property. It usually covers related legal fees too.

## Unique Considerations For Mobile Home Insurance In Texas
Similar to other coastal regions, Texas encounters a range of extreme weather events, including:
  * Wildfires
  * Damaging Winds
  * Lightning
  * [Tornadoes](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-tornado-damage)

## How To Find Cheap Mobile Home Insurance In Texas
For budget-friendly mobile home insurance in Texas, try to obtain quotes from at least three insurance companies. Rates may vary for standard coverage and additional options, so don’t forget to ask about discounts.
Nonetheless, we recommend not selecting an insurer solely based on their prices. It’s essential to ensure your policy has suitable coverage limits and to make comparisons on an equal footing.
