#  We are being dropped by Connect Auto Insurance thru Costco 
My daughter received a speeding ticket (16 over the limit) and after 5 years with no claims our family is being dropped in May. Four drivers and four cars. Has this happened to anyone else? Have you found other good options?

I work in insurance. Most carriers are being super restrictive about claims and tickets right now. 
I suggest finding a local broker who can shop multiple carriers and underwriting conditions.

Ironically a progressive ad right below this comment lol. 
I only shop them if my rate doesn't go down every year. But similar, you hit a plateau and realize the "incentive" rate they get people to join with has worn off and it's time to switch.

I shop around all the time but mostly switch between Geico and Progressive. When one raises premiums too high for no reason I go back to the other. Same with cable/internet.

No, but they jacked our premiums by over 30% this year, so we left. We've never had a claim, both have impeccable driving records, our cars are paid off & not really worth that much. We saved over $600/yr by switching.

I hate to be that guy but... 
You added someone to your policy, and in her very first term she got a speeding ticket >10 over while she's already a high risk driver due to her age. They are well aware she was likely offered traffic court and either refused it or this isn't her first incident, neither looks good on an already risky driver, especially for a low risk company like connect.

Happens often in the insurance world. The more tickets you have the bigger the risk. Shop around. Or have her get her own policy separate from yours.

This happens all the time. Your daughter is seen as bigger risk. She’s under 25 and considered a new driver and already has a speeding ticket whether it’s 5 miles over the speed limit or not. You could try getting her on a different policy. Definitely shop around.

Yup, they'll also drop you at renewal and deny future applications if you have a claim, even no-fault ones like a window replacement after a break-in.

It must be a sign of the times bc I got totaled by a hit and run about 8 yrs ago. Progressive sent out an agent to assess the damage within 2 days. 2 days later, they cut me a decent check that I was happy with and I'm still with them. My rate is only like $20 more per month than the avg in my area for full coverage so I don't think it's worth throwing away that type of service and familiarity for a chance to save a little. Just heard so many horror stories from State Farm, Allstate, and Geico that I don't want to push my luck.
