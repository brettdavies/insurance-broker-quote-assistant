## How Progressive commercial auto insurance works

Progressive commercial auto insurance offers protection for business-use vehicles, including [**liability coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/), physical damage protection, and specialized add-ons for hired and non-owned vehicles. Policies are designed around business vehicles’ specific risk profiles and usage.

One standout feature the company offers is Snapshot ProView. This telematics tool tracks driver behavior and vehicle usage, helping businesses manage fleet safety and potentially qualify for discounts. Fleet management tools through the program include:

* Near-live vehicle tracking
* Geofencing
* Trip reporting
* Safety scorecards

To simplify coverage management and reduce costs, Progressive also allows bundling with other business insurance policies. Whether you run a one-person handyman business or operate a fleet of box trucks, you can customize Progressive’s policies to fit your operation.

You can get an insurance quote online or through an independent insurance agent. In addition to quotes, the company can assist with state filings in select states and federal filings for interstate trucking, hazardous cargo, for-hire trucking, and for-hire passenger transportation.

### Progressive commercial auto discounts

Commercial [**auto insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) can help you maximize your savings on coverage, so it’s important to pay attention to what insurance companies offer.

With Progressive, discounts primarily focus on your relationship with the insurer and safe driving. See below for some of the discounts the insurer offers:

| **Business Discount Type**  sort ascsort desc | **Potential Savings**  sort ascsort desc |

### Progressive commercial auto ratings

Financial strength and customer satisfaction ratings are essential considerations when choosing a commercial auto insurer. Strong financial ratings indicate the company’s ability to pay claims reliably, even during widespread events or economic downturns.

Customer satisfaction scores reflect real-world service quality, including claims handling, billing, and support. These ratings help business owners assess an insurer’s trustworthiness, stability, and overall value before committing to a policy.

Overall, Progressive has strong financial strength, ranking just below the best possible score.[[2]](#cite-2) While J.D. Power doesn’t include the insurer in its small commercial insurance satisfaction study, Progressive has a high volume of customer complaints compared to other commercial insurers. Here’s a look at Progressive’s industry ratings:

| **Rating Source**  sort ascsort desc | **Score**  sort ascsort desc | **What This Means**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AM Best Financial Strength | A+ | Very reliable |
| J.D. Power Small Commercial Insurance Customer Satisfaction | Not rated | Not rated |
| NAIC Commercial Complaint Index | 2.95 | More complaints than expected |

## Progressive commercial auto coverage options

Progressive provides basic coverage options plus a few add-ons. But its customization options are limited compared to other commercial auto insurers. Coverage options include the following:[[3]](#cite-3)

  #### Liability coverage

  Liability insurance pays for bodily injury and property damage if you or an employee causes an accident while driving a business vehicle. You can choose split limits or a combined single limit. It’s important to note that commercial liability limits are typically higher than personal auto policy limits due to increased exposure for businesses.

  #### Comprehensive and collision coverage

  [**Comprehensive insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) pays for business vehicle damage caused by theft, vandalism, fire, or weather events.

  #### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage

  [**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) pays for damage if a driver without insurance or inadequate coverage hits your commercial vehicle. It can cover medical bills and vehicle repair costs.

  #### Hired auto coverage
