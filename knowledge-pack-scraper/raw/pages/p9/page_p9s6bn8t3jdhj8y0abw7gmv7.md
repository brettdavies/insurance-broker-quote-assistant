  * The insurer provides extensive vehicle coverage and several discount opportunities.
  * Progressive is financially strong and offers same-day policy options but doesn’t cover all types of specialty vehicles.

Overview
Progressive offers flexible and robust commercial auto insurance coverage for various business types. With options available for everything from contractor vans to tractor trailers, Progressive can tailor a policy to meet your company’s unique insurance needs.
Along with price transparency, it stands out for its fleet management tools and accessible claims process. Depending on your business type, the company states that average premiums can range from $257 per month for contractors to $1,041 per month for a for-hire transport truck.[[1]](https://insurify.com/business-insurance/commercial-auto/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
For small to midsize businesses, contractors, delivery services, and fleets requiring coverage, Progressive is worth considering.
Pros and cons
Pros
  * Covers many types of vehicles
  * Telematics-driven safety program
  * Price transparency


Cons
  * Some specialty or older vehicles may be ineligible for coverage
  * Few optional coverages available
  * Not available in Washington, D.C.


## How Progressive commercial auto insurance works
Progressive commercial auto insurance offers protection for business-use vehicles, including [**liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/), physical damage protection, and specialized add-ons for hired and non-owned vehicles. Policies are designed around business vehicles’ specific risk profiles and usage.
One standout feature the company offers is Snapshot ProView. This telematics tool tracks driver behavior and vehicle usage, helping businesses manage fleet safety and potentially qualify for discounts. Fleet management tools through the program include:
  * Near-live vehicle tracking
  * Geofencing
  * Trip reporting
  * Safety scorecards


To simplify coverage management and reduce costs, Progressive also allows bundling with other business insurance policies. Whether you run a one-person handyman business or operate a fleet of box trucks, you can customize Progressive’s policies to fit your operation.
You can get an insurance quote online or through an independent insurance agent. In addition to quotes, the company can assist with state filings in select states and federal filings for interstate trucking, hazardous cargo, for-hire trucking, and for-hire passenger transportation.

### Progressive commercial auto ratings
Financial strength and customer satisfaction ratings are essential considerations when choosing a commercial auto insurer. Strong financial ratings indicate the company’s ability to pay claims reliably, even during widespread events or economic downturns.
Customer satisfaction scores reflect real-world service quality, including claims handling, billing, and support. These ratings help business owners assess an insurer’s trustworthiness, stability, and overall value before committing to a policy.
Overall, Progressive has strong financial strength, ranking just below the best possible score.[[2]](https://insurify.com/business-insurance/commercial-auto/companies/progressive/#cite-2) While J.D. Power doesn’t include the insurer in its small commercial insurance satisfaction study, Progressive has a high volume of customer complaints compared to other commercial insurers. Here’s a look at Progressive’s industry ratings:

#### Liability coverage
Liability insurance pays for bodily injury and property damage if you or an employee causes an accident while driving a business vehicle. You can choose split limits or a combined single limit. It’s important to note that commercial liability limits are typically higher than personal auto policy limits due to increased exposure for businesses.

#### Comprehensive and collision coverage
[**Comprehensive insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) pays for business vehicle damage caused by theft, vandalism, fire, or weather events.

#### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
[**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) pays for damage if a driver without insurance or inadequate coverage hits your commercial vehicle. It can cover medical bills and vehicle repair costs.

#### Hired auto coverage
Hired auto coverage protects vehicles that you rent, lease, or borrow for business purposes. It extends your existing liability protection to that vehicle.

#### Non-owned auto coverage
Non-owned auto coverage applies when employees use their personal vehicles for work tasks. If they’re involved in an accident during a business errand, this coverage helps protect your company from liability.

[**Roadside assistance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-roadside-assistance/) pays for up to one hour of labor if a covered vehicle breaks down. Services include towing, locksmithing, flat-tire changes, fuel or fluid delivery, jump-starts, and more.


### Additional business insurance options
In addition to commercial auto insurance, Progressive offers several business insurance products, including the following:
  * **General liability insurance:** This provides protection against lawsuits stemming from regular business operations.
  * **Professional liability insurance:** Also known as errors and omissions insurance, it protects you against lawsuits arising from professional advice and services you provide.
  * **Business owners policy:** This policy includes property and liability insurance in one package.
  * **Cyber insurance:** Cyber insurance protects your business against threats to computer systems and data.
  * **Contractors insurance:** This protects contractor businesses against work-related accidents and lawsuits.
  * **Inland marine insurance:** Inland marine insurance offers additional coverage for tools and equipment that are lent, transported, or stored away from your business. You can purchase it as an add-on to a general liability or business owners policy.
  * **Workers’ compensation:** This provides financial support for employees who are injured or become sick on the job and also protects employers from workplace injury-related lawsuits.


Bundling these with your commercial auto policy can offer convenience and potential cost savings.
