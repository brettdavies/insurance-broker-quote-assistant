# California's Upcoming Changes: Auto Insurance Limits Set to Rise in 2025
Nov 27, 2024
Auto Insurance
![Rise in California auto insurance liability in 2025](https://cdn.stratospherewebsites.com/source/sites/676e33a4-7713-40b1-80ce-9530ce44ecdb/images/california-s-upcoming-changes-auto-insurance-limits-set-to-rise-in-2025.jpg?v=282020241120480384356)
As of 2025, California will implement new laws that will significantly increase [auto insurance](https://jackstoneinsurance.com/auto-insurance-brentwood-ca) liability limits for drivers. This change is designed to better protect consumers and ensure that those who cause accidents can adequately cover the costs associated with injuries and damages. For California drivers, understanding these new requirements is essential for maintaining compliance and safeguarding financial stability.
## **California's New Laws Around Auto Liability Limits**
Starting in 2025, California will increase its minimum liability coverage requirements. Currently, the minimum liability limits are set at $15,000 for injury or death of one person, $30,000 for injury or death of more than one person, and $5,000 for property damage. The new requirements will raise these limits to $30,000 for injury or death of one person, $60,000 for injury or death of more than one person, and $15,000 for property damage. This increase is aimed at reflecting the rising costs of medical care and vehicle repairs, ensuring that individuals have sufficient coverage in the event of an accident.
## **What Are Minimum Liability Requirements?**
Minimum liability requirements are the lowest amounts of insurance coverage that drivers must carry under California law. Liability insurance is designed to cover costs incurred by other parties if you are at fault in an accident. This includes medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage caused to others. It's important to note that these limits only apply to damages incurred by the other party, not to your own vehicle or injuries. Therefore, while meeting these minimums is essential for compliance, many drivers opt for higher limits for added protection.
## **Does Liability Coverage Protect Your Car?**
Liability coverage does not protect your own vehicle. It only covers damages and injuries that you may cause to others. If you want protection for your own vehicle, you will need to consider additional coverage options, such as collision or comprehensive insurance. Collision coverage pays for repairs to your car after an accident, regardless of fault, while comprehensive coverage protects against non-collision-related incidents like theft, vandalism, or natural disasters.
## **What About Uninsured Motorists Insurance?**
Uninsured motorist insurance is another important consideration for California drivers. This type of coverage protects you if you’re involved in an accident with a driver who does not have insurance or lacks sufficient coverage to pay for damages. California law does not require uninsured motorist coverage, but it is highly recommended, especially in light of the increasing number of uninsured drivers on the road. With the new liability limits coming into effect, having uninsured motorist coverage can provide added peace of mind, ensuring you are protected in various situations.
