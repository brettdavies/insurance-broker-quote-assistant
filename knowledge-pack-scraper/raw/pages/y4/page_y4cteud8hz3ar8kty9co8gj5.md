# Understanding New York’s No-Fault Insurance Law
Written By [Eric C. Nordby](https://porterprotects.com/author/ericnordby/)
_Personal Injury Attorney_  

[ Legally Reviewed By Michael S. Porter Personal Injury Attorney ](http://)
![](https://porterprotects.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mira-kireeva-GXA2XiAsko8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)
In New York, understanding the no-fault insurance system is essential for anyone on the roads. This system guarantees immediate medical care and financial compensation after a car accident, regardless of who is at fault, providing a crucial layer of protection and peace of mind for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike.
## What is No-Fault Insurance?
The beginning of no-fault insurance in the United States marked a significant shift in handling auto accidents. New York adopted this system with specific goals in mind:
  1. **Reducing Litigation** : To alleviate the court system by minimizing the need to [litigate fault](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance) after an accident.
  2. **Ensuring Prompt Treatment and Compensation** : To guarantee that individuals receive the necessary medical care and financial support swiftly.


## What are the Key Principles of No-Fault Insurance?
The no-fault insurance system in New York is supported by several key principles:
  * **Coverage Regardless of Fault** : Individuals are covered by their insurance policy regardless of who caused the accident.
  * **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** : This mandatory coverage is part of every driver's insurance policy, covering necessary expenses related to injuries from a vehicular accident.


## What are the Basic Coverage Requirements in New York?
  * A minimum of $50,000 for [PIP](https://porterprotects.com/how-the-no-fault-claim-process-works-in-new-york/).
  * Coverage for 80% of lost earnings from work, up to a maximum of $2,000 per month for up to three years following the accident.
  * Up to [$25 per day](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/06/complete_nf_forms_2021.pdf) for a maximum of one year from the date of the accident to cover other reasonable and necessary expenses.


## Who is Covered by New York's No-Fault Insurance?
No-fault insurance in New York [extends](https://nysba.org/legalease-if-you-have-an-auto-accident/) to:
  * **Drivers** : Regardless of who caused the accident.
  * **Passengers** : Ensuring they're not left out of coverage.
  * **Pedestrians and Bicyclists** : Offering protection even to those not in a vehicle.


However, there are clear exclusions. Coverage does not apply if the damages are due to:
  * **Intentional Damage** : Acts done on purpose to cause harm.
  * **Driving Under the Influence** : Incidents where the driver is impaired by drugs or alcohol.


## What are the Benefits and Limitations of New York's No-Fault Insurance?
### Medical and Rehabilitation Expenses
Under New York's no-fault insurance, a range of medical and rehabilitation costs are covered:
  * Hospital bills
  * Doctor's visits
  * X-rays and imaging tests
  * Physical therapy
  * Prescribed medicines
  * Necessary medical equipment


To claim these benefits, you must file a claim with your insurance provider, typically within 30 days of the accident. The [coverage is up to $50,000](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2004/rg041116.htm) unless you have additional protection. 
### Lost Wages and Economic Loss
If an accident leaves you unable to work, no-fault insurance can compensate for [lost wages](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ISC/5102):
  * It covers 80% of your lost earnings.
  * Payments are capped at $2,000 per month.
  * Benefits can last for up to three years after the accident.


#### Can You Increase Your PIP Insurance Coverage?
Yes. The basic no-fault policy in New York caps benefits at $50,000, covering medical expenses, lost earnings, and other necessary costs. If costs exceed this amount, you have options such as [Additional Personal Injury Protection (PIP)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2003/rg030138.htm), which raises your coverage limit, and [Supplementary Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (SUM) Coverage](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2004/rg040428.htm), safeguarding you against underinsured at-fault drivers. 
#### Coordination of Benefits Post No-Fault
Once no-fault benefits are maxed out, your private health insurance may take over. Here's how it works:
  * **Coordination of Benefits** : Your health plan may cover [remaining medical costs](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2004/rg040816.htm) after no-fault benefits are used up.
  * **Subrogation** : If your insurer pays for costs related to the accident, they may seek [reimbursement](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2008/rg080108.htm) from the at-fault party's insurer.


## How Do You Claim No-Fault Insurance Benefits in New York?
After an accident, your first move should be to inform your insurance company. This is crucial:
  * **Notify your insurer immediately** : Quick notification helps avoid delays in coverage.
  * **File within 30 days** : You typically have 30 days from the date of the accident to file a no-fault claim to be eligible for benefits.


Missing these deadlines can result in a denial of your claim. To start your claim, you'll need to complete the [No-Fault Claim Form (NF-2)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/06/complete_nf_forms_2021.pdf).
### Documentation and Verification
When filing a no-fault claim in New York, compiling the right documents is important. Here's what you'll need:
  * **Police Report** : Confirming the accident details.
  * **[Medical Records](https://porterprotects.com/how-do-i-obtain-my-medical-records-in-new-york/ "Medical Records")** : Documenting your injuries and treatment.
  * **Proof of Lost Wages** : Verifying income loss due to the accident.


These documents are the backbone of your claim, providing evidence of your accident and resulting expenses. 
## When is No-Fault Not Applicable?
### 1. Motorcycle Accidents and Pedestrian Incidents
[Motorcycle accidents](https://porterprotects.com/practice-areas/motorcycle-accidents/) are [typically not covered](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2022/isc/article-51/5102/) by no-fault benefits in New York. This is because [motorcycles](https://porterprotects.com/most-common-causes-of-motorcycle-accidents-in-new-york/) are considered inherently riskier, and policies are structured differently. Pedestrians and cyclists, however, do receive protection under no-fault laws if they are struck by a motor vehicle. 
### 2. Crossing the Threshold for Litigation
New York Insurance Law [Section 5102(d)](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ISC/5102) defines a _“serious injury”_ as one that meets certain conditions, such as:
  * Significant disfigurement
  * Bone fractures
  * Permanent limitation of use of body organ or member
  * Significant limitation of use of body function or system
  * Full disability for 90 days


Injuries that meet these criteria may allow you to pursue additional legal action outside of the no-fault system. 
## No-Fault Insurance Fraud
  * **Staged Accidents** : Deliberately causing a collision to claim insurance money.
  * **Exaggerated Claims** : Reporting higher expenses than actually incurred.
  * **False Medical Reports** : Billing for treatments that were never provided.


## How is New York's No-Fault Insurance Different From Other States?
  * **PIP Coverage:** New York offers $50,000 in PIP coverage, much more than states like [Florida's $10,000](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/). New Yorkers have better initial coverage after an accident.
  * **Serious Injury Threshold:** In New York, _“serious injury”_ is strictly defined, affecting when you can sue for more damages. Other states might be less strict, leading to more lawsuits.
  * **Property Damage** : Unlike some states, New York's no-fault law [does not cover](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements) property damage. This means that vehicle damages are handled separately, often through the at-fault driver's [liability insurance.](https://porterprotects.com/glossary/liability-insurance/)
  * **Motorcycle Exclusions:** New York's no-fault insurance doesn't cover motorcyclists, a policy not shared by all states. Motorcyclists must have separate insurance.
  * **Out-of-State Coverage:** New York's no-fault insurance includes [_"extraterritoriality,"_](https://www.jstor.org/stable/253661) meaning residents still receive benefits if they have accidents in other states. However, the exact coverage can vary based on the other state's laws.
  * **Interstate Considerations:** New Yorkers traveling or moving should know other states' no-fault laws. For example, Michigan offers [unlimited medical PIP](https://www.michigan.gov/autoinsurance/choosing-coverage/choosing-pip-med-coverage), unlike New York's limit. This matters for extra insurance when going out of state.
