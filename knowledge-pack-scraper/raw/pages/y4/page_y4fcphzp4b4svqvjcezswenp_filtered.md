### Cheap car insurance for new drivers at 30

| Age | Experience driver rate | New driver rate | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **30** | **$203** | **$309** | **52%** |

Experienced driver rates are for a driver who has been licensed since age 16. New driver rates are for a driver who has had their license for 1 month. All rates are for full coverage.

## How much is car insurance for a 30-year-old male vs. female?

By age 30, men and women pay the same amount for car insurance.

**At younger ages, men usually pay more than women.** That's because younger men are 
more likely
to engage in risky driving behaviors, like speeding and drunk driving, than women.

**But by age 30, men don't pay any more for car insurance than women.** The gap in rates stays narrow until drivers are in their 70s, when men start to pay more for coverage again.

## How to find the cheapest car insurance for a 30-year-old

Car insurance companies all charge different rates, so shopping around can help you get the coverage you need at the best price.

You might also get a lower rate by:

* **Driving safely.** Safe driving won't likely reduce your rate immediately, but it can help keep your rates from increasing over time. Your rate goes up when you get tickets or cause accidents. Safe driving helps you avoid these jumps in price. Some companies even have discounts if you go through a safe-driver program.
* **Bundling policies.** [Bundling your car and home](/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles") or [renters insurance](/renters-insurance "Compare Renters Insurance Quotes") is one of the best ways to save money on both insurance policies. Bundling just means buying both plans from the same company, and it's usually one of the best discounts you can get.
* **Adding discounts.** In addition to bundling, most car insurance companies have discounts that can help you get a cheaper rate. You might save by paying your six-month or annual rate in full, going paperless or not driving often.
