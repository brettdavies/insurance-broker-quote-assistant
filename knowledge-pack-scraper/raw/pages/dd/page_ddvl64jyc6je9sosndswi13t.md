*USAA is only available to the military community and their families.
With different companies offering such different rates, it’s important to [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from several companies before you decide which one is the best for you. 
Comparing quotes side by side is one of the best ways to get the cheapest car insurance rate for the coverage types and amounts you need. 
##  Car insurance cost by state 
###  The state you live and drive in can have a big impact on what you pay for car insurance 
  * Wyoming drivers pay an average of $372 a year for minimum-coverage car insurance, for example, while Michigan drivers pay $1,597 a year. 
  * In Maine, full-coverage car insurance costs $1,243 a year, on average. The average cost in Nevada is $3,439 a year. 


Even within these states, though, what you pay for car insurance can be higher or lower than the average cost due to other rate factors.

###  Why is car insurance so cheap in some states and so expensive in others? 
Car insurance companies often charge higher or lower rates depending on things like: 
  * How many claims are filed in a state or city 
  * How much those claims cost them 
  * Population density 
  * Accident and crime rates 
  * Likelihood of severe weather 


A state’s car insurance requirements also impact the average price of a policy. Some states require a lot less coverage than others, and that can help drivers there get a cheaper rate than they would in other states. 
Although there’s nothing you can do about the factors listed above, you can counter them by driving safely, avoiding claims and comparing quotes from several companies at least once a year.

[Young drivers pay the highest car insurance premiums](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-teens/) of any age group. This is mostly because insurers see them as a high risk due to their lack of experience behind the wheel. Teen drivers usually see their rates go down as they age and keep a clean driving history.

State Farm is the company with the cheapest car insurance after a speeding ticket, charging an average rate of $1,752 a year. This is just 9% higher than what the company charges a typical driver with a clean record. 
Company | Clean record rate | Speeding ticket rate | % difference

Progressive | $2,076 | $2,724 | 31%

Company | Clean record rate | Accident rate | % difference  
---|---|---|---  
State Farm | $1,608 | $1,848 | 15%  
Progressive | $2,076 | $3,108 | 50%  
Geico | $2,112 | $3,636 | 72%

##  Car insurance cost with a DUI 
**The average cost of full-coverage car insurance after a DUI (driving under the influence) is $3,891 a year.** That’s an 85% increase from what a driver with a clean record pays for the same amount of car insurance. 
Progressive is the best company for [cheap car insurance with a DUI](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-dui-car-insurance/), charging an average of $2,652 a year. It’s also the company with the smallest average rate increase after a DUI. Progressive charges drivers with clean records $2,076 a year, which means its DUI rate is just 28% more.

---|---|---|---

Farmers | $3,468 | $5,304 | 53%

Progressive | $2,076 | $2,652 | 28%  
State Farm | $1,608 | $3,900 | 143%  
After teen drivers, car insurance companies consider drivers with a DUI on their record to be the riskiest to insure. This is why drivers with DUIs pay much higher rates for car insurance than drivers with clean records do. 
Also, a DUI can stay on your insurance record for three to five years, and you’ll probably pay higher rates the whole time. 
If your license is suspended after a DUI, you’ll probably have to file an [SR-22](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/sr-22-insurance/) form with the state. The SR-22 proves that you carry the minimum amount of car insurance your state requires. You’ll need this to reinstate your license.

Company | Good credit rate | Poor credit rate | % difference  
---|---|---|---  
Geico | $2,112 | $3,408 | 61%  
Progressive | $2,076 | $3,624 | 75%  
Allstate | $2,964 | $4,860 | 64%  
Farmers | $3,468 | $6,000 | 73%  
State Farm | $1,608 | $6,480 | 303%  
###  Not all states let insurance companies use credit scores to set rates

  * California 
  * Hawaii 
  * Maryland 
  * Massachusetts 
  * Michigan

##  Factors that impact your car insurance cost 
What you pay for car insurance is based on several factors, including **where you live** (your ZIP code) and **the make and model of the vehicle you drive**. 
Other factors that determine your car insurance rate include your: 
  * Annual mileage 
  * Driving record 
  * Insurance claim history 
  * Policy coverage limits and deductible 
  * Age 
  * Gender 
  * Marital status 
  * Credit history (in some states) 


Car insurance companies weigh these rate factors differently when setting your quote. One company may see your age or claim history as being a greater risk than another company, for example, and charge you more as a result. 
This is why car insurance quotes can differ so much between companies. It’s also why comparing car insurance quotes from multiple companies can help you get the cheapest rate for the coverage you need. 
##  How to lower your car insurance costs 
Some of the best ways to lower your car insurance rate are to **look for discounts** , **raise your deductible** and **compare quotes from several companies**. 
###  Get discounts 
Qualifying for one or more [car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) can save you a lot of money. Some of the most common discounts reward people who:

  * Insure more than one vehicle 
  * Drive safely 
  * Get good grades 
  * Go paperless 
  * Pay up front and in full

Our team of insurance experts rated insurance companies based on several categories. These categories include average rates, discounts, coverage options, third-party customer service ratings and app/website experience. We weighted these categories based on what customers value in an insurance company. 
For third-party customer service ratings, we included Complaint Index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best. NAIC Complaint Index scores are used to determine how satisfied customers are with their claims, while financial strength ratings from AM Best reflect the ability to pay out claims.
