The average annual car insurance cost is $2,101 for a full coverage policy and $829 for minimum coverage.

What you pay for car insurance depends on several rate factors, including the car you drive as well as your driving history, age, gender and more. Car insurance rates vary widely by state and insurance company, too.

## How much is car insurance?

The average cost of car insurance is $2,101 a year, but **you’ll likely pay more or less than that based on where you buy your policy**.

State Farm charges an average rate of $1,608 a year, for example. This is the cheapest rate of the largest auto insurance companies we surveyed. You may get an even lower rate from regional or local car insurance companies like Erie and Country Financial.

USAA is cheaper if you or a family member have military ties. Its average rate is $1,320 a year.

With different companies offering such different rates, it’s important to [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from several companies before you decide which one is the best for you.

Comparing quotes side by side is one of the best ways to get the cheapest car insurance rate for the coverage types and amounts you need.

## Car insurance cost by state

### The state you live and drive in can have a big impact on what you pay for car insurance

* Wyoming drivers pay an average of $372 a year for minimum-coverage car insurance, for example, while Michigan drivers pay $1,597 a year.
* In Maine, full-coverage car insurance costs $1,243 a year, on average. The average cost in Nevada is $3,439 a year.

Even within these states, though, what you pay for car insurance can be higher or lower than the average cost due to other rate factors.

### Why is car insurance so cheap in some states and so expensive in others?

Car insurance companies often charge higher or lower rates depending on things like:

* How many claims are filed in a state or city
* How much those claims cost them
* Population density
* Accident and crime rates
* Likelihood of severe weather

A state’s car insurance requirements also impact the average price of a policy. Some states require a lot less coverage than others, and that can help drivers there get a cheaper rate than they would in other states.

Although there’s nothing you can do about the factors listed above, you can counter them by driving safely, avoiding claims and comparing quotes from several companies at least once a year.

## Car insurance cost by age

**Younger drivers usually pay more for car insurance than older drivers** with more experience on the road do. A lot more.

* The average [18-year-old driver](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-for-18-year-olds/) pays $2,673 a year for minimum car insurance.
* These drivers pay an average of $6,359 a year for full-coverage car insurance.

Teen car insurance rates are more than triple the amount a typical 30-year-old driver pays for the same amount of coverage.

### Car insurance rates for 18-year-olds vs. 30-year-olds

| Policy type | 18-year-old | 30-year-old | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full coverage | $6,359 | $2,101 | 203% |
| Minimum coverage | $2,673 | $829 | 222% |

[Young drivers pay the highest car insurance premiums](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-teens/) of any age group. This is mostly because insurers see them as a high risk due to their lack of experience behind the wheel. Teen drivers usually see their rates go down as they age and keep a clean driving history.

## Car insurance cost after a speeding ticket

**The average cost of car insurance after a speeding ticket is $2,591 a year for full coverage.** This is 23% higher than the average car insurance cost with a clean driving record.

State Farm is the company with the cheapest car insurance after a speeding ticket, charging an average rate of $1,752 a year. This is just 9% higher than what the company charges a typical driver with a clean record.

| Company | Clean record rate | Speeding ticket rate | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| State Farm | $1,608 | $1,752 | 9% |
| Progressive | $2,076 | $2,724 | 31% |
| Geico | $2,112 | $2,760 | 31% |

| Farmers | $3,468 | $4,584 | 32% |

## Car insurance costs after an accident

**Drivers with an at-fault accident on their records pay an average of $3,147 a year for full coverage.** This is 50% higher than what your average driver with a clean record pays.

State Farm has the [cheapest car insurance for drivers with an accident](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-for-bad-driving-record/) on their records at an average rate of $1,848 a year.

| Company | Clean record rate | Accident rate | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| State Farm | $1,608 | $1,848 | 15% |
| Progressive | $2,076 | $3,108 | 50% |
| Geico | $2,112 | $3,636 | 72% |
| Allstate | $2,964 | $4,704 | 59% |

An accident stays on your record for three to five years, and during this time you’ll likely pay higher car insurance rates.

## Car insurance cost with a DUI

**The average cost of full-coverage car insurance after a DUI (driving under the influence) is $3,891 a year.** That’s an 85% increase from what a driver with a clean record pays for the same amount of car insurance.

Progressive is the best company for [cheap car insurance with a DUI](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-dui-car-insurance/), charging an average of $2,652 a year. It’s also the company with the smallest average rate increase after a DUI. Progressive charges drivers with clean records $2,076 a year, which means its DUI rate is just 28% more.

| Company | Clean record rate | DUI rate | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Allstate | $2,964 | $4,680 | 58% |
| Farmers | $3,468 | $5,304 | 53% |
| Geico | $2,112 | $5,064 | 140% |
| Progressive | $2,076 | $2,652 | 28% |
| State Farm | $1,608 | $3,900 | 143% |

After teen drivers, car insurance companies consider drivers with a DUI on their record to be the riskiest to insure. This is why drivers with DUIs pay much higher rates for car insurance than drivers with clean records do.

Also, a DUI can stay on your insurance record for three to five years, and you’ll probably pay higher rates the whole time.

If your license is suspended after a DUI, you’ll probably have to file an [SR-22](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/sr-22-insurance/) form with the state. The SR-22 proves that you carry the minimum amount of car insurance your state requires. You’ll need this to reinstate your license.

## Car insurance cost by credit score

**Drivers with poor credit pay an average rate of $4,088 a year for car insurance**, according to our data. This is a 95% hike over what those with good credit pay for the same policy.

If you have poor or bad credit, get a quote from Geico to see what it will charge you. We found Geico to have the cheapest [car insurance for bad credit](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) at $3,408 a year, on average. This is 61% higher than the average rate it charges drivers with good credit.

| Company | Good credit rate | Poor credit rate | % difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Geico | $2,112 | $3,408 | 61% |
| Progressive | $2,076 | $3,624 | 75% |
| Allstate | $2,964 | $4,860 | 64% |
| Farmers | $3,468 | $6,000 | 73% |
| State Farm | $1,608 | $6,480 | 303% |

### Not all states let insurance companies use credit scores to set rates

These states currently ban the practice:

* California
* Hawaii
* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* Michigan

## Car insurance cost by model

Your car insurance costs can vary based on your vehicle type. Vehicles with higher repair costs or few anti-theft devices usually cost more to insure. The same is true of vehicles with higher accident rates.

Search:

| Model | Annual rate |
| --- | --- |
| Ford EcoSport | $2,761 |

## Factors that impact your car insurance cost

What you pay for car insurance is based on several factors, including **where you live** (your ZIP code) and **the make and model of the vehicle you drive**.

Other factors that determine your car insurance rate include your:

* Annual mileage
* Driving record
* Insurance claim history
* Policy coverage limits and deductible
* Age
* Gender
* Marital status
* Credit history (in some states)

Car insurance companies weigh these rate factors differently when setting your quote. One company may see your age or claim history as being a greater risk than another company, for example, and charge you more as a result.

This is why car insurance quotes can differ so much between companies. It’s also why comparing car insurance quotes from multiple companies can help you get the cheapest rate for the coverage you need.

## How to lower your car insurance costs

Some of the best ways to lower your car insurance rate are to **look for discounts**, **raise your deductible** and **compare quotes from several companies**.

### Get discounts

Qualifying for one or more [car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) can save you a lot of money. Some of the most common discounts reward people who:

* [Bundle multiple insurance policies](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/home-and-auto-insurance-bundle/) with one company
* Insure more than one vehicle
* Drive safely
* Get good grades
* Go paperless
* Pay up front and in full

### Increase your deductible

Raising your car insurance deductible lowers your overall rate. Since your deductible is what you pay out of pocket when you file a claim, make sure you can afford that amount before you change it.

### Compare quotes

Comparing car insurance quotes from a number of companies side by side lets you see which one offers the best price for the coverage you need. Use the same info for each quote so you can make the most accurate comparison.
