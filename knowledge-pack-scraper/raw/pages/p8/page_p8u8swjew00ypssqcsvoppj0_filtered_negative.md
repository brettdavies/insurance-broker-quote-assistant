*USAA is only available to military members, veterans and their families.
That's because full coverage typically includes [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"). These coverages pay to repair or replace your car if it is damaged.
**How to save:** You can save money by canceling extra coverage you don't need. For example, you may not need [rental car reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") if you have more than one car in your household and can share a vehicle while yours is in the shop.
Keep in mind that you may have to have comprehensive and collision coverage if you have a loan or lease on your car. And if you're in an accident, you'll have to pay for any damage over [your insurance limits](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?").
Young men typically have the most expensive car insurance rates. At age 20, men [pay about 8.5% more for full coverage insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Prices for Men and Women") than women of the same age. However, the difference evens out as drivers get older.
**How to save:** The best way for young drivers to get cheap car insurance is to [share a policy with an older family member](https://www.valuepenguin.com/family-car-insurance "Cheapest Family Car Insurance"). Doing so can reduce your overall insurance bill by 62%.
**If you aren't able to share a policy with a family member,[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") typically has the cheapest rates among national companies for teens with their own car insurance policy.**
Younger drivers can also qualify for [good student discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Good Student Insurance Discount: Who Offers It, and How to Save") or take training courses to bring rates down even more.
Drivers in the most expensive state for car insurance, Michigan, can expect to pay [four times more for full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#carbystate "Cost of car insurance by state") than people who live in Maine, the cheapest state for car insurance.

For example, there's a price difference of $283 per month between the cheapest and most expensive ZIP codes for [car insurance in NYC](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-york "Cheapest and Best Auto Insurance Companies in New York").
**How to save:** Although car insurance is just more expensive in some areas, you may still be able to find cheaper rates by [comparing quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online").
Keep in mind, the [color of your car](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/do-red-cars-cost-more-insure "Do Red Cars Really Cost More to Insure?") won't impact your insurance rates.

Adult drivers who recently caused a crash [pay 50% more for car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "Cost of Insurance After a Crash") than those with no accidents or tickets. Insurance companies consider these drivers high risk because they're more likely to be in a future accident.

However, you could find cheaper rates than you're currently paying by shopping around. **State Farm and Progressive tend to offer the[cheapest rates for drivers with a bad record](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record "Best Cheap Car Insurance For Those With a Bad Driving Record").** Auto-Owners and Erie also often have good rates, although these companies aren't available in every state.
Drivers with [poor credit or no credit history](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-auto-insurance-bad-credit "Best Insurance for Drivers With Bad Credit") often pay more for insurance. This is because insurance companies believe they're more likely to file a claim in the future than those with good credit.
California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan have [banned the use of credit scores](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates#check "/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates#check") to calculate auto insurance rates. If you live in one of these states, your credit score will not affect your rates.
**In the meantime, compare quotes from Geico and Farm Bureau. These companies have the[most affordable rates for drivers with bad credit](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-auto-insurance-bad-credit "Best Cheap Car Insurance for Bad Credit").**
The easiest way to [find cheaper car insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "Best Cheap Car Insurance") is to shop around for quotes from multiple insurance companies. Even if one company is charging you high prices, you may still be able to find a great price elsewhere.

Most car insurance companies offer [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to help their customers save money on their car insurance bills. Remember that the amount you can save and how you qualify varies by insurance company.
* **[Bundling](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"):** Get multiple insurance policies with one company and save 5% to 25%.
* **[Defensive driving](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount"):** Take a defensive driving class and earn a discount of 10% to 15%, on average.
* **[Good student](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Good Student Insurance Discount: Who Offers It, and How to Save"):** Be a full-time student with a GPA of 3.0 or better to earn a 5% to 25% discount.
For example, it may not be worth it to have [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance#need "Do you need collision and comprehensive insurance?") if you don't have a loan and your car is over eight years old or worth less than $5,000.
[Changing your deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-do-deductibles-affect-car-insurance-premiums "How Do Deductibles Affect Car Insurance Premiums?") can greatly impact the cost of full-coverage insurance. That's because your car insurance company won't pay you as much money after an accident.
For example, $50,000 of [bodily injury coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?") per person and $100,000 per accident only costs around $11 more per month than $25,000 of coverage per person and $50,000 per accident. But if you cause a crash and the other driver has $40,000 in medical bills, you'll be responsible for paying $15,000 with the cheaper policy. The more expensive option would cover all of the costs.
* **Consider a pay-per-mile program.** [Pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/should-you-switch-pay-mile-car-insurance "Should You Switch to Pay-Per-Mile Car Insurance?") uses the number of miles you drive each month to help determine your car insurance rate.
* * *
There are [six main factors that typically affect your car insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/why-car-insurance-expensive#factors "#factors"): your insurance company and coverage, your age and gender, your driving history, where you live, the car you drive and your credit score. Many other things help companies determine your rates, but these tend to have the biggest impact.
If you can't afford your car insurance payment or you think you're paying too much, [start by comparing rates from other companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/why-car-insurance-expensive#how "#how"). You might be able to get the same coverage for a cheaper price. Additionally, make sure you have all the discounts you are eligible for and review your coverage to make sure it's right for your needs.
