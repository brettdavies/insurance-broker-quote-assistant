# Past Performance No Guarantee of Future Performance Clause Samples
The "Past Performance No Guarantee of Future Performance" clause establishes that previous results or achievements do not ensure similar outcomes in the future. In practice, this clause is often used in investment, financial, or service agreements to clarify that historical returns, successes, or service levels should not be relied upon as indicators of future results. Its core function is to manage expectations and limit liability by making clear that parties cannot assume continued success based solely on past performance, thereby protecting the provider from claims based on unmet future expectations.

**Past Performance No Guarantee of Future Performance**. Risk. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Investing in securities involves risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. AS WITH ALL MARKET INVESTMENTS, CLIENT’S INVESTMENTS CAN APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE. BIP does not guarantee the future performance of Client’s account, promise any specific level of performance or promise that BIP’s investment decisions, strategies or overall management of Client’s account will be successful. The investment decisions BIP will make for Client are subject to various market, currency, economic, political and business risks, and will not necessarily be profitable. In managing Client’s account, BIP will not consider any other securities, cash or other investments Client owns unless Client has told BIP to do so in Client’s written instructions to BIP. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, BIP will not be liable to Client for any loss (a) that Client may suffer as a result of BIP’s good faith decisions or actions where BIP exercises the degree of care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances that a prudent person acting in a fiduciary capacity would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; (b) caused by following Client’s instructions; or (c) caused by the Custodian, anybroker or dealer to which BIP directs transactions for Client’s account or by any other third person. Federal and state securities laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and this Agreement does not waive or limit Client’s rights under those laws.
