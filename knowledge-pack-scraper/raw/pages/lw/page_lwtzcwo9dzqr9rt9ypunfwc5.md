# What Does Windstorm Insurance Cover?
![Man checking the roof's gutter for windstorm damages](https://www.dalyblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-Does-Windstorm-Insurance-Cover_-_-Daly-Black.png)
**If you live along the Gulf Coast, storms aren’t just a possibility — they’re a reality.****  
**High winds can tear roofs apart, topple trees, and cause devastating damage in a matter of minutes. Yet many homeowners only realize after a disaster that their insurance coverage might not be as comprehensive as they thought.
Understanding what windstorm insurance does and does not cover is essential to protecting your home, your property, and your financial future.
### **What Does Windstorm Insurance Cover?**
Windstorm insurance is designed to help homeowners recover from damage caused by high winds, hail, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
A standard windstorm policy will typically cover:
  * **Roof damage** : Shingles ripped off, structural compromise, or complete roof replacement.  

  * **Siding and exterior walls** : Wind-blown debris or direct wind force damaging walls and siding.  

  * **Windows and doors** : Broken windows or warped doors due to pressure changes and flying debris.  

  * **Structural damage** : Including attached garages, patios, and decks.  

  * **Personal property** : Some policies cover belongings inside the home if the windstorm causes an opening in the structure.  



While rain damage might also occur during a storm, it’s generally only covered if the windstorm first causes a breach (like a broken window or roof damage) that allows rainwater inside. Coverage can become more nuanced if the rain damage results from preexisting issues. This is one common exclusion in windstorm insurance policies — among others.
### **Common Exclusions in Windstorm Insurance Policies**
While windstorm insurance covers many losses, certain exclusions often surprise homeowners. Common exclusions include:
  * **Flood damage** : Even if a flood is a direct result of a hurricane, it is usually excluded unless you have separate flood insurance.  

  * **Negligence** : Insurers may deny claims if they believe poor maintenance, such as a rotting roof, contributed to the damage.  

  * **Pre-existing damage** : Damage that existed before the storm event is not covered.  

  * **Detached structures** : Sheds, fences, and other non-attached structures may be excluded or only partially covered.  



Homeowners often only discover these exclusions after filing a claim, making it crucial to review your policy carefully before storm season.
### **Special Considerations for Texas Homeowners**
Homeowners along the Texas Gulf Coast face unique risks, and windstorm insurance often plays a critical role in their protection. In many coastal counties, traditional homeowners insurance policies exclude windstorm coverage entirely.
In these cases, property owners may need to purchase coverage through the **Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA)**.
**The following are key points based on TWIA’s official guidance:**
#### **Eligibility Requirements**
TWIA policies are available to property owners who have been denied wind and hail coverage from at least one authorized insurer. The property must meet specific building code requirements to qualify.
#### **Coverage Limits**
As of 2024, TWIA provides coverage for residential dwellings up to a maximum limit of **$1,773,000**. This limit is reviewed and adjusted annually based on construction cost indices filed with the Texas Department of Insurance.
#### **Policy Coverage**
TWIA policies cover direct physical loss from wind and hail. However, they do not cover flooding, rain damage without an opening caused by wind, or damage due to poor maintenance.
#### **Annual Adjustments**
Coverage limits are updated annually to reflect changes in construction costs. TWIA policies may also include an **Adjusted Building Cost (ABC) Endorsement** , which automatically adjusts dwelling coverage at renewal to help maintain adequate protection.
### **How Much Is Windstorm Insurance in Texas?**
According to TWIA, as of June 30, 2024, the average premium on a TWIA residential policy is approximately **$2,300**.
Premiums vary based on:
  * Amount of insurance  

  * Construction type  

  * Deductible  

  * Optional coverages  



TWIA does **not** use credit scoring or territorial rating. Premium credits are available for homes certified as built to recent windstorm building codes.
#### **Deductibles**
TWIA policies require a deductible, typically calculated as a percentage of the insured value rather than a flat dollar amount.
Given the seasonal threat of hurricanes and tropical storms, securing comprehensive windstorm coverage is essential for Texas coastal residents. A thorough review of your policy terms — and an understanding of TWIA’s evolving requirements — can help you avoid unpleasant surprises when it’s time to file a claim.
### **How Windstorm Damage Claims Work**
Windstorms can cause significant and widespread damage. Knowing how to file a claim can make a critical difference in how quickly you recover. According to the Insurance Information Institute, approximately **1 in every 35** homeowners files a wind- or hail-related insurance claim each year — highlighting how common this type of damage is.
**Here’s a step-by-step look at how windstorm damage claims generally work:**
  1. **Review your policy****  
**Understand your coverage, exclusions, and deductible to avoid surprises during the claims process.  

  2. **Inspect and document the damage****  
**When it’s safe, inspect your property. Take extensive photos and videos from multiple angles and make detailed notes.  

  3. **File your claim promptly****  
**Contact your insurer as soon as possible — by phone, online, or through a mobile app. Record the loss date.  

  4. **Protect your property from further damage****  
**If needed, take emergency measures such as tarping a roof or boarding windows. Keep all receipts.  

  5. **Schedule inspections and cooperate with adjusters****  
**Insurers will likely send an adjuster. Provide your documentation and be honest and accurate in all communications.  

  6. **Track all communication and expenses****  
**Keep a record of all correspondence and receipts in case of disputes.  



Even when following best practices, policyholders may face challenges such as:
  * Low settlement offers  

  * Denied claims based on vague policy language  

  * Delays in payment or repairs  



Understanding your rights and obligations at each stage helps you avoid being taken advantage of when you need help the most.
### **When to Consult a Windstorm Damage Attorney**
There are times when hiring a lawyer is necessary. Consider speaking with an attorney if you experience:
  * A **claim denial** without a clear, valid reason  

  * **Disputes over repair costs** between your insurer and contractor  

  * **Unreasonable delays** that leave you financially vulnerable

### **FAQ**
**What exactly does windstorm insurance cover?****  
**Windstorm insurance generally covers damage to roofs, windows, siding, and other structural components of a home caused by high winds, hail, hurricanes, or tornadoes. Some policies also cover personal property if the storm creates an opening in the structure.
**Is flooding covered under windstorm insurance?****  
**No, flood damage is typically excluded. You’ll need separate flood insurance to protect against rising water damage.**Do I need windstorm insurance if I already have homeowners insurance?****  
**It depends on your policy and location. In coastal or high-risk areas, standard homeowners insurance often excludes windstorm damage — making a separate windstorm policy necessary.
