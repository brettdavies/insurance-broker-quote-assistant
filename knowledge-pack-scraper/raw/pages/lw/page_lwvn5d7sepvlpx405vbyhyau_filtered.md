## The best car insurance companies in Omaha

Bankrate reviewed average rates from Quadrant Information Services to find some of the most affordable car insurance in Omaha, [Nebraska](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/nebraska/). In addition to average pricing data, we also assigned each company a Bankrate Score based on a wide range of factors, including coverage options, discount availability, and third-party ratings for financial strength and customer satisfaction. Using these metrics, we gave a score to each company out of a possible five points.

Overview

**Why Auto-Owners made our list**: Auto-Owners is a regional carrier known for its affordable rates and great discounts. Policyholders may be able to build a more robust policy with endorsements for roadside assistance, gap insurance and additional expenses coverage. The company also won two [2025 Bankrate Awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/): Best Budget Auto Insurance Company and Best for Young Drivers. However, Auto-Owners is only available in 26 states, which may be a concern for drivers who move frequently.

**Why Auto-Owners may be the best for affordable rates**: Auto-Owners offers a lot of ways to lower your annual premium. Omaha drivers may be able to take advantage of discounts for bundling, paying their premium in full, enrolling in paperless billing and being a good student. Drivers with a good driving record will score the best rates.

**Why USAA made our list**: USAA receives consistently high scores for customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and tied for the 2025 Bankrate Award for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall. In addition to low average rates, USAA policyholders may save even more on their premiums with potential discounts for garaging a vehicle on base, driving infrequently and having family members who are insured with USAA. However, not everyone is eligible for coverage with USAA.

**Why USAA may be best for military-focused coverage**: USAA only sells insurance policies to active duty and retired military personnel and their eligible family members. The low rates and discounts can be passed onto future generations, even if they didn’t serve. Although USAA does not offer as many endorsements as some competitors, it does offer roadside assistance and rental car reimbursement coverage.

**Why State Farm made our list**: State Farm is one of the largest car insurance providers in the country by market share. Although State Farm’s average rates are some of the highest on our list, the carrier offers a variety of discounts, including two app-based telematics programs, [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) for drivers under 25 and [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) for drivers over 25. The company won the 2025 Bankrate Award for Best Auto Insurance Company for Safe Drivers. In addition, State Farm sells roadside assistance, rideshare insurance and rental car reimbursement for Omaha drivers looking for more robust coverage. However, gap insurance is not available from State Farm, which may be a drawback for drivers who lease or finance their vehicles.

**Why State Farm may be best for local agents**: State Farm has dozens of agents in the Omaha area, making it easy to touch base face to face with an insurance professional. You can ask questions about the many available State Farm discounts and endorsements and have a local point of contact to reach out to with any issues.

**Why Nationwide made our list**: Average rates from Nationwide are unavailable, but the company offers a lot of ways to personalize your policy. Plus, Nationwide has a pay-per-mile program in select areas called SmartMiles, which considers how many miles you drive each month when setting your premium. Nationwide scored below average in the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) in the Central region, so potential customers may want to speak with existing policyholders about their experience.

**Why Nationwide may be best for robust policy options:** Shoppers may like having  Nationwide as their auto insurance carrier if they value unique endorsement options. Drivers in Omaha can customize their policies by adding features like [accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/) and vanishing deductible, among several other options.

In fact, many drivers have a higher rate until their mid-20s, even with no tickets or accidents. The following rates are based on teens who are added to their married parents’ policy.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
