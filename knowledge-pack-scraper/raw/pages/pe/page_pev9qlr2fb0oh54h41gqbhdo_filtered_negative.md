No matter what type of car insurance you choose, you have a legal right to seek [compensation for your losses after an auto accident](https://illinoishammer.com/illinois/car-accident-lawyer/). The Illinois Hammer Injury Attorneys can help you protect your rights and get the money you deserve.
All vehicles registered in the state of Illinois must carry [liability insurance](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/auto-insurance-shopping-guide.html). This type of insurance protects you from financial losses related to property damage and injuries you cause others in the event of a crash.
* **Comprehensive coverage:** Pays for damage to your vehicle from a variety of sources, including weather, fire, theft, hitting an animal, and more
* **Towing:** Pays for the cost of towing your disabled vehicle
* **Uninsured motorist property damage:** Pays for damage caused to your vehicle by an uninsured driver
* **Gap coverage:** Pays off your loan or lease if the vehicle is totaled and you still owe money
* **Custom coverage:** Pays for any customized features added to a vehicle
If your vehicle is involved in an accident with a driver who has little or no insurance, you may be confused about how to pursue compensation for medical bills and auto damage. The skilled attorneys at [The Illinois Hammer Injury Attorneys](https://illinoishammer.com/illinois/) can answer your questions about your legal rights and help you recover what you’re owed.
