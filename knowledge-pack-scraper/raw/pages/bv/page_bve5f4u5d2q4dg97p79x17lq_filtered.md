## Is Progressive a Good Insurance Company?

Progressive is a giant in car insurance, ranking #2 nationally, as stated by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/research-actuarial-property-casualty-market-share.pdf) (NAIC), with a 14% market share. With its long history in the insurance industry and strong financial ratings, Progressive is in good standing.

A [review by the Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/insurance-services/progressive-insurance-reviews/#:~:text=J.D.%20Power%202023%20Insurance%20Claims,score%20of%201.97%20which%20is%20.) team gave the insurance company a 9 out of 10 after considering policy offerings and customer experience sources. The insurance cracked the top 10 (out of 130!) thanks to wide availability, diverse coverage, and a solid industry rep. You can choose from 38,000 agents for personalized service or go online with Progressive Direct for a streamlined experience.

Progressive favors high-risk drivers with competitive rates and discounts. Its customer reviews are mixed, and [J.D. Power scores 870 out of 1,000](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study). Meaning Progressive sits slightly below the industry average in overall satisfaction and claims handling. But with an AM Best’s A+ rating, it assures they can pay claims.

Pros:

* Unbeatable rates for drivers with a DUI, potentially saving you hundreds compared to competitors.
* Offer a wide range of optional coverages like accident forgiveness, diminishing deductibles, and rideshare insurance, tailoring your policy to your needs.

Cons:

* [Progressive’s usage-based program](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/snapshot/) (Snapshot) can offer discounts for good driving, but rates can increase by 20% for low-score users.
* Collision repair professionals surveyed by [CRASH Network](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) gave Progressive a C for their claims process, suggesting potential issues during claim handling.

## How Do I Contact Progressive Insurance in California?

There are a few ways to contact Progressive insurance in California:

* National Phone Number: They have a national phone number for general inquiries: 1-800-PROGRESSIVE ([1-800-274-4499](tel:1-800-274-4499)).
* Local Agent: Progressive has an extensive network of agents across California. You can find a local agent on their website: <https://www.progressive.com/contact-us/> and enter your zip code.
* Online Chat: Progressive offers online chat functionality on their website, which might be a quicker option for non-urgent inquiries.

## How to File a Claim with Progressive?

Nobody crashes hoping to use their insurance, but accidents happen. If you’re stuck dealing with a damaged car, filing a claim should be manageable. Here’s a quick rundown to make your claim for drivers with Progressive insurance:

* Secure the Scene (Safety First!) – Stay calm, call 911, exchange info with the other driver, and document everything (photos, videos).
* Contact Progressive ASAP – Call 1-800-PROGRESSIVE or use their app. They’ll need details about the accident, like the date, location, and other drivers involved.
* Know your coverage (Review Your Policy) – Understand your coverage limits and deductibles (the amount you pay out-of-pocket). Talk to Progressive if you need clarification.
* Work with your adjuster – Progressive will assign an adjuster to assess the damage and work on your claim. Be cooperative and provide any requested information.
* Repairs or replacement? You decide! – Choose where you get your car fixed (Progressive can recommend shops). Once repairs are approved, Progressive will issue payment (minus your deductible).

##### Note

The process seems overwhelming, but [Kevin Crockett](/kevin-crockett/) and his team of [personal injury lawyers](/irvine/personal-injury-attorney/) will fight to get you the compensation you deserve! This is a simplified guide, and you can Crockett Law Group for trial-tested legal advice specific to your situation.

## How Long Do You Have to Report an Accident to Progressive Insurance?

It’s ideal to inform Progressive about your accident immediately if you intend to make a claim. The accidents could either be:

* [Catastrophic injuries](/irvine/catastrophic-injury-lawyer/)
* [Traumatic brain Injury](/irvine/traumatic-brain-injury-lawyer/)
* [Burn injury](/irvine/burn-injury-attorney/)
* [Spinal cord Injury](/irvine/spinal-cord-injury-lawyer/)

Besides, the sooner you initiate the claims process, the sooner your vehicle can undergo repairs and you can seek medical advice.

## Is Progressive Good at Paying Claims?

Progressive maintains a high AM Best financial strength score, indicating its ability to consistently and dependably fulfill claims obligations. This suggests that while their satisfaction rating may have room for improvement (870 out of 1,000), policyholders can still have confidence in Progressive’s financial stability and ability to handle claims effectively.

## How Long Does Progressive Take to Pay a Claim?

The 2023 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study revealed that, on average, it takes about 23 days for an auto insurance claim to be resolved across the industry. However, as Progressive scored below this average, customers may experience slightly longer wait times for claim resolution.

Progressive may not be as swift in handling claims as some other insurers, but it is still within a reasonable timeframe compared to the industry standard.

## How Much Does Progressive Pay for Bodily Injury?

Bodily injury (BI) liability on your car insurance protects you financially after an accident and when others are injured. It covers their medical bills, lost wages, and legal fees, but not yours or your passengers.

To determine your net worth for insurance purposes, add your assets, such as bank accounts, retirement savings, and property like your home and car. Then, subtract your debts to arrive at your total net worth.

Aiming for a BI limit equal to this amount is wise, as medical expenses often constitute the most significant cost of a car accident.

California’s car insurance laws mandate coverage for all drivers, with minimum requirements in place, though additional insurance may be prudent. The state’s minimum liability insurance includes:

* $15,000 for bodily injury per person
* $30,000 for total bodily injury per accident
* $5,000 for property damage per accident

##### Tip

Increasing your auto liability limits can provide more comprehensive asset protection. While setting limits high enough to cover your net worth is advisable. California also recommends bodily injury coverage for uninsured and underinsured motorists (UM/UIM).

This coverage applies if you’re in an accident with a driver without sufficient insurance. The state suggests the following minimum limits for uninsured/underinsured bodily injury coverage (UM/UIM BI):

* $15,000 per person
* $30,000 per accident

### Choosing your BI Coverage:

Driving without BI can lead to fines and personal financial responsibility for medical bills. Progressive offers BI coverage and can help you choose the right amount.

* Consider state minimums, but aim for a limit close to your net worth. Medical costs can skyrocket.
* Review your policy for three key numbers: coverage per person, per accident, and property damage.
* Ensure your BI limits are enough to protect your assets in case of a lawsuit.

##### Tip

Need Extra Protection? For a net worth exceeding $500,000, consider an umbrella policy from Progressive for up to $5 million in added liability protection.

## How Do I Dispute a Claim with Progressive?

Like all insurers, Progressive Insurance must handle claims in good faith, following laws and making honest efforts to resolve claims. Unfair or malicious handling of a claim constitutes bad faith insurance handling. You can file an appeal, gather evidence, or seek legal help if Progressive denies your claim.

Progressive might deny a claim due to factors like:

* Lack of liability
* Policy exclusions
* Pre-existing damage
* Fraud suspicion
* Lack of coverage
* Failure to document
* Exceeding the statute of limitations

As a last resort, you can sue Progressive for breach of contract, with reputable lawyers helping you gather evidence and navigate the legal process. Seeking legal advice can help determine if the denial was justified or in bad faith.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Progressive Insurance

We want you to feel empowered and confident in seeking fair compensation for damages from the liable party. Below, we’ve answered some of our clients’ most frequently asked questions about Progressive car insurance claims. Please contact our legal team for a free consultation if you have additional concerns.

###### What is an insurance claim?

An insurance claim is a formal request you make to Progressive Insurance to cover specific damages from an accident. The insurance settlements may not cover all your damages and will depend on the policy limits and covered losses.

If you've experienced significant vehicle damage or injuries, filing a claim against the responsible party's Progressive insurance policy may be wise.

###### Can you file an insurance claim without a police report?

Yes, you can file an insurance claim without a police report, but having one can expedite the process and help validate your account of the accident. Besides, a police report ensures you're protected should any issues arise.

For minor [car accidents](/irvine/car-accident-attorney/), a police report may not be necessary, especially if no one is injured, the damage is minor, all parties are cooperative, and there's valid license and insurance information exchanged.

But under California law, as the driver involved in a car accident, you must submit a written report to the California Highway Patrol or local police within 24 hours if the accident led to injuries or [wrongful death](/irvine/wrongful-death-attorney/). Additionally, within ten days after the accident, you must inform the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if the accident resulted in injuries, death, or if the property damage exceeds $1,000.

When a police report isn't generated, document the accident thoroughly. Record the date, time, location, individuals involved, insurance information, vehicle details, and environmental factors. Additionally, take photos to support your account.

###### How soon can you file a claim after getting insurance?

You can file a claim with Progressive as soon as your policy goes into effect. Normally, at 12:01 am on the start date listed on your insurance policy documents.

There may be a waiting period for specific coverages, but comprehensive and collision (which would cover damage to your car) are usually active immediately. Double-check your particular policy or call Progressive to confirm if any waiting periods apply.

###### Does insurance go up after a claim?

Insurance companies typically consider several years of your driving history when setting rates—accidents, whether at-fault or no-fault, can impact rates. At-fault accidents generally increase rates, while no-fault accidents may also lead to higher premiums.

Comprehensive claims, such as for theft or vandalism, can also affect rates, potentially less than at-fault accidents. But Progressive offers [Accident Forgiveness benefits](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-accident-forgiveness/#:~:text=As%20a%20new%20Progressive%20customer,than%20or%20equal%20to%20%24500.), sparing you rate hikes for your first small claim or after being a customer for five years without accidents.

###### Can insurance deny a claim?

If your Progressive insurance claim was denied, understanding why is crucial. Common reasons include:

* Policy coverage limitations
* Late reporting
* Lapsed coverage
* Driving under the influence

To appeal, gather documentation and contact Progressive. If unsatisfied, consider filing a complaint with a reputable law firm.

###### Does Progressive cover rental cars?

Progressive rental car insurance and rental car reimbursement coverage are different. Rental companies offer the former, while the latter is an option for your auto policy, aiding rental costs during car repairs after an accident.

Progressive covers rental cars with matching limits and deductibles. For instance, if you have comprehensive collision coverage, it extends to rental vehicles, protecting against physical damage. Likewise, liability coverage applies when driving rentals.
