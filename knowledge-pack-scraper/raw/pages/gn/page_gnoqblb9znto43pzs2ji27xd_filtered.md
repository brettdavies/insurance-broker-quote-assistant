This form verifies that you have the necessary insurance coverage in place. If your driving privileges were suspended or revoked and you must carry an SR-22, you must maintain continuous coverage for the period specified by the court or DMV.

In this guide, you’ll find what SR-22 insurance covers in California and how it affects your annual premiums should you need one.

## Who needs an SR-22 in California?

* [Reckless driving](/risky-and-dangerous-driving-behaviors/)
* [Driving without insurance](/driving-without-insurance-penalties-state.aspx)
* Multiple traffic offenses within a short period
* If you’re involved in an accident and don’t have car insurance, the DMV may suspend your license and require you to file an SR-22

## How do I get an SR-22 in California?

Getting insurance in California involves purchasing a car insurance policy and having the insurance company file an SR-22 form with the [Department of Motor Vehicles](/MotorVehicle.aspx) (DMV)on your behalf.

Getting the right auto insurance:

* **Contact your current insurance company:** Many insurance companies file SR-22 forms, but keep in mind that your rates will go up.
* **Comparison shopping:** It’s a good idea to [compare rates from other insurance companies](/car-insurance-comparison.aspx). Tell them you need an SR-22 so they give you accurate quotes.
* **Meet** [**state minimum car insurance requirements**](/Articles/minimum-liability-car-insurance-requirements-by-state.aspx)**:** You’ll need to purchase minimum liability coverage with limits of 30/60/15.

Filing the SR-22:

* **Pay any associated fees.** Expect an SR-22 filing fee from your insurance company on top of the increased premium for your high-risk status.
* **Maintain continuous insurance.** A [lapse in coverage](/Articles/lapse-in-coverage-penalties-by-state.aspx) may result in the DMV suspending your license again.

Remember, an SR-22 requirement could lead to higher premiums based on your driving history. It’s important to shop around for quotes and practice safe driving to help lower the elevated rates.

You will need an SR-22 in California for a period of 3 years. This document proves to the California DMV that you are maintaining state-mandated coverage.

SR-22 insurance varies by state and the reason you need it. Usually, it’s required for three years but in some cases, it might be longer.

## How do I check my SR-22 status online in California?

You can easily check your SR22 status by visiting the official website of the California DMV and using their online services. Alternatively, you can contact the California DMV by phone to inquire about your SR-22 status, and they can provide you with the required information.

## What happens if I cancel my insurance?

If you discontinue your SR-22 insurance in California before the mandated period ends, you could face severe consequences.

* **Driver’s license suspension:** If your SR-22 policy is canceled, your insurance provider will notify the state. This typically leads to a suspension of your driver’s license since insurance coverage must be maintained for the mandated period.
* **Fines and penalties:** In some states, you might face additional fines or penalties for not complying with the SR-22 requirement.
* **Extended probationary period:** If your SR-22 is part of a probation period for a driving offense, canceling it might restart your probationary period.

## How to get an SR-22 removed in California

The most common [way to get your SR-22 removed](/kb/how-to-cancel-SR-22-after-3-years) is to wait until the required filing period is over. In California, the standard SR-22 filing period is 3 years from its filing date.

Brau explains that you should maintain continuous insurance coverage without any lapses. If you cancel your policy or let it expire, the SR-22 will no longer be valid. Wait out the required period. During this time, drive responsibly and maintain your insurance coverage.

“Check with your state’s DMV and confirm the exact duration and any additional requirements for removal. Some states may require you to submit a formal request or provide proof of good driving behavior,” he says.

“Once the required period has passed, ask your insurer to file an SR-26 form with the DMV. This form notifies them that you no longer need an SR-22. After your insurer submits the SR-26, check with the DMV to ensure the SR-22 is officially removed from your record.”

## How does an SR-22 affect car insurance rates in California?

The requirement of an SR-22 certificate can increase your car insurance premiums significantly. Most insurance companies consider drivers with SR-22 high risk, resulting in premium hikes.

Your [specific increase in rates will vary based on various factors](/Articles/10-factors-that-affect-your-car-insurance-rates.aspx), including your [driving record](/how-to-check-your-driving-record) and the reason for the SR-22.
