[Data show](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/upload/CDI-Fact-Sheet-Summary-on-Residential-Insurance-Policies-and-the-FAIR-Plan-v-011325-2.pdf) that California’s FAIR plan is taking on an increasing number of policies, with the percentage of these policies rising to 3.7% of the market in 2023 from 1.7% in 2015. In the top ten counties with homes at high wildfire risk, that figure reached 32.6% in 2023. And since then the numbers have only grown, with the number of FAIR plan policies rising by [23 ](https://www.cfpnet.com/key-statistics-data/)% between September 2024 and March 2025. [Colorado just launched its FAIR plan](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-launches-new-last-resort-homeowners-insurance-policy) in April as a result of homeowners finding it increasingly hard to get insurance as wildfire risks there grow.
> _It is important to note—and insurers often fail to acknowledge this when reporting rising claims costs—that insurance companies earn a significant portion of their profits by investing customers’ premiums and the surplus capital they hold. Instead of acknowledging the nature of the business model, insurers point to low “underwriting profits” or underwriting losses as a justification for rate increases. But since the underwriting profit excludes investment income it fundamentally misrepresents the profitability of the business._
> _As climate change gets worse, so does trouble in insurance markets, threatening mortgage markets and property values. In certain communities, sky-high insurance premiums and unavailable coverage will make it nearly impossible for anyone who cannot buy a house in cash to get a mortgage and buy a home. Property values will eventually fall — just like in 2008 — sending household wealth tumbling. The United States could be looking at a systemic shock to the economy similar to the financial crisis of 2008 — if not greater._
