## **Safeco rating:** 3.5 out of 5 stars

Safeco auto insurance, a [Liberty Mutual](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/review/liberty-mutual-car-insurance-review-213225343.html) subsidiary, isn’t the flashiest. But it might quietly reward you more than most if you stick around. Drivers who go multiple years without an accident or violation can unlock deeper discounts, deductible reductions, and even receive cash back twice a year. Plus, Safeco’s auto insurance rates are close to average.

If you’re the type to stay with the same insurer for years (and you’ve got a clean driving record), Safeco could be a good option.

*Learn more:* [*Most common types of car insurance explained*](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/types-of-car-insurance-175724082.html)

### Does Safeco offer accident forgiveness?

Yes. Safeco offers accident forgiveness for eligible drivers, though it can vary by state and isn’t available in California. If you qualify, your first at-fault accident won’t raise your premium.

Safeco also offers Small Claim Forgiveness, which means your rate won’t increase after a minor claim under $750. But this benefit is limited to one per policy term.

Additionally, you can earn a discount if you remain accident-free for three years, with even greater savings at five years.

Perhaps Safeco’s most interesting perk is its claims-free cash back program. If you didn’t file a claim during the entire six-month policy period, Safeco will cut you a check for 2.5% of your premium amount. The max discount is 5% per year.

*Learn more:* [*Is accident forgiveness insurance worth it?*](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/insurance/article/accident-forgiveness-163926085.html)

### Does Safeco auto insurance include emergency roadside assistance?

Yes. Safeco has optional emergency roadside assistance you can add to your policy. Coverage includes towing, flat tire changes (using your own spare tire), jump starts, fuel delivery, and lockout assistance.

Safeco’s roadside assistance doesn’t include trip interruption benefits (like hotel stays or meals if you’re stranded far from home) unless you have motorcycle roadside help. If that’s important to you, you might want to explore other options.

## How much does Safeco auto insurance cost?

Safeco auto insurance is slightly cheaper than average, with full coverage at $182 per month and basic coverage at $108.

Every state sets its own minimum coverage requirements, but these basic policies usually only include liability insurance — meaning they cover the other driver’s costs if you cause an accident. A basic policy won’t help pay to repair or replace your car if it’s damaged or stolen. That’s why Yahoo Finance recommends upgrading to full coverage if your budget allows.

### Average auto insurance costs for full coverage

A full coverage policy with Safeco costs about $182 a month — $8 below the national average.

### Average auto insurance costs for basic coverage

Basic coverage with Safeco averages $108 per month — just a few bucks below the national average of $113.

### Safeco car insurance discounts

Here are a few ways you might be able to save more money on a Safeco car insurance policy:

* **Bundling discount:** You could save up to 15% if you bundle your auto insurance with a Safeco homeowners policy.
* **Good driver discount:** If you go three years without an accident or violation, you could get a discount.
* **Superior good driver discount:** You could earn an even bigger discount if you haven’t had any accidents or moving violations in the past five years.
* **Multi-car discount:** If you enroll more than one vehicle on your auto policy, it could unlock an additional discount.
* **Safety discount:** A discount could also be available for having certain safety features on your vehicle, like airbags and anti-lock breaks.
* **New teen discount:** If you’ve been a customer for more than a year and renew your policy with a teen driver on your account, you can qualify for savings.

In addition to discounts, SafeCo also has loyalty rewards. For example, if you stick with Safeco for a year, you’ll automatically move up to Silver status. At five years, you’ll hit Platinum. Loyalty perks vary by state, but long-time customers may unlock guaranteed renewal or extra protection benefits.

## How to file a claim with Safeco

If you’ve been in an accident or your car’s been damaged, Safeco makes it pretty easy to file a claim. Here’s what to do:

1. **Start your claim online or in the Safeco app:** You can file 24/7 through your online account or the Safeco mobile app. You’ll need to share what happened, describe the damage, and upload photos if possible. If you need a rental while your car is in the shop, and you have loss-of-use coverage, you can schedule one during this step. *Note:* *If your claim is for broken glass only, Safeco will route you to Safelite so they can handle it directly.*
2. **Choose a repair shop:** Safeco has a preferred repair network, which streamlines the process. The shops in the network work directly with Safeco to handle the estimate, repairs, and payment. If you prefer to use your own shop, you can — but you may need to submit photos of the damage or get your own estimate.
3. **Get an inspection and start repairs:** Safeco will review the estimate and confirm next steps. If your car is repairable, you’ll schedule the work. If it’s declared a total loss, Safeco will pay you for the actual cash value of the vehicle.
4. **If another vehicle was involved, Safeco will investigate:** They’ll figure out who’s at fault and determine whether your policy covers the other party’s repairs.
5. **Get paid:** If you use a shop in Safeco’s repair network, you’ll get paid directly. If not, you’ll receive a payment digitally or via check in the mail. Then, you can use that money to pay for the repairs yourself.

### How long do I have to submit claims to Safeco?

Safeco encourages you to file your claim as soon as possible, but its website doesn’t give a hard deadline. Generally, your car insurance company should be the second place you notify after 911 (if needed).

### How fast does Safeco pay auto insurance claims?

Overall, this depends on the payment method you choose and how complicated your claim is. If you're going the digital route, you could get money sent to your debit card or PayPal account within minutes of your claim being approved. You can also get it via direct deposit in one to two days or mailed check within a week. Just make sure your personal info (like your current address) in the claim file is correct, so you don’t hit any snags that delay the process.

## Safeco’s mobile app

The Safeco Mobile app is available on Android and iOS. You can use the app to fully manage your auto insurance policy, including grabbing digital ID cards, paying your premium, filing and tracking a claim, and calling for roadside assistance.

Safeco mobile app ratings:

* **Apple App Store:** 4.8 out of 5 stars
* **Google Play Store:** 4.7 out of 5 stars

## Safeco auto insurance FAQs

### How does Safeco pay claims?

Safeco can send payments a few different ways, depending on your preference. Digital payments to a debit card or PayPal are usually the fastest — sometimes within minutes once your claim is approved. Direct deposit to your bank account can take a day or two, while a paper check in the mail could take up to a week.

### Can I access my documents through Safeco?

Yes. You can log into your Safeco account online or use the mobile app to pull up your policy documents, ID cards, and billing info at any time. You can even save your ID card to your phone’s digital wallet for quick access on the go.

### How do I contact Safeco Insurance for claims?

You can file a claim 24/7 through Safeco’s website or mobile app. If you prefer to talk to someone, you can call the claims line at 1-800-332-3226 to get started with an agent.

### Is Safeco Insurance good or bad?

It depends on what you’re looking for. Safeco’s rates are close to average, and it seems best for customers with clean driving records who are willing to stick with Safeco long enough to use perks like accident forgiveness, cashback for claims-free driving, and loyalty rewards.

## Methodology

### Auto insurance ratings

We researched the coverage details and prices for 13 auto insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each auto insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best auto insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated.

**Coverage types: 20% of score.** We examined all the coverage options available, and assessed whether each insurer offered the following: new car replacement (5%), GAP insurance (5%), accident forgiveness (5%), and diminishing deductible (5%).

**Average cost: 40% of score**. The average cost was generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and includes more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. These estimates are for policies with full coverage for the average policyholder who owns one car. Average policyholder here is defined as a 48-year-old driver, driving a 13-year-old car, in an average-income ZIP code with full coverage.

**Customer satisfaction: 30% of score.** We factored in information from three major sources: 1) National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaints (10%), in which we took the total number of complaints each company had over a three-year period (2022-2024), 2) CRASH scores (10%) from the Crash Network which share how well each company ensures quality repairs and customer service, and 3) J.D. Power scores (10%) from the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Discounts: 10% of score.** We gave points for each type of discount that each auto insurer offers.

All app ratings were accurate at the time of publication.

### Auto insurance pricing data

Unless stated otherwise, the estimates above are provided by Savvy Insurance Solutions (“Savvy”). Savvy operates a marketplace for home and auto insurance, plus an agency licensed in all 50 states. Estimates are generated using Savvy’s in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and include more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Savvy’s nationwide data set. This includes data from more than 2 million insurance accounts connected through Trellis Connect, an in-house technology allowing consumers to “link” their insurance accounts before searching for insurance, and tens of thousands of policies bound by Savvy’s own agents. It takes into account a myriad of factors to create predictions, such as:

* Policyholder age
* Number of vehicles
* ZIP code
* Vehicle age
* Insurer
* …and more

Savvy creates estimates by running models against multiple inputs to the parameters of interest. For instance, the “teen driver” estimates were created by adjusting the policyholder age input into the pricing model while keeping all other variables steady from the baseline for “full coverage.” The models enable hyper-personalized estimates that take into account a plethora of user attribute permutations (e.g., teen drivers in specific states, teen drivers with new vehicles, teen drivers in specific states with new vehicles) to provide individuals with a unique and tailored experience. The charts above are a subset of the kinds of personalization Savvy can do.

### Definitions

The following are definitions used by Savvy when providing its rate estimates for various types of coverage.

**Full coverage car insurance:** A policy with comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage.

**Average policyholder:** A 48-year-old driver who owns a 13-year-old vehicle and lives in an average-income ZIP code.

**Senior driver:** A 70-year-old policyholder with full coverage car insurance.

**Good driver:** Drivers across all coverage types, vehicle types, and locations who have no tickets, accidents or DUIs.
