So, both your driving behavior and your claims history play a role in determining your insurance rates. In fact, insurance companies look at 3-year history, which shows that a strong insurance record can even help you secure better coverage at a lower cost.
## The Role of Your Driving History in Car Insurance
Your driving record correlates to risk. For example, a clean driving record shows that you’re less likely to file an insurance claim. Any traffic violations on your driving record correlate to higher chances of [filing a car insurance claim](https://www.carinsurance.org/filing-a-car-insurance-claim-after-an-accident/ "filing a car insurance claim"). Most driving infractions have an impact on car insurance rates. For example, DUIs drive up your insurance rates by 72%.
![Allstate Site Screenshot: Cheap Car Insurance Companies That Only Look Back 3 Years](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201716%20712'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Each state handles DUI differently, but car insurance companies across the United States increase car insurance rates if you have a DUI on your driving record. Expect your insurance rates to look similar when you have multiple speeding tickets, reckless driving violations, and accidents. Drivers with too many infractions are considered high-risk.

## Common Traits of High-Risk Drivers
Too many driving violations or accidents place you in a high-risk pool. Some states require you to get an SR-22 (SR-50 in Indiana) when you are listed as a high-risk driver. If you need car insurance with a claims history, Florida and Virginia, both have FR-44 for high-risk drivers who have been convicted of a DUI.

Your high-risk driving status can last up to three years under SR-22. If you’re still considered a high-risk driver after that, you’ll have to reapply for SR-22 certification. Drivers who don’t get SR-22 certified could lose their car insurance coverage, and the insurance company can report their uninsured status to the state DMV.
