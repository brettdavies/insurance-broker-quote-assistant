On another thread one poster commented how cheap his auto insurance is in Texas. The state minimum is 30/60/30. So that's what he has. I told him it was woefully inadequate. But he said he had "money in the bank" if the accident goes over these limits.
That's been one of the most stupid things I have ever heard.
So he will not pay a couple of hundred more to protect his savings account.
Great for California for mandating higher limits. And yes you will now pay more.

I really appreciate this! I will be looking into increasing my coverage! Not trying to be cheap, definitely trying to be protected, I was just met with shock from all of my peers when I told them so that triggered me to think something was wrong. Now I know what actually is wrong is my minimum liability 😬

They’re now covering you for twice the bodily Injury coverage and triple the property damage coverage. Sad thing is, you’re still very underinsured.

If $229/month was for minimum coverage it would not surprise me that your bill jumped that much for decent coverage.
I have shopped around before, and GEICO is still the cheapest and best insurer for claims from my experience.

Update: I checked my coverage and after some research, I don’t think I actually have the bare minimum coverage for CA?
300k/500k - bodily injury liability 100k - property 300k/500k - uninsured motorist
Now I’m curious if the above is adequate coverage. I definitely don’t want to skimp out on coverage. I drive a ton.

100k property damage coverage is a little low, imo. The average price of a new car is around $50,000 these days. You might benefit from an umbrella policy, especially if there’s a bundling discount, you could end up with significantly more coverage for very little extra out of pocket.

You will never get a guarantee premium, every policy has some fluctuation and renews every 6 months to a year. Very little reason to assume one will increase more than the other, I would simply make sure everything is good with the quote.

You might be able to answer your own question here. May I ask - how did CA SB 1107 affect your coverages? What were they before and what are they now?

Just jump insurers every 6/12 months. It's the cheapest way.

Switch to progressive. If it goes higher switch again. The "loyalty" discount is probably no more than 7%. Just be leary of any insurance agent saying you policy will go down after a certain time. That just not the reality of insurance right now

Two things that might help (does with State Farm) is taking an online safe driver course ($15 & 8 hours total) and putting the tracking widget in your vehicle which is synced to your phone. From SF that got me a 15% discount. You want a widget/phone tracker, not just a phone tracker (there's a USPS driver having issues with Progressive because it's all start/stop driving). Best of luck.

My insurance was due 3 weeks ago. I went and saw my agent to ask why it was so high. My vehicles are all over 20 years old. We tried to get a hold of insurance company yeah 2 hours later still no person. She said let me run some more rates. It went from over 2,000 to 900. Same exact coverage as old policy. Shop around.

I've tried 2 insurers (in Michigan). Liberty mutual jacked up rates after 1 year. Progressive has generally slowly increased rates on me, but still significantly lower than other options.

Well if you want to keep paying more even though you’ve found a lower rate, idk what to tell you. If the savings aren’t significant, then stay. Only you know what you can afford. An independent agent can also give you quotes to help you make your best decision.
