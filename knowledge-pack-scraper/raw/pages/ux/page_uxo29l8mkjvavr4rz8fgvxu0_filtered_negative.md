"Full coverage" isn’t exactly a real thing. People often assume it means they’re completely protected, but it’s more complex than that. Full coverage typically includes both [comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) and [collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/), but people don’t realize it also involves extras like rental car coverage and roadside assistance, which you pay extra for."

Remember that the cheapest car insurance may not always be the best option. Take a look at the 2025 results of [The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) to see which companies deliver the highest levels of service and satisfaction to their customers. We've provided a brief overview of the top contenders below.
While [USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) is only available to military members and their families, this company is renowned for its customer service and came in first place for auto insurance in The Zebra's customer satisfaction survey. We also found it has the second-cheapest average rate for full coverage.
[Erie](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/erie-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) is a regional insurance company that serves the Northeast and Midwest, but it could be a great option if it's available for you. While finding affordable car insurance for teen drivers is always a challenge, our data indicates Erie is cheaper than many of its competitors. The company also has a great reputation for good customer service, coming in seventh place in The Zebra's customer satisfaction survey for auto insurance.
With coverage available in every state, [State Farm](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) came in first place for claim satisfaction in our customer satisfaction survey. For those who prefer personalized service, State Farm also has local agents available to help you with your car insurance policy.

Comprehensive Insurance | Collision Insurance | Liability Insurance
---|---|---|---
Coverage  |  **Covers damages to your vehicle caused by incidents other than collisions** (e.g. theft, vandalism, natural disasters, fire, falling objects, animal damage or collision, civil disturbances).  |  **Covers damages to your vehicle resulting from a collision** with another vehicle, an (e.g. a tree, guardrail, or pole), or if your car rolls over*.  |  **Covers the costs of damages and injuries you cause to other drivers, passengers, and property owners when you’re in an at-fault accident**(e.g. medical bills, lost wages, property replacement)
Typical Deductible  |  **$500-$1,000** |  **$500-$1,000** |  **$0** (typically covered up to your chosen policy limit)
Risk of Rate Increase After Filing a Claim  |  **Low**. Many auto insurance companies don't view comprehensive claims as a result of driver error.  |  **High**. Most collision claims are seen as at-fault accidents. [Rate penalties can last three to five years](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) |  **High**. Most liability claims occur when you’re at fault in an accident. Rate penalties can last up to three years.
*If you have uninsured motorist coverage on your policy, you can use the property damage portion of this coverage rather than collision. We recommend you carry uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to cover collisions involving uninsured drivers.

If you noticed the cost of your insurance go up in the past year, you're not alone. According to our data, 43% of The Zebra's customers say they're paying too much for auto insurance. Rates in 2024 increased by over 20% year-over-year.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/best-full-coverage-auto-insurance/#footnote-1) It's more important than ever to compare rates, shop around, and check for discounts. Remember that rate increases aren't always related to you as a driver; sometimes, it is simply a business decision that reflects the current economy.
Full coverage is typically required if you're leasing or [financing](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-financed-vehicle/) a vehicle, and our data shows that around 41% of drivers fully own their vehicles. If you don't own the vehicle outright, then ensuring comprehensive protection is essential. Lenders often mandate full coverage to safeguard their investment, sometimes referred to as "force-placed" or "[collateral protection"](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collateral-protection/) insurance.
###  [How to Find the Best Car Insurance Discounts | The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/)
If you're looking to save the most on full coverage, consider lowering your liability limits to your state's minimum required amount to offset the cost of comp and collision. Keep in mind: your location, vehicle, age, and driving record will impact your car insurance rate.

[Gap insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/) comes into play when there's a gap between the value of your totaled vehicle and what you still owe on a loan. It's particularly useful for newer or high-value vehicles. To have gap coverage, you typically need both collision and comprehensive coverage. It might be included in your lease agreement if you're leasing a vehicle, but confirming that your insurance covers it is crucial.
