Allstate and GEICO are two of the four largest insurance companies in the United States by market share, in fourth and third place, respectively.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-1) They both offer a range of coverages and discounts on their car insurance policies as well as flexible purchase options.
Depending on your needs and circumstances, one company may be a better choice for you than the other. For example, GEICO tends to have cheaper rates for most drivers and ranks better for customer service in some regions while Allstate is better for customer experience in other regions and also underwrites its own home insurance policies (unlike GEICO).
Here’s an overview of how Allstate and GEICO compare across several key categories to help as you weigh your options.

Which Auto Insurance Is Better?
## Allstate vs. GEICO Average Cost Comparison
Allstate tends to be more expensive than its main competitors when looking at average costs for various coverage levels and driver profiles while GEICO tends to be one of the cheapest. So, it comes as no surprise that our data shows that GEICO beats Allstate on price across the board. Remember, these rates are averages, so the premiums you’re quoted may differ.
Company | Allstate | GEICO | National Average
---|---|---|---
**Full coverage** | $2,605 | $1,731 | $2,399
**Minimum coverage** | $840 | $517 | $635
**25-year-old drivers** | $3,722 | $2,172 | $2,113
**Senior drivers** | $2,782 | $1,664 | $1,602
**Speeding ticket** | $3,428 | $2,358 | $2,511
**Accident** | $4,243 | $2,889 | $2,812
**DUI** | $4,824 | $4,246 | $3,305
**Low credit** | $3,958 | $2,492 | $3,377
## Allstate vs. GEICO Coverage Options
Allstate and GEICO both offer the full range of standard coverage options, which include [liability](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/liability/), [comprehensive and collision](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/), medical payments, personal injury protection and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.
They also have add-on coverages that you have the option of adding to your policy depending on your needs:
Coverage | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
Roadside assistance | Yes | Yes
Rental car reimbursement | Yes | Yes
Gap or loan/lease payoff | Yes | No
Accident forgiveness | Yes | Yes
Vehicle protection/mechanical breakdown insurance | Yes | Yes
Custom parts and equipment value coverage | No | Yes
Rideshare coverage | Yes | No
Coverage options can vary by state, so if you need a specific add-on coverage, verify what’s available in your area by checking your quote or contacting your agent. Drivers who work for services like Uber, Lyft or DoorDash should note that Allstate offers rideshare coverage, which it calls “Ride for Hire,” while GEICO does not.
In addition, Allstate is worth considering if you’re a homeowner looking to bundle auto and home insurance because it underwrites its own home policies. GEICO, on the other hand, uses third-party insurers for home insurance.
If you lease or finance your vehicle, your lender may require you to purchase [gap insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/gap/), so it’s important to keep this in mind when shopping for coverage.
## Allstate vs. GEICO Discounts
Discounts are a key component of auto insurance policies and can help you save a significant amount on your premium each year. Allstate and GEICO both offer several [auto insurance discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/) for eligible policyholders, including bundling and good driver discounts.
GEICO also has certain special discounts for members of the military community as well as federal employees. We cover the specific eligibility requirements for these discounts in more detail below.
The following table below provides a full list of the main discounts offered by both companies. Keep in mind that the discounts available vary by state, so always confirm what’s available where you live.
Discount | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
**Bundling** | Yes | Yes
**Multicar** | No | Yes
**Continuous insurance** | No | No
**Homeowner** | No | No
**Defensive driving course** | No | Yes
**Good driver** | Yes | Yes
**Pay in full** | Yes | Yes
**Automatic payment** | Yes | No
**Online quote** | No | No
**Paperless** | Yes | No
**Safety features** | Yes | Yes
**Anti-theft** | Yes | Yes
**Good student** | Yes | Yes
**Distant student** | Yes | Yes
**Low mileage** | No | No
**New vehicle** | Yes | Yes
**Military** | No | Yes
**Federal employee** | No | Yes
Just because a company offers more discounts that apply to you does not mean that it will offer you the lowest rate. For example, you may still get a cheaper rate from GEICO even if you’re eligible for automatic payment and paperless discounts. Always get quotes from at least three different companies.
### GEICO Discount Eligibility
GEICO offers the following military-specific discounts:
* A general discount of up to 15 percent for service members, available to those on active duty, retired from the military or members of the National Guard or Reserves.
* An Emergency Deployment Discount, available to those deployed to an imminent danger pay area designated by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) whose vehicle is stored under one of GEICO’s approved storage protection plans.
* A discount for being a member of certain military-affiliated organizations, including the Association of the U.S. Army, the Armed Forces Benefit Association and the Navy League of the U.S.
It also offers the following special discounts for federal employees:
* A general discount for active or retired federal government employees, GS-7 and above.
* A discount for being a member of certain federal groups.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-2)
Compare insurance from [USAA vs. GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa-vs-geico/).
### Allstate vs. GEICO Telematics Programs
If you’re a safe driver and want an opportunity to get a potentially major discount on your premium, you may consider signing up for a telematics program. Both Allstate and GEICO offer one — Allstate’s program is called [Drivewise](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-drivewise/) and GEICO has [DriveEasy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/driveeasy/).
These telematics programs use the companies’ respective mobile apps to track your driving behavior and reward safe driving with a discount. However, there is a caveat: While this isn’t true of all telematics programs, both Drivewise and Drive Easy may increase your premiums if you drive unsafely.
In terms of potential discounts, DriveEasy offers up to 10 percent off when you sign up and up to 25 percent off at renewal. Meanwhile, Drivewise offers a discount of up to 10 percent at signup and a generous discount of up to 40 percent at policy renewal.
Note that Drivewise is not available in California or Arkansas, and DriveEasy is currently available in 37 states and Washington, D.C.
While its potential discount is lower, GEICO’s telematics program ranked higher than Allstate’s in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, with an above-average score of 837 compared to Allstate’s below-average score of 818.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-3)
Category | Allstate Drivewise | GEICO DriveEasy
---|---|---
Potential discount | Up to 10% at signup, up to 40% at renewal | Up to 10% at signup, 25% at renewal
UBI satisfaction score (J.D. Power) | 818 out of 1,000 | 837 out of 1,000
## Allstate vs. GEICO Customer Service
According to various industry studies and data, Allstate’s and GEICO’s customer service ratings are mixed — there is no clear winner in this category but, rather, it depends on the region and the metric. Here’s how the companies compare in key customer experience areas:
### Claims Satisfaction
J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study is a good metric for how policyholders feel about their insurers’ claims management process, and Allstate and GEICO are essentially tied in this study. Allstate received a score of 691 while GEICO scored 692.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-4)
Meanwhile, the 2024 CRASH Network Report Card, which tracks auto shops’ experiences dealing with insurers, gave Allstate a D+ grade and GEICO a C-. For additional context, none of the 10 largest insurers scored higher than a C+.[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-5)
Study | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
2024 J.D. Power Claims Satisfaction Report | 691 out of 1,000 | 692 out of 1,000
CRASH Network 2024 Insurer Report Card | 80th out of 88, D+ grade | 74th out of 88, C- grade
### Customer Service
According to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, Allstate’s and GEICO’s overall customer satisfaction ratings varied greatly based on region. GEICO won by a wide margin in New York and the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions and by a lesser margin in the Northwest and Texas. Meanwhile, Allstate won in California, Florida, New England and the Central, North Central and Southwest regions.
Here is a breakdown of each company’s score (out of 1,000) by region:
Region | Allstate | GEICO | Average
---|---|---|---
California | 634 | 626 | 637
Central | 629 | 622 | 647
Florida | 643 | 629 | 625
Mid-Atlantic | 624 | 647 | 654
New England | 646 | 638 | 637
New York | 627 | 649 | 647
North Central | 652 | 641 | 652
Northwest | 626 | 637 | 643
Southeast | 634 | 651 | 663
Southwest | 633 | 618 | 635
Texas | 646 | 653 | 645
Another metric to consider when looking at customer service reputation is the NAIC complaint index, which measures the rate of complaints that a company receives above average. Both companies receive more complaints than average, but GEICO wins in this area. As of 2023 (the most recent data at the time of writing), GEICO had a complaint index of 1.83[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-6) while Allstate’s was 3.53.[7](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-7) An index of 1 is considered the expected number of complaints for a company in the market.
Metric | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
NAIC Complaint Index | 3.53 | 1.83
### Shopping
When it comes to the shopping process, customer sentiment seems to be pretty similar towards both Allstate and GEICO, but Allstate slightly edges out its competitor. In J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Insurance Shopping Study, Allstate scored 664 and GEICO scored 656.
Both companies have flexible shopping processes, allowing customers to get quotes and purchase policies online or on the phone with an agent.
Category | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
J.D. Power Insurance Shopping Study Score (average 676) | 664 out of 1,000 | 656 out of 1,000
Online quotes | Yes | Yes
Quotes by phone | Yes | Yes
Online purchasing | Yes | Yes
## Allstate vs. GEICO Mobile App and Online Tools
Customers of both Allstate and GEICO can take advantage of the companies’ respective online tools, including online platforms and mobile apps. These tools allow policyholders to file claims, access policy information, get roadside assistance and more. The apps are tied when it comes to their iOS rating, but GEICO has a higher rating for Android users. Here’s a breakdown of each app:
Features | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
Free download from the Apple Store and Google Play | Yes | Yes
iOS rating (out of 5 stars) | 4.8 | 4.8
Android rating (out of 5 stars) | 4.0 | 4.6
View policy information | Yes | Yes

Meanwhile, J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study indicates that customers are more satisfied with Allstate’s digital tools. In the service category, it scored 713 while GEICO only scored 668. The scores were more similar in the shopping category, with Allstate receiving a score of 521 to GEICO’s 519.[8](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate-vs-geico/#citation-8)
J.D. Power Digital Experience Category | Allstate | GEICO
---|---|---
Service (average 698) | 713 out of 1,000 | 668 out of 1,000
Shopping (average 516) | 521 out of 1,000 | 519 out of 1,000
## Recap
Allstate and GEICO are matched closely in terms of overall customer service reputation and financial stability ratings. However, depending on your region, you may want to prioritize one or the other if you value customer service. For example, GEICO has a much better customer experience reputation in New York while Allstate is better in the Southwest.
One of GEICO’s notable downsides is that it does not offer gap coverage, which may be a dealbreaker if you lease or finance your vehicle. It also does not offer rideshare coverage. Allstate sells both of these coverages.
Both companies offer accident forgiveness, but Allstate only offers the option to purchase it. With GEICO, you may earn it if you meet certain requirements automatically, including being insured with GEICO and accident-free for at least five years.
**> > Keep Comparing**: [Liberty Mutual vs. GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/liberty-mutual-vs-geico/)
Cost is a major factor in car insurance and most drivers, including those with violations on their record or low credit, will likely find lower rates from GEICO. The company also offers certain discounts specifically for the military community and federal employees, so if you are eligible, you may get an even better rate. However, rates vary greatly based on several factors, so always get personalized quotes from several companies before purchasing.
## Frequently Asked Questions
What are the disadvantages of GEICO?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Some of the disadvantages of GEICO include that it ranks lower than some competitors when it comes to customer service and it does not offer gap coverage, which may be important if you lease or finance your vehicle. In addition, it does not underwrite its own home insurance policies.
Who better, Allstate or State Farm?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) tends to be cheaper and has a better overall customer service reputation than Allstate, but the better company will ultimately depend on your needs and circumstances.
Does Allstate raise rates after accidents?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Generally, Allstate raises rates after-fault accidents as drivers who cause accidents are a higher risk to insure. However, if you purchase Allstate’s accident forgiveness coverage, you can have your first at-fault accident forgiven, meaning it can’t increase your premium.
## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we use four key factors to evaluate auto insurers:
* **Price (40 percent):** We analyze average premiums for both full and minimum coverage for a standard driving profile of a good driver with good credit. We also looked at rates for other driver profiles, including those with violations or low credit. We also consider discounts available. Full coverage averages use the following limits:
* Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
* Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
* Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
* **Claims handling (25 percent):** An auto insurer’s claims handling process should be quick, transparent and efficient, with clear communication, fair evaluation of damages and timely payment or resolution. We assess claims practices using sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings. We also include real-life customer experiences when possible.
* **Customer experience (25 percent):** We evaluate the ease of the customer journey, from getting a quote and purchasing a policy to making changes or accessing documents. We consider the availability and quality of both online and agent interactions, as well as the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings and app store reviews.
* **Coverage options (10 percent):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and prioritize providers with options beyond the state-required minimums, such as accident forgiveness, gap coverage, rideshare coverage and more.
