Agent insight: What does full coverage actually mean?

"Full coverage" isn’t exactly a real thing. People often assume it means they’re completely protected, but it’s more complex than that. Full coverage typically includes both [comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) and [collision](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/), but people don’t realize it also involves extras like rental car coverage and roadside assistance, which you pay extra for."

## How much does full coverage car insurance cost?

Full coverage auto insurance comes in at around **$181 per month**, assuming liability coverage limits of 50/100/50. If you're considering upgrading from a [liability-only](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) policy to a full coverage plan (with $500 collision and comprehensive deductibles) you can expect your monthly auto insurance premium to go up by approximately $88.

While your state may only require liability coverage, we highly recommend considering additional coverage options to safeguard both you and your valuable assets. It's worth noting that a whopping 70% of The Zebra's customers choose to go with full coverage when they purchase a policy. Look at the tables below to get an idea of the average monthly costs of minimum and full coverage.

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

Our rate analysis shows Travelers and USAA are the top choices if getting the cheapest price is your priority. But don't stop there — many insurance companies are ready to offer you full coverage plans. However, depending on your needs, certain companies might be a better fit than others.

#### Zebra Tip: Look for insurers with good customer satisfaction ratings

---

Remember that the cheapest car insurance may not always be the best option. Take a look at the 2025 results of [The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) to see which companies deliver the highest levels of service and satisfaction to their customers. We've provided a brief overview of the top contenders below.

## The best companies for full coverage

![USAA insurance insignia]()

Best overall for full coverage — USAA

While [USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) is only available to military members and their families, this company is renowned for its customer service and came in first place for auto insurance in The Zebra's customer satisfaction survey. We also found it has the second-cheapest average rate for full coverage.

![Erie insurance insignia]()

Best for young drivers — Erie

[Erie](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/erie-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) is a regional insurance company that serves the Northeast and Midwest, but it could be a great option if it's available for you. While finding affordable car insurance for teen drivers is always a challenge, our data indicates Erie is cheaper than many of its competitors. The company also has a great reputation for good customer service, coming in seventh place in The Zebra's customer satisfaction survey for auto insurance.

![State Farm logo]()

Best for claim satisfaction — State Farm

With coverage available in every state, [State Farm](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) came in first place for claim satisfaction in our customer satisfaction survey. For those who prefer personalized service, State Farm also has local agents available to help you with your car insurance policy.

## What exactly is full coverage car insurance?

The term 'full coverage' might seem a bit confusing as it encompasses different types of coverage, including comprehensive, collision, and higher liability limits. For most folks, full coverage insurance is about safeguarding your vehicle and covering injuries and property damage.

When searching for full coverage auto insurance quotes, remember that 'full coverage' essentially combines two types of physical damage coverage: comprehensive and collision coverage. These two and the mandatory liability coverage as per your state make up a comprehensive full coverage car insurance policy.

|  | Comprehensive Insurance | Collision Insurance | Liability Insurance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage | **Covers damages to your vehicle caused by incidents other than collisions** (e.g. theft, vandalism, natural disasters, fire, falling objects, animal damage or collision, civil disturbances). | **Covers damages to your vehicle resulting from a collision**  with another vehicle, an (e.g. a tree, guardrail, or pole), or if your car rolls over\*. | **Covers the costs of damages and injuries you cause to other drivers, passengers, and property owners when you’re in an at-fault accident** (e.g. medical bills, lost wages, property replacement) |
| Typical Deductible | **$500-$1,000** | **$500-$1,000** | **$0** (typically covered up to your chosen policy limit) |
| Risk of Rate Increase After Filing a Claim | **Low**. Many auto insurance companies don't view comprehensive claims as a result of driver error. | **High**. Most collision claims are seen as at-fault accidents. [Rate penalties can last three to five years](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) | **High**. Most liability claims occur when you’re at fault in an accident. Rate penalties can last up to three years. |

\*If you have uninsured motorist coverage on your policy, you can use the property damage portion of this coverage rather than collision. We recommend you carry uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to cover collisions involving uninsured drivers.

## What full coverage doesn’t include

'Full coverage' typically includes collision and comprehensive insurance, but it **does not** cover everything. Important protections like higher liability limits, personal injury coverage, and extras like rental car reimbursement may require separate policies.

Consider adding these optional coverages for more complete protection:

* [Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/)
* [Medical payments coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/medical-payments-coverage-auto-insurance/) (MedPay)
* [Personal injury protection](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/pip-insurance/) (PIP)
* [Roadside assistance and towing](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/)
* [Rental car reimbursement](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/insurance-rental-car/)
* [Gap insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/)
* [Custom parts coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/modified-car-insurance/)

#### Zebra Tip: Get more than just the bare minimum coverage

While full coverage mostly entails having a policy with comprehensive and collision coverages, don't neglect to increase your liability limits above the state minimum. A true "full coverage" policy will also have bodily injury and property damage liability limits that are high enough to provide adequate protection should you cause serious injury or property damage in an accident.

![money key]()

Did your car insurance rates go up?

If you noticed the cost of your insurance go up in the past year, you're not alone. According to our data, 43% of The Zebra's customers say they're paying too much for auto insurance. Rates in 2024 increased by over 20% year-over-year.[[1]](#footnote-1) It's more important than ever to compare rates, shop around, and check for discounts. Remember that rate increases aren't always related to you as a driver; sometimes, it is simply a business decision that reflects the current economy.

## Is full coverage auto insurance required?

Unlike liability coverage, full coverage isn't legally required by states. However, full coverage insurance is likely a requirement by your lender if you are leasing or financing a vehicle.

We recommend carrying full coverage if your vehicle is worth more than $4,000, if your vehicle will eventually be resold, or if the drivers of your vehicle are younger, less experienced or have a history of accidents. See the list below for more details.

![Stack of bills]()

Required: For leased or financed vehicles

Full coverage is typically required if you're leasing or [financing](/auto-insurance/vehicles/car-insurance-financed-vehicle/) a vehicle, and our data shows that around 41% of drivers fully own their vehicles. If you don't own the vehicle outright, then ensuring comprehensive protection is essential. Lenders often mandate full coverage to safeguard their investment, sometimes referred to as "force-placed" or "[collateral protection"](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collateral-protection/) insurance.

![cash in wallet]()

Recommended: For vehicles worth more than $4,000

Insurance experts suggest carrying full coverage if your vehicle is worth more than $4,000. To determine your vehicle's value, you can use resources like [Kelley Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/whats-my-car-worth/) or [NADA](https://www.nada.org/nada/consumer-vehicle-values) online. Full coverage is designed to protect your car. However, if your vehicle isn't worth much, full coverage might not be the most cost-effective choice, especially if you have a substantial emergency fund that can cover potential damages or replacement costs.

![keys]()

Recommended: For vehicles you plan to sell

If the vehicle will be resold in the future, full coverage insurance is a wise investment. If the vehicle were [totaled](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/total-loss-auto-insurance/) — either in a collision or in adverse weather — the insured party would have no recourse.

![teen driver]()

Recommended: For vehicles whose drivers are high-risk

While age doesn't always determine driving skills, [young drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) and [teens](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) might benefit from adding collision coverage. Similarly, full coverage insurance can provide valuable financial protection from potential future accidents if you have a history of accidents. Again, vehicle value plays a role; if the car isn't worth much, full coverage might not be necessary.

### [How to Find the Best Car Insurance Discounts | The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/)

If you want to save on car insurance, it's important to be aware of available discounts. Let The Zebra's insurance experts help you find an auto insurance discount to fit your driving situation.

## Full coverage vs. state minimum: Which costs more?

Full coverage will likely be more expensive. By boosting your coverage from the minimum amount to add collision and comprehensive insurance, expect to **pay over double** what you were paying for just the state-required minimum amount of liability insurance.

This disparity in pricing is less apparent if you already carry comp and collision coverage. Whether you have a $500 or $1,000 [deductible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-deductibles/), the difference in premium between coverage levels maxes out at about 15%.

If you're looking to save the most on full coverage, consider lowering your liability limits to your state's minimum required amount to offset the cost of comp and collision. Keep in mind: your location, vehicle, age, and driving record will impact your car insurance rate. Use The Zebra to [instantly find the cheapest car insurance for you, online](/auto-insurance/policies/same-day-auto-insurance/).

Zebra tip: Consider gap insurance for leased or financed vehicles

[Gap insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/) comes into play when there's a gap between the value of your totaled vehicle and what you still owe on a loan. It's particularly useful for newer or high-value vehicles. To have gap coverage, you typically need both collision and comprehensive coverage. It might be included in your lease agreement if you're leasing a vehicle, but confirming that your insurance covers it is crucial.

## How age impacts full coverage car insurance rates

[Age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) plays a significant role in determining your car insurance rates, along with [other factors](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/). Younger, less experienced drivers typically pay the highest premiums due to their increased risk of accidents. As drivers gain experience and maintain a clean record, rates tend to decrease. For example, drivers in their 40s and 50s generally pay much less than those in their 20s. However, rates may start to rise again for drivers in their mid-70s.

The table below highlights average full coverage insurance rates by age group from top providers.

## Full coverage insurance FAQs

What does full coverage insurance cover?
Chevron down icon

Full coverage usually refers to the combination of collision and comprehensive coverage, both of which protect your vehicle from physical damage. Collision covers your car in the event you collide with another object or vehicle, while comprehensive takes care of damage other than collisions, such as a hailstorm.

How much does full coverage insurance cost?
Chevron down icon

Among major insurance companies, the average cost of a six-month full coverage auto insurance policy is $880, which equals about $147 per month. However, the cost of the auto insurance quotes you receive depends on several factors, including your driving history, age, credit score, home address and insurance provider.

Which insurance companies offer cheap full coverage insurance?
Chevron down icon

The cheapest average rates for full coverage insurance come from Travelers ($122/month), American Family ($132/month), and USAA ($141/month).

Is full coverage auto insurance mandatory?
Chevron down icon

Full coverage might be required if you are financing your vehicle. It is also a good idea if the insured vehicle is worth a significant amount of money (usually any amount over $4,000). If the vehicle will be resold, full coverage is a good way to keep the vehicle protected in the meantime.
