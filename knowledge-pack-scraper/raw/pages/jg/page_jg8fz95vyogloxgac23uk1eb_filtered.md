## How much is car insurance in Washington?

The national [average annual cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of full coverage car insurance is $2,671, while minimum coverage costs an average of $806. Washington drivers pay lower average rates at $1,919 per year for full coverage and $589 per year for minimum coverage. While [minimum coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) is all that's legally required by the state, most insurance experts recommend [full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) for additional financial protection. If you have a loan or lease on your vehicle, your lender will likely require you to purchase full coverage car insurance.

### Key takeaways

* Teen drivers see some of the highest average rates in Washington. Parents with a 16-year-old driver on their policy pay an average full coverage premium of $4,046 per year.
* Although Washington allows insurers to consider credit history in auto insurance rating, rate differences between drivers with good credit and drivers with poor credit are not as drastic as in many other states.
* Your vehicle type impacts your Washington car insurance rates. For example, BMW 330i drivers pay 37 percent more for full coverage than Honda Odyssey drivers.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Washington

Like most states, Washington's car insurance rates are [influenced by age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) and gender. Drivers will typically see the highest costs at 18 (when on their own policy) and a consistent decline thereafter until rates flatten at around age 40.

Men typically pay slightly more for car insurance than women, since they are statistically more likely to be involved in accidents. In the chart below, 16-year-old rates assume they are insured on their parents' policy since drivers are unable to be the primary policyholder if under the age of 18.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Young male drivers see some of the highest average car insurance rates because they are more likely to engage in [risky driving behavior](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/), including speeding, distracted driving and not wearing a seatbelt. Fortunately, most drivers see their rates decrease over time as they age and demonstrate safe driving habits. Young drivers may be able to save by enrolling in a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) that rewards safe driving with a premium discount.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Washington?

As with any other state, Washington car insurance rates are strongly impacted by driving history. If you get into an accident, receive a speeding ticket or are convicted of a DUI, you are more likely to pay higher car insurance premiums. The rates below show the average increase drivers may see after a single offense in each category. If you become a repeat offender, the increase will typically be much higher. Note that not all carriers will extend coverage to drivers with a DUI conviction or other high-risk offense.

## Car insurance rates in Washington by credit score

Your credit history will influence your Washington car insurance rates. Drivers with poor credit histories tend to file more claims than drivers with strong credit histories, so carriers generally charge higher rates if you have poor credit. Although Washington passed a law to ban credit history from auto insurance rating in 2022, it was later overturned and is no longer in effect.

## Washington car insurance rates by vehicle type

Insurers will take your car's make and model into account, as well as the car's age, when pricing policies. Vehicles that are lower in cost and able to be repaired using domestic rather than imported parts may earn a lower rate than high-priced sports or luxury cars. Cars with low theft rates and extra safety features also typically see lower premiums.

## How to save on car insurance in Washington

If the average car insurance rates in Washington seem expensive to you, keep in mind that you may be able to find a lower quote using a few strategies:

* **Gather multiple quotes:** Since every insurer determines rates using their own proprietary algorithms, each insurer you ask is likely to give you a different quote. By [comparing multiple quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) for the same levels of coverage, you can determine which company is able to offer you the lowest rate for your insurance.
* **Use all possible discounts:** Most insurance companies offer at least a small handful of [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), and some are easy to qualify for. Most insurers, for example, will reduce your rate if you [bundle](http://krate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) your auto insurance with a homeowners or renters policy. This is one reason it may be good to work with a live agent — they can make sure you are receiving all the possible discounts you have earned.
* **Raise your deductible:** If you can afford to increase your [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/), which is the amount you pay before your insurance kicks for some types of coverage, you are likely to save on your premium rate. Raising it from $500 to $1,000, for example, will probably net you a lower premium. Just be careful you don't raise it higher than you could afford to pay in the event of a claim.
* **Avoid certain types of car:** Your premium cost will vary depending on the type of car you drive. A high-end imported luxury or sports car is likely to cost you more to insure than a more-reasonably priced domestic model. If you're in the market for a new car and have narrowed down your choices to a few vehicles, consider getting quotes for insurance for all of them to see which one is cheapest.

* ###### Is car insurance getting more expensive in Washington?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Yes, most Washington drivers have seen their insurance premiums rise as insurers charge higher rates for coverage. In early 2024, Washington’s Office of the Insurance Commissioner approved an [auto premium increase request of nearly 25 percent](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/washingtonians-find-rising-car-insurance-rates-outrageous/) on average. Policyholders likely saw that approval reflected in their rates when their policy renewed this year. Some of the factors contributing to these high rates are high repair costs, increasing medical costs, and an uptick in extreme weather.
