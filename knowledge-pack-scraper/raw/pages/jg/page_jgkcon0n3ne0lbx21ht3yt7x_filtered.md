**Question:** I just bought a second car, for my daughter. How do I add a car to my State Farm insurance policy online?

**Answer:** Adding an additional car to your [State Farm](/reviews/car-insurance/state-farm/) auto insurance policy can be done in a variety of ways, including going online. If you don’t want to go into a local branch or call customer service, making changes to your policy online is your best option.

To do this, you’ll need to set up a State Farm online account with a username and password. If you already have one, head over to the State Farm login page and sign in. If you’re already a State Farm customer but do not have an online account setup, you can head over to their Create An Account page.

Once you’ve set up your account with a login name and password, you can access your policy information on their website. Look for your auto insurance policy and click into it. You should see a “What would you like to do?” box and one of the possible selections will be “Add or replace vehicle.” You can follow the prompts from there to add the new car to your policy and see the updated pricing.

With a login, you’ll also have access to your account via the State Farm app, which you can download the app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also send a text message to 78836 with the word “MOBILE” and have a download link sent to your phone.

## The State Farm app

Using the app, you’ll be able to access a wide range of functionality with your policy.

* **Manage your insurance policies**. View a list of all your policies and make changes as needed.
* **File and manage claims**. You can [file a claim](/car-insurance/car-insurance-claim/) or take care of details to keep the process moving.
* **Access your ID cards**. If you don’t have your physical insurance card with you, most states will allow digital versions to be used as [proof of insurance](/car-insurance/proof-of-insurance/) with law enforcement or in the case of an [accident](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/). You can access your ID cards for State Farm auto and other policies right in the app.
* **Get roadside assistance**: If you need a jumpstart, tow or have been locked out of your car, the app lets you request help.
* **Upload photos and documents**: If you’re in the middle of a claims process and need to provide photos or documentation, you can upload them directly from your smartphone using the State Farm app.
* **Connect with your agent**: You can also get support from your agent’s office in the app.

If dealing with your insurance online or in an app isn’t your thing, your other option is to call toll-free and talk to a customer service representative who can assist you with your policy and any changes that need to be made. State Farm customer service can be reached at 1-855-733-7333. And, of course, you can always head into a State Farm branch to see your agent directly. It is probably best to call ahead and make an appointment.
