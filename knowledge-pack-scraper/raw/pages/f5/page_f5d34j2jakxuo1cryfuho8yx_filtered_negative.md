![Woman watching man install a smoke detector. ](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/614-smoke-detector-wide.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Depending on the [cause of the fire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/protect-your-home-against-these-common-causes-of-house-fires), there are several types of extinguishers to choose from and each has various uses. The common types of home fire extinguishers include:
* **Water extinguishers** —
* **P** ull the pin
* **A** im low
* **S** queeze the lever
* **S** weep the nozzle
* If you have a [smart home system](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/control-your-homes-safety-with-your-smartphone), consider linking your carbon monoxide detectors so you can receive smartphone alerts if carbon monoxide is detected.
* Some manufacturers of carbon monoxide detectors offer combination or three-in-one detectors to alert you when carbon monoxide or an explosive gas (like [natural gas or propane](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/natural-gas-detectors)) is detected. Many home natural gas detectors or explosive gas detectors will require being plugged into an electrical outlet and may have a battery backup.
* [Furnaces](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-prepare-your-furnace-for-extreme-winter-cold)
* **Fireplace screens** — keep screens on fireplaces to help prevent ash or sparks from reaching nearby flammable materials like carpets or drapes. Monitor the screen for holes or damage and replace it as necessary. You may want to consider a yearly [chimney clean](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/why-chimney-cleaning-is-important) as well.
* **Fireproof boxes** —
* **Emergency kits** — the type of [emergency kit](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/emergency-kit-supplies) needed depends on the type of weather in your region. Consider including general protective gear like gloves, [safety goggles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-should-i-grab-my-safety-glasses), hearing protection, [sunscreen](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/why-is-sunscreen-important), [insect repellant](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/how-to-prevent-bug-bites), dust masks and other items.
Once you have the right equipment, consider developing a comprehensive [fire evacuation plan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/prepare-a-home-fire-evacuation-plan-with-your-family) in case of emergency. Remember, the primary tool against a home fire is a safe exit route.
