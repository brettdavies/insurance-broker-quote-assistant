New York car insurance laws require drivers to carry 25/50/10 in liability coverage. NYCM Insurance provides the lowest minimum coverage rates with an average of $420. Mandatory coverage limits are low, and drivers should consider increasing liability limits and adding coverage to be more fully protected.
