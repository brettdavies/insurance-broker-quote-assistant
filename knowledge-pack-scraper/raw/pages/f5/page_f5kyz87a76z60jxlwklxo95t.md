## Are the New York minimum coverage requirements changing in 2025?
New York car insurance requirements will not change in 2025. You do not need to make any changes if you have minimum coverage. If mandatory coverage changes in the future, your insurer will inform you, along with any rate changes.
Why do limits change?
"Several states have minimum requirements of property damage of $10,000-$25,000," says Zack Pope, agency manager at David Pope Insurance in Missouri. "[Given] the current values of vehicles, that's extremely antiquated values of coverage and a main reason that I personally do not offer less than 100/300/100 to customers. It is significantly easier to see a car on the road that is valued at $100,000 than it has been in the past."
## What does minimum car insurance cover in New York?
New York requires drivers to carry at least a minimum amount of car insurance to help offset accident costs.
New York drivers are required to carry liability coverage. Bodily injury liability helps pay for injuries you cause to others in an accident. Property damage liability covers items damaged in an accident, such as another vehicle, fence, or other property.
New York is a no-fault state, meaning your insurer pays for your injuries and damages regardless of who caused the accident. The law requires you to carry personal injury protection (PIP) to pay medical costs, such as doctor visits and prescriptions.
Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is also required. Uninsured motorist coverage helps pay for coverage when the at-fault driver doesn't have car insurance, and underinsured coverage assists when the at-fault driver doesn't have enough car insurance to cover injury and property damage costs. Without these coverages, you would have to pay for medical and repair costs that the other driver's insurance didn't cover. You may be able to opt out of this coverage.
### PEOPLE ASK:
Is New York minimum car insurance enough?
It may not be. Even a moderately serious accident could exceed the state minimum limits of 25/50/10, and minimum coverage may not cover all accident costs. Furthermore, state minimums do not cover your vehicle; you need to add [comprehensive and collision coverage.](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html)
## How much car insurance is enough in New York?
[Car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance.aspx) isn't one size fits all. The amount of coverage you need depends on your assets, net worth and risk level.
For example, if you are financially stable and can afford to pay out of pocket for medical costs and repairs, you may keep insurance limits low. However, you may be sued for the cost difference if you have a sizeable net worth and don't carry enough insurance to cover expenses.
Additionally, if you drive very little or have a short commute, your chances of causing an accident are relatively low. Also, you may choose to skip coverages such as collision and comprehensive if your car isn't worth much, or you can afford to pay for a new vehicle if yours is damaged. However, if you have a loan or lease you will be required to carry this coverage by your lender.
Consider your financial situation when determining how much car insurance you need.
## New York penalties for driving without car insurance
