New York is an expensive state, especially regarding auto insurance. New York is one of the most expensive states to insure a vehicle in the United States, especially for minimum coverage.

Read on to discover what rates you should expect when shopping for auto insurance in New York and how to keep rates as low as possible.
## How much is car insurance in New York?
On average, [car insurance in New York](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/best-car-insurance/) is $2,253 for full coverage and $1,343 for minimum coverage.
Coverage level | Average annual cost in NY state | Average annual cost in the U.S. | NY difference from national average
---|---|---|---
Full | $2,253 | $2,399 | -6%
Minimum | $1,343 | $635 | +111%
Minimum coverage car insurance is expensive in New York due to high population density, frequent accidents, costly medical claims under the state’s no-fault system, and elevated rates of insurance fraud.
### By City

---|---

Average | $3,260

Excellent | $2,133
### By Violation

Driving history | Average annual cost of car insurance

## How to Save on Car Insurance in New York State
If you’re still struggling to pay your premium, follow our recommendations on how to save on car insurance in New York.
1. **Purchase only the minimum coverage legally required in New York.** Remember that the lower your limits are, the more you will have to pay out of pocket in the event of an accident.
2. **Check for discounts.** Search your insurance company’s website, or ask your insurance agent what discounts apply to your situation.
3. **Increase your deductible.** Increasing your deductible reduces your premium, but it means you will pay more out of pocket in the event of an accident before your auto insurance coverage kicks in.
4. **Look into the New York Automobile Insurance Plan.** New York has an affordable insurance plan called NYAIP. To apply, you must certify that you’ve tried and failed to find car insurance below NYAIP rates on the voluntary market within the past two months. You can apply online at https://www.nypass.com.
## Minimum Car Insurance in New York
In New York, as in most states, you must purchase car insurance to register a vehicle. The minimum auto insurance in New York consists of:
* $10,000 property damage liability
* $25,000 bodily injury liability per person/$50,000 per accident
* $50,000 liability for death per person/$100,000 per accident
* $25,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per person/$50,000 per accident
* $50,000 personal injury protection
Your insurance must remain in effect while your vehicle is registered — even if you don’t use your car. It must also be New York state insurance coverage issued in your name and remain that way.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/cost/#citation-1)
New York never accepts out-of-state car insurance coverage of any type. A vehicle registered in New York must have New York auto liability insurance.
## Fault Law in New York
New York is a no-fault state, which is one of the reasons why it’s so expensive to insure a car there. The point of no-fault insurance, or personal injury protection (PIP), is to distribute funds related to medical/health, lost earnings, and other reasonable expenses promptly after an accident, regardless of fault. PIP requires economic losses to exceed coverage to file a lawsuit. You can also sue for non-economic damages like pain and suffering in the event of a serious injury.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/new-york/cost/#citation-2)
## SR-22s or FR-44s
You do not need an SR-22 in New York. If you have an SR-22 and move to New York, you must maintain that coverage. Your driving record will still impact your auto insurance rates, and you must ensure you have the minimum amount of coverage required in New York after you move.
An [SR-22 is a form](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-sr22/) that proves you have the legally required amount of insurance after a serious violation like a DUI.
## Recap
New York is one of the most expensive states in which to insure a vehicle. New York’s no-fault auto insurance laws and cost of living contribute heavily to its auto insurance rates. Progressive, NYCM, and GEICO tend to be cheaper, but your mileage may vary — get quotes from at least three providers and compare their rates. If you have difficulty accessing more affordable insurance on the voluntary market, look into New York’s affordable insurance plan as a last resort.
