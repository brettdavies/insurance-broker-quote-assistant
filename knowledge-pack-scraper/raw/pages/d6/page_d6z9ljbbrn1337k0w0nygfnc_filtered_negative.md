A 2.5% commission agreement is very normal for a buyer agent. This being said, do not sign up for a long-term commitment with an agent that you have not even met. Zillow has a lot of new and inexperienced agents. Some of them are fine, some of them are not. Tell them you will sign a 3 day or one-week showing agreement only. After you meet them, and if you feel comfortable, at that time you can sign a long-term buyer representation agreement. Regarding new builds. Make sure you get a *pre-drywall inspection from your own home inspector who has New Construction Experience. This is absolutely critical. Before making an offer, make sure the builder will pay your buyer agents commission, if they won’t you are responsible for that. You can ask them.

VERY poorly made! All the big builders are about quantity not quality. You can look up how many lawsuits they have against them. You’ll spend more in the long run with the low quality material and shoddy work. These big builders take advantage of the average person by passing low end material off as mid or high end. It’s not uncommon to see flooring laid wrong, tile, cabinets, windows…my dad’s even seen trusses wrong. The list goes on and on. He’s constantly having to fix big builder homes. That’s half his business. Take a look through Reddit. You’ll see a lot from Lennar homeowners. I know it’s Reddit 😂 but it’s a start.

They have a history of shoddy construction, failure to make repairs, etc. Please do your research no matter which builder you are contemplating. Look up Cy Porter-home inspector. He has one that covers them often.

Just make it clear to the agent that you will not sign a purchase contract that requires you to pay any of the fee. You are only obligated to pay the fee if you sign a purchase contract that doesn't include the seller paying.
Also.. don't just hire the first agent to answer the phone on Zillow to help you with the largest financial purchase of your life.
For heaven's sake, interview a couple of agents, ask your friends/family if they liked their agent, find one you trust and who literally oozes competence.
Find an agent who will protect you.

The National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit in August 2024. The terms of the settlement require that most Realtors have you sign a document before they show you property or represent you. This was already a thing in some states to varying degrees. Part of that agreement requires you to negotiate what your buyer agent is going to be paid for their services. The buyer is ultimately responsible for making sure that their agent gets paid. You need to ask your agent what that looks like in your market, because it varies significantly. I have not had a single seller tell me that they won't pay it. I have not had a single buyer have to pay it, but I negotiate a reasonable fee from the very beginning, so that doesn't happen. Don't take for granted that any seller is going to agree to it.

Don't sign it. New builds will often not negotiate and if the agent says trust me, tell them their agreement should be "trust worthy" and not require you to commit to paying a fee. Their talk should match the paper.
In general, I'm in agreement that buyers should pay their own agent. I'm wondering why you think you need an agent to work with a new home builder?

What do you need "protecting" FROM? With a new build? Prices are listed, no? Any concessions builder might give will be eaten up by agent commission.

New builds are different than private sales. If your agent doesn’t LITERALLY walk you over the threshold of the sales office, they will not pay commission and you will have to pay it cash.
This means you cannot stop by an open house. You cannot email them. And you cannot even fill out a website form or comment on a social media post. Your agent has to make the introduction to the builder for you.

Years ago, i bought thru another national builder, and it was the smoothest deal ever. No buyers agent.
Just recently, I bought a 1 year old home from a seller. Original owner bought from national builder, held for year and decided to move. Traditional buyer and seller agents. Both idiots. Most stressful deal ever.

What is your approximate purchase price? I wouldn’t sign a buyer agreement for any more than a week and any more than 1.5% (if over $500, less if over $1.5M). You can go with Redfin that allows a release from contract at any time and 1.5 % buyer agent fee. Traditional agents will say don’t do that they’re bad however they’re just protecting their over inflated % and predatory contracts. I’ve bought and sold many times with Redfin and they’re great.

900 career deals in Chicago, we don’t advertise on Zillow, honestly very few (good) brokers do because it’s crazy $$$. A handful of really good brokers do it and it works. YELP is a much better place to find a broker. With YELP, you’re searching for a PERSON not someone who was assigned an address based on what zip codes they bought from a tech company.
