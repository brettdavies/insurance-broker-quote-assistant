# Are buyers pay their agent commission

[Homebuyer](/r/RealEstate/?f=flair_name%3A%22Homebuyer%22)

I'm first home buyer and have no experience in this. I was looking in Zillow and then found a new house from leanar builder . I know they don't like private agents but I asked and i was told that It's better to have one to represent me. So an agent from Zillow contacted me and we had a zoom meeting and he arranged a house tour then he sent me a represntation agreement to sign, but it states that the buyer pay 2.5% of the purchase .is this normal ? He told that he will negotiate with the seller and they will pay and don't worry but I can't trust him. Please advise
