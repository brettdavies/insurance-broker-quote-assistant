# The benefits of roadside assistance vs. DIY fixes
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Learn more about the safety risks of DIY car repairs and when to call roadside assistance. 
**_Overview:_**_When your car breaks down, deciding whether to attempt a DIY repair (your vehicle owner’s manual may help) or call roadside assistance can be important for your safety and the condition of your vehicle. While do-it-yourself fixes may seem appealing, they can expose you to risks such as injury, traffic hazards, improper repairs and potential impacts on warranties. Roadside assistance programs, on the other hand, may help to provide professional service from trained technicians who use safety protocols and the right tools, which can help to reduce your exposure to danger and prevent further damage. Although having some basic maintenance knowledge can be useful, choosing roadside assistance in many situations can help you address unexpected car troubles more safely and efficiently so you can get back on the road._

When your [car suddenly breaks down](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down), you’re faced with a quick decision: Should you attempt a roadside fix yourself or call for professional help? While the idea of saving time and money with a DIY car repair may be appealing, choosing a reliable roadside assistance program may offer a greater sense of security by helping you avoid the hidden safety risks that come with do-it-yourself fixes. Let’s examine why, for many situations, calling for help could be the smarter, safer choice.
## The dangers of doing roadside repairs
While it may seem practical to handle things yourself, especially minor issues, attempting to fix your car by the side of the road — especially on busy streets or highways — can put you in harm’s way. Even common quick-fix scenarios can turn risky for several reasons:
  * **Threat of physical injury** —[changing a tire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care), [jump-starting a battery](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car) or handling hot engine parts can result in burns, cuts or other injuries, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the process.
  * **Traffic-related risks** —[low visibility](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/drive-safely-in-dense-fog) and high speeds can increase your risk of injury from passing traffic.
  * **Vehicle technology** —
  * **Lack of knowledge or tools** —
  * **Towing troubles** —
  * **Warranty implications** — performing certain repairs yourself can void warranties on newer vehicles, costing you more in the long run.


## The benefits of roadside assistance
There are many [reasons you might choose roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/reasons-you-might-want-roadside-assistance-coverage). Opting for professional help through a roadside assistance program can bring several key advantages that go beyond just saving you time:
  * **Fast, reliable options** —[dead battery](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-battery-replacement-tips) or lockout, much faster than a DIY attempt, minimizing your time in a potentially vulnerable spot.
  * **Prioritized safety** —
  * **Trained technicians** —
  * **Hassle-free help** —
  * **Vehicle protection** —[save you money in the long run](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-roadside-assistance-coverage-may-save-you-money)) and helps ensure warranty coverage stays intact.
  * **Sense of security** —


## Deciding whether to DIY or call for help
While fixing a flat tire or jump-starting a battery might seem straightforward, the reality is that roadside repairs can go wrong quickly without the right preparation. Here’s a simple comparison of DIY roadside repair risks and the benefits of professional roadside assistance:
**Aspect**
**DIY roadside repair risks**
**Professional roadside assistance benefits**
Personal safety
High risk (traffic, injury)
Safety protocols, less time exposed to danger
Vehicle damage
Potential for further or costly damage
Proper tools/methods to help protect your vehicle
Efficiency
Time-consuming, uncertain outcome
Potentially fast, more reliable options
Expertise

## The bottom line
While knowing a few basics, like [tire maintenance and care](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care), can be helpful, roadside breakdowns can sometimes occur in challenging or even potentially unsafe situations. Attempting complex repairs yourself could worsen vehicle damage, void warranties or put your safety at risk. It’s important to know when to call roadside assistance, which is designed to provide professional help when you need it most, so you can get back on the road safely.
**Looking for more confidence on the road?** Adding [roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) to your auto policy can be a more affordable way to help protect yourself and your passengers from the unexpected.
