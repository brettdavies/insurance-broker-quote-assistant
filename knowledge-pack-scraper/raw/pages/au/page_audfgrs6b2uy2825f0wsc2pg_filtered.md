# The benefits of roadside assistance vs. DIY fixes

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

Learn more about the safety risks of DIY car repairs and when to call roadside assistance.

***Overview:*** *When your car breaks down, deciding whether to attempt a DIY repair (your vehicle owner’s manual may help) or call roadside assistance can be important for your safety and the condition of your vehicle. While do-it-yourself fixes may seem appealing, they can expose you to risks such as injury, traffic hazards, improper repairs and potential impacts on warranties. Roadside assistance programs, on the other hand, may help to provide professional service from trained technicians who use safety protocols and the right tools, which can help to reduce your exposure to danger and prevent further damage. Although having some basic maintenance knowledge can be useful, choosing roadside assistance in many situations can help you address unexpected car troubles more safely and efficiently so you can get back on the road.*

When your [car suddenly breaks down](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down), you’re faced with a quick decision: Should you attempt a roadside fix yourself or call for professional help? While the idea of saving time and money with a DIY car repair may be appealing, choosing a reliable roadside assistance program may offer a greater sense of security by helping you avoid the hidden safety risks that come with do-it-yourself fixes. Let’s examine why, for many situations, calling for help could be the smarter, safer choice.

## The dangers of doing roadside repairs

While it may seem practical to handle things yourself, especially minor issues, attempting to fix your car by the side of the road — especially on busy streets or highways — can put you in harm’s way. Even common quick-fix scenarios can turn risky for several reasons:

* **Threat of physical injury** —[changing a tire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care), [jump-starting a battery](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car) or handling hot engine parts can result in burns, cuts or other injuries, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the process.
* **Traffic-related risks** —the side of the road isn’t a safe workspace. Distracted drivers, [low visibility](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/drive-safely-in-dense-fog) and high speeds can increase your risk of injury from passing traffic.
* **Vehicle technology** —modern cars come equipped with advanced electronics and systems. A faulty DIY car repair can lead to more costly problems or even accidental damage to safety features.
* **Lack of knowledge or tools** —without up-to-date know-how and specialized tools, you might misdiagnose the issue, damage components or only apply a temporary fix.
* **Towing troubles** —safely towing your vehicle requires specialized equipment and the right technique. Failure to do so can lead to significant damage to your car’s frame or transmission.
* **Warranty implications** — performing certain repairs yourself can void warranties on newer vehicles, costing you more in the long run.

## The benefits of roadside assistance

There are many [reasons you might choose roadside assistance coverage](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/reasons-you-might-want-roadside-assistance-coverage). Opting for professional help through a roadside assistance program can bring several key advantages that go beyond just saving you time:

* **Fast, reliable options** —trained technicians can often resolve common problems, like a flat tire, [dead battery](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-battery-replacement-tips) or lockout, much faster than a DIY attempt, minimizing your time in a potentially vulnerable spot.
* **Prioritized safety** —professionals follow strict safety protocols, like using warning lights or cones, to secure the area, helping to keep you and other drivers safe.
* **Trained technicians** —roadside assistance providers send out professionals equipped with the right tools and expertise to help resolve common roadside issues more quickly and safely.
* **Hassle-free help** —with 24/7 support and potentially quick response times, roadside assistance may help eliminate the stress of searching for a technician or handling repairs on your own, potentially making unexpected breakdowns far less disruptive.
* **Vehicle protection** —using the correct repair methods can help avoid additional damage (which may [save you money in the long run](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-roadside-assistance-coverage-may-save-you-money)) and helps ensure warranty coverage stays intact.
* **Sense of security** —knowing that roadside assistance providers are experienced with many types of vehicles and situations means there is someone who can help, whether you’re stranded in unfamiliar territory or facing bad weather.

## Deciding whether to DIY or call for help

While fixing a flat tire or jump-starting a battery might seem straightforward, the reality is that roadside repairs can go wrong quickly without the right preparation. Here’s a simple comparison of DIY roadside repair risks and the benefits of professional roadside assistance:

**Aspect**

**DIY roadside repair risks**

**Professional roadside assistance benefits**

Safety protocols, less time exposed to danger

Vehicle damage

Potential for further or costly damage

## The bottom line

While knowing a few basics, like [tire maintenance and care](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care), can be helpful, roadside breakdowns can sometimes occur in challenging or even potentially unsafe situations. Attempting complex repairs yourself could worsen vehicle damage, void warranties or put your safety at risk. It’s important to know when to call roadside assistance, which is designed to provide professional help when you need it most, so you can get back on the road safely.

**Looking for more confidence on the road?** Adding [roadside assistance coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) to your auto policy can be a more affordable way to help protect yourself and your passengers from the unexpected.
