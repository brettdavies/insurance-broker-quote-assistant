* **The California FAIR Plan is one of the only home insurers in the state that**[**doesn't publicly disclose**](https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=144:6:17118257528871::NO:RP,6:P6_COMPANY_ID,P6_NAIC:73299,33665&cs=1OEKqHTR2OVhslUzd1G_qCG2bPQA)**basic financial data.**
* **The Department**[**directed the board to increase transparency and accountability**](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0400-reports-examination/upload/CFPA-Operational-Assessment-Report.pdf)**. That was in 2022, and little has changed.**
* **While the FAIR plan does post**[**some point-in-time data and statistics online**](https://www.cfpnet.com/key-statistics-data/)**, its board chooses what to disclose and when.**
**_Update June 9, 2025_** _: Following this investigation, the California FAIR Plan agreed to publicly disclose more information, including the composition of its board, its reinsurance structure and the dates of cash distributions back to its member companies. Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, said in a written statement that "as California's insurer of last resort, the FAIR Plan needs to be more transparent to the public about its operations."_
_While the Plan is not a state agency, it is still regulated by the state's Insurance Commissioner. "Commissioner Lara is using all the tools at his disposal to increase transparency of the FAIR Plan," said Soller.
_
_A representative for the California FAIR Plan, Hillary McLean, said in a written statement that the Plan "collaborated with the California Department of Insurance and the Legislature to help consumers, regulators and industry partners better understand the FAIR Plan's role and responsibilities." She said the Plan will continue to release and update these reports as the information becomes available._
