S&P Global. “[US homeowners insurance rates jump by double digits in 2023.](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/1/us-homeowners-insurance-rates-jump-by-double-digits-in-2023-80057804)” Accessed April 2025.
### Methodology
Insure.com worked with Quadrant Information Service to get homeowners insurance data. We analyzed 20,739,560 insurance quotes from 82 national and regional insurance companies across 34,588 ZIP codes to determine the average premiums.
The insurance rates are based on a sample profile of a homeowner with good credit and the following coverage level:
  * $300,000 dwelling coverage
  * $100,000 liability protection
  * $1000 deductible


We have taken into account 3 important factors such as average annual cost, NAIC score and AM Best rating, to determine the list of best homeowners insurance companies. The quoted insurance rates are for comparison purposes, and your individual rates may vary.
