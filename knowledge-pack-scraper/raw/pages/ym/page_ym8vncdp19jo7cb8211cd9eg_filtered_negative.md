Lemonade homeowners insurance offers budget-friendly coverage and a fully digital experience. It’s also known for its Giveback program, which donates unused premiums to a charity picked by customers. But you can only get home insurance in some states, and it only offers a limited optional coverage options.
Business Insider compared Lemonade to the [best homeowners insurance companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies) and found it to be an affordable option compared to the competition. But it may not be the right home insurance company for everyone, especially if you have comprehensive or specialized needs.
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Pros and Cons
### Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Pros
* May be cheaper than competitors
* Highly rated pet and renters insurance
* Easy online quoting and purchasing process
### Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Cons
* Only available in a limited number of states
* Does not rank in JD Power’s customer and claims satisfaction survey
* May not offer the support you'd receive from companies with more licensed insurance agents
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Overview
Founded in 2015, Lemonade is a rising star in the Insurtech space. It’s popular for its highly rated renters and pet insurance, but it also offers home insurance policies. Aside from providing affordable coverage, the company takes pride in doing things differently. One of the main differences?
The claim payment process is advertised as instantaneous. Auto, home, pet, and life claims can be filed online or through its app. However, the system is highly depersonalized, relying heavily on AI and the policyholders' ability to use its tech-based systems.
It’s also unique in its commitment to social responsibility. Through its Giveback program, Lemonade takes a flat fee from your premium to support its business operations. The rest of your unused premiums are allocated to a nonprofit organization chosen by customers. So, if you’re drawn to companies that center social impact, Lemonade may be a great option for you.
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Plans and Coverage
Lemonade offers coverage for primary homes, cooperatives, condominiums, and renters, but it doesn’t advertise mobile or manufactured home insurance policies.
### The Standard Homeowners Insurance Policy
Lemonade's standard homeowners insurance policies cover the basics, but it may appear underwhelming compared to other insurers that include complimentary additional coverage to their base policy.
With a standard HO-3 insurance policy for a single-family residence, Lemonade covers the following.
* Dwelling: This coverage protects your home and any attached structures, like the garage, from all the listed perils in your home insurance policy. But risks aren't covered if not listed in the policy documents.
* Other structures: Pools, guesthouses, detached garages, and sheds all fall into this coverage category. This coverage is calculated based on the replacement cost of your home.
* Personal property: This part of the policy covers all personal items within the home. Items can include everything from kitchen spatulas to bed frames, but not cars or other motorized vehicles. Insurance agents may recommend coverage limits of $100,000 for condos and $300,000 for single-family homes. You can discuss higher coverage limits with your agent if you have more personal belongings to insure.
* Loss of use: If you are unable to live in your home due to damage, loss of use coverage helps cover the costs of hotels and other living expenses. Especially if you have a mortgage, loss of use helps policyholders maintain their regular mortgage and additional living expenses in balance.
* Personal liability: If a person or their property is injured due to your actions or negligence while they are on your property, personal liability coverage can provide assistance. This can also include coverage for accidents involving broken stairs, a trampoline, or a pool, as well as dog bites, among other potential risks. However, pet owners should be aware of Lemonade's exclusions for its ["high-risk" breeds list](https://www.lemonade.com/homeowners/explained/what-homeowners-insurance-covers/).
* Medical payments: This coverage is for injuries that occur to a guest while on your property. Medical payment coverage typically covers medical bills of up to $5,000.
### Renters Insurance
Lemonade renters insurance helps you replace your personal property if it's damaged or lost due to fire, severe weather, theft, vandalism, and other unexpected perils. It also covers liability, loss of use, and medical expenses in the event that someone is injured at your home.
It also offers riders you can add for an extra premium, such as:
* Enhanced coverage for your valuables
* Your significant other’s stuff
* Water backup
* Pet damage
* Equipment breakdown
### Condo Insurance
Lemonade condo insurance provides dwelling insurance for your interior structure (walls, floors, and ceilings), as well as built-in furniture, appliances, and fixtures. It also covers your personal property, liability, loss of use, and medical payments to others. Your condo association’s master policy generally covers your building’s exterior and shared spaces.
You can also customize your policy with additional coverages like:
* Scheduled personal property
* Equipment breakdown
* Water backup
* Earthquake
* Extended replacement cost
* Identity theft protection
### Additional Coverage Options (Riders) Offered by Lemonade Homeowners Insurance
Compared to more established competitors (think State Farm and GEICO), Lemonade's selection of riders is limited. But it still offers a simple menu that can cover most homeowners’ needs.
* Extended replacement cost: This rider protects you from rising costs by providing up to 50% above your dwelling limit to rebuild your home after a total loss.
* Service line: If your underground pipes, such as sewer, water, or gas lines, are damaged by perils outside of your policy (e.g., tree growth, wear and tear, leaks), this add-on pays to replace them.
* Earthquake: If you live in an area prone to seismic activity, consider this coverage to protect your home from earthquake damage.
* **Ordinance or law:** Older homes may need this endorsement to help with the increased cost of rebuilding your property to meet current building codes.
* **Scheduled personal property:** Enhance your coverage for valuables like jewelry, art, and collectibles.
* **Water backup protection:** Safeguard your sump pump, sewer line, and drains from backups by adding this add-on to your plan.
* Equipment breakdown: Include this rider in your policy to protect yourself from the cost of repairing your appliances due to mechanical failures.
* Personal injury: Defamation, libel, slander, and similar issues can result in tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. This coverage helps you handle the cost of lawsuits related to personal injury.
* **Identity theft:** If someone steals your identity, this rider helps cover the costs of restoring it.
Keep in mind that not all coverages are available in every state. Gathering your own quote can help you determine if you qualify for a certain product based on your location.
Note: Lemonade doesn’t service flood policies. You’ll need to work directly with NFIP for flood insurance if you're getting your home policy through Lemonade.
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Cost
The cost of a Lemonade homeowners insurance policy is $120.75 per month, or $1,449 annually, which is more affordable than many of the major insurance providers. Your actual rates will vary based on the replacement cost and condition of your home, your coverages, your claims history, and other factors.
Note: We requested a quote for a $395,000 home in New Mexico, built in 2018 and owned by a 38-year-old with good credit. We selected New Mexico for its average home insurance costs and chose age 38 to reflect the typical first-time homebuyer.
### Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Discounts
Lemonade’s “Get Discounts Now” feature allows applicants to answer a series of questions about their home to qualify for discounts. Here are the types of discounts that the company offers:
* Multi-policy: Save on your home insurance by buying it with car and/or pet insurance.
* Safety devices: If you have devices that protect your home, such as smoke detectors, sprinklers, water alarms, or temperature sensors, you may qualify for savings on your policy.
* Security devices: Get a discount for having features that prevent a break-in, such asa home security system, deadbolts, and locks.
* Wind protection: If your home is fortified against wind damage, you may qualify for lower rates.
* Home renovations: Updates that improve your home’s safety or efficiency, like replacing your roof or renovating with fire-resistant material, can result in savings on your policy.
* Gated community: If you live in a secure neighborhood, you may be rewarded with cheaper rates.
## How to Purchase and Manage a Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Policy
To get a Lemonade home insurance quote, go to [Lemonade.com](http://lemonade.com), click “Check Our Prices,” then select the “Homeowners” option with any other products you want to buy.
One thing to note is that Lemonade’s application process may take longer, as it doesn’t automatically input pre-filled data from public records about your home. Instead, it asks you to manually provide details yourself. The “do-it-yourself” approach eliminates the need to obtain a quote from an insurance agent over the phone or in person, but it also runs the risk of inaccurate information.
To minimize discrepancies and speed up the process, be sure to have specific details about your home and situation, including:
* Home age
* Square footage
* Home usage (primary, secondary, rented out, unoccupied)
* Home safety features (burglar alarm, fire alarm, sprinklers, etc.)
* Interior and exterior details (construction material, roof shape, home foundation, etc.)
* Number of garages
* Business use?
* Dogs or other exotic animals?
After you buy a home insurance policy, you can manage your account online or via your mobile device. On your digital account, you can:
* Pay your bill
* Manage your policies
* Download your insurance ID cards
* File and track your claim
* Speak to an insurance agent
* Get a quote for other insurance products
Note: Lemonade home insurance is currently available in 29 states. It’s not offered in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
### How to File a Claim with Lemonade Homeowners Insurance
With [Lemonade Homeowners Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/o61fac38dd9c?s3=personal-finance%2Fhomeowners-insurance%2Flemonade-homeowners-insurance-review_1bEPOgslZgQZgBzsNE7esY), the claim-filing process is entirely digital. Once you log in, select "file a claim." Jim, a claims chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, will guide you through the steps.
You’ll be asked to record a video to detail the incident. If you make a mistake, don’t worry. You can always go back and revise your response. If you have police or other documentation, you can scan it through the app.
You can also contact the company at (844) 733-8666 if you need to speak to a Lemonade representative in an emergency. But the fastest way to file a claim is via your mobile app.
Lemonade claims can take anywhere from a few days to several months to settle, depending on your case’s complexity, the number of claims filed at once (like after a disaster), and your state's laws, according to Policygenius.
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Customer Reviews and Ratings
Lemonade received mixed customer reviews. Some users express frustration over the difficulty of reaching a real person over the phone. Others mention that the company has refused to renew their policy. In contrast, some customers have praised the company’s representatives for their professionalism and helpfulness.
It's worth noting that your experience with the company may vary. A good way to ensure a smooth claims process is to understand your coverages and have all your information prepared.
Here’s how the company scored with different review sites:
* Better Business Bureau: 3.3 out of 5
* Trustpilot: 4.1 out of 5
* Consumer Affairs: 3.1 out of 5
In contrast, users are generally satisfied with its mobile app, which has received high ratings from both Google Play and the App Store.
* Google Play: 4.1 out of 5
* App Store: 4.9 out of 5
The table below shows Lemonade ratings from various third-party agencies:
Rating agency | Rating | What it means
---|---|---
Demotech | A | Exceptional financial strength
JD Power (Customer Satisfaction) | Not rated | –
JD Power (Property Claims) | Not rated | –
NAIC | 3.67 | Significantly more complaints than expected for its size
## Lemonade Homeowners Insurance Alternatives
See how Lemonade compares to three other options for home insurance companies: Hippo, Allstate, and Progressive.
### Lemonade vs. Hippo Homeowners Insurance
Hippo homeowners insurance, founded in the same year as Lemonade, is another tech-heavy option for homeowners. However, even though both companies provide an entirely digital experience for customers, that's where the similarities end.
In addition to home insurance, Lemonade offers car, pet, and life insurance. Hippo, on the other hand, only provides home insurance. Hippo also emphasizes preventing claims and provides customers with free smart technology devices to monitor their homes. The company also offers Hippo Home Care, a program with personalized support and checklists for proactive home care.
Policy premiums are similar, and both companies may present challenges for older generations or individuals who struggle with mobile apps and online tools. However, an important thing to keep in mind is that Lemonade and Hippo are not designed to offer comprehensive riders and coverage options you might find with big names like State Farm, Allstate, and Amica.
[Hippo Home Insurance Review](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/hippo-homeowners-insurance-review)
### Lemonade vs. Allstate Homeowners Insurance
[Allstate Homeowners Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/l22c1269308a?s3=personal-finance%2Fhomeowners-insurance%2Flemonade-homeowners-insurance-review_1bE6FIe32bMsArZOliQmsE) is one of the largest insurance providers in the nation. It offers all major personal insurance products, including home, auto, and life insurance. Licensed Allstate insurance agents handle all quotes and claims. If you're looking for one-on-one or in-person support with your policy, you may appreciate this aspect of the company.
Additionally, Allstate agents handle the back-end work, which can streamline the process. As mentioned, Lemonade's quoting process requires information that a homeowner may not have readily available without further research. Allstate agents research for you and look for discounts before returning a quote. This is true whether you only want homeowners or prefer to bundle different insurance policies with the same carrier.
Allstate offers more comprehensive coverage and riders to customize your coverage. But Lemonade is more affordable.
[Allstate Homeowners Insurance Review](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/allstate-homeowners-insurance-review)
### Lemonade vs. Progressive Homeowners Insurance
Progressive homeowners insurance may operate under slightly different names for homeowners insurance, depending on your state. But ultimately, you'd work with the same teams, website, etc. Buyers can also bundle home insurance with auto, motorcycle, and other policies.
Progressive operates primarily online, but it also employs licensed insurance agents to quote and bind insurance policies, appealing to a diverse range of customers. It is worth noting that Progressive also does not have any banned breeds. Instead, each dog is vetted based on personal history and merits.
Lemonade wins in automation. Its app makes it much easier for tech users to file claims, manage their policies, etc. However, Progressive's website is not far behind. Progressive offers more comprehensive riders, discounts, and coverage. More importantly, it’s licensed in all 50 states and Washington, DC.

## FAQ
###  Are dog bites covered by Lemonade homeowners insurance?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Lemonade homeowners coverage usually covers dog bites through personal liability coverage. But there are some exceptions, namely, if your dog has a history of biting or the dog's breed is on the company's "high-risk" list. Common excluded breeds include pit bulls, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, and Great Danes. You can find a complete list on Lemonade's website.
###  How does Lemonade's Giveback Program work?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Lemonade takes a flat fee from annual insurance premiums and donates the remaining amount to customer-selected charities from a pre-approved list. In some years, donations may not be made due to an increase in claims.
###  What do customers say about Lemonade home insurance?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Customers appreciate Lemonade's quick and efficient claims process. Plus, customers report that the app interface is easy to use. But according to some users, Lemonade's chatbot, Maya, isn't always helpful, which can be frustrating for less tech-savvy policyholders.
###  Is Lemonade a good company for homeowners insurance?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Lemonade can be a good company for its affordability and user-friendliness. This is especially true if you're a homeowner who may only need basic coverage for your home. Many customers on ConsumerAffairs have also praised the company for its customer service and claims handling. That said, if you have more comprehensive or complex needs, you may want to consider other options.
###  What are the drawbacks of Lemonade homeowners insurance?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Lemonade homeowners insurance has several drawbacks. First of all, it's a relatively new company. So, while its financial strength is good, its long-term resilience has not been tested by economic downturns and catastrophes as much as its 100-year-old competitors. This can impact your ability to receive claims when you need it.
