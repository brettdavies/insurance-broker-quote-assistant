### Optional State Farm home insurance coverages

Sometimes, standard coverage doesn’t provide enough protection. These optional coverages can fill any gaps in your State Farm policy:

* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/061a634a40/house-rental-96x96-orange_017-maintenance.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/061a634a40/house-rental-96x96-orange_017-maintenance.svg)

  #### Inflation guard

  Inflation guard coverage automatically increases your coverage limits to keep up with the rising costs of repairing or replacing your home or personal belongings.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/ee0f1a4393/law-and-justice-96x96-yellow_027-dossier.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/ee0f1a4393/law-and-justice-96x96-yellow_027-dossier.svg)

  #### Ordinance or law

  If your home needs repair or replacement and updated building codes would make the work more expensive, [**ordinance or law coverage**](/homeowners-insurance/law-and-ordinance-coverage/) pays the extra amount, up to certain limits.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/a0c151e1ba/accidental-tearing-apart-cracking-etc.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/a0c151e1ba/accidental-tearing-apart-cracking-etc.svg)

  #### Earth movement

  Your standard policy won’t cover damage from [**earthquakes**](/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/), mudslides, and other events categorized as earth movement. You can add this coverage to your policy.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/9cc6cc3671/renewable-energy-96x96-blue_013-faucet.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/9cc6cc3671/renewable-energy-96x96-blue_013-faucet.svg)

  #### Water backup

  [**Sewer and drain backups**](/homeowners-insurance/sewer-backup-insurance/) can cause serious damage to your home and its contents. This optional coverage helps cover the cost.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/f37ab321a4/weather-96x96-orange_007-humidity.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/f37ab321a4/weather-96x96-orange_007-humidity.svg)

  #### Mold

  Standard insurance might cover mold if it’s the direct result of a covered peril, such as water infiltration due to a hole in the roof from a fallen tree. But most insurers limit this coverage.

### State Farm industry ratings

While consumer reviews often come from dissatisfied customers, industry ratings paint a more complete picture. Here’s how State Farm stands with three different third-party rating agencies.

| **Rating**  sort ascsort desc | **Score**  sort ascsort desc | **What This Means**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AM Best | A++ | Indicates a strong ability to pay claims |

| NAIC Complaint Index | 1.60 | Higher number of complaints than expected for a company of its size |

## State Farm home insurance discounts

Discounts are important to consider when you’re shopping for insurance because they can make a drastic difference in your premiums. State Farm gives you a few ways to earn them:

* **Home security discount:** Fire safety and security equipment reduce your risk of having to file a claim, so State Farm offers [**home insurance discounts**](/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-discounts/) to customers who have them installed. Eligible equipment includes smoke alarms, burglar alarms, and other home monitoring systems.
* **Roofing discount:** In about half the states it serves, State Farm offers discounts to customers who use certain protective roofing materials that protect against hail damage.
* **Wind mitigation discount:** Homes constructed according to Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety and Florida Building Code standards for wind resistance are eligible for discounts in certain states.

### State Farm insurance bundling options

State Farm rewards customers for having multiple insurance policies with the company. Purchasing both [**auto insurance and home insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) earns you a bundle discount that can save you money on both policies.

Bundle discount details vary by state, so you’ll have to speak with a State Farm agent to find out what discounts you might be eligible for and how much money they can save you on your insurance.

## How to file a home insurance claim with State Farm

No one expects to have to file a homeowners insurance claim. But should the need arise while you’re insured with State Farm, you’ll have a straightforward process to follow:

1. **Mitigate the damage.** Take whatever steps you can safely take to help avoid additional damage.
2. **Document the damage.** Make notes and take photos of the damage. Gather any additional documentation that might be useful in your claim.
3. **File your claim.** You can file from the State Farm website or mobile app, or by calling State Farm to file by phone.
4. **Wait to hear from the claims handler.** State Farm will assign someone to manage your claim. Provide any information they request.
5. **Order repairs.** Once the adjuster has approved your claim settlement, hire vendors to complete the repairs.
6. **Submit invoices.** Save your estimates, contracts, and invoices. Submit the invoices to State Farm, if asked.

## State Farm vs. other insurance companies

Saturated property insurance markets mean lots of competition among insurance companies hoping to send you price quotes to earn your business. Here’s a look at how State Farm compares to two of them.

### State Farm vs. Allstate

[**Allstate**](/homeowners-insurance/companies/allstate/) provides homeowners insurance in all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C. Its standard coverages are similar to State Farm’s, but it offers a wider range of additional coverage options.

Allstate also offers more ways for customers to earn discounts. But its J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating is lower than average, at 631, while State Farm’s is above average, at 643.

State Farm also has lower average premiums. Allstate’s average rate for $300,000 in dwelling coverage is $2,401, while State Farm’s average is $2,133.

### State Farm vs. Progressive

Progressive provides homeowners insurance in all but a handful of states, similar to State Farm. It offers a number of discounts State Farm doesn’t, including discounts for getting a quote at least 10 days before you buy your policy, receiving documents by email, and paying for your 12-month policy up front.

In addition to a bundle discount for home and auto policies, Progressive offers a single deductible for single events that damage both your home and car.

At 634, Progressive’s J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating is also lower than State Farm’s.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services.

To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis.

Default Coverage Assumptions

* **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
* **Deductible:** $1,000
