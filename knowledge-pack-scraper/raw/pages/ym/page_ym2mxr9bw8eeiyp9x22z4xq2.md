## State Farm home insurance discounts
Discounts are important to consider when you’re shopping for insurance because they can make a drastic difference in your premiums. State Farm gives you a few ways to earn them:
  * **Home security discount:** Fire safety and security equipment reduce your risk of having to file a claim, so State Farm offers [**home insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-discounts/) to customers who have them installed. Eligible equipment includes smoke alarms, burglar alarms, and other home monitoring systems.
  * **Roofing discount:** In about half the states it serves, State Farm offers discounts to customers who use certain protective roofing materials that protect against hail damage.

### State Farm insurance bundling options
State Farm rewards customers for having multiple insurance policies with the company. Purchasing both [**auto insurance and home insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) earns you a bundle discount that can save you money on both policies.
Bundle discount details vary by state, so you’ll have to speak with a State Farm agent to find out what discounts you might be eligible for and how much money they can save you on your insurance.
## How to file a home insurance claim with State Farm
No one expects to have to file a homeowners insurance claim. But should the need arise while you’re insured with State Farm, you’ll have a straightforward process to follow:
  1. **Mitigate the damage.** Take whatever steps you can safely take to help avoid additional damage.
  2. **Document the damage.** Make notes and take photos of the damage. Gather any additional documentation that might be useful in your claim.
  3. **File your claim.** You can file from the State Farm website or mobile app, or by calling State Farm to file by phone.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000


Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.
