For the major standard car insurance companies, **USAA, State Farm and American Family Insurance** are three of the best for those with accidents or other infractions on their driving records. While these companies _will_ raise premiums after an accident or other traffic violation, these rate hikes tend to be smaller than those levied by other auto insurance companies. Any of them could be a good fit if you're looking specifically for high-risk auto insurance companies that are reputable and can meet the needs of other drivers in your household, as well.

**Our top picks** for insurance companies that accept non-standard drivers are **[GEICO,](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) [Progressive](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/progressive-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/), and [Kemper](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/kemper-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/)**, which have garnered the highest review scores.
Some large and well-known car insurance companies offer non-standard policies alongside preferred and standard tiers. Most non-standard carriers have a smaller geographical footprint, so they may not be available in every state. Below are some average rates for other companies that accept non-standard drivers.
---|---|---
[GEICO](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) |  $159  |  $954
[Progressive](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/progressive-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) |  $181  |  $1,086
[Infinity](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/infinity-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) |  $233  |  $1,397
[Safe Auto](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/safeauto-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) |  $270  |  $1,618

If you’ve been denied auto insurance, you’re not alone. Some companies — even [non-standard insurers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/standard-insurance-vs-non-standard-insurance/) — may refuse coverage if your driving record includes serious violations or multiple incidents.
In these cases, **assigned risk insurance may be your only option**. It’s a last-resort program for drivers with poor records who can’t get coverage elsewhere.[[1]](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/#footnote-1)
**Your best bet for saving money** is to shop around, compare quotes, and find companies that work with high-risk drivers.

These factors are non-driving related but can still significantly impact car insurance premiums. However, **every state has different laws**, meaning that some of these factors are less impactful than others.

High-risk car insurance details by state Chevron down icon
###  Your financial history
**_Tip:_**_Try to maintain continuous coverage and check if_ [_your state limits the use of credit_](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/credit-insurance-rates/) _in pricing._
###  Where you live and drive
* If you use your car for [**rideshare**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/rideshare-insurance/)**driving or long commutes**, insurers may also charge more to reflect that added risk.
**_Tip:_**_Be sure your policy matches how you actually use your car —_ [_commuter vs. pleasure_](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pleasure-use-vs-commuter-auto-insurance/) _use matters._
###  Your age and experience
**_Tip:_**_Good student_ [_discounts_](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/) _and safe-driving programs can help younger drivers save._
###  Your car and driving record
* [**High-performance**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/sports-car-insurance/)**or luxury vehicles** usually cost more to insure.
**_Tip:_**_Most_ [_points_](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/how-do-license-points-affect-auto-insurance/) _stay on your record for a few years, depending on your state — but shopping around can still lower your rate._

If using your credit score to determine your insurance premium seems unfair to you, you're not alone — some states consider credit score car insurance profiling a discriminatory practice and ban its use in determining car insurance rates.
