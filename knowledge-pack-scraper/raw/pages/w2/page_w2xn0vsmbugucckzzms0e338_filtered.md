## Car insurance for high-risk drivers

High-risk drivers often face higher premiums and fewer choices — but affordable [car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) coverage is still within reach. If you’ve had [multiple traffic violations](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), a [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/), or a serious [accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), insurers may consider you riskier to insure, which can drive up your rates. You’re not alone — and being a high-risk driver doesn’t mean paying the highest rate.

> You’re not alone — and being high-risk doesn’t mean paying the highest rate.

**The good news:** Some [companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) specialize in covering high-risk drivers and offer competitive rates despite your record. Let's look at:

* What it means to be high-risk
* How much you can expect to pay
* Which companies offer the best rates

We recommend starting your search with **[USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/)**, **[State Farm](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/)**, and **[American Family Insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/american-family-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/)** — three providers with solid options for high-risk drivers.

## Best companies for high-risk drivers

As a high-risk driver, you have two options for car insurance:

1. Stick with a standard insurance company and **pay higher rates for better coverage** and service
2. Try a **non-standard carrier that caters to high-risk customers** but may have poorer reviews.

Let's explore both paths.

#### Best standard auto insurance companies

For the major standard car insurance companies, **USAA, State Farm and American Family Insurance** are three of the best for those with accidents or other infractions on their driving records. While these companies *will* raise premiums after an accident or other traffic violation, these rate hikes tend to be smaller than those levied by other auto insurance companies. Any of them could be a good fit if you're looking specifically for high-risk auto insurance companies that are reputable and can meet the needs of other drivers in your household, as well.

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

#### More companies that accept high-risk drivers

**Our top picks** for insurance companies that accept non-standard drivers are **[GEICO,](/insurance-companies/geico-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) [Progressive](/insurance-companies/progressive-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/), and [Kemper](/insurance-companies/kemper-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/)**, which have garnered the highest review scores.

Some large and well-known car insurance companies offer non-standard policies alongside preferred and standard tiers. Most non-standard carriers have a smaller geographical footprint, so they may not be available in every state. Below are some average rates for other companies that accept non-standard drivers.

The Zebra has also reviewed four other non-standard auto insurance companies for you to check out: **[Assurance America](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/assuranceamerica-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/), [Falcon](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/falcon-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/), [The General](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/the-general-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/), and [Direct Auto](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/direct-auto-insurance-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) are worth exploring if you're a high risk driver**. Our reviews discuss customer satisfaction, coverage options, discounts, and more. However, information on average premiums for these companies is limited, which makes it hard to calculate a fair rating.

## Finding car insurance when you've been denied coverage

If you’ve been denied auto insurance, you’re not alone. Some companies — even [non-standard insurers](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/standard-insurance-vs-non-standard-insurance/) — may refuse coverage if your driving record includes serious violations or multiple incidents.

In these cases, **assigned risk insurance may be your only option**. It’s a last-resort program for drivers with poor records who can’t get coverage elsewhere.[[1]](#footnote-1)

To qualify, you’ll need to show that you’ve applied for insurance several times and been denied due to your record. An insurance agent can then file a report with your state, which may approve you for the assigned risk pool.

**Your best bet for saving money** is to shop around, compare quotes, and find companies that work with high-risk drivers.

![no coverage]()

#### Can't get coverage?

Assigned risk insurance may be your next step, but keep in mind:

* Assigned risk coverage is often more expensive than standard insurance.
* Being “too risky” isn’t an official designation — every insurer has its own thresholds.
* The easiest way to find cheap auto insurance as a high-risk driver is to shop around.

---

## What driving factors make you a high-risk driver?

When an insurance company calculates your premium for your [auto insurance policy](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/), they assess driving and non-driving factors to determine how much risk you pose.

First, insurers typically look at the number of violations or citations you've received. Each infraction typically results in a rate hike, but the type of violation and quantity push you further into high-risk territory. If you have one or more of the following points on your record, you may be considered high risk: 

* [At-fault accidents](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/)
* [Speeding tickets](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/)
* Reckless driving charges
* Street racing charges
* [DUIs/DUIs](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/)

Check out the table below to see average rates from top companies for each of these violations.

## What else might make you high-risk — even if you’re a careful driver?

While violations and accidents can lead to higher premiums, a number of personal factors can also influence car insurance rates.

These factors are non-driving related but can still significantly impact car insurance premiums. However, **every state has different laws**, meaning that some of these factors are less impactful than others. The collapsed table below has more information about individual state regulations that may be helpful.

### Your financial history

Even if you’ve [never had an accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/best-car-insurance-good-drivers/), your finances can affect your insurance rates.

* Insurers often use **credit-based insurance scores** to predict how likely you are to file a claim.
* If you’ve had a [**lapse in coverage**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-after-lapsed-coverage/) or a low credit score, you might be seen as a higher risk.

***Tip:*** *Try to maintain continuous coverage and check if* [*your state limits the use of credit*](https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/credit-insurance-rates/) *in pricing.*

![location]()

### Where you live and drive

[Your ZIP code](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/) affects more than just your mail — it shapes your insurance price, too.

* Living in a **high-traffic, high-claim** area usually means higher rates.
* If you use your car for [**rideshare**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/rideshare-insurance/) **driving or long commutes**, insurers may also charge more to reflect that added risk.

***Tip:*** *Be sure your policy matches how you actually use your car —* [*commuter vs. pleasure*](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pleasure-use-vs-commuter-auto-insurance/) *use matters.*

![driving experience]()

### Your age and experience

New drivers are more likely to file claims — and insurers know it.

* [**Teenagers**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) and drivers with limited experience **typically pay more.**
* **Some states also factor in your** [**age**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/) directly when calculating your rate.

***Tip:*** *Good student* [*discounts*](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/) *and safe-driving programs can help younger drivers save.*

![]()

### Your car and driving record

Both the type of car, and the way you drive it, matter.

* [**High-performance**](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/vehicles/sports-car-insurance/) **or luxury vehicles** usually cost more to insure.
* If you have **points from tickets or violations**, expect those to raise your rate, too.

***Tip:*** *Most* [*points*](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/how-do-license-points-affect-auto-insurance/) *stay on your record for a few years, depending on your state — but shopping around can still lower your rate.*

If you have poor or low credit, Nationwide, GEICO and USAA will likely offer the cheapest policies.

If using your credit score to determine your insurance premium seems unfair to you, you're not alone — some states consider credit score car insurance profiling a discriminatory practice and ban its use in determining car insurance rates.

![Nicholas Fernandez — Senior manager of agency at The Zebra]()

Agent insight: When am I no longer considered a high-risk driver?

"Unfortunately, the only real way to shake off a "high-risk" distinction is with time. To an insurance company, customers are no longer considered high risk after remaining infraction-free for some years. The more serious the violation, the more years insurance companies want to see pass: 3-5 years with no accidents and 7-10 years with no license suspensions or revocations will mean you are no longer high-risk."

***Nicholas Fernandez — Senior manager of agency at The Zebra***

## How to save money on high-risk auto insurance

![bullet]()

Take a defensive driving course

This solution won’t help if you already have the ticket on your record, but it’s something to keep in mind. Some states even allow you to take a defensive driving course in lieu of having points added to your record. Consider our partner, iDriveSafely, for an online defensive driving course. Available in nearly every state, the skills you learn in this course may help you become a safer driver, thus avoiding traffic violations and accidents. Learn more about [iDriveSafely's defensive driving courses](https://www.idrivesafely.com/?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=ins&utm_campaign=i-5714610213-drvhpp&ajs_event=Partner%20Link%20Clicked&ajs_prop_subId=cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers).

![bullet]()

Improve your credit score

Improving your credit score from poor to excellent can save you more than $1,400 per year on auto insurance! On average, you can save about 17% with every credit score bracket you move up. According to The Zebra's rate data, drivers with poor credit (scores between 300 and 579) **pay $137 more per month for car insurance** than drivers with very good credit (between 740 and 799).

![bullet]()

Go car-free for a while

If you’re a high-risk driver, you’re going to be paying quite a bit more for car insurance. If you can’t afford car insurance currently and can get by using public transportation, a bicycle, or rideshare services, try going car-free. Bear in mind that a gap in insurance coverage can lead to higher rates down the line, so a non-owner policy could be a good option in the meantime.

![bullet]()

Compare insurance quotes

This is the most effective way to save money on auto insurance. Not all insurance companies will rate or charge you for your violations equally. There is a lot of variation between companies and the only way to know you're getting the [best rate possible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/how-to-shop/best-cheap-auto-insurance/) is to compare [auto insurance quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) near the end of each policy period.

![bullet]()

Exercise caution before filing a collision claim

These claims can dramatically increase your premium. So, even if it seems cheaper in the short term to file a claim, you could ultimately end up paying much more in the long run. See our guide discussing [when and when not to file an insurance claim](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/) (featuring our free claims calculator tool!) for more information.

#### Should you file a claim?

* Get an estimate for the out-of-pocket expense at a local repair shop
* Use The Zebra's [State of Insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/state-of-insurance/auto/2022/) study or [claims calculator](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/) to see how much an at-fault accident would raise rates in your state
* Compare the out-of-pocket expenses to the rate increase plus your [deductible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-deductibles/) in case it's cheaper to pay for the damage yourself

## High-risk car insurance FAQs

How much is high-risk car insurance?
Chevron down icon

High-risk drivers will pay more for car insurance. However, the increase in your premiums will vary [depending on a number of variables](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/). For example, a DUI/DWI conviction can raise your premiums by around 96%, which adds up to an extra $1,680 per year. On the other hand, a speeding ticket could increase the annual cost by an average of $431.

Which company has the cheapest car insurance for high-risk drivers?
Chevron down icon

This depends on your situation, but among the major carriers, [USAA](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) tends to provide the cheapest coverage for drivers in a number of high-risk categories, such as at-fault accidents and speeding tickets. However, as USAA is only available to those in the military (or their immediate family members), other carriers offering lower rates include GEICO, Nationwide and State Farm. Chances are a major carrier will not offer the cheapest rate, so it might be worth looking into a carrier that specializes in high-risk insurance.

What if I can’t find auto insurance coverage?
Chevron down icon

If you are denied coverage from a standard carrier, your best bet is to look for what’s known as a [non-standard carrier](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/standard-insurance-vs-non-standard-insurance/). These insurance companies specialize in insuring drivers who don’t have the cleanest driving records. While you may forego some of the perks offered by standard carriers like GEICO or State Farm, you will be more likely to find coverage. However, if your driving record is such that even non-standard carriers are wary of taking you, most states have what is known as a high-risk pool. Your state can mandate that insurance companies provide auto coverage to these drivers, but beware, this coverage is not cheap.

You should be able to purchase a non-owners insurance policy and have an SR22 attached to that policy to meet the state requirement. It would be impossible to install an interlock device if you don't have a vehicle so I would recommend contacting your probation officer or attorney to discuss y…

If your friend was pulled over without insurance, they would be the one to receive the ticket. However, if they caused an accident, the other party may be able to come after you AND your friend for damages. This is because you are the owner of the car and required by law, as an owner, to have insur…

Great question! While it can vary by carrier, most car insurance companies will charge (i.e. increase your premium) for any ticket or violation within the past 3 years. You typically won't be charged for anything that happened beyond three years ago, however, insurance companies will still pul…
