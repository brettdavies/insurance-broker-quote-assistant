Those looking for a number of [car insurance discount options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/) are likely to be let down. This is because Root Insurance states that it applies discounts at the onset of your policy. This is done by measuring a driver's habits through the initial test drive. Essentially, this is a safe driver discount. As such, the only real discounts drivers should expect are the following:

Root is competitive with other big-name insurance companies, offering standard [collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/), [comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) and [liability coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) for [bodily injury](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/).
They also offer coverages for drivers in states with unique coverage requirements, like [personal injury protection](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/pip-insurance/) (PIP), [uninsured and underinsured motorist](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) and [medical payments](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/medical-payments-coverage-auto-insurance/) coverage. Root's **additional coverage options are limited** so customers with special coverage needs may have to look elsewhere. Drivers who only need standard coverage should find Root sufficient for most needs.

Root is an insurance company that is trying to do things differently. However, that doesn't mean that they will necessarily have the best insurance rates available. Because it measures your driving habits through a mobile app, Root car insurance may not be the best choice for [high-risk drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) or those who find themselves driving an excessive amount. Things like hard braking and mileage are measured and incorporated into your insurance rates. However, if you are a relatively safe driver, you might even be able to save money. With a wide range of car insurance coverage options, it could be a good fit for many motorists.
