Buying a home means you also need to buy something else: homeowners insurance. And while you may have bigger expenses, how much you pay for insurance will affect your home ownership costs.
The national [average cost of home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/average-homeowners-insurance-cost) is $2,110 a year, according to NerdWallet’s most recent rate analysis. But the amount you pay could be more or less, depending on many factors. Here’s how to get a better idea of what your home insurance might cost.
## How to estimate your home insurance
Where you live is an important factor in determining your home insurance premiums. Use the homeowners insurance calculator below to find the average cost of home insurance in your ZIP code, based on a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage, $300,000 in liability coverage and a $1,000 deductible.
You can also estimate your home insurance costs by following the steps below. This process may provide you with a home insurance estimate that’s closer to what you’d actually pay if your home doesn’t fit the profile used for the calculator. Read more about our [methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/estimate-home-insurance#methodology).

### 1. Decide how much coverage you need
A typical [homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-insurance-companies) policy includes six types of coverage:
  * [Dwelling](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners), which pays for damage to the main structure of your home.
  * [Other structures](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/other-structures-coverage), which covers unattached structures like sheds and fences.
  * [Personal property](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance), which covers your belongings.
  * [Loss of use](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage), which pays for additional living expenses if you need to move while your home is repaired.
  * [Personal liability](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-liability-insurance-homeowners), should you hurt someone else or damage their property.
  * [Medical payments](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners), which pays to treat someone injured on your property, regardless of fault. It also may pay if you, a family member or a pet injures someone away from your home.


Each of these types of insurance comes with its own limit. You’ll pay more for higher limits, but the extra coverage will give you more financial protection if disaster strikes.
Typically, you need enough dwelling coverage to pay the cost of completely rebuilding your home. An insurance agent can help you estimate this amount.
Insurance companies often calculate several of the other coverage limits as a percentage of your dwelling coverage — such as 10% for other structures, 50% to 70% for personal property and 20% for loss of use.
Liability coverage usually starts at $100,000 and can be higher depending on your needs. Medical payments coverage typically has a low limit, between $1,000 and $5,000.
Nerdy Perspective
Choosing the right amount of coverage for the structure of your home can be tricky. Get too much, and you’ll overpay for your insurance. Too little, and you might not get enough money from the insurance company to rebuild your home after a disaster. I give myself peace of mind by buying [guaranteed replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/guaranteed-replacement-cost), which means my policy will pay what it takes to rebuild my home after a disaster, even if it’s more than my dwelling coverage limit.

### 2. Evaluate your home
Your house's physical characteristics affect the cost of insurance. These could include:
  * The home’s age.
  * What materials your house is made of.
  * The condition of the roof.
  * The size of your home.
  * Whether the house has any custom features or high-end finishes.
  * Whether the house is up to current building codes.
  * The size and number of other structures such as sheds or fencing.


Additionally, a swimming pool or [trampoline](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/trampoline-home-insurance) could mean higher premiums because insurance companies consider these features to be a liability risk.
Insurers also weigh factors about where you live, such as the threat of natural disasters, the local crime rate and how close the home is to the coast.
🤓Nerdy Tip
Let your insurer know if you get a new roof or make other major renovations to your home. These changes could affect your coverage requirements or even get you a discount.
» MORE:[How much does it cost to buy a house?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-house)
### 3. Choose your insurance deductible
Your insurance deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket for a covered claim before insurance kicks in. A typical [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible) ranges from $500 to $2,000.
The higher the deductible you set, the lower your premium. However, you should consider whether the annual savings are worth paying a higher amount in an emergency. If you might not have enough to cover the deductible, choose a lower amount.
If you live in a part of the country that’s prone to hurricanes, [tornadoes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-tornado-damage) or hailstorms, you may have a separate deductible for damage from wind or hail. These deductibles are often a percentage of your home’s dwelling coverage. For example, if you have a 2% hail deductible on a home with $250,000 of dwelling coverage, your deductible for a hail claim would be $5,000.
### 4. Consider extra coverage
You may want coverage for events that a standard home insurance policy [won’t cover](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-insurance-exclusions). Examples include [floods](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance), [earthquakes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance), sinkholes and [backed-up drains](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage). Though this extra coverage will cost you more, it could come in handy if your home is at risk.
Learn more about [common home insurance endorsements](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance#endorsements).
### 5. Get quotes
Many insurers offer online tools for estimating how much their home insurance will cost. These features typically use a limited set of information, but they will at least give a sense of your potential costs.
We recommend you get at least three [home insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/home-insurance-quotes) to find the most competitive one. Make sure each quote has similar deductibles and coverage limits.

Frequently asked questions
How do I pay my homeowners insurance premiums?
If you have a mortgage, you can choose to have your lender pay your homeowners insurance bill through your [escrow account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/escrow-account). Otherwise, you’ll have to pay the bill yourself. Depending on your insurance company, you may be able to divide your bill into installments, have payments taken directly out of your bank account or otherwise pay in a way that’s convenient for you.
Will my homeowners insurance rate go up every year?
It may. Even if you don’t file a claim, insurance companies often raise rates to reflect inflation. (Because of the increased cost of labor and supplies, your house probably costs a little more to rebuild this year than it did last year.) Insurance companies may also raise rates if they’ve had to pay a lot of claims for big disasters such as hurricanes or [wildfires](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/wildfire-insurance).
Does my insurance company have to let me know in advance when my rate goes up?
It depends on where you live. Many states require insurance companies to give you advance notice if your premium is going up, especially if the increase is significant. This generally ranges from 10 to 60 days.

## NerdWallet home insurance calculator methodology
NerdWallet offers a ZIP-code-based calculator to help you estimate your homeowners insurance premium. NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from a variety of insurance companies in the largest 25 cities in each state by population.
Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:
  * $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
  * $30,000 in other structures coverage.
  * $150,000 in personal property coverage.
  * $60,000 in loss of use (additional living expenses) coverage.
  * $300,000 in liability coverage.
  * $1,000 in medical payments coverage.


We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.
These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.
