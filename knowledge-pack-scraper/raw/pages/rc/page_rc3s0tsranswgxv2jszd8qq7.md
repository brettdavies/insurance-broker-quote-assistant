## Root Insurance: A fair choice for low-mileage, good drivers
Root is a newer name in the insurance space, offering auto coverage built entirely around telematics. After enrolling, drivers use the Root app to track their habits and mileage — and those insights help determine your rate.
As a tech-first insurer, Root earns high marks for its digital experience. That said, its claims handling and customer service still have room to grow. Based on these factors, The Zebra gives Root a **fair** rating.
What customers like:
  * **Ease of Filing a Claim:** Root's multiple filing options make submitting claims simple and quick.
  * **Integration with Other Platforms:** Root connects with payment apps and devices for added convenience.


What customers don't like:
  * **Agent Knowledge and Helpfulness:** Root's staff may be unable to provide answers and require multiple contacts.
  * **Transparency in Process and Timeline:** Root's lack of transparency leaves you uncertain about claim status.


### How The Zebra evaluates insurance companies
Rating | Explanation | Star rating equivalent  
---|---|---  
Subpar  |  Lowest ranking, suggesting instability or high risk  |  0-1.9   
Fair  |  Somewhat stable but not consistently reliable  |  2-2.9   
Good  |  Generally dependable with moderate stability  |  3-3.9   
Solid  |  Strong, reliable and dependable with minor risks  |  4-4.4   
Exceptional  |  Highest rating, indicating outstanding stability and reliability  |  4.5-5   
#### Methodology — how The Zebra reviews insurance companies
The team of insurance experts at The Zebra evaluates companies by focusing on **customer experience first** , with an emphasis on service quality, reliability, and ease of interaction. Unlike previous models, **pricing is not scored** but is instead presented separately as context for comparison. 
Each category has been scored using a combination of our internal customer satisfaction survey results and published scores from reputable organizations such as AM Best and J.D. Power. 
  * **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%): **This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
  * **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
  * **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%): **This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
  * **Trust & Reliability (25%): **This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.


**Price context:**_Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided._

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

## Discounts offered at Root: Limited options 
Those looking for a number of [car insurance discount options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/) are likely to be let down. This is because Root Insurance states that it applies discounts at the onset of your policy. This is done by measuring a driver's habits through the initial test drive. Essentially, this is a safe driver discount. As such, the only real discounts drivers should expect are the following: 
Multi-policy
[Bundle your auto and home insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/) for a discount through Root Insurance.
Good driving record
If you maintain a good driving record, you may save money as a Root customer. This begins with three years of clean driving, with the possibility of further discounts at the five-year mark.
Low mileage
Root drivers who drive less than average can earn a savings of around 6%.
Common discounts offered at Root
Safe driver discount | Driver status discount

## Root's customer service & claims experience: easily available, not always helpful
Root's customer service is impressive when dealing things such as policy and availibity. Unfortunately, when it come to their claims experience, the overall service is less than desirable.
###  Excellent company 
"What made my experience great, honestly, was the price. I’m really hoping to get the lowest rate again, especially with how tough the economy is. I found this company through Credit Karma’s recommendation, and so far, everything’s gone smoothly — no problems at all.”
**_-Trustpilot_**
###  Insurance made easy 
"Everything from start to finish worked out great! Very easy, decent quote, and provided me with what I needed to get my truck on the road!"
**_-Trustpilot_**
###  Root's pricing and customer service make them worth it 
"I've had GEICO and State Farm, but Root has been a fraction of the cost. I have had to use Root's extra services, like Roadside Assistance and Towing, which has been extremely prompt and great to work with. All in all, I would suggest Root to anyone who would qualify for their insurance."

Claims process: Efficient but not always transparent
Root's claims process is accessible online and via their mobile app, making it convenient for policyholders. While simple claims are often resolved quickly, more complex cases can lead to longer wait times. Customer satisfaction surveys consistently place Root in the middle tier, indicating they offer reliable service but may struggle with handling complicated claims efficiently.

Root is competitive with other big-name insurance companies, offering standard [collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/collision-insurance/), [comprehensive](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-insurance/) and [liability coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) for [bodily injury](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/).

Root's **additional coverage options are limited** so customers with special coverage needs may have to look elsewhere. Drivers who only need standard coverage should find Root sufficient for most needs.

## Final thoughts: Is Root Right for You?
Root is an insurance company that is trying to do things differently. However, that doesn't mean that they will necessarily have the best insurance rates available. Because it measures your driving habits through a mobile app, Root car insurance may not be the best choice for [high-risk drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) or those who find themselves driving an excessive amount. Things like hard braking and mileage are measured and incorporated into your insurance rates. However, if you are a relatively safe driver, you might even be able to save money. With a wide range of car insurance coverage options, it could be a good fit for many motorists.
## Frequently Asked Questions about Root
What kind of insurance is Root? Chevron down icon
Root is a telematics-based insurer that sets rates based on your driving behavior, safety, and mileage. In the 35 states in which Root operates, they offer traditional auto insurance liability policies, which provide bodily injury liability coverage, property damage coverage, and may offer medical payments, personal injury protection, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, depending on your state's requirements.
How does Root Insurance work? Chevron down icon
Root uses driving data from your phone during the test drive to determine your good driving habits. If you qualify, you'll get a great final rate based on your good driving. If they can't continue to insure you, they'll let you know as soon as possible based on your state's laws.
Is Root Insurance worth it? Chevron down icon
You may benefit from this type of pricing if you're a safe driver but have high car insurance rates, which is usually the case for teens and young adults. Drivers with poor credit may also want to consider Root, as the company has promised to eliminate credit scores from its pricing model by 2025.
