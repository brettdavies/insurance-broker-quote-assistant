Minimum insurance in California ensures that drivers have the financial means to cover damages or injuries resulting from an accident, whether they’re at fault or not. If you have been injured due to another’s negligence, you should seek legal services from an experienced personal injury [lawyer](https://www.rosenstockandazran.com/lawyers/david-a-azran/) to recover compensation.
* $60,000 covers injury or [death](https://www.rosenstockandazran.com/personal-injury/wrongful-death/) to multiple people
The $30,000/$60,000 terminology means that the most the insurance company will pay on a given loss is $30,000 per person, and $60,000 for the entire incident, regardless of how many persons make a claim against the policy of insurance. If there is only one claimant, the most the insurance company will pay for that claim Is $30,000.
Of course, the claimant will have to prove that the claim has a value of $30,000 or more in order to persuade the insurance company to pay the $30,000 policy limit. If there are two claimants, the most any one claimant can collect from the insurer is $30,000, and the most that the insurer will pay the two claimants is $60,000, combined. No problem.

While California insurance law requires only the minimum auto insurance coverage, drivers can choose to purchase additional types of insurance to provide more comprehensive financial protection. You may also negotiate auto insurance discounts with the provider of your insurance policy. Depending on your personal financial profile and ability to afford insurance, it may be advisable to purchase automobile insurance with bodily injury liability policy limits greater than the minimum statutory requirements.
![Arbitrator reviewing documents during a UM/UIM insurance dispute hearing](https://www.rosenstockandazran.com/static/2025/04/image.png)
Where an uninsured motorist causes the accident and injuries result therefrom, the insured driver who was not at fault may make a claim against his own insurance company pursuant to the uninsured motorist provisions of their policy of insurance. In that event, the insurer will be obligated to the policyholder all amounts, up to the UM policy limits, which the uninsured at fault driver would otherwise be legally obligated for.
Thereafter, your insurance company may have a right of subrogation, wherein they could make a claim against the uninsured motorist and, although it may not be collectible, that judgment would stick to the uninsured motorist, with the legal consequences attributable to having a judgment against them. A policy holder’s UM claim is not adjudicated in court, yet instead is to be resolved by way of Arbitration.
It should be noted that, from a somewhat philosophical standpoint, the relationship between the insurer and the claimant in an UM claim creates an anomaly In the law. The policyholder, who has been loyally paying their insurance policy premiums on time, and is a member of the insurance company’s “family”, is put in a position where their own insurance company is now their adversary who is making every effort to deprive the claimant of insurance benefits they thought they were getting by buying this type of coverage.

In that scenario, assuming you are able to prove that the other driver was at fault for the collision, and their insurance company has accepted liability, they will pay the full cost of your repairs up to their property damage liability policy limit, with no deduction for a deductible.
