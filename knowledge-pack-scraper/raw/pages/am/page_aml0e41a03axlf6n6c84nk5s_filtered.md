WHAT FACTORS AFFECT THE COST OF HOME INSURANCE FOR SENIORS?

The cost of home insurance for seniors depends on several factors that insurers use to assess risk.

* Location and local risk (crime rates, weather hazards)
* Age and condition of the home
* Coverage limits and deductibles chosen
* Safety features like alarms or reinforced roofs
* Credit score and claims history

### Cheapest Homeowners Insurance for Seniors with Bad Credit

**AIG Insurance** offers the cheapest homeowners insurance for seniors with bad credit, averaging about $144 per month for $250K in dwelling coverage. 

Poor credit raises rates because insurers see it as a higher risk indicator, even if you’ve never filed a claim. However, some states, including California, Maryland and Massachusetts, don’t allow insurers to use credit scores when setting home insurance rates, which helps protect seniors with lower credit.
