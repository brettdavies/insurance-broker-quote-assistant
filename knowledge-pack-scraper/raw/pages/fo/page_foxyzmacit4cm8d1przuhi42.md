# What is a clean driving record?
A clean driving record is defined as a motor vehicle record (MVR) with no violations, at-fault accidents, or traffic-related convictions for a set amount of time. It's the ideal situation for any driver, but a violation doesn't completely negate the chance for a clean driving record in the future. A clean driving record can lower your car insurance rate because you are considered a lower risk driver to insure.

## How can you get a clean driving record?
If you are a violation-free driver with no tickets, accidents, or convictions, then you will have a clean driving record in your state. Depending on the state, you can also have a clean driving record after violations fall off your record. For states that use a point-based system for violations, they can remain on your record for three to five years, depending on the state and the severity of the offense. Learn [how tickets impact insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-tickets-impact-insurance/).
## How does a clean driving record impact insurance?
Your [motor vehicle record](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-a-motor-vehicle-record/) is one of the main factors that influence [auto insurance rates](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-car-insurance-cost/). One of the best ways to keep your auto insurance premiums low is to maintain a clean driving record. A clean record shows that you're a safe driver and a lower risk to insure. On the other hand, moving violations, accidents, and convictions can raise rates significantly. Learn more about [how accidents impact car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-accidents-impact-insurance/) and [how auto insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-101/).
## How do I check my driving record?
To check your driving record, you can obtain a copy of your driving record through your state's department of motor vehicles (DMV). Some states provide online records for immediate viewing while others may require you to mail in a form or make an in-person visit. You'll likely need proof of a valid driver's license, and a small fee may apply.
Your driving record will include a report of all vehicular violations, typically within the past three to five years. If you live in a state that uses a points system, you can also view how many points are on your driving record. Learn more about [car insurance requirements by state](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/). 
## How do I deal with an error on my driving record?
If an error exists on your driving record, you'll need to file a request to dispute. Filing a dispute varies from state to state, but most require you to fill out a form through the state DMV or insurance department. The form will likely ask for your driver's license and vehicle information and specific details about the error you are disputing.
Once you file a claim, your state will research — and hopefully correct — the error. Be prepared to be patient — this process can take some time.
## How to get points off your license
If you live in a state with a points system, taking safe driving classes or disputing a ticket may help reduce the points on your license. However, the process of getting points off your driving record differs by state, and not all states offer point reduction options. For example, Delaware may give drivers a [three-point credit](https://www.dmv.de.gov/DriverServices/drivers_license/index.shtml?dc=dr_lic_violation) toward future points/violations if they complete an optional defensive driving course.
