## Getting Auto Insurance Coverage After a DUI

After a DUI, it’s important to have the right auto insurance coverage to stay legal and protect yourself financially.

Drivers with a DUI are often seen as high-risk, which means higher premiums and stricter coverage requirements. You may also be required to file [SR-22 insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/sr-22-auto-insurance/) if your license was suspended or revoked after a DUI.

![SR-22 Insurance Definition Card: Cheap Auto Insurance After a DUI](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "SR-22 Insurance Definition Card: Cheap Auto Insurance After a DUI")![SR-22 Insurance Definition Card: Cheap Auto Insurance After a DUI](https://www.quote.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SR-22-Insurance-Definition-Card.png "SR-22 Insurance Definition Card: Cheap Auto Insurance After a DUI")

An SR-22, or FR-44 filing in some states, is a certificate required to prove you have the minimum insurance needed after a DUI. A few states also require additional coverage or higher liability limits for high-risk drivers.

The right mix of coverage helps you meet state laws and reduce the cost of accidents or damages. The types of auto insurance coverage after a DUI include:

* **Liability Insurance:** [Liability auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/liability-auto-insurance/) covers injuries or property damage you cause to others; required in most states and the minimum needed after a DUI.
* **Collision Coverage:** Pays for repairs to your car if you cause an accident, which can help avoid large repair bills.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Covers non-accident damage like theft, vandalism, or weather-related damage.
* **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** Protects you if you’re hit by someone who doesn’t have enough insurance.

Getting enough coverage after a DUI may cost more, but it helps you stay insured, avoid fines, and rebuild a clean driving record.

Before you decide, it’s smart to compare quotes from several companies, since prices can vary widely depending on your state, driving history, and credit score.

## Ways to Save Auto Insurance Rates After a DUI

Your auto insurance rates will go up after a DUI, but don’t be tempted to cancel your coverage. Gaps in your insurance will lead to even higher rates in the future, so compare quotes and discounts online to find the cheapest DUI insurance near you.

Instead, drivers can still get cheap car insurance with a DUI by adjusting coverage, improving driving habits, and managing their policies more efficiently.

#### Drivers with a DUI can lower their auto insurance costs by comparing quotes, completing a defensive driving course, and keeping continuous coverage without gaps.

Brad Larson
**Licensed Insurance Agent**

By comparing rates and using a mix of discounts and practical strategies, drivers can save hundreds each year despite their driving record.

These methods work well alongside traditional discounts and can make a big difference in keeping premiums affordable while rebuilding your record. Practical ways to save on auto insurance after a DUI include:

* **Choose a Cheaper Car to Insure:** Driving a safe, used, or low-horsepower vehicle helps reduce repair and replacement costs, leading to lower insurance rates.
* **Increase Your Deductible:** Raising your [insurance deductible](https://www.quote.com/blog/insurance-deductible/) from $500 to $1,000 can cut monthly premiums without changing your coverage limits.
* **Review and Adjust Coverage:** If your vehicle is older or has a lower value, dropping collision or comprehensive coverage can reduce overall costs.
* **Complete a Defensive Driving Course:** Finishing these programs shows insurers you’re improving as a driver, often leading to premium reductions over time.
* **Compare Rates Often:** Shopping around every six to twelve months ensures you’re getting the best price, especially as your driving record improves.

When it comes to discounts from major insurers, Progressive offers the highest potential savings — up to 30% for completing a defensive driving course.

Geico and Liberty Mutual follow with strong bundling and multi-vehicle discounts of up to 25%.
