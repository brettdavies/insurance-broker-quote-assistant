## What Does Non-Disclosure Mean?

## What Does Non-Disclosure Mean?

**Non-disclosure refers to the act of not revealing** or withholding information that is relevant. It can occur in various contexts, such as legal agreements, contracts, or situations where there is an obligation or expectation to provide complete and accurate information.

This information may be related to previous claims, prior insurance coverage, or other factors that may affect the risk or premium of the policy.

**Non-disclosure of material facts is considered a violation of the duty** of utmost good faith, which is a legal requirement in insurance policies. When an insured fails to disclose or provides false information, it can have serious consequences.

If the non-disclosure is discovered by the company after a claim is filed, they may have grounds to deny it or cancel the policy. This is because the insurer relies on accurate and complete information to assess the risk and determine the appropriate premium.

It is important for insured individuals to be honest and transparent during the application process to ensure they receive the coverage they need and to avoid potential problems in the future. Providing accurate and truthful information helps establish a fair and mutually beneficial relationship between the insured and the company.

## How Does Non-Disclosure Work at PSIC?

At PSIC, we protect you and your family. Insurance policies are contracts where trust is crucial. It is a pact between the parties, which is why your word is very important when determining the price and designing your coverage.

We suggest that you inform yourself and seek advice from your producer regarding the non-disclosure clause before purchasing your protection. This guarantees that all relevant information is disclosed to the insurer, allowing for accurate pricing and appropriate coverage.

Transparency and open communication are key in establishing a solid insurance relationship, and we are here to guide you through the process and address any concerns you may have.

As you know, the terminology in the insurance world can be very technical, and mistakes can happen. That’s why we recommend that you seek advice from a producer to provide accurate information throughout the process.
