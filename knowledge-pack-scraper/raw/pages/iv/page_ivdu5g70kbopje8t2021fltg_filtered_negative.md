Geico has no risk for homes in any state. Policy’s are bundled but they are with different company’s and the policy is serviced by GEICO all profit no risk

What? They have risk in every policy and rely on reinsurance to reduce that risk.

GEICO learned their lesson about homeowners insurance from the incredible losses from Hurricane Andrew and got out of the biz, only acting as a broker now.

Yup, I remember. Geico had the best rep in the homeowner insurance biz, especially for Hurricane Andrew. At first, they rolled everything over to Travelers.

Geico insurers absolutely 0 homes anywhere. They are broker. That is all. We take the payments etc, sell it.
I’m not even sure how involved we are with asking questions about policy related things
It’s the one thing Geico did well imo. No risk, all reward
State Farm is likely to take a big hit with this though. I know they pulled out a lot but I’m sure they still insure a lot of homes there

Heard between 300-400 claims from it so far. Won’t really see much of an impact.

I assume you mean estimates of GEICO's losses, as the total losses are in the tens of billions.
