**Bankrate’s take:** Car insurance companies take gender into account when determining risk. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db400.htm), males are statistically more likely to be involved in car accidents. Insurers see that increased risk and often charge men more for insurance coverage to compensate.
