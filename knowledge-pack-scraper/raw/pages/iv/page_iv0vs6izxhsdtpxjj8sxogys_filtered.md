## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Arizona

There are a few states where age and gender are not factored into your car insurance rates due to state regulations, but Arizona isn’t one of them.

In general, [auto insurance rates go down with age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/).

**Bankrate’s take:**
Car insurance companies take gender into account when determining risk. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db400.htm), males are statistically more likely to be involved in car accidents. Insurers see that increased risk and often charge men more for insurance coverage to compensate.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in Arizona

Car insurance premiums are largely based on risk assessments. In general, the younger and less experienced a driver is, the riskier they are to insure. While there may be no way around this other than time, there are still some ways younger drivers might save money on their auto insurance.

Young drivers are often charged different premiums depending on whether they have their own insurance policy or are on their parent's policy. Generally, drivers under 18 have to be on their parent's policy. Still, drivers between 18 and 25 may still save money on premiums by being on their parent's policy.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Arizona?

Having a driving incident like a speeding ticket, at-fault accident or a DUI conviction on your record will likely increase your Arizona auto insurance rates. These incidents could cause insurance companies to view you as a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), meaning you might be more likely to cause accidents and file claims in the future. Insurers will typically add a surcharge to your premium for a few years, likely as long as the incident is officially on your motor vehicle record. For instance, drivers with a DUI conviction in Arizona pay, on average, 101 percent more for full coverage than someone with a clean driving record.

The table below shows how different driving incidents can impact rates when compared to the average cost of car insurance in Arizona for a driver with a clean driving record.

| Driving incident Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending | Avg. annual premium\* in Arizona Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending | Percentage increase from Arizona avg. annual premium\* Caret Up IconSort arrow ascending  Caret Down IconSort arrow descending |

| [At-fault accident](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-after-an-accident/) | $3,732 | +41% |
| [DUI conviction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) | $5,305 | +101% |

\*The table above compares driving records with different incidents and highlights how much, on average, these incidents tend to raise rates. \*The rates reflected are for full coverage policies.

## Car insurance rates in Arizona by credit tier

Arizona, like most states, allows insurers to use [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) when calculating rates. Insurers use credit information to help determine risk levels for drivers. People with higher credit scores typically enjoy lower rates, while those with credit scores considered poor may face much higher insurance rates overall. For example, a driver with a poor credit rating in Arizona pays, on average, 85 percent more per year for full coverage auto insurance.

## How to save on car insurance in Arizona

The average cost of car insurance in Arizona might be close to the national average, but there may be opportunities for some drivers to save a little bit more money. From safer driving to switching carriers to pursuing discounts, there are often several avenues to pursue when aiming to save money on car insurance. By utilizing some of these tips below, you may be able to save on your auto insurance policy:

* **Take a defensive driving course**. Some car insurance companies offer discounts to drivers who take an approved [safe driving course](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/defensive-driving-courses/). Though you will typically need to pay for the class upfront, you could receive the discount for multiple years, which may result in significant savings.
* **Enroll in a telematics program**. Many car insurance companies offer their own [usage-based telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usage-based-insurance/) that track and reward safe driving habits. If you’re already a safe driver or want to improve, this could be a useful opportunity. Keep in mind, though, that some telematics programs could also raise your rates if you exhibit unsafe driving habits.
* **Understand your deductible**. If you have [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/) in your auto policy, your deductible would need to be paid out of pocket for a covered claim, while the insurance company covers the rest. A higher deductible can result in savings, but it’s important to make sure that your deductible is something you can afford at any time.
* **Look for all discount opportunities**. If you’re a teen driver and are still in school, are part of a specific organization, or are employed in a particular field, you may be able to qualify for special discounts. Bundling insurance policies, such as [home and auto](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/), with one insurer, is also a common discount. Check with your insurance provider for a full list of discounts to see if any may apply to you.

* ###### Why is my car insurance so expensive in Arizona?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Although Arizona's average rates are on par with national averages, your own premium may be higher. Insurers look at multiple factors when determining rates. For example, if you have a pricey sports car with expensive imported parts that make repairs costly, you may pay more for your coverage. Your driving record will also impact your premium. A past at-fault accident or DUI on your record suggests to your insurer that you are more likely to file a claim in the future. They compensate for this by charging you more for your policy. Other factors that are considered include your credit history, ZIP code, age and gender.
