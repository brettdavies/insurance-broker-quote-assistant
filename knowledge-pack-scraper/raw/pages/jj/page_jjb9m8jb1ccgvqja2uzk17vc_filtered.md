Understanding home construction types is crucial when it comes to insurance coverage. Knowing the differences between various construction types can help you choose the right insurance policy for your home.

Modular homes are built in a factory and assembled on-site. They are often less expensive than traditional site-built homes.

Modular homes have a *lower construction cost due to *reduced labor* and material costs*. This can result in lower insurance premiums.

Site-built homes, on the other hand, are constructed entirely on-site. They can be more **expensive due to higher labor** and material costs.

Site-built homes often require more insurance coverage due to their higher value and potential for damage.

## Home Construction Types

To determine your home's construction type, you can check the walls from the inside. Frame homes have wooden studs running vertically through the walls with space for insulation in between.

You can also look for signs of hollow or solid walls. A brick veneer home, for example, would have hollow walls with a frame and space between the studs, whereas a true brick home would have solid, brick-load-bearing walls.

Knocking on the wall from the inside can help you determine if it's solid or hollow, or you could drill into it to see if you pierce layers of brick or not.

If you're building a new home, you'll want to consider adding a *dwelling-under-construction endorsement to your insurance policy*.

These *endorsements provide additional coverage for renovation-related risks*, such as storm damage or theft, that may occur during the remodeling process.

Many insurance companies offer these endorsements as add-ons to your existing homeowners insurance policy.

You can contact your **insurance provider to discuss adding** this coverage before your renovation begins.

Here are some examples of what dwelling-under-construction endorsements cover:

| Risk | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Storm damage | Coverage for damage caused by storms, such as wind or hail. |
| Theft | Coverage for stolen materials or equipment during the renovation process. |

### Mobile

Mobile homes are a type of prefabricated home that's built in a factory and transported to the site. They're often confused with manufactured homes, but they're actually a bit different.

Mobile homes typically come with their own insurance needs, which can be met with a personalized policy through GEICO Insurance Agency. This type of coverage can help protect your personal belongings and liability.

You can **easily pay your mobile home insurance bill** and manage your policy online, making it a convenient option. This is especially useful if you're not familiar with the insurance process.

To get an idea of how much coverage you may need, you can use GEICO's personal property calculator. This tool can help you calculate the value of your belongings and determine the right level of coverage.

### Responsibilities

As a homeowner, it's essential to understand your responsibilities when it comes to **carrying insurance for your construction project**. You may still have certain obligations even if your contractor has comprehensive insurance.

You might be required to purchase builders' risk insurance or other supplementary coverage, depending on the terms of your contract with the builder. Review your contract thoroughly and discuss any insurance obligations with your contractor and insurance agent.

The extent of your responsibilities will depend on the scope of your project and your role in the construction process. Understanding the specific insurance requirements for your project will help you **avoid potential risks and financial losses**.

## Homeowners Insurance Options

The most **common type of homeowners insurance** is the HO-3 policy, which offers expansive coverage for your home's structure against all perils except those specifically excluded.

HO-3 policies protect against damage to your belongings from **named perils and provide personal liability coverage** if you're sued.

### Ho-2 (Broad)

Credit: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL2zBmmLZyg), Homeowners Insurance Exam: Policy Types Overview

The HO-2 policy is a broad form policy that covers all the **common perils listed on a basic form**, plus seven additional perils including falling objects, certain sudden or accidental damage, and the weight of ice, snow, or sleet.

This means that if you have an HO-2 policy, you'll be covered for a wide range of risks, but only if the peril is explicitly stated on your policy.

The HO-2 policy will cover your personal property, and in some cases, personal liability.

If you're unsure about what's covered under your HO-2 policy, you can contact your insurance provider's customer service department, which is available Monday to Friday from 8:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time.

As your home's value increases with renovations, you'll need to update your insurance coverage limits to ensure your policy adequately protects your property.

Credit: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzDN3jPjVRE), What is the Difference Between HO-3 and HO-5?

HO-3 policies cover damage to your home's structure from perils not written into your policy as excluded.

The main difference between HO-3 and HO-5 policies lies in how your personal property is covered. The HO-5 policy covers damage to your belongings from any peril that isn't excluded on your policy.

HO-5 policies are priced higher than HO-3s because the coverage is so broad, but for some homeowners, the extra protection is worth the extra cost.

### Ho-3 vs Ho-6

HO-3 and HO-6 policies have distinct differences, especially when it comes to coverage areas. HO-3 policies are designed to cover all areas of a property.

Condo owners, however, have a different story with HO-6 policies, which cater specifically to their needs. HO-6 insurance applies to condo owners.

The amount of dwelling coverage needed on a HO-6 policy will depend on how much of your structure is covered by your condo/homeowners association. This is a crucial factor to consider when choosing a policy.

You'll want to ensure your property remains protected during the remodeling process. Insurance Protections for Your Existing Home During Renovations explains how to do this.

Existing Protections are in place to safeguard your property against unforeseen events. These protections can help **cover damages and losses resulting** from renovation-related accidents.
