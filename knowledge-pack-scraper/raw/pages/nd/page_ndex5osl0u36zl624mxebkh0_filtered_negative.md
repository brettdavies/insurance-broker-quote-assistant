![Tyrone Adams, CEO of the Colorado Association of Realtors, said not much has changed in terms of sellers paying for buyer agent commissions, and how much they are willing to pay, following a settlement by the National Association of Realtors that changed the rules on Aug. 17. \(Photo by Eric Lutzens/The Denver Post\)](https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TDP-L-TYRONEREALTORS0017x.jpg?w=541)

So far the surveys are conflicting. Boulder-based real estate tech strategist [Mike DelPrete found no change in the average buyer agent commission rate](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2024/11/20/post-settlement-buyer-agent-commissions-remain-unchanged?rq=commissions) since Aug. 17 based on an analysis of 55,000 closed transactions per month at the nation’s largest brokerage firms. Buyside commissions have held steady at 2.59% nationally, but are down from a 2.65% rate before the National Association of Realtor’s settlement was announced.
“Three years ago, homes often went under contract in a matter of days, resulting in a very sparse inventory,” said Bret Weinstein, CEO of Guide Real Estate and a member of the Market Trends Committee with the Denver Metro Association of Realtors. “When sellers are so in control, they don’t feel obligated to offer any compensation to a buyer agent.”
