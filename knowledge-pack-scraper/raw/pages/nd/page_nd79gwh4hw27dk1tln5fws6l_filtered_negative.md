Geico offers the [standard car insurance discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") you would expect from a major insurer, along with a few extra ways to save. Esurance does not provide a list of discounts, citing that they vary widely from state to state. That makes it difficult to compare its offerings.

Editor's rating |
Esurance is owned by [Allstate](https://www.valuepenguin.com/allstate-auto-insurance-review "Allstate Auto Insurance Review"), but until 2023, the two insurers operated independently. Rates, coverage options, discounts and availability vary between the two, so drivers should consider getting a quote from both companies when comparing car insurance.
Esurance is cheaper than Geico in some instances. A full-coverage policy from Esurance costs $1,372 per year, which is $8 less than Geico. Drivers with [a recent DUI](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-esurance-vs-geico-car-insurance#incidents "#incidents") will also find cheaper rates from Esurance. However, Geico offers more affordable rates for young drivers and those looking for a minimum-coverage policy.
[Esurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/Esurance-insurance-review "Esurance review") is a good auto insurance company. It offers all of the standard coverages you would expect from a major insurer and has a solid financial stability score from A.M. Best. However, drivers may be able to find cheaper rates and better customer service elsewhere.
