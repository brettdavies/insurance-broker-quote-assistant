Mobile home insurance is designed to protect mobile and manufactured homes and their contents from risks such as fire, theft, smoke and hail. Because manufactured and mobile homes aren't eligible for [standard homeowners insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-homeowners-insurance/), you'll need a special policy to cover them and their contents.

## What Is Mobile Home Insurance?

[Mobile home insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-manufactured-home-insurance/) works like standard home insurance: You pay a premium and, in return, the insurance company pays to repair or replace your home and belongings if they're damaged or destroyed by an event covered in your policy.

Unlike traditional "stick-built" homes, mobile or manufactured homes are built in a factory and moved to a permanent site. Mobile homes are typically more susceptible to damage than stick-built homes and therefore need special coverage.

You'll often see the terms *mobile home* and *manufactured home* used interchangeably (including in this article), but technically only homes built in factories on or before June 15, 1976, are considered mobile homes. Homes built after that date must meet U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) construction and safety standards and are considered manufactured homes.

## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Cover?

Most mobile or manufactured home insurance policies include the following coverage.

### Dwelling Coverage

Dwelling coverage, also called structure coverage, protects your manufactured or mobile home's physical structure. If a covered peril damages or destroys your manufactured home, dwelling coverage pays to repair the damage or rebuild your home. Some covered perils include:

* Fire
* Hail
* Wind
* Theft
* Smoke
* Vandalism

Some policies limit dwelling coverage to the actual cash value of your mobile home. This includes [depreciation](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-depreciation/) and may be less than you originally paid for the home. Some insurers offer the option to buy replacement cost coverage, which pays to rebuild your home with materials of the same quality or, if the home is a total loss, pays up to its original purchase price.

### Personal Property Coverage

Personal property or contents coverage pays to replace or repair your personal belongings, such as your furniture, appliances and clothing, if they're damaged or destroyed by a risk covered in the policy. Typically, mobile home insurance pays the actual cash value of these items, or their current worth, which might not be enough to replace them. Many insurers allow you to upgrade to replacement cost coverage, which pays to replace your belongings with comparable new items.

> Tip: Coverage for valuables such as jewelry, guns, cameras or collectibles is usually limited, but you can typically [buy extra coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-buy-insurance-for-collectibles/) to protect these items.

### Personal Liability Coverage

If a visitor to your mobile home is injured, the [personal liability coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-liability-insurance/) portion of your mobile home policy helps pay their medical costs. It also helps cover your legal expenses if you're sued and may pay for the injured person's lost wages or other accident-related expenses. Liability insurance generally also covers damage your family members do to other people or their property outside your home, such as breaking the window of a neighbor's home.

### Loss of Use Coverage

If your insurance company determines you can't live in your mobile home while it's being repaired, loss of use (or *additional living expense*) coverage helps pay for the extra cost of accommodations, meals and other expenses of living away from home.

### Other Structures Coverage

Mobile home insurance often includes coverage for attached or detached structures you own, such as a garage, deck or shed. Some insurers include other structures coverage as part of a standard mobile home policy; others sell it as add-on coverage.

### Optional Coverage

You may be able to buy extra coverage such as:

* Trip collision coverage to protect your home during a move to another site
* Equipment breakdown protection
* Fire department surcharge coverage
* Debris removal coverage
* Water backup damage or sump pump overflow protection
* Golf cart coverage
* Tree, plant and shrub coverage
* Identity theft protection

## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Not Cover?

Much like [standard home insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-not-covered-by-homeowners-insurance/), mobile or manufactured home insurance typically doesn't cover damage from the following:

* **Floods:** Although mobile home insurance doesn't cover floods, many insurance carriers sell flood insurance as an additional policy.
* **Earthquakes:** If your area is at risk, [earthquake coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-earthquake-insurance/) may be available from your insurance carrier or other sources. For example, the  [California Earthquake Authority (CEA)](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/mobilehome) sells earthquake insurance for mobile homes in California.
* **Wear and tear:** You're responsible for maintaining your mobile home in good condition. Mobile home insurance won't cover normal wear and tear of your home's systems.
* **Animal or insect damage:** Damage from termites, mice, rats or other pests generally isn't covered.
* **Foundation damage:** Mobile home insurance generally won't cover damage to your home's foundation.

## How Much Does Mobile Home Insurance Cost?

Because mobile homes are more susceptible to damage, insuring a mobile or manufactured home insurance usually costs more than insuring a traditionally built home of comparable size—up to twice as much in some cases, according to Consumer Reports. Your [cost for mobile home insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/factors-that-impact-homeowners-insurance-costs/) can vary depending on:

* **Your home's size and value:** Homes that are worth more or have more square footage typically cost more to insure than smaller, less expensive homes.
* **Your home's age:** Many insurers offer discounts for newer homes, but getting insurance for older manufactured homes can be difficult, and you may pay more for coverage.
* **The type and amount of coverage you buy:** Purchasing coverage with higher limits or buying add-on coverage, such as replacement cost coverage or extra coverage for valuables, usually increases your premiums.
* **Where you live:** If extreme weather events such as tornadoes or hurricanes are common in your area, your mobile home will [face more risk](/blogs/ask-experian/do-i-need-high-risk-homeowners-insurance/), so your insurance will likely cost more.
* **Your insurance deductible:** The [deductible](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-home-insurance-deductible/) is the amount you're responsible for paying when you have a home insurance claim; it's typically subtracted from your insurance payout. A higher deductible generally translates into lower premiums and vice versa.
* **Prior insurance claims:** If you or your home's previous owner filed other claims in the past seven years, it could mean higher rates.
* **Your lender's requirements:** Your mortgage lender typically requires having enough mobile home insurance to pay off your loan. (Keep in mind you may need more coverage to rebuild or repair your home.)
* **Your credit:** Most states allow insurers to check your [credit-based insurance score](/blogs/ask-experian/does-your-credit-score-affect-homeowners-insurance/) when determining your premiums. Having a poor score could mean paying more for mobile home insurance.

## Is Mobile Home Insurance Required?

There's no law [requiring mobile home insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/do-you-have-to-have-homeowners-insurance/), but if you have a mortgage, your lender will likely require carrying insurance to protect the asset. Mobile home communities may also require residents to have insurance. Even if you aren't required to get mobile home insurance, buying coverage can help ensure you can afford to repair or replace your home or possessions after a loss.

## How to Choose the Best Mobile Home Insurance

Here's how to buy the [best mobile home insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/step-by-step-checklist-for-buying-home-insurance/) for your needs.

* **Calculate how much coverage you need.** Consider how much you paid for your mobile home, how much it would cost to replace all [your belongings](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-make-home-inventory-list-for-insurance/), the value of any attached or detached structures on your property and your personal net worth, which could be at risk in a lawsuit.
* **Evaluate optional coverage.** Do you need coverage for floods, earthquakes, mechanical breakdowns, water backup or siding matching? You might also want replacement cost coverage for your home or property, or extra coverage for valuables.
* **Gather your information.** To get a mobile home insurance quote, you'll typically need to provide your mobile home's make, model, date of construction, square footage, foundation type, roof type and exterior wall materials, as well as proof of ownership.
* **Gather quotes.** Get quotes from several insurers, comparing the same type and amount of coverage and the same deductible. You can get quotes at insurance company websites, by contacting insurers or by working with an independent insurance agent specializing in mobile and manufactured home insurance.
* **Compare policies.** Pay special attention to any exclusions and fine print and get explanations for anything you don't understand. Understanding your coverage before you buy helps ensure you're fully protected.
* **Select a policy and pay your premium.** Consider setting up [automatic bill payment](/blogs/ask-experian/should-i-set-up-autopay/) for your mobile home insurance to help prevent a lapse in coverage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Makes a Mobile Home Uninsurable?

Although there's no hard-and-fast rule for what makes a mobile home uninsurable, homes built before 1976 are often harder to insure because they weren't built to HUD safety standards. Some insurance companies don't sell policies for homes this old; if they do, you may pay higher premiums and deductibles or receive only limited coverage. Regardless of age, your home may also need to meet certain standards to qualify for mobile home insurance. For example, American Modern requires mobile homes to be in fair condition or better.

### Who Insures Older Mobile Homes?

You can get insurance for older mobile homes from insurance carriers including Aegis Security, American Modern, Foremost and Tower Hill. Check with each insurance company about restrictions on the age of mobile homes they'll insure. If you're having trouble finding insurance for an older mobile home, try contacting an independent insurance agent who specializes in mobile home insurance. Independent agents work with a variety of insurance companies and may be able to help you find the coverage you need.

### Can You Get Flood Insurance on a Mobile Home?

You can get flood insurance on a mobile home, but it's typically not included in a standard policy. However, many companies that sell mobile home insurance offer flood insurance as add-on coverage or a separate policy.

## The Bottom Line

Shopping around, carefully comparing policies and prices, and looking for discounts can help you find the right mobile home insurance at a price that fits your budget. You might also save money on mobile home insurance by improving your credit.

Most states allow insurers to check your credit-based insurance score when setting mobile home insurance premiums. [Credit-based insurance scores](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-difference-between-credit-based-insurance-scores-and-credit-scores/) differ from consumer credit scores but are calculated using similar factors, so [checking your FICO® ScoreΘ](/credit/credit-score/) for free with Experian can provide insight into where your credit-based insurance score stands. Actions like paying bills on time and reducing debt could help [improve both types of scores](/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/), which could mean paying less for mobile home insurance.
