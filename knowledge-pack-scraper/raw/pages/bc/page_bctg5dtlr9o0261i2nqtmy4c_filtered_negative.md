![Light bulb icon.](https://www.experian.com/static/shared/icons/icon-light-bulb.svg)
Mobile home insurance is designed to protect mobile and manufactured homes and their contents from risks such as fire, theft, smoke and hail. Because manufactured and mobile homes aren't eligible for [standard homeowners insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-homeowners-insurance/), you'll need a special policy to cover them and their contents.
[Mobile home insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-manufactured-home-insurance/) works like standard home insurance: You pay a premium and, in return, the insurance company pays to repair or replace your home and belongings if they're damaged or destroyed by an event covered in your policy.
You'll often see the terms _mobile home_ and _manufactured home_ used interchangeably (including in this article), but technically only homes built in factories on or before June 15, 1976, are considered mobile homes. Homes built after that date must meet U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) construction and safety standards and are considered manufactured homes.

Some policies limit dwelling coverage to the actual cash value of your mobile home. This includes [depreciation](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-depreciation/) and may be less than you originally paid for the home. Some insurers offer the option to buy replacement cost coverage, which pays to rebuild your home with materials of the same quality or, if the home is a total loss, pays up to its original purchase price.
**Learn more:** [Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/replacement-cost-vs-actual-cash-value/)
> Tip: Coverage for valuables such as jewelry, guns, cameras or collectibles is usually limited, but you can typically [buy extra coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-buy-insurance-for-collectibles/) to protect these items.
If a visitor to your mobile home is injured, the [personal liability coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-liability-insurance/) portion of your mobile home policy helps pay their medical costs. It also helps cover your legal expenses if you're sued and may pay for the injured person's lost wages or other accident-related expenses. Liability insurance generally also covers damage your family members do to other people or their property outside your home, such as breaking the window of a neighbor's home.
If your insurance company determines you can't live in your mobile home while it's being repaired, loss of use (or _additional living expense_) coverage helps pay for the extra cost of accommodations, meals and other expenses of living away from home.

Much like [standard home insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-not-covered-by-homeowners-insurance/), mobile or manufactured home insurance typically doesn't cover damage from the following:
* **Earthquakes:** If your area is at risk, [earthquake coverage](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-earthquake-insurance/) may be available from your insurance carrier or other sources. For example, the [ California Earthquake Authority (CEA)](https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/california-earthquake-insurance-policies/mobilehome) sells earthquake insurance for mobile homes in California.
**Learn more:** [Do I Need Flood Insurance?](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/do-i-need-flood-insurance/)
Because mobile homes are more susceptible to damage, insuring a mobile or manufactured home insurance usually costs more than insuring a traditionally built home of comparable size—up to twice as much in some cases, according to Consumer Reports. Your [cost for mobile home insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/factors-that-impact-homeowners-insurance-costs/) can vary depending on:
* **Where you live:** If extreme weather events such as tornadoes or hurricanes are common in your area, your mobile home will [face more risk](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/do-i-need-high-risk-homeowners-insurance/), so your insurance will likely cost more.
* **Your insurance deductible:** The [deductible](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-home-insurance-deductible/) is the amount you're responsible for paying when you have a home insurance claim; it's typically subtracted from your insurance payout. A higher deductible generally translates into lower premiums and vice versa.
* **Your credit:** Most states allow insurers to check your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-your-credit-score-affect-homeowners-insurance/) when determining your premiums. Having a poor score could mean paying more for mobile home insurance.
There's no law [requiring mobile home insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/do-you-have-to-have-homeowners-insurance/), but if you have a mortgage, your lender will likely require carrying insurance to protect the asset. Mobile home communities may also require residents to have insurance. Even if you aren't required to get mobile home insurance, buying coverage can help ensure you can afford to repair or replace your home or possessions after a loss.
[Allstate](https://www.allstate.com/mobile-home-insurance) offers manufactured and mobile home insurance that includes coverage for your dwelling, personal property and other structures, as well as liability insurance and guest medical protection. You can purchase additional coverage including 30-day collision coverage and scheduled personal property insurance for valuables. Allstate offers mobile home insurance discounts if you're the original homeowner, install fire or theft protection devices, are over 55 and retired, [bundle mobile home insurance with another policy](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/) or have no recent claims when you switch to Allstate.
[Foremost mobile home insurance](https://www.foremost.com/products/mobile-home/) includes dwelling and personal property coverage, with the option to buy replacement cost coverage for your home and belongings. Foremost's coverage automatically includes golf carts; debris removal; credit card or check fraud; and protection for trees, lawns, shrubs and plants. A pioneer in the manufactured home insurance industry, Foremost insures mobile homes of any age, although it offers discounts for newer homes. You may also qualify for discounts if you're 50 or older, live in an approved mobile home community or [bundle your policy](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-bundle-insurance/) with another type of insurance.
Mobile home insurance from [ State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/manufactured-homes) covers your dwelling, personal property, liability, loss of use and medical payments to others injured on your property. You may also have the option to add replacement cost coverage for your home and possessions, as well as coverage for floods, earthquakes or volcanic explosions; fraud or identity theft; and personal injury protection for things like wrongful eviction, false arrest, libel and slander. State Farm offers discounts on mobile and manufactured home coverage for installing home safety and monitoring devices such as fire alarms and smoke detectors, for having a newer home or for being a long-term customer.

Here's how to buy the [best mobile home insurance](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/step-by-step-checklist-for-buying-home-insurance/) for your needs.
* **Calculate how much coverage you need.** Consider how much you paid for your mobile home, how much it would cost to replace all [your belongings](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-make-home-inventory-list-for-insurance/), the value of any attached or detached structures on your property and your personal net worth, which could be at risk in a lawsuit.
* **Select a policy and pay your premium.** Consider setting up [automatic bill payment](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/should-i-set-up-autopay/) for your mobile home insurance to help prevent a lapse in coverage.

Most states allow insurers to check your credit-based insurance score when setting mobile home insurance premiums. [Credit-based insurance scores](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-difference-between-credit-based-insurance-scores-and-credit-scores/) differ from consumer credit scores but are calculated using similar factors, so [checking your FICO® ScoreΘ](https://www.experian.com/credit/credit-score/)[improve both types of scores](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/), which could mean paying less for mobile home insurance.
