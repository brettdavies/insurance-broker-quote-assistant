## What’s Causing the Rapid Increase in Car Insurance Rates?
Inflation is one reason car insurance rates continue to climb. Costlier claims are also driving car insurance rates higher.
Key factors contributing to the seemingly sudden increase in car insurance costs include:
### Broken Supply Chains and Shortages
The pandemic significantly disrupted global supply chains, making some auto parts scarce and driving up their prices due to the basic law of supply and demand. This increased parts prices led to higher car repair costs, which in turn caused auto insurance rates to rise.
Ongoing geopolitical issues, natural disasters and work stoppages persist, elevating auto insurance costs.
While supply chains and shortages have improved, they haven’t fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions. That keeps expenses high and makes car insurance more expensive.
### Climate Change
Climate change may lead to more frequent disasters—such as flooding, storms and wildfires—that put more vehicles at risk of harm. If catastrophic weather events cause more auto claims, insurers may try to pass those costs onto you through increased insurance premiums.
For instance, Florida is often confronted with hurricanes and tropical storms and has an average car insurance cost of $3,536 per year. Vermont, which isn’t prone to hurricanes and other catastrophic weather, has an average rate of $1,237.
### Electric Vehicle Adoption
Experts hope more drivers adopting electric vehicles (EVs) will lower emissions and slow climate change. EVs may be good for the environment but they can be expensive for car insurance.
EVs can be expensive to repair or replace, making them expensive to insure.
Planning to buy an EV? Take a look at our list of the [most and least expensive green cars to insure](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rates-green-vehicles/).
### Increase in the Theft of Vehicles and Car Parts
Vehicle theft rates have steadily risen since 2019, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. The NICB found that auto thefts surpassed 1 million in 2023, driving auto claims and car insurance rates higher.
Pro Tip
Include comprehensive insurance on your policy to ensure you can file a claim if your car or its parts are stolen.
While catalytic converter thefts are decreasing after a surge, the cost of the repair is still high. The average catalytic converter claim (to repair the car and replace the part) is around $2,900, according to State Farm.
### Inflation
Like many sectors of the economy, auto insurance is feeling the effects of inflation.
Cars have become much more expensive to repair and replace, causing car insurance rates to rise to cover future claim payouts.
New and used car prices have skyrocketed in the last few years. Auto parts needed for repairs have become more expensive, as have labor costs in the repair shops.
### Slower Claims Can Cost Insurers More
Many drivers are finding the claims process takes a lot longer now. The average repair time is 22 days, up from 12 days pre-pandemic. That’s according to a 2024 J.D. Power Survey of more than 9,700 auto insurance policyholders who settled a claim recently.
If your auto insurance pays the cost of a rental car during extended repair periods, it costs them significantly more per year in claims.
## Why Is My Car Insurance So High?
Car insurance costs can be high for a host of reasons. Your unique driver profile influences the amount you’ll pay, as insurers consider factors such as your age, driving record and location. Increased repair costs and more claims related to natural disasters are also fueling the surge in auto insurance costs.

---|---
### Choice of Car Insurance Company and Previous Policies
The car insurance company you choose and your coverage history also influence what you pay for auto insurance.
---|---
## Is It Normal for Car Insurance Rates To Go Up for No Reason?
No. You may not see at first glance a reason for car insurance rates to go up, but there should be an associated cause that the auto insurance company can explain to you and your state’s insurance regulator.
Pro Tip
If your renewal paperwork doesn’t explain the reason for a rate hike, contact your insurer for an explanation.
Higher rates could be due to personal factors like your current age bumping you up to a higher pricing tier. Or it could be due to other factors outside your control. For example, if there’s more crime or accidents in your area now or the costs of car repairs or medical treatments have increased.

### Compare Multiple Car Insurance Quotes
[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) is one of the best ways to reduce auto insurance costs. This lets you track down auto insurers charging less for your particular driver profile. I recommend shopping rates with at least three companies—more if you have time.

### Raise Your Deductible
If you’re comfortable paying more out of pocket when you file a claim, choosing a higher [car insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-car-insurance-deductible/) can be an option for lowering your costs. When you do so, your insurer will reduce your car insurance premium. Analyzing deductible rates, we found that on average you can save 19% (around $430 a year) by raising your deductible from $250 to $1,000.

### Bundle Auto and Home Insurance
Many insurance companies offer a fairly decent discount for [bundling auto and home insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/). This means buying both policies from the same insurance insurer. Evaluating rates and discounts, we found the average home and auto bundle discount is 14%.

### Check Out Pay-Per-Mile Programs
If you’ve cut back on driving, I’d suggest checking out [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/pay-per-mile/). These programs charge a daily or monthly rate and then a per-mile charge that can yield lower rates for those who don’t drive a lot.
[![Jason Metz](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/150x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jason-Metz-headshot-scaled-e1621974639148.jpg) ](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/jmetz/)

### Ask About Discounts
I recommend asking your agent if you have all the [car insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/) you’re eligible for. Most are applied automatically, but you may need to ask about some, such as a good student discount for your teen driver. Every discount you get can help reduce your bottom line.

### Maintain a Good Driving Record
Staying accident- and ticket-free is one of the best ways to keep your car insurance rates low. We found that a driver with a speeding ticket pays 25% more for car insurance and a driver with a DUI pays 72% more on average compared to those with a clean driving record.

The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective. To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. **First**, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers’ offers appear on the site. This site does not include all companies or products available within the market. **Second,** we also include links to advertisers’ offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our [partners](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/advertiser-disclosure/) who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
