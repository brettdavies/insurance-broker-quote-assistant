Looking to **cancel Progressive insurance** for auto, home, or another policy? This step-by-step guide shows you how to end a policy cleanly, avoid coverage lapses, and unlock any eligible refunds. We’ll walk through timing, documentation, cancellation channels, fees, and what to do afterward (plates, lender notices, ID cards). And if you’re switching carriers *near me*, you can compare rates before you cancel so there’s no gap.

## Quick steps to cancel Progressive

### 1) Line up your replacement

Quote and bind your new policy with a future effective date. That way, you can cancel Progressive the same day your new policy starts.

### 2) Pick your cancellation date

Choose an end date that matches your new policy start. Avoid even a one-day gap—DMVs and lenders can penalize lapses.

### 3) Send a written request

Most carriers accept phone or app cancellations, but a short *written* request is cleanest. Use our letter generator.

### 4) Confirm & save proof

Ask for written confirmation showing the cancellation date. Save it with your ID cards and lender/HOA docs.

## Best timing & how to avoid lapses

Cancel on the **same day** your new policy takes effect. If you’re selling a car, cancel on the sale date—after you’ve transferred title and removed plates if your state requires it. Moving to a new state? Start the replacement policy with your new garaging address first; then cancel the old policy.

| Situation | When to cancel | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Switching to a new insurer | Same day your new policy begins | Verify ID cards active before cancelling |
| Selling a vehicle | Day of sale/plate return (state rules apply) | Bill of sale, plate/DMV requirements |
| Moving states | After new policy is bound at new address | DMV registration, lender garaging requirements |
| Vehicle in storage | Consider comp-only or temporary garaging change | Keep coverage for theft, fire, weather |

## How to cancel Progressive (channels & documents)

Progressive typically allows cancellation *by phone, through the app/online account, by letter*, or via your independent agent. The table summarizes what you’ll usually need.

| Channel | What you’ll need | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App / Online account | Policy number, effective cancellation date | Download confirmation page or email |
| Phone (number on ID card) | Policyholder authentication; date you want to end | Request written confirmation by email |
| Written letter (mail or upload) | Name, policy #, VIN/address, desired end date, signature | Use our generator for a clean, signed request |
| Agent-assisted (us) | Same details as above | We’ll help time it with your new policy & lender needs |

Mailing addresses and steps vary by policy type and state. Use the address shown on your declarations page or cancellation instructions inside your account/app.

## Refunds, fees & billing cleanup

Your final bill depends on billing plan, earned premium to date, and state rules. Many policies refund any *unearned premium* when you cancel mid-term—especially if you prepaid. Auto-pay? Turn it off after the final invoice posts and your refund (if any) hits.

| Item | What to expect | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prorated refund | Unused days returned after cancellation | Confirm amount & method (card, ACH, check) |
| Minimum earned | Some policies keep a minimum % when cancelling early | Check declarations or billing schedule |
| Fees | Installment or policy fees may be non-refundable | Review your last invoice for fee lines |
| Auto-pay | Future drafts should stop after cancel posts | Verify “paid in full” status before disabling |

## After you cancel: what to do next

### DMV & plates

Some states require plate return or proof of continuous insurance. Check your DMV guidance to avoid fines.

### Lienholder/lessor

Auto lenders and mortgage companies want uninterrupted coverage. Share your new ID cards/evidence of insurance.

### Proof of prior insurance

Save your Progressive declarations and cancellation confirmation—handy for future underwriting and discounts.

## Switching carriers with confidence

Prices move. Coverage forms differ. Before cancelling, compare apples-to-apples limits (liability, UM/UIM, comp/collision deductibles), plus endorsements like OEM parts, accident forgiveness, and full glass. We’ll line up your replacement policy and set your cancellation date so you never miss a day of protection.
