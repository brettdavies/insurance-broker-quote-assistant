## Homeowners insurance rates by state

Homeowners insurance rates vary based on many factors including your coverage limits, the location of your home, type of materials used to build your home, roofing material, and any previous claims history. In some states, home insurers may also consider an "insurance score," which based in part on your credit score but may also take your claims history into account.
