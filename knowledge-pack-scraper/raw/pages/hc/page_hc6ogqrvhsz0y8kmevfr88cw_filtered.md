# What paperwork is needed for DMV and Insurance (Geico) when selling a car?

[Question](/r/carvana/?f=flair_name%3A%22Question%22)

The process seems easy looking at these posts, but I have some questions about the paperwork side.

Do I need to notify my DMV (New York State) that the title will be changing? Do I have to submit paperwork to that effect? Does the buyer submit the paperwork?

Also, for auto insurance, do I need proof of a sale in order for them to remove the old car from my policy?

I'll be taking delivery of a replacement car either the same day or a few days after. Will I be able to reuse the license plates?
