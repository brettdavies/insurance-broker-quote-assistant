As far as DMV, it’s gonna depend on your state. The state I live in has personal property tax on autos so it’s always a good idea to notify the DMV so that that tax stops. Insurance you should just be able to call them and remove it. They’re not gonna ask for anything.

Insurance, you don’t need to provide them proof of anything, just cancel your policy. The DMV, yes, you must notify them that you are selling the vehicle and it needs to be registered in new person’s name. This is for your protection to ensure that the person doesn’t take your car, go commit a homicide for example, and you then have a bolo for you as a suspect; make sure it’s done.
You can keep your plates, but again, you need to notify the DMV you are transferring them to a new car. Most likely whoever you are purchasing the new car from can do that for you.
In regards to the title; you will need to sign it over to the new person. Again, DMV will need to be notified. I’m assuming you don’t have a lien on that car? If you do, you also need to notify your lender.
