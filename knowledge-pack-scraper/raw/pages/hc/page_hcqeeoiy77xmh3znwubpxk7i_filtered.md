## Key Things to Know About Bodily Injury Liability Coverage

* **Covers others’ injuries.** Bodily injury liability insurance pays for other people’s medical expenses after a car accident that you were at fault for. It’s important to note that your bodily injury liability insurance does not cover your own injuries or medical expenses. However, if another driver is at-fault, you can file a bodily injury liability claim with their insurer to get compensation for your expenses.

* **Your limits should cover your net worth.** If your bodily injury liability insurance limits are not high enough to cover the total cost of repairs after an accident, you can face lawsuits. Limits that are at least as high as your net worth protect your assets and help ensure that you will be able to pay for other people’s medical expenses and property damage if you cause an accident.

* **You need at least state-minimum coverage**. If you are caught [driving without the proper insurance](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/driving-without-insurance/14425) coverage, you may face fines and driver’s license suspension or revocation.

* **Supplemental coverage is available.** If the standard BI limits offered by insurance companies are not high enough to cover your net worth, you can look into an [umbrella insurance](https://wallethub.com/edu/oi/umbrella-insurance/9808) policy, which offers coverage limits starting at $1 million.
