![Can Florida HOAs Stop You From Installing Hurricane Shutters or Generators](https://www.stormsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Can-Florida-HOAs-Stop-You-From-Installing-Hurricane-Shutters-or-Generators-300x225.png)No, under Florida law (House Bill 293, enacted in 2024), your HOA cannot prohibit you from installing hurricane protections like shutters, impact windows, reinforced doors, or a permanent generator, as long as they meet building code and community specifications.
Florida House Bill 293, signed into law in 2024, gives homeowners in HOA communities the legal right to install hurricane protection products, as long as those products meet state building code and any written HOA guidelines. Your HOA can no longer deny you simply because they don’t like how something looks.
While Florida’s HB 293 prevents your HOA from denying hurricane protection outright, it does allow them to set reasonable rules about how those protections look and where they go.
If your HOA refuses to approve your hurricane protection request, they may be violating Florida law and you have a clear process to challenge it. Under House Bill 293, HOAs must allow code-compliant protections and cannot deny you for arbitrary or aesthetic reasons alone.
* A short statement referencing HB 293 and your right to install protective systems
_Good to know:_ Many storm protection companies, including Storm Smart, can help provide product documentation, HOA-friendly specs, and even help communicate with your association if needed.
_Tip:_ Some installers, like Storm Smart, can even help you submit HOA paperwork or provide detailed drawings if needed.
