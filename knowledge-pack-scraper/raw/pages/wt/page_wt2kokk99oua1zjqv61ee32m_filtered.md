## State Farm Insurance: A good choice for most shoppers

As the largest insurance provider in the country, State Farm brings scale, stability, and a streamlined digital experience to the table. It typically offers competitive premiums, especially for drivers with clean records.

However, the claims process can be a sticking point — often described as slow and lacking transparency. Still, with its broad coverage options and strong reputation, State Farm remains a **good** choice for most drivers.

What customers like:

* **Availability of Support Channels:** Get help through your preferred method—phone, chat, app, or in-person.
* **Mobile App Functionality and Usability:** Manage claims, payments, and documents from your phone.

What customers don't like:

* **Transparency in Process and Timeline:** Lack of transparency leaves you uncertain about claim status.
* **Average Processing Time:** Slow processing delays reimbursement when you need funds.

### How The Zebra evaluates insurance companies

| Rating | Explanation | Star rating equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subpar | Lowest ranking, suggesting instability or high risk | 0-1.9 |
| Fair | Somewhat stable but not consistently reliable | 2-2.9 |
| Good | Generally dependable with moderate stability | 3-3.9 |
| Solid | Strong, reliable and dependable with minor risks | 4-4.4 |
| Exceptional | Highest rating, indicating outstanding stability and reliability | 4.5-5 |

#### Methodology — how The Zebra reviews insurance companies

The team of insurance experts at The Zebra evaluates companies by focusing on **customer experience first**, with an emphasis on service quality, reliability, and ease of interaction. Unlike previous models, **pricing is not scored** but is instead presented separately as context for comparison.

Each category has been scored using a combination of our internal customer satisfaction survey results and published scores from reputable organizations such as AM Best and J.D. Power.

* **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%):** This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
* **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
* **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%):** This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
* **Trust & Reliability (25%):** This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.

**Price context:** *Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided.*

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

## State Farm's customer service & claims experience: A mixed bag

State Farm's customer service varies widely depending on the issue. While routine tasks like managing your policy or handling claims are easy and efficient through their digital platforms, dealing with disputes or complex claims can be more time-consuming.

This one’s a little tricky. In most cases, your State Farm auto policy won’t cover a rented moving truck, because personal car insurance typically excludes larger vehicles like U-Hauls.

Claims process: Leaves you wishing for more

Filing a claim with State Farm is generally straightforward — it’s the follow-up where things get rocky. Many customers report poor communication and long stretches without updates, making the claims department feel nonexistent at times. With no clear timeline and limited transparency, the process can quickly become frustrating.
