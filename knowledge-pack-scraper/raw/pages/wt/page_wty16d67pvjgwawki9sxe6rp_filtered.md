# Can Florida HOAs Stop You From Installing Hurricane Shutters or Generators?

![Can Florida HOAs Stop You From Installing Hurricane Shutters or Generators](https://www.stormsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Can-Florida-HOAs-Stop-You-From-Installing-Hurricane-Shutters-or-Generators-300x225.png)No, under Florida law (House Bill 293, enacted in 2024), your HOA cannot prohibit you from installing hurricane protections like shutters, impact windows, reinforced doors, or a permanent generator, as long as they meet building code and community specifications.

For years, many Florida homeowners were caught between protecting their homes and following strict HOA rules about aesthetics. But now, the law is on your side. Florida’s updated statutes make it clear: if the hurricane protection product meets official safety and installation standards, your HOA must allow it.

That means you don’t need to choose between compliance and preparation, you can have both.

In the sections below, we’ll break down:

* What protections are now legally protected
* What your HOA can still regulate (hint: it’s mostly cosmetic)
* What to do if your HOA pushes back
* And how to choose hurricane products that keep both your home and your HOA happy

Because when a storm is coming, you deserve more than permission, you deserve peace of mind.

## Florida HB 293: What Hurricane Protections Are Now Legally Allowed in HOA Communities?

Florida House Bill 293, signed into law in 2024, gives homeowners in HOA communities the legal right to install hurricane protection products, as long as those products meet state building code and any written HOA guidelines. Your HOA can no longer deny you simply because they don’t like how something looks.

Here’s what the law explicitly allows, assuming products are code-compliant and meet any adopted HOA specifications:

* Impact-resistant windows and doors
* Storm shutters (including accordion, roll-down, colonial, and panel types)
* Polycarbonate or metal hurricane panels
* Reinforced garage doors and roof improvements
* Erosion prevention systems
* Permanent, fixed-in-place generators and external fuel tanks

Under the law, HOAs must adopt reasonable written standards for these protections, like color, location, or style, but they cannot deny your request if your installation follows those standards and the Florida Building Code. In short: you have the right to protect your home, even in a deed-restricted community.

The law applies to all HOAs statewide (not just new ones) and is meant to eliminate past conflicts where protection was denied for aesthetic or outdated reasons. If your HOA hasn’t updated its documents yet, they’re legally required to.

## Florida HOAs: What They Can Regulate vs. What They Can’t Under HB 293?

While Florida’s HB 293 prevents your HOA from denying hurricane protection outright, it does allow them to set reasonable rules about how those protections look and where they go.

Your HOA can still regulate things like:

* Color and style – for example, requiring shutters or window frames to match the building’s trim
* Placement and visibility – such as screening a generator from view or placing storm panels on the inside of windows
* Documentation – you may need to submit an application, product specs, or installation drawings before starting work
* Installation method – HOA rules may require a licensed contractor and permits to ensure safety and compliance

But here’s what your HOA cannot do anymore under Florida law:

* They can’t deny your installation just because they don’t like how it looks, if it meets the written specs
* They can’t refuse a permanent generator or fuel tank if it meets local codes and your HOA’s adopted standards
* They can’t drag out approvals or create arbitrary delays to prevent you from installing legal protections
* They can’t ban hurricane protection altogether – if they haven’t adopted written specs yet, they must

The bottom line is: Your HOA still has a say in how things look, but not whether you’re allowed to install protection at all. This ensures communities maintain their visual appeal, without putting safety at risk.

## What to Do If Your HOA Denies Hurricane Protection Under Florida Law?

If your HOA refuses to approve your hurricane protection request, they may be violating Florida law and you have a clear process to challenge it. Under House Bill 293, HOAs must allow code-compliant protections and cannot deny you for arbitrary or aesthetic reasons alone.

Here’s what to do next:

1. **Request the HOA’s Written Standards**  
   Ask to see the HOA’s adopted hurricane protection specifications. If they don’t have formal, written guidelines (as required under the new law), they can’t legally deny your request based on unwritten preferences.Ask this directly: “Can you please provide your adopted hurricane protection specifications under Florida Statute §720.3045?”
2. **Submit a Clear, Documented Application**  
   Include:
   * The product type (e.g., impact windows, accordion shutters, fixed generator)
   * Certification that the product meets Florida Building Code standards (e.g., HVHZ-rated)
   * Install details or drawings, if required
   * A short statement referencing HB 293 and your right to install protective systems
3. **Keep Everything in Writing**  
   If your HOA delays or denies without a clear reason, save all correspondence. Documented communication shows you acted in good faith and can be crucial if you need to escalate.
4. **Consider Mediation or State-Level Help**  
   If the HOA continues to block you unfairly:
   * File a complaint with the Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation (DBPR)
   * Consult a Florida real estate attorney if the issue escalates

*Good to know:* Many storm protection companies, including Storm Smart, can help provide product documentation, HOA-friendly specs, and even help communicate with your association if needed.

In short: a pushback isn’t the final word. If your product is legal and compliant, Florida law is on your side.

## How to Choose Hurricane Protection That Satisfies Florida Law and HOA Design Rules?

The best way to meet both Florida’s legal standards and your HOA’s design rules is to choose hurricane protection products that are code-compliant, professionally installed, and visually appropriate for your community.

The “Hurricane Protections for Homeowners’ Associations” gives you the right to install protection, but to avoid delays or pushback, it’s smart to pick options that meet both legal and neighborhood expectations.

Here’s what to look for:

1. **Products That Are Florida Building Code–Approved**  
   Only choose products with:
   * A Notice of Acceptance (NOA) from the Florida Building Commission
   * HVHZ (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) rating if you live in South Florida
   * Labels showing compliance with ASTM E1996/E1886 or Miami-Dade County standards
2. **Styles That Match Your HOA’s Guidelines**  
   Even though they can’t deny you outright, your HOA can request that your product:
   * Match the home’s trim color or finish
   * Use concealed fasteners or painted frames
   * Avoid blocking shared views or common areas
3. **Installation by a Licensed, Experienced Contractor**  
   Professional installation:
   * Reduces the chance of HOA pushback
   * Helps you get permits faster
   * Comes with warranties and documentation your HOA may require

*Tip:* Some installers, like Storm Smart, can even help you submit HOA paperwork or provide detailed drawings if needed.

You don’t have to choose between safety and aesthetics. With the right product and installer, you can protect your home and keep your HOA on board, without the headache.
