While insurance companies are prohibited from discriminating based on factors like race, guidelines use particular facts about people to measure risk and set rates. This means that some form of discrimination is both necessary and legal. Still, questions about [what counts as fair or unfair discrimination](https://www.investopedia.com/caste-discrimination-and-consequences-8421061) have received increasing attention, especially since [George Floyd’s](https://www.investopedia.com/how-corporate-america-is-reacting-to-the-protests-4846547) murder in 2020.
##  Existing Discrimination
##  Types of Discrimination
##  Notable Examples of Underwriting Guidelines Discrimination
###  Redlining and Housing
The federal government began insuring home mortgages to grow homeownership and the White middle class during that time. The Home Owners’ Loan Corp. (HOLC), a government agency, classified neighborhoods across the country on a perceived level of risk based on factors like:
The 1938 _Underwriting Manual_ from the [Federal Housing Administration (FHA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-housing-administration.asp) spelled out the explicitly racial component of these maps. It even listed, in a section called "Quality of Neighborhood Development," “incompatible racial and social groups" and the "probability of the location being invaded by such groups," along with "flimsy construction" and "freakish architectural designs" as underwriting negatives, "If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes. A change in social or racial occupancy generally contributes to instability and a decline in values," the manual declared.16
###  Civil Rights Act
Since then, more explicit forms of discrimination have become illegal. The 1948 U.S. Supreme Court case _Shelley v. Kraemer_, for instance, found that racial covenants are unenforceable because they violate the 14th Amendment.18 Importantly, the [Civil Rights Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/civil-rights-act-1964.asp) of 1964 made many forms of racial discrimination illegal.19 This had an impact on race-based premiums in life insurance, discussed below.
###  Race and Life Insurance
According to an article by Mary L. Heen in the _Northwestern Journal of Law & Social Policy, _the24
###  Race and Auto Insurance
In recent years, investigations have revealed that practices like redlining have persevered in subtle forms in the auto insurance industry. A 2017 investigation published by _Consumer Reports_ and ProPublica that used payout data found disparate auto insurance prices in California, Illinois, Missouri, and Texas that its authors say cannot be explained by differences in risk, suggesting what they call a “subtler form of redlining.”34
###  Use of Algorithms
Unfair discrimination happens when similar risks are treated differently and premiums are based not on relative risk but on factors like race.
Redlining is the now-illegal discriminatory practice of denying loans or insurance to residents of certain areas based on their race or ethnicity. Sociologist John McKnight coined the term in the 1960s to describe color-coded maps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corp. (HOLC) that marked racial minority neighborhoods in red, labeling them “hazardous” to lenders.47 Redlining significantly contributed to the [racial wealth gap](https://www.investopedia.com/the-racial-wealth-gap-5105010) that persists today.17
