Our hearts go out to the communities and families of all those who have been tragically affected by the recent severe weather and extremely damaging tornado in Greenfield, Iowa. Our greatest concern is for the safety of everyone in the area. State Farm catastrophe claim response team members are responding to assist customers, and local State Farm agents also are available to help. Our priority is taking care of our customers' needs as quickly as possible as we begin the recovery process. State Farm has received approximately 750 homeowner claims and about 500 auto claims from the string of severe weather and tornado that impacted portions of Iowa.
To provide the best possible service and response to customers who have damage from the tornado, the following are in place: 
  * Catastrophe claims adjusters and support members are deploying and arriving on-site. Catastrophe claim teams will be actively making contact and providing initial claim handling efforts for our impacted customers with a focus on the most severe losses. Catastrophe Customer Care sites are being planned in the most impacted area to support claim handling efforts for local residents, additional details will be shared as available.
  * The 1**-800-SFCLAIM** line is activated and available for customers to begin the claim reporting process, should they be unable to reach their local State Farm agent. 
  * State Farm policyholders who have damage can submit and manage their claim through various channels. **This includes calling or emailing their State Farm agent, calling 1-800-SFCLAIM, submitting a claim through our mobile app or through our website at statefarm.com/claims. Customers may also text the word “CLAIM” to 62789 to receive a link to file a claim.**


Our response includes State Farm agents who live and work in the same neighborhoods as our customers, and teams of claim specialists trained in disaster response traveling in to evaluate damage on site. They are joined by thousands of employees in centralized care centers across the country helping answer customers’ questions and file their claims. Additionally, our remote claim teams are able to conduct virtual inspections with impacted customers following the storm, helping customers in their time of need. 
Our State Farm Customer Response Unit (CRU) is traveling throughout the impacted community. CRU team members and State Farm agents are distributing needed items such as bottled water, work gloves and other useful items for residents. The CRU team responds immediately following a disaster, and navigates throughout impacted areas to provide in-person contact and assistance to those in need. State Farm agents often ride along on the CRU, and can offer neighbors helpful information about filing their claim and insurance tips. State Farm is there to help residents during this first and critical step on the road to recovery. 
**Tips for assessing tornado damage when safe to do so:**
  * Don't enter damaged buildings until they are declared safe and use extreme caution around debris. Wear appropriate clothing, like sturdy shoes or boots, long sleeves and gloves.
  * Safely check your home or apartment for any signs of structure issues and hidden damage.
  * Safely take pictures of your home's damage, inside and out.


**Tips for making temporary repairs to damaged property:**
When it is safe to do so, people with repairable/limited property damage should have reasonable temporary repairs made to prevent further damage to their property. Depending on your coverage, these repairs may be reimbursed. Save receipts if you purchase items such as tarps and plywood or other supplies to make repairs.
