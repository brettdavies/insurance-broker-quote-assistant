However, a reckless driving or DUI charge costs less at Safeco. Every car insurance company has different post-violation pricing structures, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurance company suits you.

##### RATES BY VIOLATION: SAFECO VS. STATE FARM

| **Citation** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium** |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### State Farm vs. Safeco: rates by age bracket

Auto insurance companies rely on a driver's age to outline risk potential, assigning rates accordingly. A car insurance policy is typically expensive for drivers younger than 25 — due to their inexperience — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every auto insurance company rates age brackets uniquely, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose State Farn over Safeco: the former's average annual rates are $1,945 less.

##### COMPARING AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY AGE: SAFECO VS. STATE FARM

| **Age** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $5,820 | $7,765 |
| **20s** | $2,379 | $2,566 |
| **30s** | $1,585 | $2,566 |
| **40s** | $1,587 | $2,128 |
| **50s** | $1,558 | $1,745 |
| **60s** | $1,485 | $1,687 |

Affordability aside, State Farm and Safeco each have pros and cons, including their discounts, perks, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to shop around before settling on an option.

State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a great option for customers looking for flexible or with unique coverage needs. However, State Farm's average rates tend to be higher than average. Also, the company suffers from a lack of available homeowners discounts — only four discount options at present. State Farm's home insurance options enjoy good ratings from third-party agencies, and the company ranked fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Still, homeowners looking for basic insurance with no bells or whistles may wish to look for an alternative.

In general, Safeco provides good homeowners insurance coverage at relatively affordable rates. The company offers all of the basic coverage types one would expect, plus additional options for [valuable items](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/scheduled-personal-property-coverage/) and [equipment breakdowns](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/equipment-breakdown-coverage/).
