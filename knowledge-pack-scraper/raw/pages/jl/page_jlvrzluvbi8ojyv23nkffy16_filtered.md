## Why Is Home Insurance So Expensive in Texas?

Overall, the main reasons home insurance is so expensive in Texas is due to the rising number of claims in the state, high risk of damaging weather/natural disasters, rising material/labor costs, and current state insurance laws. Below, we will go into detail about each of these factors:

![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)

**Rising Claims**

Texas homeowners make more claims than the average. The Insurance Information Institute reports that in 2024, the state recorded the second-highest total incurred insurance losses (claim value) in the country, at [64.4 billion dollars](https://www.iii.org/publications/triple-i-insurance-facts/view-by-state/?state=Texas), which led insurers to charge more.

![rain icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/rain_fkozzi.svg)

**High Weather Risks**

Due to the [high risks of major weather damage](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map) around the Gulf Coast and large population centers in Texas, the likelihood of expensive claims is higher. In 2024, weather-related risks accounted for at least [$20 billion in damage](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/home-insurance/texas-home-insurance/), mostly from severe storms and cyclones.

![hammer icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/hammer_yk2psa.svg)

**Rising Material and Labor Costs**

Construction costs accounted for a record [64% of new home prices in 2024](https://www.nahb.org/blog/2025/01/cost-of-construction-survey-2024), up from around 61% in 2022, according to the National Association of Home Builders' (NAHB) latest survey. Since 2020, wages for construction workers [have risen by 35%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXWCON), raising the cost of damages. These factors contribute to higher claims costs for insurers.

![bond icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/bond_sjrp2s.svg)

**State Insurance Laws**

Texas operates under a [file and use system](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/economics/2024/self-insure/#:~:text=Legislative%20focus,%2C%20called%20%E2%80%9Cflex%20rating.%E2%80%9D), allowing insurers to notify state departments and raise insurance rates without full approval from the Texas Department of Insurance.

Home insurance is required if you’re getting a mortgage, and with [most opting out of that market](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/06/24/texas-housing-costs-homeownership-rents-harvard/#:~:text=The%20Texas%20housing%20market%20has,at%20the%20median%20sales%20price.) to keep renting due to the high expenses, insurers have less money to draw from for claims, increasing the risk of insuring homeowners.

## What Affects Texas Home Insurance Costs?

Like for most home insurance companies, regardless of state, pricing is mostly affected by these factors:

* Location
* Coverage chosen
* Home build details
* Provider Chosen
* Credit
* Claims history

Each factor affects Texas home insurance rates in myriad ways:

### How Much Does Location Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Location drives Texas home insurance rates more than any other factor: rates vary up to 134%. Weather risks, home value and population density determine your costs.

| Category | City | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | El Paso | $269 | $3,230 |
| Highest | Port Aransas | $1,335 | $16,019 |

### How Much Does Coverage Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Coverage choices rank second in Texas home insurance pricing, and rates run $3,298 to $20,807 yearly. Higher coverage limits and lower deductibles raise premiums. Lower limits and higher deductibles cut costs.

| Category | Coverage Level | Deductible | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | $100K Dwelling / $50K Personal Property / $100K Liability | $2,000 | $275 | $3,298 |
| Highest | $1MM Dwelling / $500K Personal Property / $1MM Liability | $500 | $1,734 | $20,807 |

### How Much Do Home Details Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Home details (age, construction materials and roof type) rank third in Texas pricing, running $221 to $591 monthly. These factors affect replacement costs and damage risk, creating major rate differences.

| Category | Home Age | Square Footage | Fire Risk | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Newer | 800 | Low-Risk | $221 | $2,647 |
| Highest | Middle Age | 2500 | High-Risk | $591 | $7,095 |

### How Much Does the Provider You Choose Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Your insurer choice ranks fourth in Texas pricing; rates range from 41% below to 47% above the state average.

| Category | Provider | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Mercury Insurance | $252 | $3,025 |
| Highest | Progressive | $881 | $10,571 |

### How Much Does Credit Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Higher credit scores signal reliability and cut your home insurance costs. Premiums vary by up to 97%, with annual rates running $5,056 to $11,527.

| Category | Credit Score | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Excellent | $421 | $5,056 |
| Highest | Poor | $961 | $11,527 |

### How Much Does Claims History Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Claims history affects Texas homeowners insurance less than other factors. More claims mean higher perceived risk and higher premiums.

| Category | Claims History | Average Monthly Premium | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Claim free for 5+ years | $571 | $6,854 |
| Highest | 2 claims in past 5 year | $801 | $9,617 |

## Tips to Save on Texas Home Insurance

Especially with high costs in Texas, you need to find ways to save on premiums to buy a home or cut expenses for your current home. Below are some tips to help you find the best and [cheapest home insurance in Texas](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/best-homeowners-insurance-texas/).

1. 1

   Find How Much Coverage You Need Beforehand

   [Determining how much home insurance you need](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/how-much-home-insurance-do-you-need/) before buying allows you to frame how you search for coverage and avoid being oversold by agents. In addition to [standard coverage options](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/types-of-homeowners-insurance/), you should also consider if you need add-ons to protect any additional items you own.
2. 2

   Research Costs and Discounts Beforehand

   To know whether you’re actually getting a good deal, you’ll need to understand [average costs for you](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-cost-of-home-insurance/) and your home specifically. Also, be sure to ask about all home insurance discounts with agents since insurers are not required to apply some of their reductions unless you ask them for home policies.
3. 3

   Compare Multiple Providers Through Different Avenues

   Once you are armed with research, compare multiple insurers apples to apples for the coverage you want. We also recommend using multiple different avenues such as online comparison sites, brokers, provider websites, and provider agents since quotes will vary widely between each method.
4. 4

   Consider Bundling Policies

   Like all states, you can have significant savings when bundling policies. For example, if you [bundle home and auto insurance in Texas](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-auto-bundle-in-texas/), you can save up to 29% on home insurance and $1,188 per year for both policies.
5. 5

   Reduce Your Personal Risk Profile

   To get cheaper premiums on your home, consider making improvements like adding storm shutters or home security systems. Also, improving your credit score can decrease premiums drastically. For example, moving from a fair to a good credit score can save you 28% on average.
6. 6

   See if You Are Eligible for State Programs

   If you are denied by traditional insurers, Texas offers the [TFPA policy](https://www.texasfairplan.org/about-us/coverage-eligibility/) to insure you. While TFPA plans don’t offer the same amount of coverage you get with traditional policies, it does satisfy mortgage requirements.
