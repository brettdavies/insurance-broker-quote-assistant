Car insurance in Florida shouldn’t be a secret. Insurance companies tend to use complicated language to describe car insurance requirements and the coverage you need to be fully protected. Florida law has specific insurance requirements and policy minimums for drivers who are looking to purchase auto insurance. But the first thing we should address is Florida being a No-Fault state and identifying what that means when it comes to Florida motor vehicle insurance.
## Required Car Insurance in Florida
Driving in Florida means you’re operating under a no-fault insurance system, and that brings some unique rules. To legally register and drive a vehicle in the state, there are two types of coverage every Florida driver must carry: Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL). These are the bare minimums required by law, but they’re far from full protection.
Let’s break down what these required coverages actually do, and what they don’t, especially if you’re ever in a car accident.
### Personal Injury Protection Insurance
As a no-fault state, Florida requires Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for every registered vehicle. This means your own insurance company [pays for your medical expenses](https://www.injurylawyers.com/blog/how-medical-bills-are-paid-after-car-accident/), no matter who caused the accident. But here’s the catch:
  * PIP only covers injuries, not property damage.
  * It pays for 80% of your medical bills and 60% of lost wages, up to a maximum of $10,000 — but only if you get treatment within 14 days of the crash (Florida Statute §627.736).
  * If your injuries are severe, that $10,000 can vanish fast — especially if multiple family members were in the car.


Not only does [PIP cover yourself](https://www.injurylawyers.com/blog/how-does-florida-personal-injury-protection-pip-insurance-works/), but it also covers your children and other members of your household. It’s clear to see that the $10,000 can get spread very thin if you and your family are involved in a Florida car accident. That is why it is super important to have other types of auto insurance coverage to help with compensation.
There have been legislative discussions to repeal the State of Florida no-fault system in favor of a mandatory Bodily Injury (BI) liability requirement, but as of 2025, these efforts have not passed. This means Florida drivers must still rely on PIP coverage for medical expenses, regardless of fault.
### Property Damage Liability (PDL)
Paired with PIP insurance coverage is [property damage liability coverage](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) which pays for damages done to another person’s property. The minimum required coverage is $10,000 for PDL, and all vehicles registered must be insured with PIP and PDL insurance. PDL covers damage to another person’s property, such as their vehicle, home, or other structures. However, PDL does not cover damage to your own vehicle. If you want coverage for your own car, you’ll need Collision coverage.
Especially if you find yourself a victim in an auto accident, you deserve compensation from the driver who is at fault. A Florida car accident lawyer will be able to help you receive the compensation you deserve to pay for all injuries and damages you experience.
## Optional Car Insurance Coverage in Florida
While Florida only requires drivers to carry Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL), those coverages often fall short in real-life crashes — especially if someone is seriously injured or if the other driver isn’t insured. That’s where these optional coverages come in. They’re not required by law, but they can be lifesavers when the unexpected happens.
### Bodily Injury Liability (BI) Coverage
Bodily Injury Liability (BI) insurance is not required for all drivers in Florida. However, under Florida Statute 324.022(2)(b), BI is mandatory for high-risk drivers, including those with DUI offenses or multiple accidents. The required minimums for these high-risk drivers are:
  * $100,000 per person
  * $300,000 per accident
  * $50,000 for property damage


If a Florida driver causes an accident resulting in injuries and does not have BI coverage, they could be personally liable and risk having their license suspended under Florida’s Financial Responsibility Law.
## Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage
Florida has one of the highest rates of uninsured drivers (~20% as of 2024). [Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage](https://www.injurylawyers.com/blog/uninsured-motorist-coverage-in-florida/) is not required in Florida but is strongly recommended.
UM coverage helps pay for your medical expenses and lost wages if the [at-fault driver has no insurance](https://www.injurylawyers.com/blog/no-injury-car-accident-lawyer/) or inadequate coverage. While PIP coverage provides some protection, it may not fully cover expenses in a serious accident.
### Stacked vs. Non-Stacked UM Coverage
Florida allows stacking UM coverage across multiple vehicles, increasing payout limits in case of an accident. If you own multiple vehicles, stacking UM coverage provides greater protection by allowing you to combine the coverage amounts across all insured vehicles. This can be a significant advantage for Florida drivers.
## Collision & Comprehensive Coverage
While not legally required, Collision and Comprehensive coverage provide additional protection for your vehicle:
  * Collision coverage pays for damage to your vehicle from an accident, regardless of fault.
  * Comprehensive coverage protects against non-collision events such as fire, theft, hurricanes, flooding, and falling objects.


Drivers who finance or lease a vehicle are often required by lenders to carry both Collision and Comprehensive coverage. Given Florida’s high risk for hurricanes and flooding, Comprehensive coverage is particularly valuable for Florida drivers.
## Florida Insurance Laws & Car Accidents
Let’s take a closer look at the key Florida laws that govern the state’s insurance requirements and what drivers must do after a car accident. These statutes help define when coverage is required and what steps you’re expected to take if you’re involved in a crash.
[Florida Statute 316.065](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.065.html)
  * The driver of a vehicle involved in a car accident resulting in injury or death of any persons or damage to any vehicle/property of at least $500 must contact the police. 
    * Violating this will result in a noncriminal traffic infraction and be punishable as a nonmoving violation.


[Florida Statute 627.7275](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.7275.html)
  * A motor vehicle insurance policy providing PIP must also include Property Damage Liability for the vehicle to be registered correctly.


[Florida Statute 324.022](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0300-0399/0324/Sections/0324.022.html)
  * Bodily Injury insurance is required for drivers who are deemed ‘high risk’ drivers.
  * Minimum requirements for this policy for these drivers are $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $50,000 for property damage.
  * These individuals are labeled as ‘high risk’ drivers because of their crash, speeding, or DUI record.


[Florida Statute 324.021](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0324/Sections/0324.021.html)
  * If a driver causes an accident without BI coverage, they may face license suspension unless they can prove financial responsibility, such as purchasing BI coverage or posting a bond.


## How Much Car Insurance Coverage is Necessary?
Aside from Personal Injury Protection and Property Damage Liability policies, [Florida also recommends drivers](https://www.injurylawyers.com/blog/how-much-car-insurance-coverage-necessary-advice-from-a-car-accident-lawyer/) to carry Bodily Injury Liability insurance, Uninsured Motorist coverage, Collision, and Comprehensive coverage.
**Bodily Injury** minimum coverage amount is $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. BI protects you if you are deemed at fault for a vehicle accident, as it covers costs if multiple people are injured. If the roles were reversed, the at-fault driver with BI would be responsible for paying for your injuries with their BI policy amounts. But what happens if they do not have any type of insurance coverage?
**Uninsured Motorist** coverage is recommended as it protects you as a car accident victim, and the at-fault driver has no insurance coverage. Yes, you will have your PIP policy, but that only goes so far. Florida car accident lawyers recommend you protect yourself with UM just in case you are involved in a severe car accident and your injuries outweigh PIP coverage.
Uninsured Motorist coverage is a policy that will provide you will peace of mind when driving. Our [Florida car accident lawyers](https://www.injurylawyers.com/florida-injury-lawyers/) can help you claim compensation from that policy if the at-fault driver has no coverage to pay for your damages. If you want to be better covered for your injuries, it would be a good rule of thumb to get a higher coverage amount than your PIP coverage.
[**Collision and Comprehensive** coverage](https://www.iii.org/article/what-is-covered-by-collision-and-comprehensive-auto-insurance) are other Florida car insurance policies that are recommended to have just in case as they do not pertain to vehicle accidents! Collision coverage pays for damage to your vehicle caused by colliding with an object. Those objects can be a mailbox, a telephone pole, or even a pothole. This coverage doesn’t directly pay for the costs to repair your vehicle; it reimburses you after the fact but only for the costs and not the deductible.
**Comprehensive coverage** covers vehicle damages caused by disasters. Disasters such as fire, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, car theft, fallen trees or tree branches, and a broken windshield. Typically, if you finance a car, you may be required to get both of these insurance coverages.
