Because they lack experience, [car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance/) is more expensive for new drivers than for anyone else. Adding a high school or college student to your policy can spike your rates up 150% or more, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

A teen with on their own policy could pay double or even triple what their share would be on a family plan.

Thankfully, many major insurers have good-student discounts that reward academic success with lower rates. There are other discounts, too, including for leaving the car behind when heading off to college and being a member of an honor society or Greek organization.

Read the small print, though: There are often age limits and other eligibility requirements, and not all discounts are available in all states.

## Driver training discount

In addition to the good student discount, many insurers offer discounts for completing an approved driver education or defensive driving course.

Given that students and young drivers statistically have a higher accident risk, completing this course demonstrates a commitment to safe driving, prompting car insurance providers to offer discounts as a reward.

Depending on your driver’s education program curriculum, you may already be eligible for this discount, but contacting your provider is likely the fastest way to determine your eligibility.

## Affiliation discount

Many larger universities negotiate discounts with specific insurers, which can be available to students, staff and alumni.   
  
The same goes for fraternities, sororities, honor societies, religious groups, young professionals and others.

## Military discount

Students who are also in the military may earn additional military discounts from certain insurers. Savings opportunities may be available for policyholders who are deployed or who garage their vehicle on base..

## Car insurance FAQs

### Is it cheaper to be on your parents’ car insurance?

Yes, it is cheaper for teen drivers to be on their parents’ insurance. A full coverage policy for an 18-year-old male is, on average, over 60% more per month than their share of a family policy.

You can stay on your parents’ insurance indefinitely, as long as you live with them or are a full-time college student.
