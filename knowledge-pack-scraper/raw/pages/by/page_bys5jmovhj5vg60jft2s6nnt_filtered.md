Discounts are one of the easiest ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). And with teens and young drivers paying some of the highest rates of any group, it’s even more important to find ways to lower your bill.

Full-time high school and college students with good grades can qualify for a [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount). Insurers typically require a 3.0 or higher grade point average (GPA). [Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) is one of many auto insurance companies offering a good student discount. Savings start at 5% in most states.

Here’s how to get a good student discount, who qualifies, and what other discounts Progressive offers to help young drivers save.

## **What Is the Progressive Student Discount?**

Many [car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) offer a good student discount. Most insurers — including Progressive — require students to be full-time and receive at least a B average on their most recent report card.

Some insurance companies — like Liberty Mutual and State Farm — offer a discount for students up to [age 25](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-insurance-under-25). But Progressive offers its good student discount only to drivers up to age 23. Students must also be on someone else’s car insurance policy, not their own.

## **How Much Can You Save With the Progressive Student Discount?**

![Woman in a yellow sweater, wearing headphones, writes in a notebook while using a laptop at a wooden table with a coffee cup nearby.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/2e9b68fd52/girl-studying.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

Progressive’s website advertises that its good student discount savings start at 5%, but it’s not available in [California](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/california) or [Hawaii](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/hawaii). And the base discount amount might also be lower in [North Carolina](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/north-carolina), [Oklahoma](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/oklahoma), [Texas](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/texas), and [Washington](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/washington).

Although Progressive offers several student discounts, you may not be able to stack them together for more savings, as several Reddit users found out.[[1]](#cite-1) Some Progressive customers reported that their students didn’t qualify for the [distant student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/student-away-at-school-discount) because they already had a good student discount.

[Adding a teen driver](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/adding-child-to-insurance) to your auto policy is expensive. A good student discount incentivizes your child to get good grades to help lower the cost of car insurance. Ask your Progressive agent how much you can save with a good student discount.

### **How does Progressive’s student discount compare to competitors?**

Progressive is just one insurance company with a good student discount. Other companies — including GEICO, State Farm, and Allstate — also offer it.

See how Progressive’s good student discount compares to competitors in the table below, including average premiums, discount availability, and maximum savings, according to Compare.com data.

## **How to Get the Progressive Student Discount**

![Smiling woman in a blue shirt adjusts the car's radio while driving, with greenery visible through the window.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/8e434ac36b/blonde-girl-driving.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(90))

Progressive offers its student discount to full-time students 22 and younger with a 3.0 or better GPA. You must provide proof of good grades to add the discount to your car insurance policy. The following documents typically qualify:

* Most recent report card
* Dean’s list or honor roll certificate
* Transcript including your most recent completed semester

Although some companies only allow single drivers to get a good student discount, Progressive offers the discount to [married drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/marital-status). But the qualifying student and their spouse must be on someone else’s policy to get a Progressive student discount, not their own.

## **Other Progressive Discounts to Consider**

Progressive offers multiple [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) that you can usually combine to maximize your savings. Discounts you may qualify for include:

* **Multi-car:** Insure two or more vehicles with Progressive to save an average of 12% with a [multi-car discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-car-insurance-discount).
* **Multi-policy:** Save an average of 7% with a [multi-policy discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-policy-discount) by bundling another Progressive insurance policy with your auto policy, such as home or renters.
* **Homeowner:** You can get a homeowner discount just for owning a home, even if you don’t insure it through Progressive.
* **Continuous insurance:** New Progressive customers can get a [loyalty discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/loyalty-discount) on their first policy renewal based on how long they were with their previous insurance company.
* **Sign online:** Sign your insurance policy documents online for an average savings of 9%.
