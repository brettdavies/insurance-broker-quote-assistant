#  News  Massachusetts Division of Insurance Reaccredited by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
NAIC accreditation is necessary to ensure a uniform regulatory environment while also protecting the insurance-buying public in Massachusetts. To achieve re-accreditation, the Division had to undergo a comprehensive on-site accreditation review by a team of independent consultants, who evaluated the department’s capabilities in the following areas:
An accreditation review must be performed at least once every five years with interim annual reviews. If necessary, key areas for improvement may be provided to the state and interim follow up may be required on those areas.
