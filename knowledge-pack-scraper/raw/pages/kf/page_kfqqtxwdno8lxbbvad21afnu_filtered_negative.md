The average homeowners insurance cost in California is $2,160 per year, or roughly $180 per month. Companies like Travelers, Hippo, Stillwater, and Bamboo offer some of the cheapest home insurance premiums for California homeowners, with rates well below the state average. But [**home insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) is getting harder to find.
Increasing wildfire risk has led more than half of the state’s top home insurers to pause or restrict coverage, and some have rate increases of 10x or more.[[1]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-1) Fire-hardened homes could qualify for discounts, but you’ll still need a separate policy to protect against earthquakes and floods. Given the state’s susceptibility to natural disasters, understanding your coverage is crucial.
You’re no stranger to rising home insurance rates if you live in California. While finding affordable premiums is challenging, getting quality homeowners insurance coverage is possible. Remember that many [**types of home insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) are available, and the best choice depends on your financial situation and coverage needs.

The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
Farmers is the [**cheapest homeowners insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/cheap-home-insurance/) company in California. Policyholders pay rates well below the state average, making it a financially savvy option for many homeowners. A policy from Farmers with dwelling coverage of $300,000 costs $86 per month, compared to the state average of $180 for a policy with the same limits.

Home insurance rates in California are expected to rise by 21% by the end of 2025, to an annual average of $2,930, according to an [**Insurify report**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/report/home-insurance-price-projections/). This projected increase is 2.5 times higher than the nationwide projected increase of 8% by year’s end.
* **Personal property:** If a covered peril damages your belongings, such as clothing, furniture, or electronics, home insurance will pay to replace them. Creating a [**home inventory**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-inventory-checklist/) can help you determine how much personal property coverage you need.
Californians face unique challenges thanks to climate change and the state’s geography. Three of the most common risks are wildfires, earthquakes, and floods. The increasing frequency and intensity of these natural disasters have caused traditional insurance companies to pause or limit new policies.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-4)
[**Wildfires**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/wildfire-coverage/) are a growing concern in California, but they’re a common peril that most homeowners policies cover. With more wildfires occurring throughout the state, reviewing and adjusting your policy limits regularly is crucial. This ensures your coverage keeps up with changing property values and rebuilding costs, which can spike after widespread disasters.
Unlike wildfires, homeowners insurance doesn’t typically cover [**earthquakes**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/). California’s seismic activity makes it an important consideration, and you’ll need supplemental coverage for earthquake protection. The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) offers earthquake insurance, often available through your regular insurer.[[5]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-5)
Standard home insurance policies don’t include coverage for [**flood damage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/). Considering certain areas in California are vulnerable to flash floods and seasonal heavy rains, especially in coastal and low-lying areas, a flood insurance policy is a wise precaution. You have options, including coverage through a private insurer or the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).[[6]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-6)
Affordable home insurance in the Golden State isn’t the easiest to find, especially with major insurers like Allstate, State Farm, and Farmers stepping back from offering new home insurance policies.[[7]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-7) Other California home insurers are limiting their coverage focus, concentrating on renters or condo insurance only.
Many insurance companies offer discounts when you [**bundle**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/) homeowners insurance policies with other coverage, such as auto insurance. It can simplify your insurance management and lead to substantial savings.
Use online tools to [**compare different insurers**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) and find the most cost-effective policy. Side-by-side comparisons of coverage options and prices make it easier to tailor policies to meet your specific needs.
In this case, the California FAIR Plan might be your best solution. It’s the state’s “insurer of last resort” and offers basic [**fire insurance coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/fire-insurance/) and earthquake protection for homeowners, regardless of their property’s fire risk. But it’s designed as a temporary solution until coverage from a traditional insurance company becomes available.[[8]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/california/#cite-8)
The [**dwelling coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/dwelling-insurance/) amount you choose affects your home insurance quote significantly. Higher coverage levels result in high costs because they offer greater protection and increase the insurer’s risk.

Homeowners insurance rates swing high and low from state to state and even between cities within the same state. Factors like local weather conditions are mostly responsible, leading insurers to charge more in neighborhoods prone to wildfires, earthquakes, or floods. Areas with a history of vandalism or [**theft**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/does-home-insurance-cover-theft/) may also experience higher costs.
