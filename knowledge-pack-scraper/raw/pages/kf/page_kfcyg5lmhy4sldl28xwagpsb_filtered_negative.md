* Car Seat Basics: Safety Tips and How To Choose One
![Baby in a carseat](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/car-seat-and-child-passenger-safety.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Contrary to what many parents think, it’s height and weight — not age — that determines which kind of car seat to use. Keep your child rear-facing until they outgrow the car seat’s recommended height and weight range. Many manufacturers are making seats to fit and [keep children rear-facing](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/carseat-recommendations-for-children-by-age-size.pdf) long after their first birthday for their safety.
In a [2022 study conducted by State Farm](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/nearly-a-fifth-of-us-parents-skip-life-saving-child-safety-seats/), reasons parents cited for not using child safety seats included the child not wanting to use it, the child being “too old” for the seat or the seat being inconvenient. Because safety is paramount when driving in a vehicle, it’s crucial to follow recommended guidelines, regardless of the child’s age and attitude, to help protect them.
Seats must meet [federal child restraint system standards](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-571/subpart-B/section-571.213 "External link: safekids.org - Federal motor vehicle safety standards"). As mentioned above, consider your kid’s height and weight and read the labels on the seats when looking to purchase one. Since there can be a lot to consider when choosing a seat, let’s look at [the different types](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx "External link: healthychildren.org - Car seat info for families with a chart of ages and car seat types") of car seats. There are three basic types of car seats: rear-facing, forward-facing and booster.
A rear-facing car seat may include an infant seat, convertible or all-in-one. [The harness moves with the child](https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/car-seats-and-booster-seats#car-seat-types "External link: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - Car seats and booster seats") during a crash while helping protect their neck and spinal cord. Keep your child in a rear-facing seat until they outgrow the manufacturer’s height and weight requirements.
Once you understand the federal car seat safety guidelines and the different types of car seats, [which model are you going to pick?](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Product-Listing.aspx "External Link: Car Seats Product Listing") There can be varying models to choose from for each type of seat. A convertible car seat goes from rear-facing to forward-facing — so you get one seat that can last a little longer. And an all-in-one might work even better as this type of seat usually goes from rear-facing to front-facing to booster. Consider one that fits within your family’s budget and is appropriate for your child.
If you've been in an accident, confirm that the car seat is safe to use before putting a child back in it. [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/car-seats-and-booster-seats/car-seat-use-after-crash "External link: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - Guidelines for replacing car seats after a crash") recommends replacing seats after a moderate or severe crash. Car seats don't automatically need to be replaced following a minor crash. A minor crash typically means you can drive away from the accident, none of the air bags were deployed and no one was injured in the collision. If you do need a new seat, it may be covered by your [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto.html "Auto Insurance") policy in the event of a covered claim. Talk to your [State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/ "Find State Farm Agents Near You") or claim rep for more information about your policy’s car seat replacement coverage.
Installing a car seat correctly is an important component of maintaining car seat safety. Follow the instructions provided with your car seat for [proper installation](https://ucsg.safekids.org/basic-tips/installing/ "External link: Safe Kids - Installing car seats"). If you're not sure about installation, consult an expert by calling the car seat manufacturer's customer service center. You might also consider attending a [local car seat checkup event](https://events.safekids.org/ "External link: Safe Kids - Car seat checkup events").
