To help find the coverage you need at a price you can afford, we've rounded up the best car insurance for college students, with Allstate getting our top recommendation due to its good student discount and teenSMART program.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Company** | **Best for** | **Good student discount** | **Distant student discount** |
| [Allstate](https://financebuzz.com/allstate-auto-insurance-review) | Best overall | Yes | Yes |

## Allstate

Best overall

Company details

* **BBB rating:** A+
* **AM Best rating:** A+
* **Good student discount:**
  + Available to students with a B- (2.7 GPA) or higher
  + No percentage specified
* **Away-from-home student discount:** Yes
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their teens:** $301 per month
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their 20s:** $181 per month

Allstate is in our top spot because it has everything we're looking for when it comes to insuring college students. Perhaps most importantly, the Allstate god student discount rather lenient grade requirements for qualifying: a B- average. So, if you have a bumpy first semester of college (like this writer did) or experience other challenges along the way, there's some wiggle room with Allstate.

Its teenSMART safe driving program is available through the age of 20, and getting better at driving never hurts. Allstate's Drivewise app could also lower your costs, but only if you're confident that you (or your student if you're shopping on their behalf) will maintain safe driving habits. That's because high-risk driving could actually increase your insurance costs.

Pros

* Allows lower grades than other companies for a good student discount
* Offers Milewise pay-per-mile insurance
* Offers rideshare insurance

Cons

* Below-average J.D. Power claims satisfaction score

## Nationwide

Best for claims satisfaction

Company details

* **BBB rating:** A+
* **AM Best rating:** A
* **Good student discount:**
  + Available to students with a B average
  + No percentage specified
* **Away-from-home student discount:** No
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their teens:** $385 per month
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their 20s:** $236 per month

Nationwide had the highest J.D. Power claims satisfaction score of any company on this list. J.D. Power is an independent company that collects information on user experience. Claims satisfaction matters, as that's the entire reason we have insurance in the first place. That and it's legally required.   
  
Nationwide also has its SmartRide safe driving app. This is similar to Allstate's Drivewise app — it sets insurance rates based on usage and driver safety. So only enroll in this program if you're confident that you (or the person you're insuring) has safe driving habits.

Nationwide does have a significant downside, though. Many insurers offer a discount if you have a student on your policy who attends school 100 miles or more away from home and doesn't take their vehicle with them. After all, they won't be driving as much that way. Nationwide, however, doesn't offer that discount.

Pros

* Available in 46 states
* Vanishing deductible option
* Accident forgiveness option

Cons

* Not available in Massachusetts, Louisiana, Alaska, or Hawaii
* No discount for students attending college away from home

## GEICO

Best for financial strength

Company details

* **BBB rating:** A+
* **AM Best rating:** A++
* **Good student discount:**
  + Available to students with a B average or better
  + Discount of about 15% (varies by individual)
* **Away-from-home student discount:** No
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their teens:** $256 per month
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their 20s:** $176 per month

A company is only as good as its ability to pay claims, and financial strength is an indicator of that ability. GEICO not only has the highest financial strength rating on this list, it has the highest rating offered by AM Best. And it's the third-largest insurance company in the country (after State Farm and Progressive).

GEICO also has a reputation for low premiums, and it claims that people who switch to GEICO save an average of $900 per year, but there is no guarantee that your premium will be the lowest available. If you're looking for [cheap student car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/car-insurance-college-students) (and given the cost of college these days, you likely are), you should get quotes from multiple insurance companies before buying a policy.

Pros

* Has the highest AM Best rating available
* Available nationwide
* Decent good student discount (about 15%)

Cons

* No discount for students attending college away from home
* Below average claims satisfaction score from J.D. Power

Learn more in our [GEICO review](https://financebuzz.com/geico-auto-insurance-review).

## State Farm

Best for good student discount

Company details

* **BBB rating:** C-
* **AM Best rating:** B
* **Good student discount:**
  + Discount of up to 25%
* **Away-from-home student discount:** Yes
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their teens:** $230 per month
* **Average full coverage rate for drivers in their 20s:** $152 per month

When it comes to providing cheap car insurance for college students, State Farm does pretty well, offering a potentially high good student discount of up to 25%. What's more, that discount is available through age 25. Like other insurance companies on this list, State Farm also offers a safe driving program for younger drivers — Steer Clear. Program availability varies, so you'll need to check with your State Farm agent to find out if you (or your college student if you're shopping for someone else) are eligible.

State Farm's emphasis on working directly with its agents is also a reason to consider the company. There's a lot to be said for talking to a real person if you're having an issue rather than calling an automated number.

Pros

* Largest property and casualty insurance company in the country
* Large, national agent network
* Safe driving program

Cons

* Lowest BBB rating on this list
* Lowest AM Best score on this list

Progressive has long offered unique tools for finding insurance coverage. It allows you to compare car insurance rates, and it also has a Name Your Price tool. With this tool, you say how much you want to pay, and Progressive will put together coverage options in that price range. This could be a good way to [save on car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/save-money-on-car-insurance).

Keep in mind that if you use the Name Your Price tool, you may end up with minimal coverage. That may be fine for students driving older vehicles, but those with newer ones may want to go with more robust coverage, including [comprehensive](https://financebuzz.com/comprehensive-car-insurance) and [collision insurance](https://financebuzz.com/is-collision-insurance-worth-it).

Pros

* Second largest property and casualty company in the country

## What determines car insurance rates for college students

The most significant determinants for car insurance rates for college students are age and their driving record. It's no secret that young drivers have the highest rates, though those rates will drop as the driver ages, assuming they have a clean driving record.

Accidents and moving violations will also have a negative impact on rates. This holds true for everyone, but it's even more important for young drivers since they already have the highest rates.

## How to get a lower car insurance rate

* **Compare, compare, compare.** While it might seem tedious to find the lowest rate, you need to compare rates. You can use an online tool, contact companies individually, or work with an independent agent to find the lowest rate. Be sure you're comparing the same coverage options across companies so you're making an apples-to-apples comparison.
* **Don't go it alone.** Bundling policies typically results in lower rates. College students should stay on their parent's policy for as long as possible. And families should consider bundling multiple types of coverage (like home and auto) with the same company for the lowest costs.
* **Go to school.** Companies will often offer discounts for taking defensive driving or teen driving courses.

## FAQs

### What is the best car insurance for college students?

The best car insurance for college students is coverage from a reputable company that offers student discounts and excellent service. It should also be affordable, which might mean staying on a parent's policy while college students are in school.

Since it topped our list, we recommend Allstate, followed by Nationwide and GEICO. These are far from the only reputable options, though.

### Do college students get a discount on car insurance?

College students may get a discount depending on the insurance company. Many companies offer a good student discount, which rewards high school and college students for good grades (usually a B average or better).

If you attend college away from home and don't take your car, you may be eligible for a discount. You could also enroll in a safe driver program or a pay-per-mile program for additional savings.

### Can college students stay on their parents' car insurance?

You can stay on a [parent's car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/parents-car-insurance) for as long as you share an address. This might mean living at home or going to a college full-time away from home but maintaining your parents' address as your home address.

Once you move out, you'll need your own insurance policy.

## College student car insurance that didn't make our list

* **USAA:** Although USAA is a highly regarded company with a reputation for excellent customer service, it didn't make our list since it's only available to military members and their families. If you're eligible for membership and coverage, though, it's worth checking out. You can learn more in our [USAA review](https://financebuzz.com/usaa-auto-insurance-review).
* **Erie Insurance:** While Erie also has a reputation for excellent service, it only serves 12 states and Washington, D.C. You can learn more in our [Erie Insurance review](https://financebuzz.com/erie-car-insurance-review).

  

## Bottom line

College students are a big demographic, so many reputable companies offer student discounts on car insurance aimed at making their policies more appealing to drivers in that age range.

Companies with good student or away-from-home student discounts are likely to offer the best college student car insurance. The companies on this list are a good start, but if you'd like to explore further, our list of the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies) offers more options.
