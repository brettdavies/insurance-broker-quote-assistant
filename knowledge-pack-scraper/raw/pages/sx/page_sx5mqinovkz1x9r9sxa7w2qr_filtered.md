# Best SR-22 and IID setup in LA County? Already have State Farm, DMV suspension in effect.

Hey everyone, I’m dealing with a recent DUI in LA County and trying to figure out the smartest and cheapest way to handle the SR-22 and IID situation.

I just got the decision from the DMV hearing, and they suspended my license from 04/26 to 08/25/2025. I’m eligible for a restricted license right now if I install an IID which I am planning on getting.

I already have State Farm insurance on my car, and I have my first court arraignment this week, so nothing has been decided yet on the court side, this is just from DMV.

My lawyer recommended Breathe Easy Insurance for the SR-22. They quoted me $650 for the first year, $330 the next, and cheaper again the third year (If I maintain a clean driving record).

My questions:

* Should I just get the SR-22 through Breathe Easy and keep State Farm?
* Will State Farm find out and possibly drop me?
* Anyone know of a cheaper or better SR-22 option?
* Any IID providers in LA County you’d recommend (reliable and low-cost)?

Trying to get back on the road ASAP and do this the right way. Any help or advice is seriously appreciated
