## Why insurance companies reward smart-home devices

Insurance companies offer discounts for smart-home devices because the technology can help catch problems early, potentially preventing expensive claims.

Say you have a smart water sensor next to your water heater, and the appliance springs a leak. The device could sound an audible alarm and send an alert to your phone, enabling you to take immediate action. (Some devices even have an automatic water shut-off feature.)

Without the sensor, you could end up [filing a claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims), paying a big deductible and having to find contractors to clean up the mess. But with the sensor, the damage might be so limited that you wouldn’t need to make a claim at all.

## Should you buy smart-home devices?

The cost of smart-home technology can add up quickly. If you want to invest in a protective device but aren’t sure which ones are worth the money, consider your home’s unique risks, says Karen Collins, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association.

For instance, if your home has older plumbing, water sensors might be worth buying, Collins says. But if you live in a neighborhood with high crime rates, your money might be better spent on a home security system.

Ask your insurer whether the devices you’re considering would qualify you for a homeowners insurance discount. Depending on the amount of the discount and the cost of the devices, they might pay for themselves within a few years.

Keep in mind that the benefits of smart-home technology could go beyond insurance savings. Having smart-home devices can help give you peace of mind, knowing that you could be alerted before a small problem turns into a bigger one.
