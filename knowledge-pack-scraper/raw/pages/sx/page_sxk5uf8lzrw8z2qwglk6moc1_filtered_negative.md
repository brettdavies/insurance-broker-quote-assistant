*   * [ ](javascript:window.print\(\))
Homeowners in many states across the country saw[ big increases in insurance premiums](https://www.aarp.org/money/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance-prices-soar/) in recent years, including in Florida, California, Colorado, Arizona, Nebraska and Utah, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report. It is a widespread issue, and no state has really gotten a handle on how to keep homeowners insurance affordable, Cascio says.
_Carina Storrs, a New York–based journalist, covers aging, health policy, infectious disease and other issues._
