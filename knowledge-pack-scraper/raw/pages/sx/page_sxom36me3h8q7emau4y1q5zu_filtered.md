. That fact alone makes it a must-look when shopping for business auto insurance.

But for other [business insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/business-insurance) policies — like general liability or workers’ compensation — Progressive acts as an intermediary, connecting you with other insurers. You’re better off going directly to the source for that coverage, unless you plan to bundle your business insurance with an existing Progressive car insurance policy.

### Progressive commercial auto insurance

Commercial auto and truck insurance is the only business coverage offered directly through Progressive, so policyholders can take advantage of the company’s 24/7 customer service (available online and by phone) and earn a variety of discounts.

[Commercial auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-vs-commercial-auto-insurance) policies typically include liability, physical damage, medical payments, uninsured motorist and hired auto and non-owned coverage, but you can customize your Progressive coverage to meet the needs of your business. Specific coverage options for commercial trucks include earned freight coverage and trailer interchange insurance.

Progressive insures the following types of commercial vehicles:

* Cars and SUVs, including those with dual use (personal and business).
* Motor homes and RVs.
* Buses.
* Limousines.
* Tractor-trailers.
* Pickup trucks.
* Tow trucks.
* Box trucks.
* Dump trucks.

Progressive doesn't offer commercial auto insurance for emergency vehicles, race cars or wheelchair buses, among other specialty vehicles.

### Progressive general liability insurance

Progressive offers [general liability insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/general-liability-insurance) through a third-party insurer. You can get general liability as a stand-alone policy or bundle it with commercial property insurance through Progressive’s business owners policy.

General liability insurance is recommended for all business owners. It typically covers bodily injury, property damage and personal injury, such as libel, slander or copyright infringement. Progressive general liability insurance also covers claims related to products you manufacture, sell or distribute, as well as faulty work completed by your business.

Liability coverage applies only to third-party claims: if a customer falls and is injured at your store or your employee breaks a customer’s window while on a job site, for example. It doesn't cover damage to your property or injuries to your employees, or protect against claims of negligence or professional mistakes. Additional coverage, such as commercial property insurance, workers’ compensation and professional liability coverage would be required.

## Should you choose Progressive for business insurance?

Progressive may be a good fit for your business if:

* Your first priority is commercial auto insurance. Progressive's commercial auto policies cover a wide range of vehicles and can be tailored to businesses of all sizes. The company also had fewer commercial auto insurance complaints than expected filed with state regulators between 2018 and 2021, according to a NerdWallet analysis.
* Your other insurance needs are relatively simple. Progressive can help you buy basic types of insurance, like general and professional liability and workers' comp, from other insurance companies. But you'll need to shop elsewhere for specialized coverages like directors and officers insurance.
* You don't mind working with an agent. You can get a quote online from Progressive, but you'll need to talk to an agent to complete your purchase.

NerdWallet recommends getting [business insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/business-insurance-quote) from several different providers. That way, you can compare coverage details and prices before choosing the best option for your business.

Methodology

### Business insurance ratings methodology

NerdWallet’s business insurance ratings reward companies that offer small-business owners reliability and ease of use. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, customer complaint data, shopping experience and customer service. Learn more about [how we rate small-business insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-small-business-insurance).

These ratings are a guide, but insurance policy details and prices can vary widely from business to business and provider to provider. We encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes.

NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/editorial-guidelines).

### Insurer complaints methodology

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2018-2021.

To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

Our star ratings consider ratios for both general liability insurance and commercial property insurance. When an insurer sells policies that are underwritten by several different insurance companies, we consider the NAIC complaint ratios of all the underwriters.
