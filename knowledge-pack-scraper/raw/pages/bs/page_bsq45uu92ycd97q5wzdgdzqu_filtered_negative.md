If you want to add to this, you can confirm that there isn't a tank in the basement and that there isn't a pipe on the outside to fill the tank that isn't there.
I briefly worked in property insurance and my big concern with buildings that used to be heated with oil is a company filling the wrong house and flooding the basement with oil. It happened often enough that we always wanted the fill pipe to be removed of filled with something to make it non-functional.

Tanks remaining on the property are required to be disclosed in the agreement of sale by certain states, as well.

When I was buying my house the question of if oil tanks were removed came up. The house is now geothermal but was oil prior to that. My realtor strongly recommended that if the sellers couldn't produce documentation proving the tanks were removed to not move forward with the purchase. She shared that she knew of a situation where a buyer purchased a house that's had oil tanks that were supposedly removed but were not and eventually leaked underground and into a near by creek. The home owner had to pay many tens of thousands for environmental remediation and in fines to the government. Its up to you if you want to roll the dice and lie to the insurance company but I'd say honesty is the best policy for this and tell them you don't know. If you tell them there aren't any tanks and then there's a leak in the future they almost certainly would deny that claim, rightfully so. If they aren't changing you a premium that incorporates the potential cost of an oil leak because you told them there are no oil tanks why would they later cover the cost of one?

Thanks - that makes sense and I wouldn't expect the insurance to cover any claims related to an oil tank leak (if it in fact turns out that there's still a tank). But if that's the only risk I'm taking, I think I'm okay with it as I think it's low probability.
I'm more concerned with if a tree falls through our roof, or if God forbid there's a fire, is the insurance company going to nitpick through every representation to see if anything was inaccurately reported (even if unrelated to the incident at hand), and if so, use that to deny the claim?

If you live in Massachusetts, your insurance now has to cover oil tank leaks and it could cost half-a-million dollars to remediate. Literally, $500k. This legislation is new here and is in response to a slew of sad stories where people lost everything because oil leaks were not covered by homeowners insurance.

I called and told them I don't know, and they said that I needed to find out and provide a definitive answer. Even suggested that I call a plumber to come and investigate, but no way I'm paying $200+ for someone to come just so I can answer a question on an insurance questionnaire

Check with your municipality to find out when they required permits to be pulled for a change from oil to gas. Then see if a permit was pulled. Check with your gas supplier to see if there is a record of when gas service was started at your residence. Check your basement foundation walls both inside and out to see if there have been any repairs to close up a hole that would have been fixed from the removal of an oil fill valve being removed. Most likely on a wall that would be close to the street or driveway so the fill hose wouldn't have to be dragged around to the back of the house. A coal chute most likely would not have been removed and repaired, just weather sealed (and maybe not even that). If there was a coal burner I think from seeing one at my great grandparents' house that there would be a stone or rock big "bin" to hold the coal shoveled through the chute. Look on the basement floor for any evidence of minor oil drips. Even an intact tank can drip very small amounts of oil from around the fill pipe over the years. See if your local historical society has information somewhere about the most common heat source (gas,coal, oil) was residentially in the '20's.
Paying a plumber to come out for a look-see won't give you any more information than what I've just described. More importantly, I have no idea how you would be able to say an oil tank was professionally removed (unless there is a permit from days past). That is a ridiculous ask.
Consider using a different homeowner insurance company.

If old tank and lines are cut and breather pipe is removed, there would be no way to know. If it was not disclosed to you at sale, then there is not much you can do.
Look in the basement, crawlspace for 2 small copper lines together, usually 1/4 and or 3/8 inch thickness. They will likely be cut and crimped over as they penetrate a concrete wall, likely towards a parking area or where an oil tank would have room to be buried.

I have reviewed your case. I did not see a fuel oil tank in your basement, nor fill pipes in your yard. You can say no. Trust me im a professional.
Or, see if the insurance company can send out a person to check. Free of cost so that the insurance company can get a definitive answer

You've received some great advice, I would just like to reiterate that not investigating a possible oil tank could be a 6 figure mistake, depending on where you live. I friend of mine had to get a buried, leaking oil tank removed from a property close to the water in West Vancouver about a decade ago and it was well over 100,000 for the soil remediation alone.

I didn’t have the same question (about oil boilers cuz we don’t use those out here), but I did review my entire homeowners policy the other day. Top to bottom. I answered all the questions best I could but some answers I basically said “I don’t know” or “not since I’ve owned it” or “this house was built 10 years before I was born”.
The woman laughed at that one. But she got my point. I wasn’t trying to be difficult or anything. I just didn’t know. I was able to speak to everything I’ve done in the 10+ years since I’ve been here & some stuff I could answer cuz it’s on the inspection. But beyond that I didn’t know.
The chat was recorded & I have a record of it too

You can call a plumber to check for you. They will be able to tell if all the lines in your house are water, and find oil pipes if they are there. If there are oil pipes, then they can tell you approximately where to look for a tank.
From there, you would need a land surveyor to use ground radar to see if the tank still exists. If you do have a tank, your world is going to get a bit costly...

Leaking oil tanks are awful. My brother had an old oil tank, and when he went to get it decommissioned he found out it was too late. It was already leaking. Ended up having to remove tons of soil and had an enormous pit in his backyard until the place was finally foreclosed.

They want to be sure there's no leaking tank buried in the back yard. It's a hazard. In a home like yours, if it was oil, the tank would likely be in your basement with the drop extending to the street.
If the inspector says it just had coal, that should be good enough.

They are going to do an inspection before writing the policy. If you don't know, you don't know!
It might have an old fill inlet with a cap still through the foundation.
If it was built in 1929 it very possibly had a coal fired gravity furnace. Look for a metal hinged door with a foundry name outside through the foundation and look for black granulated soot like material on the basement ceiling.
Call another insurance company and tell them that the last agent was a dick. They won't ask you the same question.
Edit: Originally oil tanks weren't buried. They were on an elevated rack in the basement. That would last the average home a few months.
Unless your house is over 2000 Sq Ft I seriously doubt you had an underground tank.

Cost-effective home insulation methods
Insulating your home can significantly reduce energy costs and improve comfort. Here are some cost-effective methods and tips from Redditors on how to achieve this:
### Attic Insulation
* **Blown-in Cellulose**: This is often recommended for its affordability and ease of installation. ["Blown insulation is probably the cheapest. Material and a blower rental is not terrible."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4piwf5/)
* **DIY Installation**: You can rent the necessary equipment from big box stores and do it yourself to save on labor costs. ["You can get the stuff at the big box stores and they usually give you a free machine rental."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
* **Cross-Hatched Method**: For better R-value, consider laying insulation in a cross-hatched pattern. ["For example you could put R3 in between the ceiling joists, then lay R4 perpendicular covering the joists."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7tijov/)
### Wall Insulation
* **Blown-in Cellulose**: If you have existing walls, blowing in cellulose is a good option. ["You can blow in cellulose insulation behind drywall but you will need the right machine and cut a billion holes."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
* **Injection Foam**: This is another method for insulating walls without removing drywall. ["For the walls, your best bet is probably injection foam."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmn2rx/)
### Crawl Space Insulation
* **Vapor Barrier and Foam Boards**: Covering the crawl space with a vapor barrier and attaching foam boards to the perimeter can significantly improve insulation. ["Cover the perimeter beam from the inside with like 10 mil vapor barrier."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)
* **Encapsulation**: This involves sealing the crawl space to prevent moisture and air infiltration. ["Tape everything together so it's watertight, like turning the space into a bath tub."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)
### General Tips
* **Air Sealing**: Before adding insulation, make sure to seal any air gaps. ["Start with doing a complete air seal and you'll be amazed at how much that will help."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pp4s1/)
* **Thermal Imaging**: Use a thermal camera to identify heat loss areas. ["See if your local library has 'energy efficiency kits' or anything similar - ours included a thermal camera."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7t7y5q/)
* **Professional Help**: Sometimes, hiring a professional can be cheaper in the long run due to their access to bulk materials and efficient installation methods. ["Hire a company that only does insulation. They have access to much more product and it will be cheaper installed then you can buy it for at the box stores."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1364vzq/comment/jimuij1/)
