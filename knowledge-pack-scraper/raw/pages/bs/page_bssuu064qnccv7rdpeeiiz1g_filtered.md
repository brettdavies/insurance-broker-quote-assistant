## Benefits of taking defensive driving courses in Maryland

### Keeping your license after a traffic violation

You must take a defensive driver course in Maryland if you get a letter from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) telling you that you need to.

The most common reasons you may be required to take a defensive driving class are:

* You were referred by a judge. This typically happens when you have multiple traffic violations in a short amount of time.
* You have five to seven [points on your driving record](/driving-points-increase-auto-insurance#work "How license point systems work"). This could be from one serious incident, like a DUI, or many smaller incidents over a short time period.
* You were convicted or granted probation for a moving violation when driving with a 
  provisional license

**You must complete your MD driver improvement course by a certain date, or you will lose your driver's license.**

The course can also help you avoid a fine, ticket or points, depending on the situation and district court ruling.

### 2. Getting a discount on auto insurance

Another potential benefit of taking a driver improvement course is saving on your [auto insurance in Maryland](/best-cheap-car-insurance-maryland "/best-cheap-car-insurance-maryland").

However, not all companies offer a [defensive driving discount](/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount"). And some companies only offer a discount to teens or seniors.

For example, Geico offers drivers above the age of 50 up to 10% off their car insurance after completing defensive driving classes in Maryland.

On the other hand, Travelers offers a driver training discount for people under the age of 21.

Talk to your agent or auto insurance company to see if you qualify for a discount before registering for a class.
