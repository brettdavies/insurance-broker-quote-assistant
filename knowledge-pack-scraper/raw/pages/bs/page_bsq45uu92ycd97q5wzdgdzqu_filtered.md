# Insurance wants to know if home was ever heated by oil

Currently shopping for homeowners' insurance and was asked if the home was ever heated with oil, and if so, whether the tank was professionally removed. We moved in a year ago and while the home is currently gas heated, we have no idea whether it was previously heated with oil. It's an older home (1929 build) so likely had a different heat source back in the day. We asked our inspector and he thinks that while it's possible it was previously oil heated, it could also have been just coal before the gas was put in. He also thinks that if there was an oil tank, it was almost certainly removed.

My question is if I tell the insurance company that no, the home was not ever heated with oil (presumably that will result in the lowest premium), what's the worst that could happen? If I end up filing a claim, are they going to investigate every representation I made and if any turned out to not be 100% accurate, deny the claim? Or would it be more specific, where if something oil tank-related came up, then they have the right not to cover it?

Thanks for the help!

EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone, but to clarify, I called and told them I don't know, and they said that I needed to find out and provide a definitive answer. Even suggested that I call a plumber to come and investigate.
