### What's the best car insurance coverage for VT drivers?

Most drivers in Vermont should get full coverage car insurance.

That's because full coverage can have higher liability limits than the state requirement, as well as comprehensive and collision coverage.

**Minimum coverage plans may not be enough to cover the cost of damage in an expensive accident.** For example, if you crash into and total a brand new car, $10,000 of property damage liability coverage won't be enough to fully replace it. With a full coverage policy, you can have higher property damage liability limits, so you'll pay less out of pocket after a crash.

In addition, full coverage insurance includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?").

* **Collision coverage** pays for damage to your car after a crash, regardless of whose fault it is.
* **Comprehensive coverage** pays for other types of damage, like damage from theft, vandalism or extreme weather.

**Most lenders require you to have comprehensive and collision coverage if you have a car loan or lease.** You should also consider these coverages if your car is less than 8 years old, or worth more than $5,000.
