# What discounts does GEICO offer for safe driving?
Asked 5 months ago
GEICO offers several discounts for safe driving, which can significantly reduce insurance premiums for eligible policyholders. One of the primary discounts is the Safe Driver Discount. This is available for individuals with a clean driving record, meaning no accidents or traffic violations over a specified period. The length of time required to qualify may vary, but generally, maintaining safe driving for five years or more can help policyholders benefit from this discount. Additionally, GEICO offers a good student discount, which encourages responsible driving among younger drivers. Students who meet certain academic criteria, such as maintaining a specified grade point average, may qualify for this discount. Another program relevant to safe driving is the DriveEasy program, which monitors driving behavior through a mobile app. By demonstrating safe driving habits, individuals may qualify for additional discounts based on their driving performance. For those interested in discovering all available discounts, including those related to safe driving, it is advisable to explore the current GEICO website. It provides up-to-date information and resources to help individuals understand how they can maximize their savings on auto insurance.
