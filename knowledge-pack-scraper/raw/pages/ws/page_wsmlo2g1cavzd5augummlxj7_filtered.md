Drivers in Florida are required by law to carry a minimum level of insurance to register a car and drive it on public roads.

There are only two required forms of insurance: Personal injury protection (PIP) pays for your own medical bills after a crash. And property damage liability covers damage you cause to another person's property. Unlike almost every other state, Florida doesn't require bodily injury liability insurance, but drivers should still carry it.

## Minimum Florida car insurance requirements

When buying [car insurance in Florida](/cheap-car-insurance-florida-study "Best Cheap Car Insurance Florida"), you'll need at least the following:

| Coverage | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Property damage liability (PDL/PD) | $10,000 per accident |
| Personal injury protection (PIP) | $10,000 per accident |

**[Property damage liability (PDL or PD)](/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance and How Does It Work?")** pays to repair others' property if you're at fault for an accident. For example, if you lose control of your car and rear-end another driver, PDL would pay for repairs to the other vehicle.

You're required to carry at least $10,000 of PDL coverage, but it's advisable to buy more. Adding more is not expensive and can save you thousands of dollars if you're responsible for a car crash. Note that this coverage does not pay for damage to your own car or personal property.

**[Personal injury protection (PIP)](/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "Personal Injury Protection Car Insurance")** pays for your medical expenses, regardless of who's at fault. In Florida, PIP only covers 80% of the cost of care. If you're injured in a crash, you'll have to pay the remaining 20% with either your health insurance or your own money.

You'll also need PIP coverage of $10,000 per accident, which you can't increase. This coverage includes a $5,000 death benefit and a disability benefit that reimburses 60% of your lost income if you're unable to work due to injuries.

Each part of the PIP limit counts toward the combined $10,000 maximum that your company will pay per accident. These benefits extend to people in your household, unless they have their own insurance policy.

If you're not working, such as if you're retired, then excluding PIP's lost-income benefit can help lower your premium. Don't do this if you still depend on your earnings. Instead, you can choose a higher PIP deductible, which typically ranges from $250 to $1,000. But keep in mind that a higher deductible adds to your financial burden after an accident.

## Optional auto insurance coverages

Even with the state-mandated minimums, you might not be fully protected. A well-rounded policy includes [several coverages](/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance"). You can enhance your protection by adding:

**Bodily injury liability (BIL or BI):** If you're at fault for a car accident that causes injuries, BIL pays for the other people's medical expenses. Typically, the other driver's PIP would cover their medical bills, but you may be responsible for any expenses not covered by their PIP.

Without BIL, you'd have to pay out of pocket, so it's a good buy. The lowest available limit in Florida is $10,000 per person or $20,000 per accident. Companies may offer higher limits or even require BIL on a [minimum coverage policy](/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheapest Liability-Only Car Insurance").

**Additional PIP** is optional. Basic PIP covers up to 80% of your medical expenses; additional PIP would cover the rest. It also comes with an extra 25% income-loss benefit. All of those costs need to fit within the $10,000 limit, though, so you'll need to decide whether to include your family members in this coverage.

**Medical payments** covers [your own medical expenses](/medical-payments-car-insurance-coverage "Medical Payments Car Insurance Coverage") following an accident, regardless of fault, and comes with a separate limit. It may be redundant if you have health insurance, but it depends on your policy. Some health insurance companies exclude auto accidents from their coverage.

**Uninsured motorist BI (UMBI)** covers your bodily injury and lost income if you're hit by an uninsured driver. Some insurance companies won't let you buy UMBI if you don't have bodily injury liability coverage on your policy, so check with yours. While you can choose from a range of limits, they can never be higher than your BIL limits. This coverage is a good idea, since Florida has a very high number of [uninsured drivers](/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") — about 16% — according to the Insurance Information Institute.

## Minimum requirements for SR-22 and FR-44 policies

If you cause a serious accident or are caught driving while intoxicated, the state may require you to carry these additional coverages. Your limits to meet Florida's financial responsibility law may also go up.

**SR-22:** If you cause a crash that injures or kills someone, you'll need to have your insurance company [file an SR-22 form](/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance") on your behalf. This form confirms that your policy meets state requirements. You must also buy bodily injury liability insurance on top of PDL and PIP, with the following limits:

* **Bodily injury and property damage:** You can choose a $30,000 limit per crash or split the coverages. A split-coverage policy includes $10,000 for bodily injury liability per person, $20,000 for bodily injury liability per accident and $10,000 for property damage.
* **Personal injury protection:** $10,000 per accident.

**FR-44:** If you're caught driving under the influence in Florida, the state increases your coverage limits tenfold:

* **Bodily injury:** $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident
* **Property damage:** $50,000 per accident
* **Personal injury protection:** $10,000 per accident

## Penalties for not carrying insurance in Florida

Driving without insurance or other proof of financial responsibility is a crime in Florida. And there are [serious consequences for letting your coverage lapse](/auto-insurance/florida/penalties-driving-without-insurance "Penalty for driving without insurance in Florida"). You're likely to have your license suspended and face a fine of up to $500, depending on whether you're a repeat offender:

| Offense | Fine | Penalty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First offense | $150 reinstatement fee | License and registration suspension of up to three years, unless proof of insurance is provided in time |
| Second offense | $250 reinstatement fee if lapse occurs within three years of the first offense | License and registration suspension of up to three years, unless proof of insurance is provided in time |
| Subsequent offenses | $500 reinstatement fee if lapse occurs within three years of the first offense | License and registration suspension of up to three years, unless proof of insurance is provided in time |

If you're having a difficult time getting insurance through a private company, you can buy insurance through the [Florida Automobile Joint Underwriting Association (FAJUA)](/auto-insurance/florida/high-risk-plan), a state-run program.

## Your right to sue after a car accident

In Florida, you may be able to sue for pain and suffering resulting from an accident. But the limits are stricter than in many other states. You can sue for medical and other economic losses once your own PIP limits are exhausted. But you cannot sue for emotional suffering or other noneconomic losses unless you meet at least one of these conditions:

* **Significant disability** from the loss of one or several bodily functions
* **Permanent injury**, according to a doctor
* **Significant disfigurement**, according to a court's decision
* **Death**

## Alternative proof of financial responsibility

Drivers who demonstrate sufficient financial ability to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles may not need an insurance policy and instead be approved for a certificate of self-insurance. As a self-insurer, you would be liable for the same amount of coverage as an insurance company under the split limits of 10/20/10 for BIL and PDL coverage, as well as $10,000 in PIP coverage.

All of these documents are necessary to apply for self-insurance:

* A notarized financial statement that shows assets worth at least $40,000 (combined limits of the minimum BI, PD and PIP), also known as the statement of net worth. You may choose which assets you list on the balance sheet.
* The license and Social Security numbers of all drivers who will hold the certificate of self-insurance
* A list of all of the vehicles covered under the certificate, including the make, model and year, plus the VIN and license plate (tag) number of each
