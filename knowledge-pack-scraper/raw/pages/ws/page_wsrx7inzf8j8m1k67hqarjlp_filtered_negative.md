A user on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1hm2ncw/how_the_progressive_snapshot_device_almost_killed/) posted their personal story, where their vehicle stalled in the middle of a major roadway and refused to turn back on. After the vehicle was brought to a local mechanic, the Snapshot OBD-II device was found to be the cause of the stall. The device had thrown 49 error codes at the vehicle's computer, overwhelming the system and stalling the vehicle. Once the device was removed, the vehicle turned on and was able to be driven normally.
