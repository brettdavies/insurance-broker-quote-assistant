## Multi-Car Insurance Comparison: Buying Guide

Shopping for multi-car insurance can save your family hundreds or thousands of dollars annually. To maximize savings, understand how to compare quotes properly, which discounts to request and when separate policies might be more cost-effective than bundling.

### How to Get Cheap Multi-Car Insurance Rates

Here's your step-by-step guide to securing the best multi-car insurance rates for your specific situation.

1. 1

   Determine Your Coverage Needs

   Newer, more expensive cars warrant comprehensive coverage, while older vehicles may need only liability protection. Consider these factors:

   * **Value of the car:** Older cars worth less than your deductible plus annual premium might only need [liability coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/). This strategy can significantly reduce your multi-car policy costs when applied to appropriate vehicles.
   * **Loan/lease status:** Lenders require comprehensive and collision coverage for financed or leased vehicles.
   * **Personal finances:** Comprehensive and collision coverage are worthwhile investments if you can't afford to replace or repair a car out of pocket.

   Purchase more than your [state minimum liability](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/) insurance to protect your finances in an at-fault accident.
2. 2

   Consider Raising Your Deductibles

   Increasing your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can lower premiums by 10% to 15%. Consider higher deductibles for vehicles driven less frequently.
3. 3

   Know Your State’s Specific Incentives

   Research your state's insurance incentives. California offers special low-income auto programs, while Massachusetts provides mandatory multi-car discounts of at least 10%. Understanding these state-specific benefits can save hundreds annually.
4. 4

   Stack Multiple Discounts

   A multi-car policy is just the starting point for savings. You can stack several additional [discounts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-discounts/) to reduce your total household premium significantly:

   * **Bundling Discounts**: [Combine your multi-car policy with homeowners or renters insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles/) for a powerful discount ranging from 5% to 25% off your total premium. Some insurers also offer a single deductible if the home and car are damaged in the same incident.
   * **Family & Driver Perks**: Leverage discounts for good students (typically 10% to 15% off for B averages or better) and reward family members who maintain clean driving records with safe driver discounts. Married couples also often qualify for immediate lower rates.
   * **Payment & Loyalty Savings**: Pay your annual premium upfront (5% to 10% savings) to avoid installment fees, or enroll in automatic payments for a smaller but consistent 3% to 5% reduction. Many companies offer loyalty perks for long-term customers.
   * **Vehicle & Membership Discounts**: Check for discounts on vehicles with anti-theft devices or advanced safety features (each potentially saving 3% to 10%). Savings are also available through affiliations like AAA, alumni associations, professional groups, and military service (often providing 3% to 8% savings).
5. 5

   Gather the Necessary Information

   Collect all required details before requesting quotes:

   * Each driver's license number, birth date, driving history and marital status.
   * Every vehicle's VIN, mileage and trim level.

   Being unprepared can delay your application and increase your premium by 5% to 10%.
6. 6

   Get Quotes and Compare

   [Get at least three quotes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-get-an-anonymous-car-insurance-quote/#finding-car-insurance-quotes-online) from different insurance companies using the same coverage limits. Insurance premium rates can vary by hundreds of dollars for identical coverage, even within the same state.
7. 7

   Purchase a Policy

   Purchase your multi-car insurance policy. Your insurer can walk you through the online process, or an agent can help finalize your purchase.

### When Multi-Car Policies Are Cheaper

Multi-car insurance makes the most financial sense for families where everyone maintains a clean driving record and shares similar insurance needs. The average household saves about $500 annually by bundling coverage, making it ideal for families with:

* **Clean driving histories**: All drivers have clean records.
* **Similar vehicle types**: Households with vehicles in comparable insurance groups that don't require specialized coverage, such as classic or high-performance vehicles.
* **Shared primary residence**: When all vehicles are garaged at the same location, most of the time.

Multi-Car Insurance Policy Pros and Cons

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

**Pros**

* Save $500 to $830 annually
* One payment, one renewal
* Pay one deductible
* Stacked coverage limits
* Family-friendly perks

![errorCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/ErrorCheck_wfuc3a.svg)

**Cons**

* Shared risk penalty
* Limited vehicle flexibility
* All-or-nothing approach
* Increased discount requirements

### When Individual Policies Are Cheaper

Separate policies cost 10% to 25% more than equivalent multi-car coverage. You'll also lose access to multi-policy discounts ranging from 5% to 25% and take on the administrative burden of tracking multiple renewal dates, payments and policy documents.

This extra cost pays off when it prevents one person's poor driving record from affecting everyone's rates or when specialty vehicles require coverage that would raise the entire family's premiums. Individual policies work better for families with:

* **Mixed risk profiles**: Households combining high-risk drivers (young or violation-prone) with experienced, clean-record drivers.
* **Specialty vehicles**: Classic, high-performance or electric cars that need specialized coverage unavailable through standard multi-car policies.
* **Different primary addresses**: When vehicles are garaged at separate locations, most of the time
* **Significant rate disparities**: Adding one driver or vehicle would substantially increase the combined premium by more than the individual policy costs.

Individual Policy Pros and Cons

![blueCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blueCheck_sm9qbi.svg)

**Pros**

* Individual risk protection
* Insurer flexibility
* Independent renewal timing
* No relationship requirements

![errorCheck icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/ErrorCheck_wfuc3a.svg)

**Cons**

* Higher costs
* Complex management
* Lost discount opportunities

### Factors Affecting Multi-Car Insurance Rates

Multi-car policies work like regular auto insurance when it comes to [pricing](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/why-did-my-car-insurance-go-up/), but things get trickier when you're covering several drivers and vehicles at once. Knowing how these different pieces fit together can help you get better coverage for less money:

![money icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/money_kmo8zz.svg)

**Driver Profiles**

Each [driver's age](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/when-does-car-insurance-go-down/), [driving history](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheap-car-insurance-after-a-bad-driving-record/), [credit score](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-bad-credit/), and other personal factors affect your premium. Adding a [high-risk driver](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/) (such as a teenager or someone with multiple violations) can substantially increase rates despite the multi-car discount.

![car icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_idrljy.svg)

**Vehicle Types**

The [make, model, year and safety features of each vehicle](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/by-vehicle/) impact your rates. Newer, more expensive cars cost more to insure, while vehicles with advanced safety features can qualify for additional discounts.

![carInsurance icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_insurance_aud02m.svg)

**Coverage Selection**

You can [choose different coverage types](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-lower-your-car-insurance-rate/) and limits for each vehicle. For example, you might select comprehensive coverage for a new SUV but liability-only for an older sedan used less frequently.

![usMap icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/us-map_s1ingz.svg)

**Location**

Your state, city, and even ZIP code influence insurance rates. Urban areas have higher premiums due to [increased accident and theft risks](https://www.moneygeek.com/living/driving/best-worst-driving-states/), while rural areas often see lower rates.

![variableRate icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/variable-rate_cctrqt.svg)

**Usage Patterns**

[How much and when you drive each vehicle affects your rates](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-does-mileage-affect-car-insurance-rates/). Some insurers offer [low-mileage discounts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/low-mileage-car-insurance/) or usage-based insurance options that can lead to additional savings for vehicles driven less frequently.

### Best Insurance for Multiple Vehicles: Our Ratings Methodology

Families with multiple vehicles need reliable rate data showing which providers offer genuine savings without sacrificing quality coverage. Multi-car insurance can save households $500 to $830 annually, but only if you choose the right provider and coverage levels for your situation.

**We gathered data from Quadrant Information Services and state insurance departments** to calculate average multi-car insurance costs, then evaluated rates using a sample driver profile representing typical family coverage needs.

**We examined 766,080 quotes across 900 ZIP codes from 16 companies** using information from state insurance departments and Quadrant Information Services. This comprehensive view helped us identify which providers offer the best value for families with multiple vehicles.

**Our sample driver profile:** a 40-year-old married couple with clean driving records insuring two Toyota Camrys. We calculated multi-car discounts by comparing the cost of insuring both vehicles on one policy versus separate policies.

**Coverage specifications:** 100/300/100 liability limits with $1,000 deductibles for comprehensive and collision insurance. We modified this profile for driver age, geographic location and driving history to calculate rates for different driver profiles.

**Understanding the numbers:** A deductible is the amount you pay when you file a claim before the insurance company's payment kicks in. The term 100/300/100 means $100,000 bodily injury liability per person, $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident and $100,000 property damage liability.

Liability insurance covers damage to other people's property. Full-coverage policies include comprehensive insurance, which covers damage to your car from weather and fire, and collision coverage, which pays for damage to your car if you collide with something or another vehicle.
