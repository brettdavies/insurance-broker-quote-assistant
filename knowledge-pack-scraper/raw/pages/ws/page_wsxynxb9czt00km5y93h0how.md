# Progressive Renters Insurance: Coverage, Price Factors & Easy Savings “Near Me”
![Young renter reviewing a Progressive renters insurance quote on a phone in a modern apartment](https://blakeinsurancegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Progressive-Renters-Insurance.webp)
A landlord may only ask for proof of liability, but a smart **renters insurance** plan protects much more—your furniture, electronics, bikes, and temporary living costs after a covered loss. Below, you’ll find a clear checklist of what Progressive-style renters policies typically include, what affects your price by city and building type, and the **discounts** most people miss. When you’re ready, use our secure quote tool for side-by-side pricing and instant proof for your lease.

## Why renters choose an independent agent
### Lease-ready proof today
Get your binder/ID cards fast so you can send proof of liability coverage to your landlord or property manager.
### Total-cost clarity
We explain how deductibles, replacement cost vs actual cash value, and valuables limits affect what you’d pay after a claim—not just monthly premium.
### Bundles that actually save
We’ll pair renters with auto (and more) where it helps—and skip it where it doesn’t—so you don’t overpay for a “bundle.”
## Renters insurance coverage checklist
Coverage | What it does | Common options | What to confirm  
---|---|---|---  
Personal Property | Reimburses belongings after covered perils (theft, fire, some water events, etc.) | Replacement Cost (RCV) vs Actual Cash Value (ACV) | Per-item sublimits (jewelry, bikes, electronics); deductible  
Personal Liability | Helps pay if you’re legally responsible for injury or damage | $100k–$500k+ limits | Landlord requirement; dog breed or trampoline exclusions  
Medical Payments to Others | Small medical bills for guests regardless of fault | $1k–$5k typical | Incident scenarios covered/excluded  
Loss of Use | Pays for temporary living costs if the home is uninhabitable after a covered loss | Time or dollar caps | Hotel/meal limits and documentation  
Scheduled Property | Extra coverage for high-value items | Appraised jewelry, bikes, art | Appraisal requirements; deductible options  
Water Backup (endorsement) | Backup of sewers/drains/sump (not flood) | Common limits: $5k–$25k | Waiting periods and exclusions  
Identity Fraud / Personal Injury* | Optional endorsements offered by some carriers | Vary by state/program | Availability, sublimits, definitions  
Availability, names, and limits vary by carrier and state. Flood and earthquake are typically excluded and require separate policies. Your quote and policy control.
## What affects the price of renters insurance
Factor | Why it matters | Examples | Ways to save  
---|---|---|---  
ZIP & building type | Theft, fire, and claim trends vary locally | Garden-style vs high-rise; gated entry | Ask about fire/burglar alarm credits  
Personal property limit | Higher limits = higher premium | $15k vs $50k coverage | Inventory your stuff; pick a right-sized limit  
Deductible | What you pay before insurance responds | $250 vs $1,000 | Choose the highest deductible you can handle  
Claims history | Prior losses may impact price | Recent theft or water claim | Add prevention (locks, leak sensors)  
Bundle & loyalty | Auto + renters can unlock credits | Driver with renters add-on | Quote renters with your current auto policy  
Rates are filed by each carrier and differ by state. Some states restrict how certain factors are used in pricing.
## Discounts to check before you buy
Discount | Typical requirement | What to verify  
---|---|---  
Bundle renters + auto | Active policies with the same carrier | Applies to both policies? Any bundling tiers?  
Protective devices | Monitored fire/burglar alarm, sprinklers | Proof needed; eligible devices  
Paperless / autopay | E-delivery + ACH/CC on file | Effective dates and stacking rules  
Claims-free | No recent renters claims | Lookback period length  
Discount names, amounts, and eligibility vary by state and carrier and can change.
## Claims & documentation tips
Step | What to do | Why it helps | Pro tip  
---|---|---|---  
Create a home inventory | Photos/videos + receipts for high-value items | Speeds up settlement and accuracy | Back up to cloud; update after big purchases  
Mitigate further damage | Shut off water, board up, secure entry | Required by most policies | Keep receipts for reimbursement  
Document loss of use | Save hotel/meal receipts if displaced | Supports Additional Living Expense | Ask about temporary housing networks  
Schedule valuables | Add riders for jewelry, bikes, collectibles | Bypasses low sublimits | Consider $0 deductible scheduling where offered  
Follow your carrier’s instructions and deadlines. Your policy wording governs coverage and claim procedures.

## Progressive Renters Insurance — FAQs
How much renters insurance do I need?
Start with an inventory of what you own (furniture, clothing, electronics). Many renters choose _$20k–$50k_ personal property and at least _$100k–$300k_ liability, then adjust for valuables and local requirements.
Is water damage covered?
Sudden/accidental discharge may be covered, but **flood** is typically excluded and requires a separate policy. _Water backup_ is often an optional endorsement—ask to add it if available.
What if I work from home?
Renters policies may include limited coverage for business property. If you store inventory, run client appointments, or need higher limits, ask about endorsements or a separate in-home business policy.
Does renters insurance cover roommates?
Policies usually list named insureds only. Each roommate should consider their own policy unless the carrier allows a shared policy—confirm rules before adding anyone.
Can renters insurance help my landlord requirements?
Yes—your policy can provide a certificate of insurance and, when allowed, add your property manager as an interested party for notices. Tenants remain responsible for their own coverage and deductibles.
