To make it easier, there are cost calculators available to help you. If you have high-value items, such as jewelry, you may need to add a rider to cover them properly.
## What won’t Geico renters insurance cover?
If you’re covered by Geico renters insurance, your belongings are covered for most risks. However, there are a few things renters insurance typically does not cover. Below are the following scenarios in which Geico may not be able to cover your items:
  * **Flooding** – Standard policies typically do not cover flooding. In the event that a policyholder’s belonging is damaged due to flooding, renters insurance may not cover you
  * **Earthquakes** – Typically, high-risk earthquake areas in the United States require a separate policy, in addition to basic renters insurance to cover the damage for these items.
  * **Infestations** – Ants, roaches, bed bugs, mice, or any other infestations will not qualify for Geico renters insurance coverage.


While the examples above will not be eligible for coverage under a basic renters insurance plan with Geico, there may be special policies available that can cover you during these instances.
## **Does Geico run your credit for renters insurance?**
Since your credit score is a factor that insurance providers do consider when generating your insurance quote, Geico will run your credit to provide you with the best rate. However, unlike when you apply for a credit card, insurance companies use a soft inquiry, so it will have no impact on your credit score.
A soft inquiry, also known as a soft credit pull, occurs when you authorize a business or organization to view your credit report. The information reviewed can help it determine if you may be eligible for a credit limit increase or a lower auto insurance rate.
A hard inquiry, also known as a hard credit pull, occurs when you apply for a new line of credit, such as a credit card, mortgage, or auto loan. According to [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/report/understanding-hard-inquiries-on-your-credit-report/), a hard inquiry can negatively impact your credit score, and it may remain on your credit report for up to two years.

## Does Geico offer discounts on renters insurance?
According to [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-renters-insurance), 45.1% of renters nationwide spend at least 30% of their household income on rent and utilities. That leaves very little room to cover expenses like renters insurance.
Fortunately, Geico renters insurance offers a couple of discounts like:
  * **Bundling and multi-policy discounts** – If you have more than one policy with Geico, discounts are available
  * **A home security system discount** – If you install a burglar alarm in your home or you are renting in a building with security staff, Geico will discount your policy
  * **A sprinklers or smoke alarm discount** – If you rent in an apartment, condominium, or home with a fire extinguisher or sprinklers, Geico will discount your policy


Who doesn’t love a good discount? If you are seeking affordability and flexibility, Geico renters insurance has a few discounts that sound like they can be a great choice. However, if you would prefer a renters insurance company that provides more discounts and even more attractive benefits, you may decide to go in a different direction.
