## What does Geico renters insurance offer?

If you’re in search of renters insurance, Geico is a company name that rings bells. Its great reputation alone may be enough to convince you to [buy renters insurance](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/buying-renters-insurance/ "buy renters insurance") from Geico.

Geico’s renters insurance plans offer:

* Add-ons that can help you to personalize your plan to protect you properly
* If you have more than one policy with Geico, you can take advantage of a multi-policy discount

It’s important to know that renters insurance from Geico is issued through a third-party company. This means that your details will be shared with another company, and that your plan will not be serviced by Geico directly. Some of the companies offering renters insurance are Travelers, Liberty Mutual, and Assurant.

Despite this, Geico does still offer bundling discounts when you buy renters insurance through a partner.

## What does Geico renters insurance cover?

If you’re renting, your landlord will typically cover the repairs in your household. But what if something were to happen to your belongings in the process? This is where Geico renters insurance comes in.

In the event of a house fire, a windstorm, severe water damage,  theft, vandalism, or other common unknown disasters, this insurance policy will typically cover the following:

* Clothing
* Electronics
* Sports equipment
* Furniture
* Jewelry and other valuable assets
* Accidental damage to someone else’s property
* Coverage for visitors that have been injured on your property

In addition to covering your personal belongings, renters insurance from Geico can also cover you from liability claims made against you by others.

* [Does Auto Insurance cover windstorm damage](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/does-auto-insurance-cover-windstorm-damage/ "Does Auto Insurance cover windstorm damage")?

### **How do I estimate the value of my property?**

Renters insurance will require you to take inventory of your property, and how much you feel it is worth in total, so you can better decide on a policy limit. There are several ways you can go about identifying the value of your items.

To make it easier, there are cost calculators available to help you. If you have high-value items, such as jewelry, you may need to add a rider to cover them properly.

## What won’t Geico renters insurance cover?

If you’re covered by Geico renters insurance, your belongings are covered for most risks. However, there are a few things renters insurance typically does not cover. Below are the following scenarios in which Geico may not be able to cover your items:

* **Flooding** – Standard policies typically do not cover flooding. In the event that a policyholder’s belonging is damaged due to flooding, renters insurance may not cover you
* **Earthquakes** – Typically, high-risk earthquake areas in the United States require a separate policy, in addition to basic renters insurance to cover the damage for these items.
* **Infestations** – Ants, roaches, bed bugs, mice, or any other infestations will not qualify for Geico renters insurance coverage.

While the examples above will not be eligible for coverage under a basic renters insurance plan with Geico,  there may be special policies available that can cover you during these instances.

## **Does Geico run your credit for renters insurance?**

Since your credit score is a factor that insurance providers do consider when generating  your insurance quote, Geico will run your credit to provide you with the best rate. However, unlike when you apply for a credit card, insurance companies use a soft inquiry, so it will have no impact on your credit score.

A soft inquiry, also known as a soft credit pull, occurs when you authorize a business or organization to view your credit report. The information reviewed can help it determine if you may be eligible for a credit limit increase or a lower auto insurance rate.

A hard inquiry, also known as a hard credit pull, occurs when you apply for a new line of credit, such as a credit card, mortgage, or auto loan. According to [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/report/understanding-hard-inquiries-on-your-credit-report/), a hard inquiry can negatively impact your credit score, and it may remain on your credit report for up to two years.

## Does Geico offer discounts on renters insurance?

According to [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-renters-insurance), 45.1% of renters nationwide spend at least 30% of their household income on rent and utilities. That leaves very little room to cover expenses like renters insurance.

Fortunately, Geico renters insurance offers a couple of discounts like:

* **Bundling and multi-policy discounts** – If you have more than one policy with Geico, discounts are available
* **A home security system discount** – If you install a burglar alarm in your home or you are renting in a building with security staff, Geico will discount your policy
* **A sprinklers or smoke alarm discount** – If you rent in an apartment, condominium, or home with a fire extinguisher or sprinklers, Geico will discount your policy

Who doesn’t love a good discount? If you are seeking affordability and flexibility, Geico renters insurance has a few discounts that sound like they can be a great choice. However, if you would prefer a renters insurance company that provides more discounts and even more attractive benefits, you may decide to go in a different direction.
