Florida and a few other states follow the no-fault system for auto insurance. No-fault law means that each driver is responsible for paying for any damages they suffer in a car accident.

All drivers are required to carry personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability (PDL) in Florida. These types of coverage in an auto insurance policy allow drivers to pay for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage and funeral and burial expenses if necessary. Damages must be paid through PIP or PDL through one’s own insurance policy regardless of who’s at fault for a car accident. If someone is deemed responsible for a collision, they must pay for damages to the other party’s vehicle through their PDL coverage as well.

## Legal Definition of a No-Fault State

The legal definition of a no-fault state is that anyone who has auto insurance is responsible for paying for medical expenses, lost wages and other damages related to a car accident. This means the insurance company reimburses them regardless of who is at fault.

## Purpose of the No-Fault System

There are specific purposes for the no-fault system in Florida and other states that follow these laws. They include providing quicker access to medical treatment and compensation for accident victims and personal injury protection (PIP) coverage.

### Providing Quicker Access to Medical Treatment and Compensation for Accident Victims

The no-fault system allows anyone injured in a car accident to more quickly receive access to medical treatment and compensation for their medical expenses and lost wages if they miss time from work. This is because their auto insurance policy more immediately pays them for out-of-pocket expenses and a portion of their income if injuries prevent them from working. By contrast, compensation from a lawsuit comes much slower.

### Personal Injury Protection (PIP)

Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is a mandatory part of auto insurance policies in Florida. It’s available with the no-fault system as a way for drivers and their passengers to be protected if they suffer injuries in a car accident. All drivers must carry at least $10,000 of PIP coverage before they can register their vehicle in the state.

## Overview of PIP Coverage

Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is mandatory under the no-fault laws. It includes a mandatory requirement for all Florida drivers to pay for medical expenses and death benefits.

### Mandatory Requirement for All Florida Drivers

Florida drivers must carry PIP coverage in their auto insurance policies. The no-fault system is designed to provide up to 80% compensation of a policyholder’s medical expenses even if they are at fault for an accident. Injured passengers are also covered by PIP, which protects the policyholder from having to pay out of their own pocket.

### Medical Expenses Covered By PIP

PIP covers 80% of medical expenses stemming from a car accident at up to $10,000 per person. It pays for medical necessities for covered persons, including doctor’s visits, dental work, hospital bills and ambulance rides. Injured parties must seek medical attention within 14 days of an accident to be covered by PIP.

### Death Benefits Under PIP

PIP coverage also provides death benefits. If a policyholder is killed in a car accident, their insurance pays up to $5,000 toward funeral and burial expenses.

## Injury Threshold in Florida

Florida’s injury threshold is an exception to the no-fault law. It means that if a person suffers serious injuries in a car accident, they can file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. This allows the victim to potentially recover compensation for their pain and suffering and other damages that fall outside the $10,000 PIP limit.

Examples of the injury threshold are permanent disability, permanent scarring or disfigurement and permanent injury.

## Comparison to Fault-Based Systems in Other States

The Florida no-fault system requires all drivers to carry $10,000 in PIP and $10,000 in property damage liability (PDL) coverage as part of their auto insurance policy. By contrast, fault-based systems in other states mean that a driver who causes a car accident is directly responsible for compensating the other party or parties involved for their medical expenses and other damages. Instead of going through an auto insurance policy, the injured party or parties must file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver.
