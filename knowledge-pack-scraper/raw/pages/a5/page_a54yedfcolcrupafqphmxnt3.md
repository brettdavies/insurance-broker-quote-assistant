## Ohio car insurance rates by city
Auto insurance rates in Ohio can [vary between cities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/) for several reasons, including how frequent traffic accidents are in the area, the local average value of vehicles, weather risks, infrastructure problems, cost of repairs and more. As you can see from the table below, Cleveland and Columbus have notably higher average rates than the other cities. Part of what's happening with those cities is related to how densely populated they are and how high the population is overall, including more crowded highways and higher accident frequency and severity rates. More drivers means more risk, especially if those drivers are condensed into a relatively small area.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Ohio
In Ohio, [your age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) may be a significant factor in determining your rates. Young drivers usually pay some of the highest average car insurance rates because they have the least amount of experience behind the wheel and high accident frequency. Once you turn 25, car insurance rates generally start to drop, provided you maintain a clean driving record. Around age 70, car insurance rates start to increase again due to an escalating risk of accidents.
Here are the average annual [car insurance premiums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-calculator/) in Ohio for different age groups. The rates on the table below, with the exception of the ones for a 16-year-old driver, showcase drivers on their own insurance policies:
  * Male
  * Female

**Bankrate’s take:** When calculating your insurance rate, insurers are permitted to take your gender into consideration in most states, including Ohio. Statistics show that, for the most part, men are [more dangerous drivers](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813375) than women — which makes them statistically more likely to file a claim that will cost their insurer money. To make up for this added risk, many insurers charge men higher rates than their female counterparts when all other rating factors are equal.
### Cost considerations for young drivers in Ohio
[Auto insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) are based largely on risk levels, with younger, more inexperienced drivers being seen as some of the riskiest to insure. Typically, this translates to these young drivers paying higher average premiums. While time and experience may be the only way past these high rates, it may still be possible for young drivers to save some on premiums.
Drivers under 18 cannot purchase their own insurance — they are legally allowed to have their own policy with written consent of a parent or guardian. However, drivers between 18 and 25 can often save money by staying on their parents’ policy rather than getting their own. The table below highlights the average cost difference between these two scenarios:

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Ohio?
When you first buy a car insurance policy, and every time your policy renews, your insurance company will likely review your driving record. If you have any negative marks on your record, like a speeding ticket conviction, at-fault accident or OVI, your rate will go up. For example, after a speeding ticket in Ohio, average car insurance premiums change by about 21 percent more. An imperfect driving record can also affect how you shop for your policy; if you have an OVI on your record, for instance, you might need a company that specializes in [high-risk auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-auto-insurance-ohio/) and can file an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) on your behalf.
The table below shows average rates for Ohio drivers with different traffic violations on their record and how much these rates deviate from average rates for clean driving records in the state:

## How to save on car insurance in Ohio
Even though Ohio insurance rates are lower than the national average, they are still on the rise. In fact, Ohioan drivers may see their insurance costs increase by [33 percent this year](https://fox8.com/news/ohio-car-insurance-rates-could-jump-by-33-this-year-heres-why-study/). Here are some strategies for lowering your premium:
  * **Take advantage of****special****discounts** : Many car insurance [companies offer discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) for specific types of drivers. There are often savings for good students, being claims-free and having advanced safety features in your vehicle. You may also be able to take advantage of professional association or union discounts. For instance, educators and first responders can often qualify for lower insurance rates.
  * **Pay your premium in full** : If you can afford to pay your annual car insurance premium upfront and in full, rather than in monthly or quarterly installments, your car insurance carrier may lower your rate.
  * **Bundle your policies** : Buying your homeowners or renters insurance and your car insurance with the same company usually results in lower rates. You may also get a discount by having more than one vehicle insurance with the same company.
  * **Maintain a clean driving record** : Drivers with a clean motor vehicle record typically pay the lowest car insurance rates and may qualify for safe driver discounts. If you have a history of at-fault accidents or moving violations, working to maintain a clean driving record could help you achieve a cheaper premium over time.
  * **Switch insurance carriers** : [Switching insurance carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/switching-carriers/) may help you [save money](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) if you find a different provider that can offer you a cheaper rate. Comparing quotes from various carriers before your policy renews may show you if this could be an effective strategy for you.
