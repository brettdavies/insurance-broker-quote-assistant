GEICO Insurance was founded in 1936 by Leo and Lillian Goodwin. It was originally designed to provide federal employees and military personnel with lower-cost, high-quality insurance. 

GEICO is actually an anagram that stands for G- Government E-Employees I-Insurance Co-Company.

According to their market share, ratings, and the total number of policyholders, GEICO is currently ranking as the second-largest auto insurance provider in the nation. 

If you’ve been thinking about switching to Geico or you’re considering purchasing coverage with them, then this article is for you. Below, we’re going to break down coverage policies, discounts that policyholders can apply for, and [Geico insurance’s](https://www.insuranks.com/geico-insurance) average cost.

## **GEICO Car Insurance Cost**

So how much does geico car insurance cost. According to our  [average car insurance cost per month](https://www.insuranks.com/how-much-does-car-insurance-cost-per-month-on-average)  research, GEICO is actually a very affordable option. Monthly premiums are significantly more affordable than those of competitors.

The study mainly compared safe drivers and GEICO policyholders from around the USA and created an average premium amount based on different factors, such as the driver’s age.

 The study showed that GEICO’s average  full coverage insurance cost is $98 per month, or $1,175 per year.

 The lower end of the spectrum primarily consisted of older drivers (over age 65), while those who had higher premiums were younger drivers (around 25-years-old or older).

The average GEICO car insurance cost for minimum coverage is $40 per month or $480 per year, which is among the  [cheapest car insurance quotes](https://www.insuranks.com/car-insurance-quotes)  you can find, especially among the larger and more well known companies. 

More from GEICO’s average car insurance costs study:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coverage Type** | **Cost Per Month** | **Cost Per Year** |
| Full Coverage | $98 | $1,175 |
| Minimum Coverage | $40 | $480 |
| [GAP Coverage](https://www.insuranks.com/gap-insurance-coverage) | Not offered | Not offered |

### **How Much Is Geico Car Insurance a Month**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Coverage Type** | **Cost Per Month** |
| [Full Coverage](https://www.insuranks.com/car-insurance-quotes) | $98 |
| [Minimum Coverage](https://www.insuranks.com/liability-car-insurance-coverage) | $40 |
| [GAP Coverage](https://www.insuranks.com/gap-insurance-coverage) | Not offered |

Based on our research, GEICO car insurance cost per month is $40 per month for minimum coverage and $98 per month for full coverage on average.

GEICO typically offers six, nine, or twelve-month policy plans for auto insurance. You’ll typically pay a downpayment to start your coverage and then pay off the rest of your vehicle insurance policy over several months.

## **How To Lower Your GEICO Car Insurance**

Here are some of the best methods that you can use to lower your premium.

### **Maintain A Safe Driving Record**

The safer you drive, the lower your insurance will be. Suppose you can avoid any accidents and avoid traffic tickets that put points on your license for several years at a time. In that case, your car insurance premiums will likely decrease naturally over time.

### **Raise Your Credit Score**

One of the easiest ways to lower your GEICO car insurance rates is to raise your credit score, make all of your payments on time, and avoid any liens on your vehicle at all costs. Once you raise your credit score a bit, give your agent a call and talk to them about any discounts.

### **Take A Defensive Driving Course**

GEICO offers a low-cost online defensive driving class that you can easily complete within a couple of hours on your next day off. After taking the course, you’ll receive a brief virtual test. If you pass the test, you may be able to save between [5% and 10%](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/) on your premiums.

---

### **Get A More Economical Car**

If you’re driving a fancy [sports car](https://www.insuranks.com/cheapest-cars-to-insure), then expect to pay extra for it. These cars are statistically more likely to be involved in dangerous accidents. Consider switching to a more economical option with a standard 4-cylinder engine. Our [cheapest cars to insure](https://www.insuranks.com/cheapest-cars-to-insure) guide might be handy as well.

### **Move To Another City**

The closer you live to a big city, the more you’ll pay. By moving out to the suburbs or into the country, you could receive a considerable discount on your monthly auto insurance rates.

#### **Apply For Umbrella Insurance Policies**

In addition to auto insurance, GEICO also offers [life insurance](https://www.insuranks.com/compare-life-insurance-quotes), [home insurance](https://www.insuranks.com/compare-home-insurance-quotes), renters insurance, motorcycle insurance and more. You can save on your total policy by bundling all of your policies together under one GEICO policy.

## **GEICO GAP Insurance Cost**

GEICO GAP insurance cost cannot be measured since the company currently does not offer [GAP insurance](https://www.insuranks.com/gap-insurance-coverage)  as part of its services.

## **How To Cancel GEICO Car Insurance**

Cancelling your GEICO car insurance policy is pretty simple. All you need to do is call them up and let them know that you’re interested in cancelling your policy. It’s important to notify them before your next payment; otherwise, it will be automatically debited from your account. [GEICO has a no-cancellation-fee policy](https://www.geico.com/information/faq/cancel-insurance/#:%20~:%20text=If%20you%20want%20to%20cancel,%22%20and%20then%20%22auto.%22) , so you won’t have to pay anything extra should you decide to cancel your coverage!

NEVER GO WITH GEICO!!! They have the worst service ever!
I had a 6 months old, 7000 miles new car and one night I hit a deer on the road.
GEICO refused to pay for OEM replacement parts and offered a reconditioned, pre-used parts instead!
The difference in value was $186.. After making a few phone calls they said it states in my policy that they have the right to do so.
I was never told this fact at any point of purchasing the policy with GEICO.

I was a loyal GEICO customer for 15 years, with a pristine unblemished driving history and high coverage levels [and had never filed a previous claim].  I recently had a minor fender bender that was deemed by GEICO Claims to be '100% my fault.'   Shortly thereafter, I received a form follow-up letter from GEICO stating that, for that reason, GEICO would not pay for damage repairs to my vehicle.   A shocker to me.   Does an insurance policy with these terms really represent meaningful...

I been a loyal customer of Geico for 30 years. On Christmas Day 2021, I was stopping at a red light to make a left turn. I was stopped next to a police car, when an elderly driver approaching from the opposite direction crossed several lanes and hit me head on. It was purely the elderly lady’s fault. A few days later, the Geico adjuster gave my car a cursory look over, and estimated the hangar to be $6500. All body shops were booked until February, so my car was towed to my house so it...

I just noticed the Geico Mobile app deducts points from their customer if someone tailgates you, it deducts points from the customer. If you driving on a Main Rd, and someone is getting ready to run a stop sign, and you have to stop even though you have the right of way, the Geico Mibile App detects this, like a car was in front of you. So the Mobile App needs some improvements. When I drive. My ex-husband always tells me, I'm too far away from cars, and I need to get closer, Geico Mobile App...

Thank you Liberty Mutual for an excellent customer service! My son moved to Florida, yet his car was left in Colorado. Liberty Mutual helped us to keep it insured in a more affordable way.

I would like to give several thumbs up to Liberty Mutual for not increasing car insurance rates even following an accident. Was sure it's going to be raised but was pleasantly surprised. Guess my clean driving history helped as well! Excellent company.

I had insurance with GEICO for over 10 years and not even one claim. When I needed their help they were not there to assist me.
GEICO customers must learn that when you get into a car accident with another GEICO customer, this will not play well for either one of the sides involved. In other words, whatever GEICO decides on the case - is final. We had to learn the hard way that there was no way of beating the system on that one. 2 days after the car accident, while I was still giving details...

I do NOT recommend using GEICO!
We have 3 auto, RV, umbrella and homeowners with the. A few months ago I had one cars stolen off my driveway, it took me about 3 weeks just to get to talk to an agent… We always pay on time, no problems, no claims ever… About a month later I received a phone call saying they will send me the paperwork so I can get paid for the stolen car and buy a new one. Nothing ever came and seems like nothing ever will.
It has been over a month and I still have no... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

I have been a GEICO customer for many years and I can honestly say - they don’t care for their long time customers AT ALL!
I had to pay a large sum for my renewal. In Nov. I was told that I would not have to pay until Dec. I said ok but decided to still pay towards my renewal. GEICO rep was very happy to take my money.
After paying the rest of the money I was sent another bill for over $600 because I was late on my payments… So I paid in November and their rep had the wrong... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

GEICO do not care at all about their long term customers! They discriminate their clients.
I have been a single woman for 7 years now and had my car and my home insured with GEICO. All those years I was never late on a payment and never filed a claim. We had a few funerals and a wedding in the family, I sold my house so dropped the policy and inherited a car so I got a second policy for that car until sold one of them.
One day I received a letter from GEICO that starting Dec 31 they... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

GEICO is the worst company in the world! Slumlords! My payment was 5 days late and they decided to punish me and jack up my premium by more than $60!!!!!!!!!! OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I am so disgusted by their greedy and unjustified treat!

I am very disappointed with GEICO unprofessional customer service!
My car got hit on the back and GEICO offers absolutely no help with the damage. Their rep was very unhelpful and was not willing to share any kind of information with me, never called me back even once to help me understand how the process works. A representation well below average.
GEICO adjuster did a horrible job, did not describe a thing in the report but had good excuses as for why the prices were so... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

I have a dispute with GEICO over an unresolved claim, as they are unable and incapable of resolving my case.
If you contact their HQ to inquire and try to get some answers - this should turn a red light on for managers and executives, but it does not.
My car got rear-ended and totalled. GEICO adjuster gave me two options - retain the vehicle, or retune it below market value. Both are a major disadvantage! MY car is used for business travel and other necessities and I am currently taking... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

GEICO only care about the money they take from you!!!
I was insured with another company and wanted to switch to them. The policy they offered was a little lower but when told them that my wife had a car accident over 6 months ago, they jacked the price from $73 to $168 because she was considered a high risk driver.
She was not even at fault for that accident!!!!!!!! Terrible!!
They do not care to help you as a customer and only want to take your money!! DO NOT GO WITH GEICO!

I am an active duty military and I have been with GEICO for over 8 years.
A few months ago they decided to raise my premium by ore than $60 for the same exact cars I have had since forever, without no warning!
When I called to ask why, they said that repairing any of my cars would cost more than their actual value and deductible. That is despite the fact that I have been paying them $220 a month for 8 long years and no claims!! Over $20,000!
This may actually off my car completely…... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

GEICO don’t care for you! My car got hit by an older gentleman from out of state and broke off the mirror while I Was completely standing still!
GEICO demand that I pay my deductible BEFORE having my car fixed!!! Why are they making me pay my deductibles if this accident was not even my fault?! Disappointed!!!

I have been a GEICO customer for a long time now, until they decided to screw over my son who was deployed overseas, for his auto insurance.
Before leaving, he informed GEICO, as well as his bank that he will not be using his car for an undisclosed period of time.
His bank canceled his credit cards even tho he told them he’s leaving the country. Then his automatic payments did not go through.
GEICO reported my son to the DMV in Florida which got his license suspended…

Do NOT get GEICO! I was buying car and home insurance with Arrowhead. They were supposed to call my the same eve with a quote but never did. The following day I went into my bank account and discovered that they charged me $599 and additional $30 overdraft charge.
Arrowhead sent me a check 3-5 days after but GEICO said they would put the $30 back into my account - they never did!
I can’t get a hold of anyone to talk to and never got that money back so far!
KEEP AWAY FROM GEICO AND... [Read More](/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")
