With car insurance rates up [more than 30%](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/the-true-cost-of-auto-insurance/?clkid=c%3A908de433-3e6c-4e72-804b-6925cbdf4d1d%7Cr%3A586533449b0e11f0a0d0cb5e9f0a63ee%7Cus-aol%7Ctext-link) from 2023, there’s no better time to take a second look at your policy.
One great way to lower your bill is to compare the discounts available from your carrier and the competition. Insurers offer rate reductions for all kinds of things, including putting more than one car on your policy, [bundling home and auto coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/select/should-i-bundle-home-and-auto-insurance/), completing a safe-driving course and even being a homeowner.
  * **Read on:**[**Best cheap car insurance companies**](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance/)


Not all discounts are available in all states, however, and some discounts can’t be combined. So, be sure to research an insurer before enrolling.
We reviewed our previous reporting on the best  companies to identify the brands offering the best discounts across numerous categories.

##  How to save on car insurance
While car insurance has become a big expense for many Americans, there are still ways to save. Here are a few notable ways to [cut down your car insurance bill](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/):
  * **Raise your credit score:** In many states, insurance companies can use your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/) to decide how much you’ll pay.
  * **Drive safely:** Keeping a clean driving record free of accidents, tickets and other violations can help keep costs down.
  * **Consider a pay-per-mile insurance policy:** If you aren’t driving much, getting an insurance policy that [charges by the mile](https://www.cnbc.com/select/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/) could help lower your price.
  * **Pay in full:** Many companies offer discounts for paying your premiums in full rather than paying month-to-month.
