NEVER GO WITH GEICO!!! They have the worst service ever! I had a 6 months old, 7000 miles new car and one night I hit a deer on the road. GEICO refused to pay for OEM replacement parts and offered a reconditioned, pre-used parts instead! The difference in value was $186.. After making a few phone calls they said it states in my policy that they have the right to do so. I was never told this fact at any point of purchasing the policy with GEICO. I called 2 other companies who told... [Read More](https://www.insuranks.com/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

I was a loyal GEICO customer for 15 years, with a pristine unblemished driving history and high coverage levels [and had never filed a previous claim]. I recently had a minor fender bender that was deemed by GEICO Claims to be '100% my fault.' Shortly thereafter, I received a form follow-up letter from GEICO stating that, for that reason, GEICO would not pay for damage repairs to my vehicle. A shocker to me. Does an insurance policy with these terms really represent meaningful... [Read More](https://www.insuranks.com/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

I been a loyal customer of Geico for 30 years. On Christmas Day 2021, I was stopping at a red light to make a left turn. I was stopped next to a police car, when an elderly driver approaching from the opposite direction crossed several lanes and hit me head on. It was purely the elderly lady’s fault. A few days later, the Geico adjuster gave my car a cursory look over, and estimated the hangar to be $6500. All body shops were booked until February, so my car was towed to my house so it...

I just noticed the Geico Mobile app deducts points from their customer if someone tailgates you, it deducts points from the customer. If you driving on a Main Rd, and someone is getting ready to run a stop sign, and you have to stop even though you have the right of way, the Geico Mibile App detects this, like a car was in front of you. So the Mobile App needs some improvements. When I drive. My ex-husband always tells me, I'm too far away from cars, and I need to get closer, Geico Mobile App...

Do not use Liberty Mutual for your motorcycle insurance!!! I ride a ’96 Goldwing and they had me paying $568 a year.. Terrible rates!!! I tried Geico and their quote Wass for $189.69 - 67% LESS THAN LIBERTY!!!! I called them to cancel my policy and now they want to charge me $126 for canceling early… DO NOT USE LIBERTY MUTUAL FOR MOTORCYCLE INSURANCE!!!

I had insurance with GEICO for over 10 years and not even one claim. When I needed their help they were not there to assist me. GEICO customers must learn that when you get into a car accident with another GEICO customer, this will not play well for either one of the sides involved. In other words, whatever GEICO decides on the case - is final. We had to learn the hard way that there was no way of beating the system on that one. 2 days after the car accident, while I was still giving details...

If you contact their HQ to inquire and try to get some answers - this should turn a red light on for managers and executives, but it does not. My car got rear-ended and totalled.

GEICO only care about the money they take from you!!! I was insured with another company and wanted to switch to them. The policy they offered was a little lower but when told them that my wife had a car accident over 6 months ago, they jacked the price from $73 to $168 because she was considered a high risk driver. She was not even at fault for that accident!!!!!!!! Terrible!! They do not care to help you as a customer and only want to take your money!! DO NOT GO WITH GEICO!

I am an active duty military and I have been with GEICO for over 8 years. A few months ago they decided to raise my premium by ore than $60 for the same exact cars I have had since forever, without no warning! When I called to ask why, they said that repairing any of my cars would cost more than their actual value and deductible. That is despite the fact that I have been paying them $220 a month for 8 long years and no claims!! Over $20,000! This may actually off my car completely…...

GEICO don’t care for you! My car got hit by an older gentleman from out of state and broke off the mirror while I Was completely standing still! GEICO demand that I pay my deductible BEFORE having my car fixed!!! Why are they making me pay my deductibles if this accident was not even my fault?! Disappointed!!!

I have been a GEICO customer for a long time now, until they decided to screw over my son who was deployed overseas, for his auto insurance. Before leaving, he informed GEICO, as well as his bank that he will not be using his car for an undisclosed period of time. His bank canceled his credit cards even tho he told them he’s leaving the country. Then his automatic payments did not go through. GEICO reported my son to the DMV in Florida which got his license suspended… When a... [Read More](https://www.insuranks.com/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")

Do NOT get GEICO! I was buying car and home insurance with Arrowhead. They were supposed to call my the same eve with a quote but never did. The following day I went into my bank account and discovered that they charged me $599 and additional $30 overdraft charge. Arrowhead sent me a check 3-5 days after but GEICO said they would put the $30 back into my account - they never did! I can’t get a hold of anyone to talk to and never got that money back so far! KEEP AWAY FROM GEICO AND... [Read More](https://www.insuranks.com/geico-insurance#user-reviews "read more")
