Why we picked this company

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
* No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
* Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

## USAA

USAA focuses on competitive premiums for military personnel and their families. It also has good financial strength ratings and ranks highly in J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction study.[[1]](#cite-1) Liability-only car insurance with USAA costs $52 per month, while full-coverage car insurance costs $99.

## GEICO DriveEasy vs. USAA SafePilot

DriveEasy is GEICO’s optional usage-based insurance program. You can access it through the GEICO app and lock in a 15% sign-up discount as well as up to 25% off on your premium for demonstrating good driving habits.

The app automatically tracks your driving and considers factors like speeding and hard braking to determine your savings. Unfortunately, poor driving habits with DriveEasy can result in a higher premium.[[2]](#cite-2)

USAA’s SafePilot telematics program is similar to DriveEasy. It monitors your driving behaviors and can reward you with an initial discount of 10%. If you prove you’re an exceptionally good driver, you can score up to 30% off your car insurance rates. Note that SafePilot may penalize you for handheld phone usage and even hands-free phone calls.[[3]](#cite-3)

## GEICO vs. USAA: Which is the cheapest?

USAA offers the cheapest average rates across all categories, but your unique rate depends on several factors, like your location, [**age**](/car-insurance/driver/age/), gender, marital status, [**driving record**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/), and discounts. Also, if you’re not active military, a veteran, or a family member of one, you won’t be able to apply for a USAA policy.

GEICO and USAA have lineups of several main car insurance coverage options, including [**bodily injury liability**](/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage liability, [**personal injury protection**](/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/), and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/). [**Collision**](/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) and [**comprehensive**](/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) policies are also available from both car insurance companies.

Additional add-ons are available, like roadside or emergency road service and rental car reimbursement. However, GEICO offers mechanical breakdown insurance, a unique add-on you won’t find with USAA.

## GEICO vs. USAA FAQs

As you’re shopping for car insurance, here’s some additional information about car insurance policies from GEICO and USAA.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

No, USAA is not the same as GEICO. USAA is an insurance company that serves the military community. GEICO, on the other hand, caters to all types of drivers and is one of the largest car insurers in the U.S.

USAA’s car insurance policies and other insurance products aren’t available to everyone. To secure an auto policy from USAA, you must be affiliated with the military and become a member.

Compared to other car insurance companies such as GEICO, USAA’s car insurance rates are cheaper. But you can only take advantage of these lower premiums if you have a connection to the military and join USAA.

State Farm is GEICO’s biggest competitor. Both insurance companies target drivers with a variety of auto insurance policies.
