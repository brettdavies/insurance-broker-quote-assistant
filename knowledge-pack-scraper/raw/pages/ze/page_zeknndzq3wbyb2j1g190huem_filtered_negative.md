In Florida, the Wind peril, or damages from hurricane are separate from the remaining perils of fire, theft, etc. the coverage for the wind peril is what brings the total cost into the stratsophere.
Opting not to purchase [wind coverage](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Florida+homeowners+insurance+without+wind+coverage&cId=30a58c65-a2d3-42e0-9e5f-4ee05b7a9016&iId=aa625ebf-434d-4775-83c9-57c0dc7fd87d) but purchasing the coverage for other perils is what some have done.

Flood too. And the stupid new law that says your flood must match your wind which totally fucks me since my expensive stuff is in the second floor and will never flood. It very well could have the roof blown off

Not exactly "fair" in the American way of life though, but that's on life support these days.

Yes, that has always been a grey line for insurers between wind driven water and flood from rivers and such from excess rain.

We had a well known company, paid off house, I even paid extra for replacement coverage. Had wind and flood. We should have been fully covered and we did everything right. Then we had some damage from Ian. First time we ever had a claim. I could tell you a whole dramatic story but I’ll condense it to, they ended up paying less than half the damages only after we hired a lawyer. That company dropped our coverage and we didn’t make new coverage a priority, then it was hurricane season again and it was too late. We are near the water in [Sarasota county](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Sarasota+county+hurricane+damage+insurance&cId=52ab6001-b5ad-4f15-bece-82e8d0cf92ef&iId=03129e23-bc07-4819-a9b6-873febb79ad2). After Milton/Helene we found out it was cheaper and quicker to hire people directly to repair the damages than deal with the insurance. No hassles, no inspectors, no begging for my own money. We’re 100% repaired already when most people’s insurance companies are still jerking them around. I’ll never use insurance again. It feels predatory now that I’ve seen the outcomes. Why would I contract for a service when they don’t provide the service you pay for?

My uncle calls “insurance” legalized larceny because they do this.
My mom’s house is paid off and she dropped flood and wind coverage because she has a decent nest egg for repairs and excellent credit. She’s also further inland even though she’s in a coastal town.
As annoying and expensive as insurance is, I’d suggest looking at several factors before making a decision to drop insurance or not. One of the things you could do is take the monthly premium and deposit it in a [high yield savings account](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=high+yield+savings+account+for+home+repairs&cId=306f674c-2e32-45ee-9f91-0305fc69e2de&iId=2fe43091-8525-4d4a-bfdb-0d3ae123744c). Earmark the account for repairs and don’t touch it for anything else.

I read about that too. But it turns out that people were submitting for flood damage when they didn’t have flood insurance in their policy. So the numbers are skewed.

Yes! My great grandfather built our house in 1930. We had insurance for decades but after [Michael](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Hurricane+Michael+insurance+claims+Florida&cId=caf483d3-56dc-4f20-b6c6-29b7f3d8cb97&iId=1f0bf846-6155-4a3a-bfe4-06e1e7b45129), that proved to be useless (we had over $11k in damage and insurance paid us a grand total of $1000). We dropped our insurance after that and pay our premium to ourselves (in a HYS). Now if there’s a storm, we just use the cash to pay for repairs. We usually get a better price and we’re usually near the top of the list with the better contractors/repairmen because we’re paying cash, not dealing with insurance red tape.
(Granted our house is not worth millions so this anecdote probably skews the data. If our house was a newer build we would probably do things differently.)

You can get coverage without wind which makes insurance affordable. The wind portion of my policy was $2700. Once I removed wind, the rest of the policy was a little under $800.

I opt out of flood and wind coverage which saves me over $10k per year. When you consider paying $10k AND having high deductible it starts to make sense, but you have to be financially prepared for a disaster.

My wife and I’s 5 year plan is to pay off the house and self insure. That includes even removing our hurricane coverage. It’s just not worth it anymore, and realistically the only way we can continue to live in FL. This is coming from people who were born and raised here.

Three of my neighbors have no home insurance.
We are not in a flood zone area, and their homes have long been paid off.

My dad had only been living in FL for maybe 5 years before Ian hit and flooded his house. No flood insurance, but still pretty much broke even between the repairs and the premiums he would have been paying had he been carrying it. No regrets at all from him.

a lot of older folks allow their homeowner insurance to lapse after the mortgage is paid off, because they're on a fixed income and can't afford it. Not that unusual. The national average is around 7.5%. Here in FL it's more like 10%.

Considering 46% of Florida homes are mortgage free 10% seems like a low number. But there is another reason that does make a lot of sense. If the home meets cat 4/5 standards, metal roof, impact windows and doors…,. The chances of damage are very low. And damage caused is usually less than a $25,000.00 deductible.

We did before we moved. The trailer was only valued at 6000 with an acre of land with old oaks on it. Insurance wanted us to cut down the whole hammock of trees. No, we did sell but got a nice chunck because of those pretty old trees. Got a mortgage now they don't play but I'm ok 😊

My grandfather built and owned his home in Jupiter Farms. He didn't have insurance for the last 10 years he lived. He couldn't afford it and he was confident his home would stay standing. He built it elevated on a hill of dirt, so it never flooded. It really depends on the house and land if you should risk it.
