## About Geico Pet Insurance
Although Geico offers pet insurance, the pet policies it sells are not administered by the insurance company but rather by Embrace, one of our [top-rated pet insurance companies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance).
[Embrace](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/embrace-pet-insurance), which scored a 4.5 out of 5 in our best pet insurance companies rating, offers coverage for dogs and cats with plans for accidents and illnesses, accidents only, and three levels of optional wellness coverage for routine care costs, including [vaccinations](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/does-pet-insurance-cover-vaccinations) and annual exams. Our research also found that Embrace has the best unlimited annual coverage among the best pet insurance companies we reviewed.  

Pros:
  * Policies issued by Embrace, a top-rated pet insurer
  * 48-hour waiting period for accident coverage
  * 10% multi-pet discount


Cons:
  * Geico’s website provides limited information about coverage
  * Various exclusions and restrictions


## What Does Geico Pet Insurance Cover?
Geico’s pet insurance is administered by Embrace, which offers an accident-and-illness plan and an accident-only plan. The plan you purchase will dictate the exact coverage your pet will receive.
### **Accident-and-illness**
The accident-and-illness plan offered through Embrace has a maximum enrollment age of 14 years old and covers the expenses for the following services:
  * Emergency care
  * Hospitalization
  * Surgery
  * Diagnostic tests
  * Orthopedic conditions
  * Cancer
  * Chronic conditions
  * Specialist care
  * Breed-specific, congenital, and genetic conditions
  * Dental illnesses


### **Accident-only**
Embrace’s accident-only plan covers unexpected injury expenses for things like bite wounds, broken bones, and swallowed objects. It also has no age limit, so dogs and cats 15 years or older who are excluded from Embrace’s accident-and-illness plan are eligible for this coverage.
## Additional Options Offered by Geico Pet Insurance
Embrace has an optional wellness plan called Wellness Rewards that helps cover routine care costs. The insurer also offers prescription drug coverage and exam fee add-ons.
### **Wellness Rewards plan with Embrace**
Embrace’s Wellness Rewards plan has three different levels with annual benefit amounts of $300, $500 or $700. The plan helps cover services like vaccinations, regular exams, various tests, [dental cleanings](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/what-is-pet-dental-insurance), [microchipping](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/how-much-does-it-cost-to-microchip-a-pet), [spaying or neutering](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/how-much-does-it-cost-to-spay-or-neuter-a-dog) and flea, tick and heartworm prevention.
Wellness Rewards also lacks a deductible and comes as a dog wellness plan, a cat wellness plan, or a puppy and kitten wellness plan.
### **Exam fee coverage with Embrace**
This add-on reimburses exam fees for accidents and illnesses, but does not include routine vet visits.
### **Prescription drug coverage with Embrace**
Embrace will reimburse vet-prescribed medications for a covered condition with this add-on, including:
  * Allergy medication
  * Antibiotics
  * Anxiety medication
  * Insulin and supplies
  * Ear and eye drops
  * Oral chemotherapy
  * Pain relief medication
  * Steroids


## Does Geico Pet Insurance Impose Restrictions?
Embrace has several restrictions and exclusions to its pet insurance policies.
### **Preexisting conditions**
Most pet insurers do not cover preexisting conditions, which are any health problems your pet develops before your pet insurance coverage starts.
But Embrace will look at the curability of your pet’s condition, and if the condition is curable (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and a year has passed since your pet exhibited symptoms or received treatment, Embrace may offer coverage for the condition in the future.
### **Waiting periods**
Embrace, like most other pet insurers, has [waiting periods](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance/how-do-pet-insurance-waiting-periods-work) before its coverage starts, ranging from 48 hours for accidents to 14 days for illnesses. The insurer also has a six-month waiting period for orthopedic conditions, but an exam and waiver process can reduce this to just two weeks.
Note that coverage will not extend to any health problems that arise during a waiting period, as these are considered preexisting conditions.
### **Cosmetic procedures**
Embrace’s coverage will not extend to cosmetic procedures that are not medically necessary, like ear cropping or tail docking.
### **Illnesses or injuries resulting from neglect, fighting, or cruelty**
Treatment for injuries or illnesses due to an owner’s negligence, poor treatment, or recklessness will not be covered by Embrace.
### **Breeding and pregnancy**
Breeding, pregnancy and whelping expenses will not be covered.
## Discounts Offered by Geico Pet Insurance
The following discounts are available to pet owners through Embrace:
  * A 5% discount is available to active military members, except for those in New York or Tennessee.
  * A 10% multi-pet discount is available for pet owners enrolling more than one pet.
