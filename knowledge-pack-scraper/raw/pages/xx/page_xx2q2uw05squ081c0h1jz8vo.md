#  State farm homeowners insurance deductible 
We recently had to file our first homeowners insurance claim in the 6 years we’ve owned our house. We had a huge storm with 75+ mph winds and torrential rains, tornadoes etc. We randomly had the wood paneling in our living room (interior wall, other side is a bedroom) sustain water damage. It was wet and mushy and all warped. We want it fixed because we don’t want mold growing etc. roof is 4 years old so we aren’t sure how water got in. We also need a professional to figure out how this happened. 
Anyway, State Farm says it’s covered under our policy. We have a $3,000 deductible. They said they deduct the deductible from the money they send us for the repairs. We don’t pay it up front. (We are waiting for a callback from the contractor they helped us find). To me that sounds like if it’s going to cost $6,000 to fix they take off $3k and we only get $3k. My husband thinks we get the full amount for the repairs which makes no sense to me. State farm has to pay themselves the deductible. We had a total loss on a car last year and they took the deductible out of that and we got less money back for our payment. So that’s why I think we aren’t going to get the full amount (which is not going to be helpful we don’t have a ton of money right now). So anyone know who’s right?

The deductible is deducted from final payout. 
You are correct If your total claim was $6,000 you would receive a check for $3,000 
If your total claim was $500,000 you would receive $497,000 
On claims where you recover depreciation it is deducted from the first payout. 
Recovered depreciation means they say it is likely to cost $20,000 to fix this thing so they will initially pay out the cost of the damaged item based off of its age on a depreciation schedule or it's fair market value depending on the item. In this case let's say you have a roof claim and the roof is 10 years old and it's rated as 70% of its value on their schedule. That means that they will pay out 70% of the $20,000 up front minus deductible so you would receive $14,000 - 3,000. Then once the roof is replaced, you will get a second reimbursement check for the remaining amount, in this example 6000 additional dollars. 
All that to be shortened to, your policy deductible is what you will pay anytime you make a claim out of pocket.

You're spot on with everything except your first sentence: 
> The deductible is deducted from final payout. 
The deductible is applied to the total claim prior to any payments being issued, so it's effectively subtracted from the first payment, not the last, other than less-common case-by-case instances where it's applied to a later payment for a specific reason.

I say from final payout as in the total. Final may be the first payment, because they may not capture depreciation. 
The final payment may include adjustments based on other damage etc. 
I think I should have just said from the first payment honestly, that's a clearer way to communicate what's happening. It's possible with a high deductible, that it eats the entire first payment and a little bit of the next one but that's extremely rare in personal lines IMO.

I am battling State Farm now. Maybe it is me. We need roof replacement due to wind/hail. State Farm sent me the value of the roof on the house, less depreciation, and also kept out my deductible ($2900). I am now being told I also hav e to pay the deductible to a deductible out of my pocket to the contractor as well. This in essence is me paying a deductible twice. In all conversations with State Farm, they keep saying I didn’t pay State Farm my deductible, though it is line item Ed out of my first check for depreciation; “Less Depreciation”. The sum of my first check was value - depreciation - deductible = final payout. Why do I then have to shell out a second deductible to my contractor? Secondly, if the depreciation check with the deductible already held out is treated as separate from the actual new replacement, why then can State Farm slide the accountability for the deductible to the replacement roof? I feels like o am being hit twice for my deductible.

You should only have to pay it once, which yes, would be witheld from the first check. Someone has messed up the math, it sounds like.

Your husband is wrong. The point of having a deductible is so that you have some skin in the game. If insurance paid the entirety of the damages, then where would your 3k deductible come into play? Ask him that.

There are some types of losses that are not subject to the policy deductible with most carriers and plans, some that even don't have a deductible. They aren't generally the main structure of the home related though.

You have a $3,000 per claim deductible. If your covered loss is $6,000, you will receive $3,000.

They take the entire assessment, subtract your deductible and cut you a check. You pay the deductible amount to your contractor plus the amount state farm gives you.  
Do yourself a favor and run from State farm asap. 7 months they strung us around to fix our roof and we keeps incurring internal water damage that entire time.  
They are horrible.
