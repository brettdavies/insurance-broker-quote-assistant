# State farm homeowners insurance deductible

We recently had to file our first homeowners insurance claim in the 6 years we’ve owned our house. We had a huge storm with 75+ mph winds and torrential rains, tornadoes etc. We randomly had the wood paneling in our living room (interior wall, other side is a bedroom) sustain water damage. It was wet and mushy and all warped. We want it fixed because we don’t want mold growing etc. roof is 4 years old so we aren’t sure how water got in. We also need a professional to figure out how this happened.

Anyway, State Farm says it’s covered under our policy. We have a $3,000 deductible. They said they deduct the deductible from the money they send us for the repairs. We don’t pay it up front. (We are waiting for a callback from the contractor they helped us find). To me that sounds like if it’s going to cost $6,000 to fix they take off $3k and we only get $3k. My husband thinks we get the full amount for the repairs which makes no sense to me. State farm has to pay themselves the deductible. We had a total loss on a car last year and they took the deductible out of that and we got less money back for our payment. So that’s why I think we aren’t going to get the full amount (which is not going to be helpful we don’t have a ton of money right now). So anyone know who’s right?
