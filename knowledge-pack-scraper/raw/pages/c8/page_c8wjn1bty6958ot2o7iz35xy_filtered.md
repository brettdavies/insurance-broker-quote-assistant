## GEICO Coverage

### Coverage Options - 4 / 5

GEICO offers a basic renters insurance policy that covers both personal property loss and personal injury protection, essentially ensuring both the apartment building and the belongings housed within the apartment unit as well as its residents and any visitors. Their personal property protection covers damages caused by known perils such as fire, lightning, smoke, theft, etc., while the liability component is intended to cover medical payments in the event residents or guests are harmed while on the property. Although GEICO's discount and coverage options are very limited, they do extend a considerable list of additional coverages or plan riders that include protection for stocks, bonds, jewelry, business property, and other valuables.

## Pricing & Discounts

### Add-Ons & Discounts - 4 / 5

GEICO.com offers discounts for customers who bundle their renters insurance with their auto insurance coverage as well as those who have installed sprinklers, smoke alarms, or home security systems. GEICO fails to disclose deductible options or coverage amounts, so those interested in obtaining further plan details should request an online quote through the company's website.

## Customer Experience

### Customer Service - 3.5 / 5

GEICO Corporation—headquartered in Washington, DC—is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has received mostly negative customer feedback on the organization's website, though this corresponds to the company as a whole and not their renters insurance specifically. Their products and services have been the object of numerous complaints from former clients, which is quite common for a company of its size. Geico has received mixed customer reviews on TrustPilot.com.
