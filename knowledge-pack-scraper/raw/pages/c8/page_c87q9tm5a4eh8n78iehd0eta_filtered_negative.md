One of the advantages of working with ADPIA as an option for workers’ comp is that the company’s payroll and HR technology helps make it easier to manage workers’ comp policies and premium payments. With the [Pay-By-Pay® Premium Payment Program](https://insurance.adp.com/what-we-offer/workers-compensation.aspx), ADP automatically calculates and forwards workers’ comp payments to the insurance carrier each time a business runs its payroll. This pay-as-you-go structure results in more accurate premium payments, improved cash flow, and easier audit processes.

* **Temporary total disability:** This type of disability pay applies when a worker is entirely unable to work during a relatively short-term recovery period. For example, a worker who requires an eye procedure that leaves them temporarily unable to see may receive temporary total disability benefits during that time. Typically, following the waiting period, a worker can expect these benefits to be calculated as 66.67%, or two-thirds, of their weekly income and may be subject to minimum and/or maximum amounts.
* **Temporary partial disability:** Temporary partial disability benefits are available when a worker is partly unable to work, either in duration or in scope, during a relatively short-term recovery period. For example, a worker who injures their back might only be able to work part-time or in a different capacity. In these situations, the worker may receive temporary partial disability benefits. Typically, a worker receiving temporary partial disability benefits can expect to be paid an amount that is somewhere in between the wage for the new, limited role and their role before the injury.
* **Permanent total disability:** Permanent total disability benefits are available when a worker is entirely unable to continue earning as a result of a lasting injury or illness. For example, a worker who suffers from paralysis or a severe brain injury may recover permanent total disability benefits. Typically, a worker can expect these benefits to be 66.67% of their average weekly wage until death or retirement, depending on state laws.

Every workers’ compensation policy will list explicit _exclusions_, or things that the policy does not cover. These exclusions define certain types of workers, injuries, and expenses that fall outside of the policy’s coverage. Generally, these exclusions will match what we’ve described above—that specific types of workers and injuries occurring outside of normal work procedures are not covered by the policy. However, sometimes policies will include a list of exclusions that define additional items (types of workers, injuries, or scenarios) that fall outside of coverage. It is important to read through the policy to understand both what will, and will not, be covered.

* **Annual payroll:** The wages of an injured employee are directly proportional to their payout on a claim, so payroll is a significant factor in determining the cost of the policy. Generally, as your payroll grows, you can expect to pay more for coverage.
