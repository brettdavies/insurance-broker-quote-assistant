## How Do We Rate GEICO?
#### Breakdown
4.0/5
Coverage Options
4.0/5
Add-Ons & Discounts
3.5/5
Customer Service
4.5/5
Financial Strength
#### Our Overall Rating: 4 / 5 (Very good)
Although better known for their auto insurance policies, GEICO Corporation is also a leading property and casualty insurer offering basic homeowners and renters insurance coverages. They provide a limited amount of discounts and are not as forthcoming with actual plan details as they are about the reasons why one should consider renters insurance in the first place, yet offer fair rates and sizable discounts for those who bundle their renters and auto policies. Although GEICO customers seem divided about whether the company upholds the highest possible customer service standards, they've received fewer complaints than similar-sized competitors, and remains a solid provider with an excellent financial reputation.

## GEICO Coverage
### Coverage Options - 4 / 5
GEICO offers a basic renters insurance policy that covers both personal property loss and personal injury protection, essentially ensuring both the apartment building and the belongings housed within the apartment unit as well as its residents and any visitors. Their personal property protection covers damages caused by known perils such as fire, lightning, smoke, theft, etc., while the liability component is intended to cover medical payments in the event residents or guests are harmed while on the property. Although GEICO's discount and coverage options are very limited, they do extend a considerable list of additional coverages or plan riders that include protection for stocks, bonds, jewelry, business property, and other valuables.
Basic Coverage |  Personal Property Personal Liability

## Pricing & Discounts
### Add-Ons & Discounts - 4 / 5
GEICO.com offers discounts for customers who bundle their renters insurance with their auto insurance coverage as well as those who have installed sprinklers, smoke alarms, or home security systems. GEICO fails to disclose deductible options or coverage amounts, so those interested in obtaining further plan details should request an online quote through the company's website.

## Customer Experience
### Customer Service - 3.5 / 5
GEICO Corporation—headquartered in Washington, DC—is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has received mostly negative customer feedback on the organization's website, though this corresponds to the company as a whole and not their renters insurance specifically. Their products and services have been the object of numerous complaints from former clients, which is quite common for a company of its size. Geico has received mixed customer reviews on TrustPilot.com.
