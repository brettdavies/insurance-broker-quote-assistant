Although better known for their auto insurance policies, GEICO Corporation is also a leading property and casualty insurer offering basic homeowners and renters insurance coverages. They provide a limited amount of discounts and are not as forthcoming with actual plan details as they are about the reasons why one should consider renters insurance in the first place, yet offer fair rates and sizable discounts for those who bundle their renters and auto policies. Although GEICO customers seem divided about whether the company upholds the highest possible customer service standards, they've received fewer complaints than similar-sized competitors, and remains a solid provider with an excellent financial reputation.

*The NAIC complaint ratio (in this case 0.0) is a ratio of the number of complaints a company received to the its total premiums written in a calendar year. The median complaint ratio across all companies is 1. A score below 1 means the company received fewer than average complaints. A score above 1 means the company received a higher number of complaints than average.
