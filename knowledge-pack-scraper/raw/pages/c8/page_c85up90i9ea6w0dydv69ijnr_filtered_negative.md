Tesla vehicles are tough to insure. Repair costs are much higher than your average vehicle and not all body shops are capable of repairing Teslas correctly. Those factors and others drive up the premiums. If State Farm misquoted the premium initially, the customer can always try to find a lower premium somewhere else.

When I was looking for an EV back in January I got VIN numbers for not only Teslas but for Chevy equinox ev, Honda crv hybrid etc
I couldn't believe how much cheaper the equinox was compared to several other vehicles. I pay $800 a year with full coverage, full court and $500 deductible.

State Farm has to be the shiniest turd of the bunch. I had them, insuring my Mercedes. After a no fault of mine, a truck hit my parked car in a lot. I was told that I would have to become the lead investigator, prosecutor and bounty hunter in order to collect a penny from the other driver. I was then told, after paying my deductible, that not all the repairs were going to be covered. They said my car had specialized parts, air ride suspension from factory, that was not a part of the accident even though it was damaged by. Other things, including them questioning whether I had coverage immediately after, scared me initially. Never been in an accident, dealt with this. So, car is gone for 6 months, no fault of insurer. Roughly about that time, I got notification my rates were doubling. Upon inquiring, they read that this accident was now labeled “at fault”. I never got a call back from adjuster, only one. My agent acted like she cared, but she too never called me back once. Just the worst experience ever! Tell me you’re going to be there for me for the soul purpose I am commanded to own… and, literally abandoned by the police, the insurer, agent, collision, etc… I felt like the lowest of. Like my life mattered to no one. You only cared about my money.

Tesla insurance is both the best/cheapest and the worst/most expensive insurance for the Cybertruck and in general. I've gotten my monthly premium as low as $140 and I'm other months as high as $500. The differentiation factor is due to your safety score and how well you drive. Once you're score is high 90+, Using FSD consistently is a must if you want the cheapest rate. My most expensive month occurred when I loaned the truck to a friend safety score by 40+ points. FSD is a must at all times..

The cybertruck is quite unique. The body is made of what materials? Insurance has to cover. I wouldn't buy one. State farm is increasing vehicle and home owners insurance. Because of " inflation". I don't like it. I have 2 ves one is a 2015 f150. Xlt. The other 2018 Ford Explorer. 340.00 a month. 1k deductible. Increasing last year from 271.00. My rate of pay and hours do not compensate. I wish anyone buying a cybertruck.

State Farm is a very corrupt insurance company. Years back in their LI office, I recorded using a RadioShack micro tape recorder when I was a teenager, an insurance premium contract under assigned risk at a very good rate. Turned out I got that rate by them putting me and many new drivers on others people's policy's. The whole office was doing this, and would then change the yearly payment, to a three month and I recorded the manager telling me no one would take a kids word over theirs. Guess what? Brought the recording to the DAs office in hauppauge and got my money back. Home office threw a few of their own under the bus as the saying goes, and arrests were made.

State Farm is not a corrupt organization. State Farm agencies are independent contractors and what your agency was doing was doing was illegal and absolutely outside the agency’s agreement with State Farm. You betcha corporate dumped them and probably helped the DA in the investigation.

If I was an insurance company I would avoid insuring any Tesla. So many lawsuits and accidents have been filed already, and the lithium battery in several of them has self-ignited and caused explosions. Sometimes resulting in the house burning down if charging in the garage

Pay 300$ /mo in Manhattan for 2018 Model 3. Clean record, used to pay 80$ / mo and better insurance via Tesla in Chicago. I get it why so many drive without insurance and the cost is shifted to honest drivers. Legislation is crap and favors big corporations. If I’ll get something like an EV tax I’ll snap and buy worst diesel generator and charge the car.

State Farm is a mess. When my son started driving they said my umbrella insurance would increase a little. It went from $400 to $800. Then my 2nd son started driving 3 years later and it went to $1,200. This past year it went to $1,600. Gotta love Cali. Wake up everyone. If you vote for Newsom for president this will be across the country. Btw, to register a $40,000 car in Cali, the registration is $900. Anyone but loser Newsom if you want your $ in your pocket!

I can’t help to think the rates are politically motivated. Due to Elon buying Twitter now X and restoring free speech for all plus supporting Trump the Left. Has gone crazy with attacks to destroy Tesla vehicles owned by individuals plus Tesla dealerships they want to destroy Elon and intimidate Tesla owners to eliminate votes for Trump and his supporters.would not allow such behavior due to the reflection on the company. But look at Office Depot refusing to print Charlie. Kirk posters with employee stating it was propaganda. Office Depot fired her fat a$$. Jimmy Kindal program eliminated due to advertisers pulling their ads most likely due to Kimmel lies and extreme rants against the Right. It appears your first insurance agent was honest and got fired. Look up on your county’s voter regression which political party they support. I’d also do research if there is information on State Farm and the other insurance company if they voice political comments against Elon or Trump. The insurance companies are counting on you, an individual not to do anything while gleefully ripping you off. Most likely you are not the only one. But you have access to other Tesla owners who have experienced similar situations. Very clear to me you need an attorney firm who can do research of this is politically motivated and has a track record exposing large companies wrong doings. If other Tesla owners have experienced this it could maybe turn into a class action suit.
I’m not an attorney and do not have a law degree. However have worked with many attorneys in mortgage lending and as a professional liability claims investigator/ errors and omissions insurance policies insuring professionals against wrong doings. Closed banks and successful working with attorneys for a $5 million settlement against attorney firm whose actions contributed to bank failure. So grow a backbone if you don’t have one and not be a victim. You could possibly change your current situation plus insure other Tesla owners who do not expierence what you have. It may be possible some do not realize they are being ripped off and are passive. My last words tho you….Go Sicum!
