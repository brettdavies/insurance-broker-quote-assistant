Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-progressive/)
[Root](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-reviews-coverage-options-and-ratings/) was among the early adopters of [telematics technology](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/), which helps to assign insurance rates based on driving habits instead of traditional rating factors. In fact, the company aims to discontinue using credit scores — a practice it calls "discriminatory" — by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive limited mileage.

* Below-average scores for overall customer satisfaction

Drivers who commute regularly and value a number of coverage options and discounts may find that Progressive checks those boxes. Root's pricing strategy could be a better option for people who don't drive often. Progressive is only a little more expensive but is rated more positively than Root.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-progressive/)
Root partners with Homesite to allow existing auto insurance customers to bundle homeowners insurance. Root home insurance is not available as a standalone insurance policy — a customer must be enrolled in Root's car insurance program to be eligible and could receive a 10% discount by bundling.
Though the company is seen as financially stable, it receives more customer complaints than average. Customers looking for top-notch customer satisfaction may do well to look into a policy with a more established insurance provider. In addition, Root homeowners insurance quotes can only be found via the company's mobile app, not its website.

####  [ How many cars can I have on my progressive policy? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/many-cars-can-progressive-policy/ "How many cars can I have on my progressive policy?")
Hey there, thanks for reaching out! Most insurance companies — including Progressive — will allow a max of four cars per policy. Of course, it's always a good idea to check with your insurance company directly if you are unsure about whether or not all your vehicles will be covered.If you have…

You are right — having a lapse in coverage will cause your rates to be higher in the future. I recommend getting a non-owners policy, which it sounds like Progressive is already offering to you. This is essentially a liability-only policy when you do not own a vehicle, or are between vehicle owners…
