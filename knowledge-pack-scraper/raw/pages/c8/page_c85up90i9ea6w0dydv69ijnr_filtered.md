A Cybertruck owner reports that State Farm insurance is doubling his rate out of the blue. He adds that initially, he was quoted $400/month; however, the insurance agent who gave him this rate was let go, and now State Farm is asking for $800/month.

Jake Skipper, a Cybertruck owner from Texas, says that State Farm is doubling his insurance rate.

Jake mentions that at first, he was quoted $400 a month; however, later on, a different insurance agent reached out and raised the price to $800 a month.

Additionally, the new insurance agent said that the previous employee who quoted him $400 a month was fired for underquoting him.

The new agent also told Jake that he spent an hour on the phone with the underwriting department, but the best price he could get was $800/month.

This is definitely a very high premium, and the frustrated Cybertruck owner shared his story on the [Cybertruck Owners Only](https://web.facebook.com/share/p/16z52GD3X5/) group on Facebook.

He wrote:

*“What’s the best insurance for the Cybertruck?*

*State Farm quoted me $400, and now they’re pulling the rug and saying $800.*

*Our agent got "fired" and "underquoted us," and they are giving us the old excuse that "they have been on the phone with underwriting for an hour, because it's their job."*

*Is anyone else getting this treatment?”*

This is definitely not ideal, and looking at the comments, the first thing fellow Cybertruck owners wanted clarification on was whether the $800 price tag is per month or every six months.

A fellow Cybertruck owner, Michael Adkins, asks:

*“$800 for 6 months or a month?”*

In response, Jake confirms it’s the monthly rate, simply replying, “per month!”

To put this in perspective, the $800 monthly rate is even higher than the cost to lease a Cybertruck, which is around $699/month.

Granted, Jake’s Cybertruck is the more expensive performance tri-motor version, while the $699/month lease applies to the cheaper dual motor model.

Still, paying $9,600 a year to insure a $100,000 vehicle is a significant expense.

Regrettably, looking at the comments, multiple Cybertruck owners have shared that they are also having trouble insuring their trucks.

One unexpected side effect of these soaring premiums is that some Cybertruck owners are rethinking not just insurance but the way they use their trucks altogether. [When Tesla wouldn’t sell one owner a range extender, he went as far as building his own solution, giving him nearly 100 miles of extra driving capacity](https://www.torquenews.com/1/tesla-wouldnt-sell-me-range-extender-cybertruck-so-i-built-my-own-giving-me-just-short-100-miles). That unusual story shows how far some people are willing to go when traditional options, whether in coverage or hardware, suddenly become too limited, and it highlights the broader struggles Cybertruck owners face in balancing cost, practicality, and innovation.

A fellow owner, Darrell Daughtry, writes:

*“GEICO dropped my Cybertruck coverage, and now I'm paying $600 with Progressive Insurance.”*

Another Cybertruck owner, Rickey Benns, shares:

*“State Farm was the only place that would give me Cybertruck insurance.”*

A third owner, Ann McVey, says:

*“We switched from Progressive to Tesla because Progressive could not / would not say if FSD would be covered if the car was totaled!”*

A fourth owner, David Patrick Christman, adds:

*“We have Progressive. Tesla insurance wasn’t available in Pennsylvania, and everyone else either didn’t cover the Cybertruck or wanted a huge amount a month to insure it.”*

A lot of Cybertruck owners are clearly having trouble obtaining insurance coverage; however, those using Tesla insurance report paying less than $200 per month.

Lance Wade, another Cybertruck owner, says:

*“I pay $200/month in California for the tri-motor Cybertruck with Tesla insurance. But I’m 40 and have a clean driving record.”*

Nick Movs also shares:

*“I pay $125 with Tesla insurance.”*

Overall, owners who cannot get Tesla insurance in their state seem to face more challenges, while those with Tesla Insurance usually pay less than $200 a month to insure their Cybertrucks.
