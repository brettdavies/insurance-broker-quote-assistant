## Coverage Options for Natural Disasters in Illinois
#### Tornadoes
Tornadoes are consistently one of the most common natural disasters in Illinois, averaging about 50 per year, according to the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/ilx/SvrPrepWeek-Tuesday). Fortunately, a standard homeowners insurance policy typically covers damage caused by [tornadoes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/windstorm-insurance).
#### Flooding
Flooding is one of the most common natural disasters in the U.S., but it's not typically covered under a standard homeowners insurance policy. If you live in a [flood-prone area](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home), consider purchasing flood insurance through a private insurer or the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.floodsmart.gov/) (NFIP).
#### Earthquakes
Most earthquakes occur in the southernmost part of Illinois, near the [New Madrid Seismic Zone](https://iemaohs.illinois.gov/preparedness/earthquake-newmadrid.html). However, standard homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover damages caused by earthquakes. You can purchase [earthquake coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-earthquake-insurance) as an endorsement or a separate policy; however, contact your insurer for more information.
## Illinois Department of Insurance
The [Illinois Department of Insurance](https://idoi.illinois.gov/) protects consumers by regulating the state's insurance market. Consumers can file complaints, read educational content, and review laws and regulations through the department's website. You can contact them at 866-445-5364.
## FAQ
Homeowners insurance isn't mandated by state law in Illinois. However, your mortgage lender will likely require you to purchase a policy. Although not [required](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/is-homeowners-insurance-required), homeowners insurance is a wise investment to protect your assets.
A standard homeowners insurance policy in Illinois typically protects your home against specific perils, such as wind, lightning, hail, and theft. It [provides coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover) for your dwelling, personal property, other structures, liability, guest medical payments, and loss of use.
Between 2021 and 2024, Illinois saw the second-highest percentage increase in home insurance premiums of all U.S. states, as rates rose by 50% on average over that period, according to a [2025 report](https://consumerfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OverburdenedReport.pdf) by the Consumer Federation of America. One problem is that Illinois is the only state where insurance companies do not need approval from the state government to raise rates, so premium hikes are not regulated.
Furthermore, the growing threat of natural disasters such as hailstorms and windstorms is having a serious effect on the cost of home insurance in Illinois. For example, in 2024, [State Farm](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/understanding-the-issues-in-illinois/) saw more hail damage claims from Illinois than any other state except Texas, amounting to $638 million in damages. Additionally, because of market factors like inflation, the cost of building materials and labor is on the rise, making homes more expensive to rebuild. For State Farm and other providers, the cost of covering claims in Illinois is exceeding the revenue from premiums.
The [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/how-to-save-money-on-your-homeowners-insurance) suggests increasing your deductible, [bundling your home and auto policies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles), and preparing your home for natural disasters by reinforcing your roof, which can help you save money on your homeowners insurance in Illinois.

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Local Homeowners Insurance
To build our ratings, we researched 16 homeowners insurance companies and insurance agencies and analyzed data from a consumer survey with 1,125 responses, product features collected from company websites, and data on insurance costs provided by Quadrant Information Services. U.S. News worked with Quadrant to analyze a report of publicly available insurance rates using 34,595 ZIP codes across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the companies in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies that operate in that state. The insurance rates in our study are based on averages of sample rates for a 38-year-old and 56-year-old married applicant household with a 720 FICO credit score. The rates were obtained for an HO3 policy covering a wood-frame house with 10% Other Structures Coverage, 20% Loss of Use Coverage, 50% Personal Property Coverage, and a guest medical limit of $5,000.
