## What Does Renters Insurance Cover?

Renters insurance provides a range of essential coverages to protect tenants from various risks. Here’s a breakdown of the typical coverages:

### Personal Property Coverage

This coverage protects your belongings, such as furniture, electronics, and clothing, against perils like theft, fire, and water damage. It ensures you can replace or repair your items if they are damaged or stolen.

### Liability Coverage

Liability coverage protects you if someone is injured while in your rental property. It covers legal expenses and medical bills if you are found responsible for the injury, providing crucial financial protection.

### Additional Living Expenses (ALE) Coverage

ALE coverage helps pay for temporary living expenses if your rental becomes uninhabitable due to a covered peril. This can include hotel bills, restaurant meals, and other costs incurred while your home is being repaired.

### Medical Payments Coverage

This coverage pays for medical expenses if a guest is injured on your property, regardless of fault. It provides a straightforward way to cover minor injuries without involving a liability claim.
