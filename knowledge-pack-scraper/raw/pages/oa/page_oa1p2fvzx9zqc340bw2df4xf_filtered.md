## What Is Commercial Health Insurance?

Commercial health insurance refers to health plans offered by private companies rather than the government, making up the primary source of health coverage for over 68% of Americans as of 2022. These policies are predominantly offered through employer-sponsored group plans, providing a cost-effective solution for many. This article will explore the types, examples, and regulations of commercial health insurance.1

### Key Takeaways

* Commercial health insurance is offered by private companies, differentiating it from government-sponsored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
* The two most common types of commercial health insurance are preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs), each with different coverage networks and cost structures.
* Employers often purchase group coverage for employees, making it a cost-effective method for individuals to secure health insurance with reduced premiums.
* State insurance commissions regulate commercial insurance plans, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and consumer protection standards.
* Commercial health insurance policies can be obtained individually through insurance agents, companies, or the Health Insurance Marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.

## How Commercial Health Insurance Works

Commercial health insurance policies are primarily sold by for-profit insurance carriers. While policies can vary widely in the amount and types of coverage they provide, they fall into two basic categories.

The largest segment of the commercial health insurance market consists of group coverage, often purchased by employers for their employees or associations for their members.1 Because employers typically cover at least a portion of the premiums, this is usually a cost-effective way for employees to obtain health coverage. Employers get attractive rates because they negotiate with insurers and offer many young, healthy policyholders.

A smaller segment involves direct-purchase policies, bought by consumers as individuals. Direct purchase policies can be obtained through agents, from insurance companies, or through the [Health Insurance Marketplace](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/health-insurance-marketplace.asp) established by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.1

The term "commercial" distinguishes these types of policies from insurance that's provided through a public or government program, such as [Medicaid, Medicare](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/medicare-vs-medicaid.asp), or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Government-administered health insurance is mainly funded by taxes, but participants also pay [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/health-insurance-premium-4773146) and [copays](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copay.asp). It is typically reserved for particular groups, such as older Americans (Medicare), low-income patients (Medicaid), and ex-military personnel (Veterans Health Administration programs). Other examples of government-sponsored insurance include the Indian Health Service (IHS), the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and TRICARE.2

### $24 Billion

The net income of the U.S. health insurance industry as of mid-2023, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This is a increase of 6% over the previous year.3

## Exploring Different Types of Commercial Health Insurance Plans

Many commercial health insurance plans today are structured as either a [preferred provider organization (PPO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferred-provider-organization.asp) or [health maintenance organization (HMO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hmo.asp), the two most common types of managed care plans. The main difference between these two types of plans is that an HMO generally requires patients to use providers and facilities within the carrier's network if they want insurance to cover the costs (except in an emergency), while a PPO lets patients go outside the network (though their out-of-pocket costs might be greater).4

HMOs often require a primary care doctor to coordinate all care from specialists and other providers. Referrals from the primary doctor are often necessary to see a specialist.5

[Insurers](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-health-insurance-companies-8762191) offer both PPO and HMO plans, with various costs and coverage levels for each.

They may also offer other types of coverage, such as [point-of-service (POS) plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pointofservice-plan-pos.asp) and exclusive provider organizations (EPOs). Point-of-service plans vary their reimbursement levels depending on where the patient obtains services, paying more within a certain network and less outside of it. In exclusive provider organizations, patients must use specific practitioners and hospitals for insurer reimbursement, except in emergencies.6

Finally, though increasingly rare, are traditional fee-for-service health insurance plans, which provide the same level of reimbursement regardless of where the patient obtains services.

Regardless of the type of plan, the federal government and state insurance regulators have rules on [what the plans are required to offer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uniform-policy-provisions-health-insurance.asp) and how the companies that sell and administer them must operate. These laws also establish mandates for how and when insurers must pay invoices and reimburse providers and patients, as well as the amount of funds the insurer must keep in reserve to have sufficient capital to pay out benefits.

## What Is the Difference Between Commercial and Private Health Insurance?

Technically, there is no difference: commercial health insurance is provided by private issuers—as opposed to government-sponsored health insurance, which is provided by federal agencies. Commercial insurance may be sponsored by an employer or privately purchased by an individual. Most private insurance providers are for-profit companies, but they can be nonprofit organizations in some cases.2

## Is Obamacare Commercial Insurance?

Obamacare (more formally known as the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp)) is a federal law that made it possible for individuals to obtain health insurance coverage through state health exchanges or [marketplaces](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/health-insurance-marketplace.asp). These plans are offered and run by private companies, so technically they are commercial insurance—though they do have to follow some federally mandated guidelines.

## What Are Examples of Commercial Health Insurance?

Common types of commercial health insurance include HMOs, PPOs, and POS (point-of-service) plans. [Medicare Advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare-advantage.asp), [Medigap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medigap-insurance.asp), and other Medicare supplemental plans count as commercial health insurance, too. The term can also broaden from general health insurance to include dental plans and vision plans.7

## What Is a High Deductible Health Care Plan?

[High deductible health plans (HDHPs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hdhp.asp) require patients to pay greater out-of-pocket costs, through higher deductibles, but generally have lower premiums than other types of plans. The law allows people with one of these plans to put money in a tax-deductible [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) to cover some of those added costs.

## The Bottom Line

Commercial health insurance, primarily provided by private companies, covers more than 68% of the U.S. population, distinguishing itself from government programs like Medicaid and Medicare. The market's most common plans are PPOs and HMOs, each offering unique benefits. Group coverage, often provided by employers, stands as the most prevalent form of commercial insurance, benefiting from competitive rates due to large group negotiations. Private insurance plans operate under state regulations, ensuring consumer protection, while federal laws mandate specific requirements. When selecting a plan, consider cost, coverage, and provider network access to make an informed decision.
