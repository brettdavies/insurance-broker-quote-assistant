##  What Is Commercial Health Insurance?
##  How Commercial Health Insurance Works
##  Exploring Different Types of Commercial Health Insurance Plans
Technically, there is no difference: commercial health insurance is provided by private issuers—as opposed to government-sponsored health insurance, which is provided by federal agencies. Commercial insurance may be sponsored by an employer or privately purchased by an individual. Most private insurance providers are for-profit companies, but they can be nonprofit organizations in some cases.2
Common types of commercial health insurance include HMOs, PPOs, and POS (point-of-service) plans. [Medicare Advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare-advantage.asp), [Medigap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medigap-insurance.asp), and other Medicare supplemental plans count as commercial health insurance, too. The term can also broaden from general health insurance to include dental plans and vision plans.7
