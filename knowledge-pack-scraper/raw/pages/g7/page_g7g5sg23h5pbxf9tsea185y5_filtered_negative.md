In June 2021, we published [**a blog**](https://www.radarfirst.com/blog/privacy-regulatory-trends-guide-to-naic-insurance-data-security-model-law/)**[about the rapid rate of adoption of NAIC Model Laws](https://www.radarfirst.com/blog/privacy-regulatory-trends-guide-to-naic-insurance-data-security-model-law/).** Flash forward just one year and the number of states that have passed data laws based on the NAIC model has more than doubled (rising from 10 states to 21).
Because of its rapid adoption and influence on the privacy landscape, our team of experts put together a comprehensive [**(and _free_**](https://www.radarfirst.com/resources/understanding-the-naic-insurance-data-security-model-law/)**[) guide](https://www.radarfirst.com/resources/understanding-the-naic-insurance-data-security-model-law/) **to help businesses navigate the law’s complexities – such as provisions, state-by-state adoptions, and notification requirements.

State governments, _not federal agencies_, have preeminence over the insurance industry (as defined by the [**McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945**](https://content.naic.org/cipr-topics/mccarran-ferguson-act)). It’s up to each state to pass and enforce laws governing insurance companies. Every state has its own chief insurance commissioner who sits over a commission to manage this function.
To create a consistent set of standards for state-by-state regulation of the industry, the 50 state insurance commissioners, along with one from the District of Columbia and five from U.S. territories, joined together to form the**[National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/)** (NAIC).
When we write about the NAIC Model Law, we refer specifically to the**[Insurance Data Security Model Law (MDL 668)](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/MDL-668.pdf)**.
The NAIC saw a need for this law as a response to the growing number of large insurers experiencing data breaches. Providing a mechanism for state governing bodies to address consumer needs and concerns was a way to forestall federal intervention in the industry in response to those breaches. The law was passed by congress in October 2017.
21 states have passed NAIC Model Laws as of**May 31, 2022**. The following map depicts which states.
