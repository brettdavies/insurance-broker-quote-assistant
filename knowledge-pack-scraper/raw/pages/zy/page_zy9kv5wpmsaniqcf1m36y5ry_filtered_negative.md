**[Essential coverage #essential ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loggerhead-insurance-review#essential "#essential")** includes the [standard home insurance coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?") you would find at a major insurance company. Essential coverage from Loggerhead comes with:
* **[Dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?")**, which pays for damage to the structure of your home.
* **[Personal property coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?")**, which pays to replace your belongings if a covered event, like a fire, damages them.
This coverage is based on the current condition of your things, including wear and tear. This is also called [actual cash value](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance"). That means you won't get enough money to replace your stuff with new things.
* **[Personal liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?")**, which protects you if you hurt someone or damage their property by accident.
* **[Other structures coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-homeowners-cover-other-structures "What Is Other Structures Coverage for Home Insurance?")**, which pays for damage to structures on your property, like a detached garage, shed or fence.
* **[Loss of use coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loss-of-use-homeowners-insurance "What Is Loss of Use Coverage for Homeowners and Renters?")**, which pays for many of the costs of living away from home if your house is damaged and unsafe. This can include a hotel or rental home, moving expenses and the cost of meals if your rental doesn't have a kitchen.
* * *
* [Replacement cost coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance") pays to replace damaged things with new items.
* * *
* **[Full roof replacement cost](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance")** will pay the total cost to replace your roof  (minus your deductible) after an event your insurance covers, like a fire.
* **[Pool](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-pool-affects-your-homeowners-insurance "How a Pool Affects Your Homeowners Insurance") and [trampoline](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage-trampolines-treehouses "Does Home Insurance Cover Trampolines and Treehouses?") liability coverage** helps cover medical expenses or the cost of a lawsuit if a guest is hurt while using your pool or trampoline.
* **[Identity theft coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-cyber-home-insurance "What Is Personal Cyber Insurance? And How Can Homeowners Buy a Policy?")** pays to help restore your identity if it's stolen. This can include reimbursing you for credit card fraud, expert help and more.
Loggerhead Insurance only started selling home insurance in 2022, so it doesn't have a lot of customer reviews to help you decide if it's a good insurance company. However, it gets 63% fewer complaints than average, according to the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This means homeowners should find it easy to file and settle their claims.
You should look for companies with an A+ financial strength rating from AM Best and positive customer service reviews, like [American Modern](https://www.valuepenguin.com/american-modern-insurance-review "American Modern Insurance Review for Nonstandard Homes") and [Nationwide](https://www.valuepenguin.com/nationwide-insurance-review "Nationwide Insurance Review").
[Loggerhead should be able to pay out claims #reviews ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loggerhead-insurance-review#reviews "#reviews") even if Florida has a major weather event, according to Demotech, which rates insurance companies based on their financial stability.
