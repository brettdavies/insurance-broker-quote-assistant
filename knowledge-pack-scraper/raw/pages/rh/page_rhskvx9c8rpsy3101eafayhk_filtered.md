Every car insurance company will handle driving offenses differently, so don't be afraid to shop around and [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) to find out which insurance company suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: AAA VS. STATE FARM

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### State Farm vs. AAA: rates by age

Insurance companies use age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is typically most expensive for teen drivers — thanks to their inexperience — and more affordable for drivers aged 25 or older. Because every insurance company rates ages in a different way, it's smart to shop around and find the perfect policy for you.

In general, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose State Farm over AAA: State Farm offers average yearly savings of $4,436, compared to AAA.

##### RATES BY AGE: AAA VS. STATE FARM

| **Age bracket** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **AAA avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $5,820 | $10,256 |
| **20s** | $2,379 | $4,644 |
| **30s** | $1,585 | $4,644 |
| **40s** | $1,587 | $3,195 |
| **50s** | $1,558 | $3,083 |
| **60s** | $1,485 | $2,887 |

Affordability aside, State Farm and AAA each carry pros and cons, including their discount programs, add-ons, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and compare rates before purchasing a policy.

Due to AAA's partnerships with other car insurance companies to provide policies, some of these discount options may not be available in some locations. Always ask about what discounts you are eligible for when shopping for your policy.

## Telematics options: State Farm vs. AAA

State Farm and AAA both offer [telematics programs](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) that can help to measure your driving habits and calculate the level of risk you pose. Take a look at our rundown of available options from both carriers below.

![State farm telematics]()

State Farm Drive Safe & Save

State Farm Drive Safe & Save is a good option for safe and [low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/). The company claims that it can save customers up to 50% on premiums, though these types of savings are most likely to be seen by lower-mileage drivers. The program is available in most states.

![AAA logo]()

AAA OnBoard

Depending on the state in which they reside, some customers may be able to sign up for OnBoard, AAA's telematics option. The company boasts savings of 15% at sign-up, with total savings of up to 30% possible for eligible drivers. However, there is no separate app at the time of writing, meaning that all participants must download the AAA mobile app.

### Zebra Tip: Explore State Farm for telematics offerings

---

While AAA's telematics app offers a good percentage of possible savings, it is not available to everyone. State Farm's app is more widely available and best for low-mileage drivers.

## Roadside assistance: State Farm vs. AAA

No one wants to be stuck on the side of the road. If you ever find yourself in that situation, you'll want a [roadside assistance program](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) that can get you back on the road quickly. Take a look at each company's roadside assistance options below.

State Farm's Emergency Road Service offers the following:

* Mechanical labor at the place of breakdown
* Towing of your vehicle to a repair facility,
* Removal of a stuck vehicle
* Delivery of gas or oil
* Assistance with changing a tire or a jumpstart
* Locksmith services

##### AAA

Perhaps no other company is more closely associated with [roadside assistance than AAA](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-vs-aaa/). For that reason, it's no surprise that the company has an expansive selection of options available to both members and policyholders. Below is a list of options available:

* Jumpstarts
* Towing
* Fuel delivery
* Vehicle lockout
* flat tire service
* Stuck vehicle services

AAA offers different levels of membership that apply to roadside assistance. Those in higher tiers are often reimbursed for larger amounts or eligible for towing for longer distances. The highest tier even offers trip interruption coverage.

State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a great option for customers looking for flexible or with unique coverage needs. However, State Farm's average rates tend to be higher than average. Also, the company suffers from a lack of available homeowners discounts — only four discount options at present. State Farm's home insurance options enjoy good ratings from third-party agencies, and the company ranked fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Still, homeowners looking for basic insurance with no bells or whistles may wish to look for an alternative.
