INCREASE YOUR DEDUCTIBLE TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUM

Your deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your renters insurance policy kicks in to cover a claim. Increasing your deductible can lower your monthly premiums because it reduces the risk for the insurance company, as they will pay less if you file a claim.

### How Does Personal Property Coverage Impact Affordability?

Personal property coverage is a key component of renters insurance that protects your belongings in case of theft, fire or other covered events. The higher your personal property coverage, the more expensive your renters insurance. Opting for lower coverage results in more [affordable renters insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/cheap-renters-insurance-coverage/).

State Farm's $100K personal property coverage costs about $220 annually, while its $50K personal property coverage costs $149 annually. Less coverage can save you money, but determine [how much renters insurance coverage you need](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/how-much-renters-insurance-do-you-need/) to ensure you have adequate protection without overpaying.

### Is State Farm Renters Insurance Affordable in Your State?

State Farm's renters insurance premiums vary from state to state due to factors like the type of structure you live in, its proximity to a local fire station, crime rates, natural disasters and local regulations. The average premium for $20K personal property coverage is $66 in Colorado but $590 in California for the same coverage.

## What State Farm Renters Insurance Covers

Renters insurance includes three standard coverages: personal property, personal liability and loss of use. Most providers, including State Farm, include these coverages by default, so you can't purchase them individually or remove them from your policy. You can set your desired limit for each coverage, though loss of use may be a percentage of your personal property coverage. Here's each standard renters insurance coverage:

| Coverage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Personal Property Coverage** | This coverage pays to repair or replace your belongings if they’re damaged by a covered peril such as fire, theft or vandalism. For example, if your laptop is stolen, it helps cover the replacement cost. |
| **Personal Liability Coverage** | Covers legal costs if someone gets injured in your rental or if you damage someone else’s property. [Personal liability coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/) also includes medical bills, legal fees and settlements. For instance, if a guest slips and falls in your home, this option helps pay for their medical expenses. |
| **Loss Of Use Coverage** | Covers living expenses if your rental becomes uninhabitable after a covered peril. [Loss of use coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/renters/) helps pay for hotel stays, meals or temporary housing while repairs are made. If a fire damages your apartment, this one can cover your living costs until you can return home. |

### What State Farm Renters Insurance Doesn't Cover

State Farm’s renters insurance doesn't cover flood or earthquake damage, which is standard across most property insurance providers. Renters insurance only applies to sudden or accidental damage from specific perils.

It excludes intentional damage and normal wear and tear. Some of the main exclusions:

* **Flood damage**: Not included in standard renters insurance. You’ll need a separate flood policy for this.
* **Earthquake damage**: Also not part of standard coverage and requires an added endorsement.
* **Intentional damage**: Any damage caused on purpose by the policyholder isn’t covered.
* **Wear and tear**: Normal use and gradual deterioration of personal property are excluded.
* **Pest infestations**: Damage from rodents, insects or other pests usually isn’t covered.
