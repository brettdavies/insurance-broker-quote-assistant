They pay you the depreciated value for the item. If you replace it they will pay you the replacement value. If you decide not to replace you only get the depreciated value

Depreciated value up front, then if you repair or replace, they'll pay the remaining amount (with documentation)

Read it carefully and thoroughly just like you were studying for a test in school. Then come back if you still have questions.
The following is quoted from my own State Farm policy.
COVERAGE B – PERSONAL PROPERTY
1. B1 – Limited Replacement Cost Loss Settlement.
a. We will pay the cost to repair or replace property covered under SECTION I – PROPERTY COVERAGES, COVERAGE B – PERSONAL PROPERTY, except for property listed in item b. below, subject to the following:
(1) until repair or replacement is completed, we will pay only the actual cash value of the damaged property;
(2) after repair or replacement is completed, we will pay the difference between the actual cash value and the cost you have actually and necessarily spent to repair or replace the property; and
(3) if property is not repaired or replaced within two years after the date of loss, we will pay only the actual cash value.
b. We will pay market value at the time of loss for:
(1) antiques, fine arts, paintings, statuary, and similar articles which by their inherent nature cannot be replaced with new articles;
(2) articles whose age or history contribute substantially to their value including, but not limited to, memorabilia, souvenirs, and collectors items; and
(3) property not useful for its intended purpose. However, we will not pay an amount exceeding the smallest of the following for items a. and b. above:
(1) our cost to replace at the time of loss; (
2) the full cost of repair; (
3) any special limit of liability described in this policy; or
(4) any applicable Coverage B limit of liability.

One thing not explicitly mentioned in SFs policy language is the definition of what it means to replace an item, and what qualities an item has. No mention of like kind and quality that I can see.
In the example of, say, some vintage piece of electronics-- if it was unsalvageable (another term that's loose), would they, if it were replaced, under their LRCV terms, cover the purchase of the item without conditions? They use, yet never define reasonably and necessarily, and with vague language benefiting the insured, it seems foolish of them.
