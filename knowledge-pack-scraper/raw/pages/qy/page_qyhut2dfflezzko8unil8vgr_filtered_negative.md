Some homeowners insurance discounts are applied when you first [buy your policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-buy-homeowners-insurance "How to Buy Homeowners Insurance"). For example, if your house is relatively new, it may be less in need of certain repairs—such as a new roof—compared to older homes. Insurance companies consider that reduced risk when determining your rates, so you may receive some policy discounts.
Most insurance companies offer a discount to policyholders who bundle their [home and auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle") policies.

For example, AIG offers discounts to policyholders who bundle [floater policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-endorsements-scheduling "Homeowners Insurance Endorsements And Floaters") for private property—such as pieces of art— with their home insurance policies. Homeowners who bundle AIG policies are eligible for a discount of up to 12%, if their annual property-specific premium exceeds $12,000.
Some home insurance companies, including [Travelers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travelers-insurance-review "Travelers insurance review"), will offer you a small discount of around 5% on your rates if your home has a residential LEED certification.

One of the easiest ways you can lower your monthly homeowners insurance premiums is by [choosing a higher deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "Homeowners Insurance Deductibles"). **Your deductible is the amount of money you're required to pay for a repair before your insurance policy kicks in.** If your home is in good condition and unlikely to face risks in the coming year, this strategy might be right for you.
Finally, one of the most effective ways to save on your premium is by shopping around and comparing quotes from [the best insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-homeowners-insurance-companies "Best Homeowners Insurance Companies") in your area. Insurance is a competitive industry, and insurers often offer discounts to policyholders looking for a new insurance company.
