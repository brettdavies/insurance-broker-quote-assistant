Auto insurance is relatively expensive in California at $1,899 per year on average for full coverage and $669 per year for minimum coverage. However, the full coverage rate still comes in below the national average of $2,399. Meanwhile, the statewide average for minimum coverage is just over the national average of $635.
California is an interesting state when it comes to car insurance. For example, accident forgiveness is unavailable due to a law prohibiting excessive insurance rates. This helps mitigate against even higher average rates but also means that there is no way for drivers to prevent a rate increase following an accident. The state also doesn’t allow rate determination based on credit, so drivers with poor credit will not see any impact on their insurance premiums.
## Overview
* The average cost of full coverage [auto insurance in California](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/) is $1,899 per year, while minimum coverage is $669 per year.
* [GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) and [USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/) offer the cheapest auto insurance in most categories, but USAA is only available to the military community.

## How to Find the Cheapest Car Insurance Rates in California
1. **Bundle policies:** If you need an insurance policy in addition to auto, such as home or renters, purchasing both policies from the same company will usually get you a significant discount and also simplifies your policy management.
2. **Modify your policy:** If your goal is to get the lowest premium, you can do so by increasing your collision and comprehensive deductibles and/or lowering your coverage limits. However, this leaves you at risk of higher out-of-pocket expenses if you get into an accident or damage your vehicle, so make sure the trade-off is worth it to you.
3. **Maintain a clean driving record:** One of the best ways to keep your insurance costs as low as possible is to maintain a clean record and avoid violations. Rates can increase significantly as a result of speeding tickets, accidents and DUIs and they stay on your record for several years.
4. **Consider California’s low-cost program:** The California Low-Cost Automobile Insurance Program is designed to help low-income drivers afford liability insurance. You may be eligible if you need the income thresholds and your vehicle’s value is under $25,000.

## Minimum Car Insurance Requirements in California
California law requires drivers to carry a minimum level of car insurance, including bodily injury and property damage liability. These coverages help cover injuries and damages caused to others in an accident. California increased its minimum limits as of January 1, 2025, and they are now as follows:
* Bodily injury liability: $30,000 per person/$60,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $15,000 per accident
You cannot legally drive without at least these coverage limits, but it’s often wise to get higher limits for added peace of mind. Drivers with newer cars should also opt for [full coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/full/), which includes comprehensive and collision. This may also be required by your lender if you finance or lease your vehicle.
