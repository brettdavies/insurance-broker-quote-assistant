# How does a natural disaster insurance claim work?

Your homeowners insurance may cover damage to your home and belongings due to a covered peril, including damage from fire, wind, hail, and lightning. Damages to your home from an earthquake or from flooding typically wouldn’t be covered by a traditional homeowner's policy. Instead, you'd need to purchase separate earthquake and flood policies, if available, on top of your homeowners policy.

## Natural disasters and insurance

Not all natural disasters are covered by a traditional homeowners policy. To find out if the damage on your home and/or surrounding structures is covered, you'll first need to determine what caused the damage in the first place. Was it high winds? Was it a lightning strike? If so, you may be covered up to your policy's limits. But if the damage is caused by flooding water from a storm surge or from an earthquake, chances are your homeowners policy lists those perils as exclusions and won’t provide coverage.

Learn more about what constitutes a [covered peril](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/).

### Does insurance cover natural disasters?

| Type of natural disaster | Will insurance cover it? |
| --- | --- |
| [Flood](https://www.progressive.com/answers/flood-101/) | Will insurance cover it?Likely no. Many insurers list flood as an exclusion, but an additional flood policy may help extend coverage to flooding events. |
| [Earthquake](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-earthquakes/) | Will insurance cover it?Probably not. Just like flood, in some states, you may be able purchase an earthquake policy to cover earthquake damage. |
| [Tornado](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-tornado-damage/) | Will insurance cover it?It's possible if the damage is due to high winds, hail, and/or lightning. |
| [Hurricane](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-hurricanes/) | Will insurance cover it?Your policy may cover damage from high winds during a hurricane, but typically won’t cover flooding from a hurricane. In some areas prone to hurricanes, you may have a separate hurricane deductible, also known as a "named storm" deductible. |
| [Wildfire](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-wildfires/) | Will insurance cover it?Depends on your location. |

## What to do after a natural disaster

Follow these steps if you've just experienced a natural disaster:

1. **Assess the situation**: First make sure everyone is safe and sound, then take a look to see what damage has been done.
2. **File a claim**: Take photos and video recordings as soon as possible, then call your agent or file a claim online.
3. **Get an estimate**: [Your insurance adjuster](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-an-insurance-adjuster/) might be able to give you an estimate right away, giving you a clear idea of where you stand and how to move forward.
4. **Find out how your insurance coverage applies**: Damage to your home and belongings may be covered by your homeowners policy, depending on the type of peril that caused the damage. Your insurance adjuster may ask you for a [home inventory](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-create-a-home-inventory/) to help determine the amount of personal property lost.
5. **Put things back together**: This phase could take a few hours or may take up to a year, depending on how bad the damage is. You may need to find housing while things get repaired, possibly making use of your [loss of use coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/loss-of-use-insurance/). which may pay for you to live elsewhere due to damage from a covered loss.
6. **Plan for next time**: Now that you know what can happen when a natural disaster strikes, it's best to plan in case it happens again.

Pro tip:

Just because the storm is over doesn't mean the damage is done. FEMA's "[Recovering After Disaster](https://www.fema.gov/pdf/areyouready/recovering_from_disaster.pdf)" guide includes health and safety guidelines, tips for returning home and rebuilding communities, as well as how you and your family can cope during recovery.
