## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Delaware's state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, gets stolen, or is otherwise damaged due to a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you can afford a new car or major repairs after an accident.
