HOW VEHICLE CHOICE IMPACTS TEENS CAR INSURANCE RATES

Teenagers are often considered high-risk drivers, so choosing a car that's cheaper to insure can substantially lower premiums. [Vehicles rated high for safety](https://www.iihs.org/ratings) help reduce costs, while expensive, fast cars may increase them.

## Cheap Car Insurance for Teens: Buying Guide

Your teen's insurance costs depend on coverage type, vehicle choice, driving record and available discounts. If your teen drives an older vehicle, consider [liability-only coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/) instead of full coverage to reduce premiums significantly.

We analyzed teen insurance rates to identify the most effective cost-reduction strategies while maintaining adequate financial protection.

### How to Get Cheap Car Insurance for Teens

You can slash your teen's insurance costs through smart policy decisions and discount maximization. [Adding your teen to your family car insurance policy](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/adding-your-child-to-your-car-insurance/) costs $3,048 annually on average, saving you $1,818 compared to an individual teen policy.

Follow the strategies below to reduce premiums while preserving the financial protection your family needs.

1. 1

   Limit their driving distances

   Some companies offer discounts for drivers who travel fewer than 7,500 miles annually. Restricting teens to daylight driving also reduces accident risk and keeps costs down.
2. 2

   Keep the car title in your name

   Putting your teen's name on the title may force them to get individual insurance, which costs more. Teens under 18 can't legally purchase car insurance without a parent or guardian co-signing the policy.
3. 3

   Enroll in driver's education

   Many companies offer discounts for teens who complete certified driver's education programs. Usage-based telematics can also provide savings if your teen drives safely.
4. 4

   Choose an inexpensive car

   Some companies automatically assign the highest-cost driver (usually the teen) to the most expensive vehicle. Specify which car should be assigned to your teen to avoid unnecessary costs.
5. 5

   Opt for a family car insurance policy

   Family policies offer multi-car and multi-driver discounts that can reduce overall premiums by up to 20%. With one renewal date and payment, you'll also simplify management.

### Car Insurance Discounts for Teens

Teens can reduce insurance costs with multiple discounts. Whether your teen has an individual policy or joins the family plan, these discounts help manage the costs of insuring young drivers while encouraging safe and responsible driving.

In addition to discounts, opting for [no-down-payment car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/no-down-payment-car-insurance/) can provide [affordable](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) coverage with a low upfront cost. To activate the policy, you must pay at least the first month’s premium.

| Discount | How It Works |
| --- | --- |
| Good student | Offers savings to students who maintain a certain GPA or rank in the top percentage of their class |
| Defensive driving | Rewards drivers who complete a certified defensive driving course |
| Safe driver | Reduces rates for drivers with no at-fault accidents or traffic violations for a certain period |
| Distant driver | Discounts for students who attend school far from home (usually at least 100 miles away) and don't drive the insured vehicle often |
| Telematics-based programs | Rates based on driving behavior monitored by a device or app (such as Allstate's teenSMART and State Farm's Steer Clear), rewarding safe driving habits |
| Multi-car | Savings for households insuring multiple vehicles on the same policy |
| Annual mileage | Reduces rates for drivers who drive below a certain number of miles (usually 7,500) annually |
| Family policy | Big savings when adding a teen driver to a parent or guardian's existing policy instead of a separate one |
| Driver's education | Rewards teen drivers who complete a certified driver's education program |

### Teen Car Insurance: FAQ

*\*Seven states don't use gender as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.*

### Why are car insurance premiums higher for teen drivers?

Insurers consider teen drivers [high-risk](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/) due to inexperience and higher accident likelihood, leading to higher premiums than experienced drivers. Hawaii and [Massachusetts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/high-risk-car-insurance-massachusetts/) are the only states that don't use age as a rating factor, resulting in lower rates for teen drivers. Massachusetts bases rates on years of driving experience.

### How can teen drivers earn discounts on car insurance?

Your teen can score discounts in several ways, including good student, distant student, defensive driving and telematics-based discounts. Check with your insurer about all options.

### Are there benefits to choosing a specific type of car for a teen driver?

A car's make and model impact insurance costs. Vehicles with good safety ratings can lower premiums, while luxury or high-performance cars increase them. Research and choose safe and reliable vehicles.

### Should you consider telematics for your teen driver?

Telematics monitors driving behavior through devices or apps, offering feedback and potential discounts based on safe driving habits. Teen drivers can benefit from telematics, as it helps them develop safer habits and may lower their premiums through programs that reward responsible driving.

### What happens if my teen gets into an accident?

Your insurance rates will likely increase after an at-fault accident, but the impact varies by company and state. Some insurers offer accident forgiveness for first-time incidents, while others may raise rates by 20% to 40%. The teen's driving record affects the entire family policy, so discuss safe driving expectations early.

### Do I need to add my teen immediately when they get their learner's permit?

Most insurers don't require adding teens with learner's permits since they're covered under permissive use provisions while driving with licensed adults. However, you should add them once they get their full license. Some companies offer better rates if you add them earlier, so check with your insurer.

### Can my teen's grades affect our insurance rates?

Yes, most insurers offer good student discounts for teens maintaining a B average or 3.0 GPA. Some companies require verification through report cards or transcripts. These discounts can reduce premiums by 10% to 25%, making academic performance pay off for your family's insurance costs.

*\*The rates above are based on average costs. In some cases, an individual policy may make more sense. For example, if the teen drives a high-performance or luxury vehicle with high insurance costs, an individual policy prevents a large increase in the family's overall premium.*

### Best Car Insurance Rates for Teens: Methodology

**Study Overview**

MoneyGeek gathered quote data to determine the cheapest car insurance for teens by age.

**Data Acquisition, Depth and Analysis**

We collected data from Quadrant Information Services and state insurance departments. MoneyGeek analyzed 83,056 quotes from 46 companies across 473 ZIP codes.

**Driver Profiles**

The sample profile used for rate collection includes:

* 100/300/100 liability limits
* Comprehensive and collision coverages
* $1,000 deductible
* No history of tickets or accidents
* 2010 Toyota Camry LE

We adjusted this profile by age to compare rates for 16, 17, 18 and 19-year-olds. We also modified it by gender to analyze rate differences and by vehicle (Ford Mustang) to compare insurance prices for teens by car.

**Coverages and Deductibles Explained**

A deductible is paid out of pocket before certain coverages, like collision and comprehensive, apply.

A 100/300/100 policy includes:

* $100,000 in bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 in bodily injury liability per accident
* $100,000 in property damage liability per accident
