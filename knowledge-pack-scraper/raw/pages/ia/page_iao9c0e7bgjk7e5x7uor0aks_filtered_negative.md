_*Seven states don't use gender as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania._
Insurers consider teen drivers [high-risk](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/) due to inexperience and higher accident likelihood, leading to higher premiums than experienced drivers. Hawaii and [Massachusetts](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/high-risk-car-insurance-massachusetts/) are the only states that don't use age as a rating factor, resulting in lower rates for teen drivers. Massachusetts bases rates on years of driving experience.
_*The rates above are based on average costs. In some cases, an individual policy may make more sense. For example, if the teen drives a high-performance or luxury vehicle with high insurance costs, an individual policy prevents a large increase in the family's overall premium._
