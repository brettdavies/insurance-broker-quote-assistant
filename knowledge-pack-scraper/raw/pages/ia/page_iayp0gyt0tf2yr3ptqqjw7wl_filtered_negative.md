Umbrella insurance provides coverage beyond your liability insurance limits, which can pay out if you or your household members accidentally cause property damage or injuries to other people. Umbrella coverage can also cover you or your household members if sued.
Whether you need umbrella insurance depends on your assets, the risks you face and what you have to lose.
## What Is Umbrella Insurance?
Umbrella insurance is additional [liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/liability-insurance/) that pays beyond the limits of your other insurance policies. These can include your auto, homeowners and/or watercraft insurance policies. It’s for expensive situations where medical bills and/or repairs exceed your “base” auto, homeowners or boat insurance policies.
**_–[Penny Gusner](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/pgusner/), Senior Insurance writer for Forbes Advisor_**
Umbrella insurance is a separate policy that can offer additional liability coverage beyond your home and car insurance policies. It’s a kind of asset protection since it protects your assets if you lose a lawsuit judgment.
Insurance policies usually require a minimum level of home and auto liability insurance before you can buy umbrella insurance. That might mean you need at least $300,000 in your [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) policy and $250,000 for injuries and $100,000 for property damage in your auto insurance policy.
Umbrella insurance can be worthwhile if you have assets beyond your home or auto policy’s liability coverage limits. Another instance when you may want umbrella insurance is if you volunteer and could face lawsuits, such as being a member of a charity board of directors.
## How Does Umbrella Insurance Work?
Umbrella insurance kicks in once you’ve reached your “base” liability limits for home insurance or [car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/).
That means if you have $300,000 home [personal liability coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) but lose a $500,000 legal judgment, the home liability coverage would pay $300,000 and an umbrella insurance policy would pick up the remaining $200,000.
If you didn’t have umbrella insurance in this case, you’d have to pay the $200,000 out of your own pocket.
## What Does Umbrella Insurance Cover?
Umbrella insurance generally covers you and members of your household with extra liability coverage for problems such as:
* Bodily injury to others
* Property damage to others
* The legal costs to defend you in lawsuits related to these problems
* Lawsuits such as defamation, libel, slander and invasion of privacy
* Incidents that happen outside the U.S.
Note that your umbrella policy may not cover members of your household with property or auto insurance in their own name or with another insurance company. For example, your father may live with you but have his own car insurance policy. Check with your insurance company about any exclusions that may apply to household members.
### Umbrella Coverage Beyond the Base Insurance Policy
Umbrella insurance may offer coverage beyond what’s found in typical liability insurance, such as:
* False arrest, imprisonment or detention
* Malicious prosecution
* Wrongful eviction or entry
* Invasion of privacy
## What Umbrella Insurance Won’t Cover
Umbrella insurance doesn’t cover your injuries or damage to your property. Other issues typically not covered by umbrella insurance include:
* Business losses
* Criminal acts by you
* Written or oral contracts
* Intentional acts or injury by you
* Damage due to nuclear radiation, war or terrorism
* Communicable disease, such as a lawsuit against you for giving someone herpes

## Umbrella Insurance Pros and Cons
Umbrella insurance can be a wise choice if you have significant assets that exceed your liability limits. However, you may not find it’s not needed if your assets are minimal or if you’re already well-covered by existing policies.
Pros of Umbrella Insurance  |  Cons of Umbrella Insurance
---|---
**Extended Coverage**
Umbrella insurance offers expanded liability coverage beyond your existing policies. That can protect your assets if you’re sued for a large amount. It also often covers risks that your primary policies might not, such as libel and slander. |  **Extended Coverage May Not be Necessary**
You may not need the additional coverage if you already have high liability limits on your policies. The expanded coverage might not also be needed if you don’t have significant assets or if you’re not at high risk of being sued.
**Protection Against Major Lawsuits**
Umbrella insurance may pay for large legal costs, settlements and judgments beyond your liability policy limits. |  **Doesn’t Cover All Situations**
Umbrella insurance doesn’t cover everything, such as your injuries, damage to your property or business-related liabilities unless you have specific policies for those situations.
**Relatively Affordable**
Umbrella insurance is generally affordable and coverage typically starts at $1 million. |  **Required Limits May Hike Base Costs**
You need to exhaust liability coverage limits before you’re eligible for umbrella insurance.

## Do You Need Umbrella Insurance?
Umbrella insurance can be a wise financial decision if you have assets that exceed your liability insurance limit. You don’t have to be a wealthy household to benefit from umbrella coverage.
For instance, if you have a swimming pool, which increases your liability risks, you may want to buy umbrella insurance to provide an extra coverage cushion.
People with significant assets can benefit from an umbrella policy. There are other instances when umbrella coverage is a wise purchase, such as if you own a swimming pool.
Another example is if you have a large bank account, real estate, vehicles and other valuables, that could be lost in a lawsuit. You may even need to turn over a portion of your wages if you don’t have enough assets to satisfy a judgment. Umbrella insurance can provide coverage in those instances.
### Who Has High Risk Potential for Lawsuits?
Lifestyles or activities that may increase your risk includes:
* You serve on a charitable board
* You have kids living at home
* You have a swimming pool, pond or trampoline
* You have dogs, horses or other large animals
* You manage a family trust
* You host large parties in your home
* You employ household staff
* You own rental properties
* You have a high public profile

## Is Umbrella Insurance a Good Investment?
Adding umbrella insurance to your insurance portfolio can be a wise decision if you need additional liability coverage. Umbrella policies are typically fairly inexpensive. You can buy a $1 million umbrella insurance policy for about $32 per month, according to an ACE Private Risk Services report.
For that $32 per month on average, you get the peace of mind that your assets will be properly covered if you’re found responsible for other people’s injuries or damage to their property.
If you don’t have many assets, you might not need umbrella insurance. Your home and auto liability coverage may be enough.

##  Umbrella Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### How much is a $1 million umbrella policy?
A person with one home, two cars and two drivers pays an average of $383 a year for $1 million in umbrella insurance, according to an ACE Private Risk Services report. The exact cost varies by your assets and what you have to lose.
### Is umbrella insurance the same as excess liability insurance?
Yes, umbrella insurance means the same as excess liability insurance.
### What is the most that an umbrella insurance will pay?
Your umbrella insurance policy’s policy limit dictates how much your policy may pay.
If you have a $1 million umbrella insurance policy and you are found liable in a lawsuit, your umbrella insurance pays up to that amount. You can usually buy umbrella insurance in increments of $1 million, such as a $10 million umbrella insurance policy.
