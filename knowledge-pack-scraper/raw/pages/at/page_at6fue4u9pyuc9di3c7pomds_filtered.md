## About GEICO home insurance

GEICO is one of the biggest insurers in the country, yet it technically doesn’t offer its own home insurance. GEICO functions as a broker and matches customers with third-party home insurers through the GEICO Insurance Agency. Customers won’t know which company their homeowners policy is from until they get a quote — which can make for a confusing customer experience.

If you already have car insurance from GEICO, buying a homeowners policy may qualify you for an auto insurance discount. However, GEICO doesn’t allow you to choose the insurer you’ll be matched with. And if you need to make any claims, you’ll need to work with the third party directly — so there’s little convenience from bundling.

## Get home insurance quotes in minutes

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

* ### Why doesn’t this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  We make every effort to rate each company we review. However, we’re sometimes unable to provide a NerdWallet star rating for insurers that work with multiple third parties to underwrite their policies. That’s because the quality of the policy you get may vary depending on the coverage options, financial strength and other factors of each separate underwriting company.

### Where GEICO home insurance stands out

**Savings for GEICO auto policyholders.** GEICO is one of the [cheapest car insurers](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/cheapest-car-insurance) for some U.S. drivers, according to NerdWallet’s rate analysis. By getting your home insurance through GEICO, you may be eligible for further discounts.

**Availability.** Because GEICO works with so many third parties, it’s able to sell homeowners insurance in all states.

### Where GEICO home insurance falls short

**Limited information about policies.** Coverage and discounts vary from one third-party to another, so GEICO’s website is short on details about which options you might have. You’ll need to get a quote to see which company you’re matched with and the coverage options available to you.

**Claim filing.** You’ll need to reach out to the insurer that underwrites your policy, not to GEICO, in order to submit a claim for theft or home damage.

## What GEICO home insurance covers

These types of home insurance coverage generally come standard:

* ### Dwelling

  [Dwelling coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/dwelling-coverage-homeowners) pays to repair or rebuild the structure of your home after a covered event. It also covers attached structures, such as porches.

  **Typical amount**: Enough to rebuild your home.
* ### Other structures

  [Other structures coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/other-structures-coverage) pays to repair or rebuild stand-alone structures on your property, such as a fence or shed.

  **Typical amount**: 10% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Personal property

  [Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance) pays to repair or replace stolen or damaged belongings. Personal property coverage comes in one of two options: [actual cash value or replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

  **Typical amount:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Loss of use

  [Loss of use coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage), sometimes known as additional living expenses coverage, helps pay temporary living expenses while your home is being repaired. This can cover hotel stays, home rentals and meals.

  **Typical amount**: 20% of dwelling coverage.

  [Personal liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-liability-insurance-homeowners) pays if you injure someone or cause property damage unintentionally or through neglect.

* ### Medical payments

  [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners) pays to treat someone injured on your property, regardless of who’s at fault. It also pays if you, a family member or a pet injures someone away from your home.

For more details, see [What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance)

### Optional GEICO home insurance coverage

Beyond these standard coverage types, your options for customizing your policy may differ depending on which company GEICO matches you with. For example, we got a quote for a house in Maryland and were offered choices such as:

[**Water backup coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage)in case a drain backs up or a sump pump fails.

[**Identity theft coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance) to help with recovery expenses.

[**Equipment breakdown coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/equipment-breakdown-coverage-homeowners) in case an appliance or home system fails.

[**Service line coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/service-line-coverage) for underground utility lines connected to your house.

You can also buy [flood](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance) and [earthquake insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance) through GEICO agents.

### What’s not covered

A standard homeowners insurance from GEICO doesn’t cover:

* Floods.
* Earthquakes.
* Wear and tear.
* Intentional damage.

As noted above, you may be able to buy extra coverage for some of these scenarios.

## Where GEICO home insurance is available

GEICO can match you with a homeowners insurance company in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Availability may change at any time. Coverage may not be available to all homeowners in a given state.

🤓Nerdy Tip

We recommend getting [home insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/home-insurance-quotes) from at least three companies to find the best value on the coverage you need.

## What Reddit users say about GEICO home insurance

*Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like homeowners insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

Comments about GEICO on Reddit show occasional confusion, with users not realizing that their policy actually comes from a third party, not GEICO. Reviews of Assurant, one of GEICO's third-party partners, are mixed. Some Redditors complain about rate increases on their policies. However, others note that prices are going up for other companies too, so it’s important to shop around.

## More Nerdy Perspective

Another way to lower your premium is to raise your [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible), the amount that will be subtracted from your payout if you ever file a claim. I generally don’t file claims for minor damage because I know the insurer will likely raise my rates in response. Instead, I maintain a higher deductible and use my insurance only for major problems. If you choose this strategy, be sure to pick a deductible amount you’d feel comfortable covering out of your own pocket.

## Questions from Reddit: Our experts answer

### Is it normal for GEICO to send someone to inspect your house?

It’s common for insurance companies to inspect your home, especially when you first apply for coverage. Historically, insurers have sent inspectors out in person, but many now rely on [aerial images](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/aerial-imagery-homeowners-insurance) that can capture information like the state of your roof. With these inspections, insurers are looking to verify your property details and make sure they’re comfortable writing you a policy. Learn more about [home insurance inspections](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-insurance-inspection).

### Should I switch to GEICO or stay loyal to the same home insurer I’ve had for years?

Shopping around regularly is a good way to make sure you’re still getting a fair price for your insurance. Though some insurance companies offer loyalty discounts for longtime policyholders, these may not be enough to make up for a cheaper rate elsewhere. Some insurers sweeten the pot with welcome discounts that can help you save when switching carriers.

## How to file a claim with GEICO

To file a claim, you'll need to contact the partner company that underwrites your policy. Some offer online claims reporting, while others may require you to file over the phone. GEICO's website has a list of phone numbers and links for all its partners.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

## How to contact GEICO customer service

**Phone:** Call 800-241-8098 for property insurance questions.

**Email:** You can log in to your account to send direct messages to the company.

**Live chat:** GEICO’s chat feature starts out with a bot but can connect you with a live representative.

## Online tools

**Website:** You can use GEICO’s website to get a homeowners insurance quote or learn about various types of insurance. The website also offers contact numbers for the companies in GEICO’s homeowners insurance network, including [The Hartford](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/hartford-aarp-home-insurance-review), [Liberty Mutual](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/liberty-mutual-home-insurance-review) and [Travelers](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/travelers-home-insurance-review).

**Mobile app:** The GEICO app lets you view basic homeowners policy information such as effective dates and contact numbers for the issuing company.

## GEICO home insurance vs. competitors

### GEICO home insurance vs. Allstate

The biggest differences between GEICO and Allstate home insurance are:

**Business structure.** Allstate offers its own policies while GEICO sells through third parties. That means Allstate offers more details about coverage and discounts on its website so you know what to expect before you get a quote.

**Claims filing.** You can file Allstate claims on the company’s website or by phone. With GEICO, your options will depend on which third party issued your policy.

### GEICO home insurance vs. State Farm

The key difference between GEICO and State Farm home insurance are:

**Dwelling coverage.** One nice perk that comes with State Farm homeowners policies is [extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost) for your dwelling. Dwelling coverage is the part of your policy that pays to repair or replace the structure of your home. Extended replacement coverage raises your dwelling limit in case it costs more than expected to rebuild your home after a covered disaster. The home insurance company that GEICO pairs you with may or may not offer this coverage — and if it does, it may cost extra.

**Business structure.** State Farm writes its own homeowners insurance while GEICO offers policies through third parties. You won’t know which company is actually insuring you until you get a quote on the GEICO website (or through its call center).
