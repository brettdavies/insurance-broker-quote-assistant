If you’re moving to the “Big D” Dallas, or simply reviewing a larger-than-a-longhorn monthly bill, you need to know the lay of the land.

Just how much is homeowners insurance in Dallas, Texas?

Like so many financial calculations, the answer is: it depends. There are a lot of variables related to both your financial history and decisions plus property characteristics. Let’s examine how to estimate the costs and keep homeowners insurance premiums affordable.

## Average Cost of Homeowners Insurance in Dallas

Polling what others pay is a good starting point to determine the average cost of homeowners insurance in Dallas. On average, Dallas households pay $5,045 per year (or $420 per month) to insure their homes, considerably higher than the national average of $1,915 per year, more than twice the monthly average payment of $160.1

At a state level, Texas ranks second in the country for the highest homeowners insurance rates, with an average $4,400 annual cost. On the positive side, however, you’re better off in Dallas than in Houston, which has the highest rate of the top 20 metropolitan areas nationwide at $6,610 per year!

## Factors That May Increase Insurance Costs

Some rate calculations are based on the specific [home you buy in Dallas](https://www.truehold.com/post/how-to-buy-a-house-in-dallas-expert-guide), while others can be navigated and negotiated. If you’re currently shopping for a Dallas home insurance policy, consider these enduring factors:

### The Effect of Home Age on Home Insurance Rates

Overall, an older or more structurally complex home results in a more expensive insurance policy.

When it comes to age, if all other factors are equal, pricing differentials are approximately2:

* 10 years old: 48% higher than new construction
* 20 years old: 69% higher than new construction
* 30 years old: 74% higher than new construction
* 100 years old: 76% higher than new construction

It's crucial for Texas homeowners to account for these factors when budgeting for their home insurance.

### The Influence of Neighborhood and Location

The exact location and neighborhood are relevant to insurance rates to the extent they increase risk and vulnerability to damage. This can include:

* Vulnerability to natural disasters, erosion, flooding, etc.
* Crime rates
* Proximity to nearest fire services
* Strictness and care of local building codes

## Ways to Reduce Homeowners Insurance Premiums

One of the simplest ways to lower your premiums is to simply ask. Call your insurance company, let them know you’re shopping around for a home insurance policy. Ask if there are any discounts you now qualify for, especially if you’ve made property improvements. Such measures can significantly reduce what you pay.

### Leverage Discounts and Bundling Options

You can significantly reduce your premiums through discounts, so be sure to find out what you qualify for when you comparison shop. Common discounts include:

* Bundling multiple types of insurance (such as home and auto) with one carrier
* Autopay and paperless billing selections
* Loyalty (length of time with the insurer) and solid payment histories
* Nonsmoking, military, or older age status

Home characteristics that can offer discounts include:

* Smart home devices such as leak detectors
* Newer roofs with fire resistant or damage resistant materials
* Green home certification

### Improve Home Security Measures

Homeowners in Texas can reduce premium costs by strengthening home security. Consider:

* Steel entry doors
* Security systems with door and window motion sensors
* Surveillance cameras
* Fire and burglar alarm connected to police, fire, or monitoring resource

### Shop Around for the Best Rates

Is gathering some new quotes worth your time? The same $300,000 house application yielded monthly premiums of $184 to $664 from five of the top insurance companies in Texas for 2024.3

That’s a potential savings of $5,760 over the course of a year! You won’t always find a gap that huge, but comparison shopping periodically will ensure you’re taking advantage of every discount that a company rep can offer to secure your business.

### Maintain a Strong Credit Score

Your credit score makes a difference, since insurers consider your reliability as part of risk determination. Follow these steps:

* Check your credit reports periodically
* Appeal any errors
* Make regular, timely payments
* Keep a comfortable mix of credit type, utilization, and debt to income (DTI) ratio
