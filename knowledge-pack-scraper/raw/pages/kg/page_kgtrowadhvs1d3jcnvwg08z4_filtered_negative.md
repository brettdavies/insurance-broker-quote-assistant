Beginning July 1, 2024, commercial policies will become [eligible for the FAIR Plan’s clearinghouse program](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/california-fair-plan-to-add-commercial-policies-starting-july/). The clearinghouse program, an enactment of 2023’s Senate Bill 505, is designed to help offload FAIR Plan policies to private insurance providers, with the help of brokers and carriers. The news was met with some relief by many insurance experts, who have long stressed how overburdened the CA Fair Plan is.
When an insurance company gets licensed to sell policies in the state of California, it also agrees to financially support the FAIR Plan if it runs out of money following a catastrophic disaster. If a [wildfire](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/wildfire-insurance-california/) destroys a swath of homes insured with the FAIR Plan, and there is not enough money in reserves to pay out those claims, the FAIR Plan would turn to the state’s private insurers to help with the cash call.
In late 2023, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced the [Sustainable Insurance Strategy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/california-sustainable-insurance-strategy/), a multi-pronged approach to bring stability to the home insurance market and encourage private providers to return to the state. One of the goals named in Lara’s plan is to unburden the FAIR Plan by seeking a commitment from private insurers to write 85 percent of new business in historically underserved areas and to modernize the current FAIR Plan to include homeowners associations and affordable housing projects. However, part of the Strategy would also be for the FAIR Plan to call on homeowners _and_ the state’s insurance companies — instead of insurance companies alone — if the Plan needs to make a cash call after a catastrophic residential loss. In February 2025, the FAIR Plan had a $1 billion assessment to help recoup losses from the January 2025 wildfires.
> — Jason Cooper Vice President-Senior Credit Officer, Moody’s Ratings
Like standard home insurance, California FAIR Plan premiums vary based on a number of[ rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/). This includes the location, age and condition of the home, proximity to a fire station, the homeowner’s claims history, the types and amount of coverage and the deductibles chosen. In a 2022 interview with[ KCRA](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-fair-plan-wildfire-insurance-what-is-it-how-can-i-get-it/40574517), a FAIR Plan spokesperson stated that the average cost of a policy is about $3,200 per year, which is significantly more than a typical home insurance policy in California, where the [average homeowner pays $1,429](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) for $300,000 in dwelling coverage as of February 2025. Keep in mind that the FAIR plan covers much less than a typical home insurance policy, and that homeowners on the FAIR plan usually pay more for less. The cost to insure a home can be even more expensive if purchasing policies to complement the FAIR Plan, such as a difference in conditions, flood or earthquake policy.
* ###  What is the best home insurance company in California?
* ###  Do I need earthquake insurance in California?
While homeowners insurance may be a requirement by mortgage companies, [earthquake insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/is-earthquake-insurance-worth-it/) is typically not. However, because a standard homeowners insurance policy excludes earthquake coverage, many homeowners opt to purchase it anyway to protect their home and personal property, especially if they live near an active fault line or are concerned about earthquakes. Without earthquake insurance, homeowners are responsible for covering the cost of all repairs out-of-pocket. Homeowners who have a California FAIR Plan dwelling fire policy in force are able to purchase additional coverage for earthquakes, which is offered through the California Earthquake Authority.
