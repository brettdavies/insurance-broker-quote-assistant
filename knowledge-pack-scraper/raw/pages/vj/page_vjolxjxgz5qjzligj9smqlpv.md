# What Is Texas Windstorm Insurance? A Homeowner’s Guide
![What Is Texas Windstorm Insurance? A Homeowner's Guide](https://www.tbarpro.com/site/wp-content/uploads/what-is-texas-windstorm-ins.png)
Strong winds and hurricanes impact coastal Texas every year, putting homes at risk for damage. Many homeowners do not realize that standard insurance policies often exclude wind-related damage. This leaves a financial gap that can be difficult to recover from after a major storm.
Texas windstorm insurance helps cover losses caused by wind and hail, reducing the burden of out-of-pocket repairs. Understanding how this insurance works, the certificate search process, and filing a Texas windstorm insurance claim can help homeowners make informed decisions about protecting their property.
## Why Standard Home Insurance Does Not Cover Windstorm Damage
Home insurance policies cover fire, theft, and some natural disasters, but many exclude wind damage in high-risk areas. This applies to homes along the Gulf Coast, where hurricanes and strong storms occur frequently. Insurers avoid taking on the financial risk of widespread wind damage, leaving homeowners to seek separate coverage. Without windstorm insurance, homeowners must cover repair costs themselves, which can be expensive after a major storm.
Lenders often require windstorm insurance for homes in designated high-risk areas. These areas fall under Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties, where wind-related damage is common. Homeowners in these zones may need proof of coverage to secure a mortgage or maintain compliance with loan terms.
## Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) and Eligibility Requirements
The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) provides windstorm insurance for homeowners who cannot secure coverage from private insurers. This state-backed insurance option exists for those in coastal counties where the risk of wind damage is too high for standard providers.
Not every home qualifies for TWIA coverage. Homeowners must meet specific requirements, including:
  * **Location:** The property must be in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 coastal county.
  * **Certification:** Homes must pass a Texas windstorm inspection and receive a Texas windstorm insurance certificate to confirm compliance with current building codes.
  * **Flood Insurance:** Homes in high-risk flood zones built after August 31, 2009, must carry National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) coverage.
  * **Proof of Private Insurance Denial:** Homeowners must show that at least one private insurer has declined to offer wind coverage.


The TWIA acts as an insurer of last resort. It is available only to those who have exhausted private insurance options and need windstorm coverage to protect their home investment.
## How to Search for a Texas Windstorm Insurance Certificate
A Texas windstorm insurance certificate search helps homeowners confirm that their property meets windstorm insurance requirements. The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) maintains a database where homeowners can check the status of their certification.
To conduct a Texas windstorm insurance certificate search, homeowners can visit the TDI website and enter their property details. If the certificate does not appear, homeowners may need to schedule a windstorm inspection or contact the original builder for documentation.
Properties without proper certification may face insurance issues. Without certification, the TWIA may deny coverage, leaving homeowners without financial protection in the event of wind damage.
## What Texas Windstorm Insurance Covers
Windstorm insurance policies protect against damage caused by strong winds and hail. Coverage applies to the home’s structure, including the roof, walls, and other built-in components. Policyholders may also have options for covering personal belongings and additional living expenses if a storm displaces them.
Standard TWIA policies include:
  * **Dwelling Coverage:** Pays for structural repairs after wind or hail damage.
  * **Other Structures Coverage:** Protects detached buildings, such as garages and sheds.
  * **Personal Property Coverage:** Covers belongings damaged by wind or hail.
  * **Debris Removal:** Helps clear fallen tree branches and other storm debris.
  * **Emergency Repairs:** Pays for immediate repairs to prevent further damage.


Some policies offer add-ons for increased construction costs and temporary living expenses. These optional coverages help homeowners manage repair costs after a severe storm.
## How to File a Texas Windstorm Insurance Claim
Filing a Texas windstorm insurance claim requires quick action after a storm. Delaying the process may lead to further damage, increasing repair costs. Homeowners should document all storm-related damages with photos and videos before making temporary repairs. These records help support the claim and ensure accurate assessment by the insurance provider.
The claims process involves several key steps:
  * **Report the Damage** – Contact the insurance provider as soon as possible to initiate a claim. TWIA policyholders can file claims online or by phone.
  * **Document the Damage** – Take clear photos and videos of affected areas, including the roof, siding, windows, and interior spaces.
  * **Make Temporary Repairs** – Prevent further damage by securing openings and covering exposed areas. Keep all receipts for repair costs.
  * **Schedule an Inspection** – The insurance provider will send an adjuster to assess the damage and determine the claim amount.
  * **Review the Settlement Offer** – After evaluation, the insurer provides a settlement amount. Homeowners should carefully review the offer before accepting.
  * **Complete Repairs** – Once the claim is approved, homeowners can begin full repairs using the funds provided.


Working with experienced [commercial roofing professionals](https://www.tbarpro.com/roofing-services/commercial-roofing-contractor/) ensures repairs meet industry standards. After a claim, restoring the roof properly helps prevent future wind and hail damage.
## Texas Windstorm Insurance Costs and Deductibles
The cost of windstorm insurance depends on the home’s location, construction type, and policy coverage limits. The average TWIA policy costs around $2,300 per year, but rates vary based on several factors.
TWIA deductibles range from 1% to 5% of the dwelling limit rather than a fixed dollar amount. For example, a home with a $300,000 policy limit and a 2% deductible would require the homeowner to cover $6,000 of repair costs before insurance pays out. Higher deductibles reduce premiums but increase out-of-pocket costs in the event of a claim.
Homeowners should also stay aware of rate adjustments. In 2024, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association filed for a 10% rate increase, which, if approved, will take effect in 2025. This increase highlights the rising costs of windstorm insurance and the importance of exploring coverage options regularly.
## Alternative Windstorm Insurance Options
TWIA is not the only option for windstorm coverage. Several private insurers offer windstorm policies that may provide more flexibility and competitive pricing. Unlike TWIA, private insurers can bundle windstorm insurance with home insurance, potentially lowering overall costs.
Homeowners can compare private windstorm insurance providers to find the best policy for their needs. However, if denied by a private insurer, they may apply for TWIA coverage. Those unable to secure a wind policy from either option may have to explore Texas FAIR Plan insurance, though this coverage is limited and often more expensive.
