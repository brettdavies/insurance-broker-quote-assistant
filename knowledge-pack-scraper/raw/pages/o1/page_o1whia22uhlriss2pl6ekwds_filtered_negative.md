# California’s Insurance Crisis

Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018, explained California’s growing insurance crisis [in 2023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/insurance-climate-wildfires-farmers-florida-california-4e3d5d27):
A long-term change in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events would indeed alter the risk of loss. But insurance is about the management of risk. Without risk, insurance could not exist. As Cuthbert Heath, an early innovator in catastrophe insurance, [explained more than a century ago](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Cure_for_Catastrophe/aSbXCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0): “Any risk is insurable at the right price.”
Back in 1998, soon after Chris Landsea and I published [our first paper estimating what damage past hurricanes would do](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wefo/13/3/1520-0434_1998_013_0621_nhditu_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=pdf) under contemporary levels of population and wealth, we were contacted by someone in Florida’s government involved with insurance regulation. We were asked if we could apply our normalization just to hurricanes that affected Florida. We performed the requested analysis and shared our findings with Florida officials — Normalized hurricane losses for Florida under our methods implied much greater risk of loss than other contemporary methods of loss estimation, and thus implied a need for higher insurance rates for Florida homeowners. We did not hear back.
State regulation of insurance companies is [generally viewed to be necessary to meet two goals](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/252042.pdf?casa_token=HQ20Z4m3wdQAAAAA:TavdBxW_An-Kpupt0cPVGXVYeLrKjVDbX5cQ1vf0epOqAu-wThRKOFeijgJm5LLFRnkshuPq_qBT35bCWy504DeGB-PRwsWsrVmhL_wUaYEqwaF1Xg): fair pricing for consumers and ensuring that insurance companies have adequate reserves for the largest of disasters.[1](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/californias-insurance-crisis?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=119454&post_id=155179252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=1o8rh5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-1-155179252) Of course, the determination of “fair pricing” and “adequate reserves” is subject to debate, and ultimately determined politically, and, ideally, informed by science.
In California, in 1988 a ballot initiative — [Proposition 103](https://consumerwatchdog.org/insurance/text-proposition-103/), championed by Ralph Nader, called “Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act”[2](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/californias-insurance-crisis?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=119454&post_id=155179252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=1o8rh5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-2-155179252) — [narrowly passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_California_Proposition_103) and subsequently transformed how California determined both “fair pricing” and “adequate reserves.” The law has led directly to California’s insurance crisis of 2025 because it prevents insurance companies from charging actuarially sound rates for homeowners insurance.[3](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/californias-insurance-crisis?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=119454&post_id=155179252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=1o8rh5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-3-155179252)
Rate suppression refers a situation when the actuarially appropriate insurance rate is larger than the actual rate approved by state regulators, which creates a situation where pricing of insurance does not accurately approximate risk. The figure below, from an analysis by the [International Law and Economics Center](https://laweconcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rethinking-Prop-103s-Approach-to-Insurance-Regulation-2.pdf) (ILEC), shows that from 2018-2022 California had the largest rate suppression of any US state, and by a large margin.
The rates that insurance companies are allowed to charge in California are thus not high enough to enable insurance companies to cover the risks that they are taking. That gap is why [companies like State Farm have reduced their exposure](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/state-farm-stung-by-la-wildfire-claims-520855.aspx) to the California market.

First, the [law requires](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/10-CCR-2644.5) that insurance companies calculate how they price insurance for fire catastrophes based only on loss experience of the past 20 years (or more):
One is change in risk — fire risk varies and changes over time and there is no guarantee that the experiences of the past twenty years would accurately characterize current or future risk. In fact, even in the absence of changes in climate, twenty years is far to short to accurately characterize climate and ecological variability.[4](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/californias-insurance-crisis?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=119454&post_id=155179252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=1o8rh5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-4-155179252) Climate change and variability mean that fire risk is not a simple constant.

Source: [Peterson et al. 2021](https://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021/acs.est.1c03835&ref=pdf).
Another source of change relevant to estimating the risk of loss is in exposure and vulnerability. For instance, the graphs below, via [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/), shows that house prices in Malibu and Pacific Palisades, two communities devastated by the recent fires, doubled over just 5 years. That rate of growth in valuation equates to 16x over 20 years. Even in locations with smaller levels of appreciation, using catastrophe losses from the past 20 years is bound to mislead.
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ee1e30c-0d69-436d-95ac-4eee4925e261_2920x873.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ee1e30c-0d69-436d-95ac-4eee4925e261_2920x873.png)House prices in Malibu and Pacific Palisades, 2017-2024. Source: Zillow
Yet another factor relevant to contemporary risk of loss is that more houses are being built in California (but apparently, [not enough](https://www.ppic.org/interactive/californians-and-the-housing-crisis/)). According to one analysis— [Berg et al. 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622824000766) — over the period 2000 to 2020, housing in the wildland-urban interface in California increased by ~600,000 to ~800,000 units (depending on method) or roughly 20% of total housing stock in areas subject to wildfire. Development also means that backwards-looking loss estimates will always underestimate contemporary and future estimates of risk of loss.
As the [ILEC notes](https://laweconcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rethinking-Prop-103s-Approach-to-Insurance-Regulation-2.pdf):
Catastrophe models, which are allowed in California to estimate earthquake risks, are no panacea. [Dag Lohmann, CEO of KatRisk, LLC, noted](https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/millimaninc5660-milliman6442-prod27d5-0001/media/Milliman/importedfiles/uploadedFiles/Wildfire_catastrophe_models_could_spark_the_changes_California_needs.pdf) that wildfire catastrophe models can generate risk estimates that differ from each other by 300%. Even though cat models, as they are called, are not truth machines, they surely would tell us that wildfire risk in California is mispriced (and there can be little doubt that the companies limiting their exposure to the California market already know this).
[As Jessica Weinkle and I argued](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0162243916671201) in the context of hurricane catastrophe modeling in Florida, such models can also help to surface important questions about insurance that go beyond just pricing:
In addition, Proposition 103 allows does [not allow consideration of reinsurance pricing](https://laweconcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rethinking-Prop-103s-Approach-to-Insurance-Regulation-2.pdf) in regulating state insurance rates. Reinsurance companies — who provide insurance for insurance companies — are sophisticated managers of risk. They make extensive use of catastrophe models and other tools. Pricing of risk in the global reinsurance market provides further valuable information that could be used to more appropriately price California wildfire risks.
For instance, [Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in September 2023](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/9.21.23-Homeowners-Insurance-EO.pdf)that celebrated Proposition 103, suggesting the policy was well designed to keep consumer costs for insurance low:
California’s Insurance Commissioner, [Ricardo Lara, followed suit](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2023/release051-2023.cfm): “The actions announced today are aimed at addressing problems fueled by climate change...”. The national media, already deeply dependent upon climate porn, readily follows along, and voila, we have a climate-fueled insurance crisis.
[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5f3399e-c24e-4d9e-9eb0-3bc04b77d94d_551x488.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5f3399e-c24e-4d9e-9eb0-3bc04b77d94d_551x488.png)The stories, they write themselves
But disasters happen and, always, someone has to pay. Rather than fix Proposition 103, California policymakers instead utilize a public backstop called the [Fair Access to Insurance Requirements](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/California-FAIR-Plan.cfm) (FAIR) Plan. The FAIR plan uses government funds (paid by the public in taxes) and in extreme cases, levies on insurance companies passed on to consumers, to cover gaps in private insurance coverage resulting from insurance rates that do not correspond to risk.
So everyone pays for the policy failure and the actuarial inefficiency persists unaddressed. Socializing disaster losses also short circuits the ability to use insurance pricing to send signals via the market to consumers about the risks of development and homeownership in risky locations. Such price signals can motivate homeowners and developers to employ wildfire [mitigation](https://floir.com/property-casualty/premium-discounts-for-hurricane-loss-mitigation).
Grep Ip, chief economics commentator at the  _Wall Street Journal (_ and without a doubt the top national reporter on this issue), [explains the situation clearly](https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/the-world-is-getting-riskier-americans-dont-want-to-pay-for-it-51901067):[6](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/californias-insurance-crisis?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=119454&post_id=155179252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=1o8rh5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-6-155179252)
> Earlier this month, [JPMorgan](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JPM) estimated the fires around Los Angeles had inflicted $50 billion in losses, of which only $20 billion were insured.
> One reason for the gap: State regulators have prevented insurers from charging premiums commensurate with rising property values, construction costs and wildfire risk exacerbated by a warming climate. Many thus [stopped renewing policies](https://www.wsj.com/finance/california-home-insurance-los-angeles-palisades-fire-3cce96a9?mod=article_inline).
> If the Fair Plan runs out of money, it can[ impose an assessment](https://www.wsj.com/finance/insurers-rule-change-puts-california-homeowners-on-the-hook-for-l-a-fire-88336040?mod=article_inline) on private insurers to be partly passed on to all policyholders. In other words, the costs of the disaster will be socialized.

In order to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should have a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint-stock companies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the attorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private usurers, who had failed in the course of a few years.”

For a counter view, see [NAIMC](https://www.namic.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/040921AppelFinalRpt.pdf).
