**New York Homeowners Insurance Coverages**
---
**Dwelling Coverage** |  [Dwelling coverage](https://clovered.com/what-is-dwelling-coverage/) might be the first coverage you consider when you think about home insurance. It protects the physical structure of your house and its attached components. Your roof, walls, floors, patios, wiring, pipes, and air conditioning unit all fall under dwelling coverage.
**Other Structures Coverage** |  [Other structures coverage](https://clovered.com/what-is-other-structures-coverage/) covers the fixtures and features on your property not attached to your main house. These can include fences, decks, sheds, pools, and more.
**Personal Property Coverage** |  [Personal property coverage](https://clovered.com/what-is-personal-property-insurance/) covers your belongings, such as furniture, clothes, jewelry, electronics, tools, and more on and around your property.
**Loss of Use Coverage** |  [Loss of use coverage](https://clovered.com/what-is-loss-of-use-coverage/) is only applicable if you’re forced to move out of your house after damage from a covered peril. If you need to move out while your insurer repairs your home, they can pick up the tab for your lodging, food, gas, and more through loss of use coverage.
**Liability Coverage** |  [Personal liability coverage](https://clovered.com/what-is-liability-coverage/) financially safeguards you if you’re found liable for an accident where someone gets injured on your property. Personal liability coverage can cover potential settlements and legal fees.
**Medical Payments Coverage** |  Like liability coverage, [medical payments](https://clovered.com/what-is-medical-payments-coverage/) covers accidental injuries to others, but on a much smaller scale. While liability coverage may cover the injured person’s costs to get major surgeries, loss of income, or rehabilitation costs, medical payments may cover X-rays or stitches.

Relating to the way your home was built,[ insurance companies also take into account the materials used in your property’s construction](https://clovered.com/construction-type-for-insurance/).
