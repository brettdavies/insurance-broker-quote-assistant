**Security Deposit:** One of the most contentious issues in landlord-tenant relations is the security deposit. That’s why state disclosure requirements for security deposit rules are among the most common mandatory disclosures. These disclosure requirements vary from state to state. The most common rules include disclosing information about:
**Right of Inspection:** Closely related to security deposit information is a disclosure informing the tenant of the right to an inspection before they move in — to determine what damage exists when they sign the lease. This is important to avoid having pre-existing damage charged against the new tenant’s security deposit. There’s also sometimes a disclosure requirement informing a tenant of a right to be present at an inspection at the end of their tenancy to determine if there are any new damages a landlord can deduct from the security deposit.
**Deposits & Fees:** Many states require landlords to disclose information about any nonrefundable deposits or fees. For example, these states may require informing the tenant if the application fee and/or pet deposit are nonrefundable.
**Environmental hazards:** Environmental hazards are the most common state required disclosures. These disclosures typically include:
**Detectors:** Many states require that the lease or a separate document disclose details on who, the landlord or tenant, handles smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide detectors in the rental unit. Often, the tenant is responsible for testing and replacing batteries while the landlord is responsible for informing tenants about the detectors within the unit.
**Violations:** Some states require landlords to inform tenants of housing code violations. It’s more common for states to require landlords to inform tenants when the authorities condemn a building.
**Flooding:** Many states require landlords to disclose to new tenants if the unit has a history of flooding or if it’s in a flood zone.
**Smoking:** Some states require landlords to disclose whether they allow smoking in the rental unit.
**Rent Control:** Only [Oregon](https://www.steadily.com/states/oregon) and [California](https://www.steadily.com/states/california) have statewide rent-control. In Oregon, municipalities may not impose their own rent control laws. California allows municipalities to impose stricter rent control than state law provides. Other states, like [New York](https://www.steadily.com/states/new-york), have rent control in certain municipalities. Some of these local governments across the country require landlords to disclose these local rent control laws to their tenants.
The four largest states in the US are California, [Texas](https://www.steadily.com/states/texas), New York, and Florida. The combined populations of these states represent a third of the population of the entire US. We’re including the specific disclosure requirements of each of these states here.
* Landlords must provide tenants with the state’s [consumer handbook](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHLB/IAQ/CDPH%20Document%20Library/CDPH_Mold_Booklet_2021-May12.pdf) on toxic mold
* [Indoor air contamination](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ENV/27-2405) within the rental unit
* Rights of tenants to request [reasonable modification](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EXC/170-D) of the unit
* Notice of laws protecting tenants against discrimination based on their [lawful source of income](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EXC/170-E)
Consider the [case of Maureen S. Walck](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdny/pr/realtor-pleads-guilty-violating-lead-based-paint-disclosure-rules), a 72-year-old New York real estate agent. She pleaded guilty to failing to provide the lead-based  _hazard warning notice_. In her case, a child suffered from lead poisoning. Her sentence was jail-time already served, a $1,000 fine, and a $53,326.07 restitution order.
The current maximum penalty for not providing the required disclosure for lead-based paint is [$21,018  _per violation_](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/30.65).
Penalities for not providing disclosures required by state law vary widely. The California Code provides [for civil penalties up to $5,000](https://california.public.law/codes/ca_health_and_safety_code_section_25400.45) for failure to disclose that a property once contained a methamphetamine lab. But many states have no requirement to disclose if a property has contained a meth lab.
There are many regulations to consider with landlord-tenant law. It’s a good idea to simplify as much of your landlord business as you can, so you’ll have time to monitor the ever-changing regulations. One way to streamline your business is to purchase landlord insurance from Steadily, America’s best rated landlord insurance company.
