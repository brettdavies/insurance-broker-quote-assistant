## What to do immediately after a rideshare accident

A car accident is nerve-racking for anyone, but when you're driving for a rideshare service, you have added responsibilities. Like any accident, your [first steps after a car accident](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident) should focus on safety:

1. **Check for injuries** — look to see if you, your passengers (if any) or people in other vehicles are hurt.
2. **Call 911** — always report the accident to local law enforcement, even if it seems minor. This establishes an official record of the incident, which is important for your claim.
3. **Move vehicles to a safe location** —if your car is still operable, safely move it to the side of the road or another safe spot. Then, activate your hazard lights to alert nearby drivers.

## Gathering information for your rideshare claim

The more accurate and detailed the information you collect at the scene, the potentially smoother your insurance claim process may be. Try to collect:

* **Status on rideshare app** —waiting for a ride request, driving to pick up a passenger or transporting a passenger. Your app status often determines the insurance coverage that applies to the accident.
* **Contact information** —names, phone numbers, and addresses of all drivers, passengers, and anywitnesses.
* **Insurance details** — [insurance company name and policy numbers](/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/electronic-proof-of-insurance) for other drivers involved.
* **Driver's licenses** — [license numbers](/simple-insights/family/what-is-a-real-id) for all involved drivers.
* **License plates** — plates for all vehicles involved.
* **Police report** — ask the responding officer for their name, badge number, and instructions on accessing the accident report.
* **Photographic evidence** — capture photos of damage to vehicles and road conditions.

## Who to notify after a rideshare accident

Reporting the accident quickly is important. Make sure to contact:

1. **Your rideshare company** — report the accident to your rideshare company as required by their procedures. Often, you will be required to contact them through your driver app.
2. **Your personal auto insurance company** —reach out to your auto insurer to inform them of the incident and follow their specific claim reporting process.

## Understanding which auto insurance coverage applies

The insurance coverage applicable after a rideshare accident depends on when the accident occurred relative to your app activity.

App status during accident

Potential liability coverage

Potential coverage for damage to your car

App off (personal use)

Your [personal auto policy](/insurance/auto)

Collision/comprehensive (if included in your personal policy)

App on, waiting for request (Period one)

Rideshare company's limited liability policy

[Rideshare coverage endorsement](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/rideshare-coverage) (if included in your personal policy)

App on, en route to or a passenger is in your vehicle (Period two & three)

Rideshare company’s commercial liability policy

May be covered under your rideshare coverage endorsement (if included in your personal policy)

Be aware that coverage limits and policy details vary between insurance carriers and rideshare companies. To fully understand your liability and auto coverage, always review your policy documents and discuss options with your insurance agent.

## What to expect during the insurance claim process

Once the incident has been reported, your insurance company should contact you and guide the claims process. The insurance company may contact you and other parties to:

* Investigate the accident details using photos, witness accounts and the police report.
* Conduct interviews with drivers, passengers and witnesses (if applicable).
* Assess property damage and injury claims.
* Determine coverage based on driving status during the accident and applicable policies.

Throughout this process, it is helpful to keep records of all related expenses, such as medical bills or repair estimates. These documents will be necessary to support your claim.

## Being prepared for the rideshare claim process

As a rideshare driver, it’s important to know the claim process steps and have the right insurance to help protect yourself and your finances. Rideshare insurance helps protect you and your car during an accident as a rideshare driver.
