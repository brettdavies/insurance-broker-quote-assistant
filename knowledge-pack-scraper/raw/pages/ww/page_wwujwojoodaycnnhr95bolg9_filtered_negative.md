Here are several of the factors that can affect your homeowners insurance premium:[[5]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-5)
In pretty much all New York City boroughs, homeowners need to purchase flood insurance coverage to protect themselves from floods and other water damage. All boroughs across New York City face potential flood damage from severe weather year-round.[[6]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-6)
The good news for homeowners is that the city has 218 firehouses located within its 302 square miles. That means theoretically no home is more than 0.7 miles away from a fire station, which should help lower your premium.[[7]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-7)
Your personal factors can also make a difference to your home insurance rates. Some of these factors include:[[8]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-8)
* **Your credit history:** Insurers consider your credit history when giving you a quote because it may predict the likelihood you’ll file a claim. If your credit improves, you can request your insurer to review your policy and possibly get a lower rate.[[5]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-5)
A homeowners insurance policy in New York City typically covers the following:[[9]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-9)
![Tree-lined suburban street with charming houses, manicured bushes, and vibrant flowers under a clear blue sky.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/74630e4f0d/nyc-suburbs.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Flood insurance is mandatory for New York City homeowners who live in a Special Flood Hazard Area, have a federally backed mortgage, or have received federal disaster help.[[10]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-10)
But even the New Yorkers who don’t have to buy flood insurance probably should. As of right now, 1.3 million New Yorkers live in or near a floodplain, and it only takes one inch of water to cause roughly $25,000 worth of water damage.[[11]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-11)
