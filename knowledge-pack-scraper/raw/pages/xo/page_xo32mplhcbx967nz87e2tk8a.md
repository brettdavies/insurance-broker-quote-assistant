When calculating your motorcycle insurance rates, companies consider your bike's:
  * **Value:** More expensive motorbikes cost more to repair and replace. For that reason, insurance companies charge more for [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") on these bikes. 
  * **Safety features:** Bikes with more safety features, like anti-lock brakes, are less likely to be in an accident. That generally makes them cheaper to insure. 
  * **Crash rate:** Certain motorcycle models and styles have more accidents than others. If the type of bike you own is often in accidents, companies will assume you're more likely to file a claim. 
  * **Theft rate:** Insurance companies usually charge more to protect [bikes that are often stolen](https://www.valuepenguin.com/motor-vehicle-theft-statistics "Motor Vehicle Theft Statistics") with comprehensive insurance. That's because there's a higher chance the company will have to pay out a claim. For this reason, flashy and expensive bikes with higher theft rates are more expensive to insure. 


## How do I lower my motorbike insurance cost?
If you're looking to lower the cost of your motorcycle insurance, you should shop around for the cheapest rate, qualify for as many discounts as you can and adjust your coverage.

**[Compare motorcycle insurance quotes from multiple companies.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-motorcycle-insurance "Compare Motorcycle Insurance Quotes")**
There's a difference of $33 per month between the most and least expensive motorcycle insurance companies nationally. The number may be even higher in your state. That's why you should always shop for rates from multiple companies before buying a motorcycle insurance policy.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/piggy-bank)
**Qualify for motorcycle insurance discounts.** Most companies offer bikers a variety of ways to lower their motorcycle insurance rates.
You can typically save by [bundling your motorcycle policy with auto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-motorcycle-insurance-bundle "How to Save on Car and Motorcycle Insurance by Bundling") or home insurance. You can also usually lower your rates by taking a motorcycle safety course or installing an anti-theft device on your bike.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/filter)
**Adjust your coverage.** You can sometimes save a lot of money by adjusting your motorcycle insurance coverage, especially if there are add-ons that you don't need.
**For example, if your bike is older, it may not be worth it to have[comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** And if you have another vehicle or easy access to public transportation, you probably don't need  rental car reimbursement.
**If you have comprehensive and collision coverage, you can also consider raising your deductible.** A higher deductible typically leads to lower monthly payments. That's because your insurance company will pay less money if you're in a crash. However, it's important to choose a deductible you can afford to pay after an accident, especially if your bike is your only way to get around.
