As discussed in our prior Legal Updates,[1](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn1) in late 2023, California enacted a landmark set of climate-related disclosure laws—collectively referred to as the “California Climate Accountability Package”[2](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn2) —comprising:
* **SB 253** (_Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act_), requiring disclosures of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and
* **SB 261** (_Climate-Related Financial Risk Act_), requiring disclosures of climate-related financial risks.
As a reminder, SB 253 and SB 261,[3](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn3) each of which was amended by SB 219,[4](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn4) impose climate-related corporate disclosure requirements as follows:
* **Virtual Public Workshops:** CARB hosted two virtual public workshops (CARB Workshops) for SB 253 and SB 261, including to solicit further public feedback. These were held on May 29, 2025 (First Workshop)[5](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn5) and August 21 (Second Workshop).[6](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn6) During the First Workshop, CARB offered more conceptual and preliminary options, whereas, during the Second Workshop, CARB had incorporated stakeholder feedback received in connection with the First Workshop and offered more refined and concrete proposals for ongoing stakeholder feedback. The public comment period for such proposals concluded on September 11.
* **Responses to Frequently Asked Questions:** On July 9, CARB published an FAQ document titled [_California Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting and Climate-Related Financial Risk Disclosure Programs: Frequently Asked Questions Related to Regulatory Development and Initial Reports_](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/FAQs%20Regarding%20California%20Climate%20Disclosure%20Requirements_ver1.pdf) (the FAQs Guide). The FAQs Guide is designed to assist companies potentially subject to SB 253 and SB 261 navigate the regulatory development process, better understand applicability and identify initial steps toward compliance.
* **SB 261 Compliance Checklist:** On September 2, CARB published a [draft compliance checklist](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/Climate%20Related%20Financial%20Risk%20Report%20Checklist.pdf) (the SB 261 Checklist) for SB 261. The SB 261 Checklist offers guidance on reporting frameworks, disclosure content and procedural requirements, with the goal of supporting transparent, decision-useful reporting for investors and other stakeholders.
* **SB 253 Reporting Templates:** On October 10, CARB published its [Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions Draft Reporting Template](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fww2.arb.ca.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2025-10%2FSB253_Draft_Scope1_2_GHG_Template.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) (the SB 253 Template), as well as the related [memo](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-10/Draft%20Memo_Scope1%262TemplatePublicRelease.pdf) (the SB 253 Template Memo) providing guidance on how to use the SB 253 Template. CARB has solicited stakeholder feedback with respect to both the SB 253 Template and the SB 253 Template Memo, which feedback may be submitted through a [public docket](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/public-comments/draft-reporting-template-scope-1-and-scope-2-ghg-emissions). The deadline to provide feedback is October 27, 2025.
* **SB 253**: CARB has proposed **June 30, 2026** as the initial deadline for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosure. The initial deadline for Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosure would begin in 2027, with the exact date to be determined.
The initial proposal by CARB was to use the definition of “doing business” set forth in the California Revenue and Tax Code (RTC) Section 23101 with some modifications. This definition of “doing business” sets a low threshold that would bring companies with minimal ties to California within scope, with an entity considered to be doing business if it, for example, “engage[s] in any transaction for the purpose of financial gain within California” or exceeds minimal sales, property or payroll thresholds, with the 2024 thresholds being $735,019, $73,502 and $73,502, respectively.[7](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn7)
* **Defining Parent-Subsidiary Relationships:** During the First Workshop, CARB had initially proposed adopting a definition of parent-subsidiary relationships that builds off of the Cap-and-Trade[8](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn8) program’s concept of “corporate association,” which requires disclosure of certain corporate relationships based on certain “indicia of ownership interest or control.” This proposal considered the following to define parent-subsidiary relationships:
* The company is considered a subsidiary of another where the parent or holding company owns more than 50% of its voting stock.
* The subsidiary has a different legal entity name than its parent or holding company.
* The parent or holding company has a controlling interest in its subsidiary and therefore is able to influence the subsidiary’s operations, management and financial decisions.
Subject to further refinement from CARB’s forthcoming implementing regulations, the expectation is that parent companies would not automatically be brought into scope of SB 253 and SB 261 merely because one of their subsidiaries is subject to one or both of these laws. In other words, in order to be a covered entity subject to one or both of SB 253 and/or SB 261, such entity must itself meet the relevant revenue thresholds, be a US entity and be considered to be doing business in California. That said, CARB has clarified that reporting under SB 253 and SB 261 may be consolidated at that parent level such that a parent company may report on behalf of its covered subsidiaries.
* **Defining “Revenue”:** CARB’s treatment of “revenue” has shifted as it worked through stakeholder feedback. Initially, CARB proposed defining “revenue” by reference to the definition of “gross receipts” under RTC Section 25120(f)(2). CARB invited stakeholder input, including on whether this definition was consistent with prevailing business practices, how it should be applied in the parent-subsidiary context, and whether alternative definitions of “revenue” should be considered for purposes of SB 253 and SB 261.
* The legislative history for SB 253 and SB 261 suggested the number of potentially covered entities to be quite significant—5,344 for SB 253, and 10,000+ for SB 261.
* However, during the Second Workshop, CARB suggested that the proposed revisions to key elements defining which entities would be covered by these climate-related disclosure laws would significantly reduce the number of entities potentially within scope—2,596 for SB 253 and 4,160 for SB 261.
As noted above, in connection with publishing the Preliminary CARB List, CARB reiterated that potentially covered entities are responsible for compliance with SB 253 and SB 261, even if such entities are not included on the Preliminary CARB List. CARB also requested [stakeholder feedback to the Preliminary CARB List](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/0893ede53c234aac8d5334df0f091f36?portalUrl=https://gis.carb.arb.ca.gov/portal). It would be prudent to submit survey feedback sooner rather than later to potentially inform CARB’s rulemaking process. However, there’s no official cutoff date announced for the survey itself.
* **Template Disclosures:** As noted above, on October 10, 2025, CARB published the SB 253 Template, as well as the SB 253 Template Memo to guide the use of the SB 253 Template. Covered entities are not required to use the SB 253 Template, with its use being voluntary for the initial reporting cycle in 2026.
The SB 253 Template is organized into several sections, including the following: (a) organization information, (b) third-party verification, (c) inventory boundary, (d) Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosure, (e) methodology, (f) de minimis / minor sources, (g) California MRR (i.e., California Mandatory Reporting Regulation) fields (if applicable) and (h) emissions reductions (if applicable). The SB 253 Template also includes optional fields for future reporting years, such as base year emissions, which are intended to support intraorganizational comparisons and provide greater transparency.
* _Emissions Intensity Metrics_: Covered entities can provide at least one intensity or efficiency ratio (e.g., emissions per $1 million in revenue). These ratios allow stakeholders to compare performance between companies of varying sizes and across different industries.
* _Industry Classification_: Covered entities can categorize their GHG emissions using the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, enabling consistent sector-based analysis.
* _Transparency in Methods_: Covered entities can identify the source and year of Global Warming Potential (GWP) values and emissions factors and provide a brief description of the calculation method used.
* _Alignment with the California MRR_: Covered entities can include California MRR facility identification numbers, which ensure alignment of data with CARB’s other regulatory databases.
* **Enforcement Discretion:** CARB will allow companies to use existing data for the first reporting cycle and will exercise enforcement discretion[9](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/10/california-climate-disclosure-laws--countdown-to-disclosure-what-companies-need-to-know-about-reporting-deadlines-carb-guidance-and-ongoing-litigation#_edn9) to accommodate companies needing time to implement new data collection processes.
* Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Final Report (2017) or any successor framework;
* International Financial Reporting Standards Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S2); or
* Other frameworks developed in accordance with regulated exchanges, national governments or US federal regulations.
* _Governance_: Describe the covered entity’s governance framework for managing climate-related financial risk, including board and management oversight.
* _Strategy_: Identify short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities, and explain how these affect the covered entity’s operations, business strategy and financial planning (where material).
* _Risk Management_: Explain the process used to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks and how those considerations and processes are integrated into the covered entity’s overall risk management.
* _Metrics and Targets_: Disclose the metrics and targets used to evaluate and manage material climate-related risks and opportunities, including measures adopted to mitigate and adapt to those risks.
* _Qualitative Scenario Analysis_: CARB encourages the use of climate scenarios to inform strategic disclosures. Scenario analysis may be qualitative or quantitative, reflecting stakeholder feedback that quantitative modeling may be duplicative of SB 253 requirements or unduly burdensome.
* _Consolidated Reporting_: A subsidiary is not required to file a separate SB 261 report if its parent company reports on its behalf. Consolidated, parent-level reporting is permitted.
* _GHG Emissions Disclosures_: While some reporting frameworks include Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions metrics, CARB confirmed that GHG emissions disclosures are not required for the initial SB 261 reporting period, acknowledging stakeholder feedback regarding potential overlap with SB 253 reporting requirements and data availability constraints.
* _Data Source_: For initial reports, covered entities should rely on the most recent and best available data, whether based on calendar year or fiscal year reporting, to ensure consistency and verifiability.
* **Enforcement Discretion:** CARB did not initially address enforcement discretion for SB 261’s initial reporting year in its Enforcement Notice, issued on December 5, 2024 relating to SB 253. However, in the FAQs Guide, CARB emphasized a practical, phased approach to compliance, recognizing the need for lead time and the use of best available information for initial reports. CARB noted that it would consider good faith efforts to comply in enforcement decisions, particularly during the initial implementation period.
* During the Second Workshop, CARB proposed a flat annual fee structure of $3,106 for SB 253 and $1,403 for SB 261, with covered entities over $1 billion in revenue paying both fees.
During the First Workshop, and despite the delay in issuing implementing regulations (which CARB suggested would not be issued until the end of 2025), the sponsors of SB 253 and SB 261—Senators Scott Wiener and Henry Stern—confirmed that the initial reporting deadlines would not be delayed.
* Review the Preliminary CARB List to determine whether the company or its parent or subsidiaries have been identified.
* Verify annual global revenue and assess whether the company is “doing business” in California under CARB’s proposed definitions.
* Identify covered entities and subsidiaries under CARB’s proposed ownership threshold or control test and determine whether reporting will be consolidated.
* Establish or enhance board and management oversight of climate-related disclosures, with clear allocation of responsibilities.
* Integrate climate oversight into existing governance and risk management frameworks.
* Strengthen internal controls and train teams on data integrity, evidence gathering and assurance readiness.
* Align legal, finance, sustainability and communications functions to ensure consistent, compliant disclosures.
* Formalize internal processes for preparation, review and validation of disclosures under SB 253 and/or SB 261.
* Map and validate data sources for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions.
* Align methodologies with the GHG Protocol.
* Engage assurance providers early to prepare for limited assurance disclosures in 2026 and reasonable assurance by 2030.
* Select a reporting framework (e.g., TCFD or IFRS S2) and identify gaps across the four pillars: (a) governance, (b) strategy, (c) risk management and (d) metrics and targets.
* Conduct or update a climate risk assessment, considering both transition and physical risks.
* Integrate scenario analysis (qualitative or quantitative) into strategic planning and financial modeling.
* Develop a disclosure and communications plan for investors and other stakeholders.

AB 1305, which is already in effect, is not discussed in this Legal Update. For additional information on AB 1305, see our prior Legal Update, _[New California Anti-Greenwashing Law Goes Live on January 1, 2024 – What You Need to Know if You Make Certain “Green” Claims](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2023/12/new-california-antigreenwashing-law-goes-live-on-january-1-2024--what-you-need-to-know-if-you-make-certain-green-claims)_, dated December 7, 2023.

For additional information regarding SB 219, see our February 2025 Update.

While this bill amends both SB 253 and SB 261, it does not directly affect potentially covered entities. Rather, this bill is a budget-related bill that, among other things, streamlines the CARB rulemaking process by exempting CARB regulations under SB 253 and SB 261 from review under the California Environmental Quality Act.
