* **Value:** More expensive motorbikes cost more to repair and replace. For that reason, insurance companies charge more for [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") on these bikes.
* **Theft rate:** Insurance companies usually charge more to protect [bikes that are often stolen](https://www.valuepenguin.com/motor-vehicle-theft-statistics "Motor Vehicle Theft Statistics") with comprehensive insurance. That's because there's a higher chance the company will have to pay out a claim. For this reason, flashy and expensive bikes with higher theft rates are more expensive to insure.

You can typically save by [bundling your motorcycle policy with auto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-motorcycle-insurance-bundle "How to Save on Car and Motorcycle Insurance by Bundling") or home insurance.

**For example, if your bike is older, it may not be worth it to have[comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** And if you have another vehicle or easy access to public transportation, you probably don't need  rental car reimbursement.
