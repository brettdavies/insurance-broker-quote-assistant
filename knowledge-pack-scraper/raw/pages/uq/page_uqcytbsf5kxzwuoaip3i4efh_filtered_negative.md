![The Statute of Limitations for Property Damage Claims in Texas](https://grishamkendall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Statute-of-Limitations-for-Property-Damage-Claims-in-Texas.jpg)
* Discovery Rule: If the damage was not and could not reasonably have been discovered within the standard limitation period, the discovery rule may apply. This rule allows the statute of limitations to begin running from the date the damage is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered, rather than the date it actually occurred.
* Minor Plaintiffs: If the person who suffered the property damage is a minor (under the age of 18), the statute of limitations doesn’t begin until they turn 18. They would have until their 20th birthday to file a lawsuit.
* Fraud: If the property damage was caused due to fraud or concealment where the responsible party hid the damage or the fact that they caused it, the limitations period may be extended. The clock would start when the injured party discovered the fraud.
* Tolling Agreements: Parties can mutually agree to “toll” or pause the statute of limitations for a negotiated period of time. This is usually done to give more time to negotiate a settlement without filing a lawsuit.
* Judicial Tolling: In rare cases, the statute of limitations may be tolled due to judicial intervention, where circumstances like a legal disability or absence from the state prevent the plaintiff from filing a lawsuit.
* Less than $100: Class C misdemeanor, fine up to $500.
* $100-$750: Class B misdemeanor, up to 180 days in jail, $2,000 fine.
* $750-$2,500: Class A misdemeanor, up to 1 year in jail, $4,000 fine.
* $2,500-$30,000: State jail felony, 180 days to 2 years in jail, $10,000 fine.
* $30,000-$150,000: Third-degree felony, 2 to 10 years in prison, $10,000 fine.
* $150,000-$300,000: Second-degree felony, 2 to 20 years in prison, $10,000 fine.
* More than $300,000: First-degree felony, 5 to 99 years in prison, $10,000 fine.
In Texas, arson is a felony charge that involves intentionally starting a[ fire ](https://grishamkendall.com/fire-and-smoke-damage/)or causing an explosion to damage or destroy property. The severity of arson charges varies from state jail felonies to first-degree felonies, influenced by intent to harm, defraud, or if the act led to bodily injury or endangerment of life. A first-degree felony, which includes cases causing injury or involving critical structures, can lead to life imprisonment, reflecting the risk arson poses.
