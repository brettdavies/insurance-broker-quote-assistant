![The Statute of Limitations for Property Damage Claims in Texas](https://grishamkendall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Statute-of-Limitations-for-Property-Damage-Claims-in-Texas.jpg)
# The Statute of Limitations for Property Damage Claims in Texas
## The Statute of Limitations for Property Damage Claims in Texas 
### What is the statute of limitations on property damage claims in Texas?
The Texas statute of limitations for property damage claims is two years. This means you have two years from the date the damage occurred to file a lawsuit seeking damages for harm to property. This limitation applies to claims involving damage caused by negligence, accidents, or intentional acts leading to property damage. Keep aware of this deadline because once the Texas property damage statute of limitations expires, you lose the right to file a lawsuit to recover damages.
### What is the 1 year statute of limitations in Texas?
The Texas statute of limitations for property damage claims is two years; however, there is a specific context where a 1 year statute of limitations could apply to property-related issues. This shorter timeframe applies to insurance claims, particularly regarding homeowner’s insurance. Insurance policies require that any lawsuits against the insurance company for failure to pay a claim must be filed within one year of the date of the damage or loss occurrence. This is often stipulated in the contract details of the insurance policy rather than being a state law. It is important to review your specific insurance policy terms or consult with an attorney to understand the applicable deadlines for filing claims or lawsuits related to property damage under their insurance coverage.
### Can I sue for property damage in Texas?
You can sue for property damage in Texas. If your property has been damaged due to someone else’s actions, negligence, or failure to act, you have the legal right to seek compensation. You can sue for various types of damages, including the cost to repair or replace damaged property, loss of use, and in some cases, reduction in value if the property cannot be fully restored to its original condition.
### How to sue someone for property damage in Texas
To win a property damage lawsuit, you need to prove the damage was caused by another party’s negligence or wrongful action. You must demonstrate the party had a duty to prevent the damage, breached that duty, and as a result, caused your property to be damaged. If the amount of damage is under $10,000, consider filing your lawsuit in small claims court. This option is quicker and less expensive than other courts.
Given the complexities of legal claims, consulting with an attorney who specializes in property law can be very beneficial. An attorney can assess your case, navigate the legal system, and maximize your chance of winning. Taking legal action for property damage involves understanding your rights, the nature of the damage, and the circumstances under which the damage occurred. Gather all relevant information and documentation to support your case.
### Exceptions to statute of limitations in Texas
While the general statute of limitations for property damage claims is two years in Texas, some exceptions may extend or alter this period. Some exceptions include:
  * Discovery Rule: If the damage was not and could not reasonably have been discovered within the standard limitation period, the discovery rule may apply. This rule allows the statute of limitations to begin running from the date the damage is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered, rather than the date it actually occurred.
  * Minor Plaintiffs: If the person who suffered the property damage is a minor (under the age of 18), the statute of limitations doesn’t begin until they turn 18. They would have until their 20th birthday to file a lawsuit.
  * Fraud: If the property damage was caused due to fraud or concealment where the responsible party hid the damage or the fact that they caused it, the limitations period may be extended. The clock would start when the injured party discovered the fraud.
  * Tolling Agreements: Parties can mutually agree to “toll” or pause the statute of limitations for a negotiated period of time. This is usually done to give more time to negotiate a settlement without filing a lawsuit.
  * Judicial Tolling: In rare cases, the statute of limitations may be tolled due to judicial intervention, where circumstances like a legal disability or absence from the state prevent the plaintiff from filing a lawsuit.


Consult with your lawyer to understand how exceptions apply to your specific situation because it could potentially extend the time you have to initiate legal action.
### Property damage charges in Texas
Property damage charges in Texas depend on the extent of the damage:
#### Criminal Mischief:
Criminal mischief involves the intentional or reckless damage to someone else’s property, which includes acts of vandalism, graffiti, or destruction. Property damage due to criminal mischief falls under the umbrella of property law rather than personal injury law. Legal actions for property damage attempt to recover the cost of repairs or replacement of the damaged property.
  * Less than $100: Class C misdemeanor, fine up to $500.
  * $100-$750: Class B misdemeanor, up to 180 days in jail, $2,000 fine.
  * $750-$2,500: Class A misdemeanor, up to 1 year in jail, $4,000 fine.
  * $2,500-$30,000: State jail felony, 180 days to 2 years in jail, $10,000 fine.
  * $30,000-$150,000: Third-degree felony, 2 to 10 years in prison, $10,000 fine.
  * $150,000-$300,000: Second-degree felony, 2 to 20 years in prison, $10,000 fine.
  * More than $300,000: First-degree felony, 5 to 99 years in prison, $10,000 fine.


#### Reckless Damage or Destruction:
A reckless damage or destruction charge in Texas is a Class C misdemeanor applied when someone unintentionally causes damage to the property of another through careless actions. It addresses situations where a person, without deliberate intent to cause harm, nonetheless acts in a reckless manner that results in property damage. This charge doesn’t carry the possibility of jail time but can result in a fine up to $500. The charge indicates the legal responsibility people have to avoid negligently causing harm to others’ property.
#### Arson:
In Texas, arson is a felony charge that involves intentionally starting a[ fire ](https://grishamkendall.com/fire-and-smoke-damage/)or causing an explosion to damage or destroy property. The severity of arson charges varies from state jail felonies to first-degree felonies, influenced by intent to harm, defraud, or if the act led to bodily injury or endangerment of life. A first-degree felony, which includes cases causing injury or involving critical structures, can lead to life imprisonment, reflecting the risk arson poses.
### How much property damage is a felony in Texas?
Property damage exceeding $2,500 up to and beyond $300,000 is a felony in Texas, which includes anywhere from 180 days to 99 years in prison and a potential fine of $10,000.
