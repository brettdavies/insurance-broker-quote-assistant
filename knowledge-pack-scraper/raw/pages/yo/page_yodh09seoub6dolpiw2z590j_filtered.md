# Trailer insurance coverage

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

Talk with your agent to review insurance options for your utility trailer.

## Should you consider insurance for a trailer?

Utility trailer insurance is often overlooked because trailers are hitched to a towing vehicle. In some situations, that vehicle's insurance may not automatically extend coverage to the trailer.

A business or farm utility trailer can be a key tool for some businesses and farms because they offer versatility in hauling. They are used for a variety of jobs such as:

* Hauling tools, materials and equipment to and from job sites
* Delivering and transporting goods for sale to individuals or businesses
* Hauling livestock or agricultural supplies and equipment

Checking your coverage before the unexpected happens may be key. Unfortunately, many trailer owners discover they needed a trailer policy only after a loss occurred.

## Trailer coverage considerations

A key point to keep in mind when gathering information about trailer insurance is that in many cases physical damage coverage on the trailer is optional. However, liability coverage may be required to help provide coverage for damages if caused by the unhitched trailer.

A State Farm® agent can review these points with you, help find proper coverage for your needs and provide you with a quote for trailer insurance costs.

When talking to your agent, here is some information to have available to help get a more accurate quote:

* What type of trailer is it?
* What is the Gross Weight of the trailer?
  + Gross Weight is the weight of the trailer plus the maximum weight it's designed to carry.
* What is the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the trailer?
* What is the primary use of the trailer?
* Does the trailer have any attached equipment?
  + If yes, then describe the equipment and provide the MSRP of the equipment.
* What type of vehicle primarily pulls the trailer?

## Trailer coverage options available

Some physical damage coverages offered by State Farm include [Collision](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage), [Comprehensive](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) and [Emergency road service](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) (some restrictions apply to road-side assistance).

For liability coverages, State Farm offers [Bodily Injury liability coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), [Property Damage liability coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), Personal Injury Protection and/or Medical Payments Coverage.

### Coverage for the trailer's contents

A trailer policy is usually for the trailer itself. Check with your insurance company if you want to learn what kind of coverage may apply for any contents being hauled by a trailer. In some cases, personal contents may have insurance coverage available as part of a [homeowners](/insurance/homeowners) or [renters](/insurance/renters) policy or an [inland marine policy](/small-business-solutions/insurance/inland-marine-mobile-property) can be purchased to help insure business property.
