Uninsured Motorist Claims Lawyer In New York City[Thomas Robertson](https://www.kalawyer.com/learn/author/thomaseclipselegalmarketing-com/ "Posts by Thomas Robertson")2025-04-13T19:49:31+00:00
Dealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be overwhelming, especially when the at-fault driver lacks insurance coverage. In New York City, where busy streets and heavy traffic are part of daily life, uninsured motorist claims are unfortunately common. If you’ve been injured in an accident caused by an uninsured driver, understanding your rights and options is critical to securing the compensation you need for your recovery; an uninsured motorist claims lawyer can help.
At [**Koenigsberg & Associates Law Offices**](https://www.kalawyer.com/), we are dedicated to helping accident victims navigate the complexities of uninsured motorist claims. With decades of experience and a commitment to personalized legal representation, our team works tirelessly to protect your rights and maximize your recovery. Let us guide you through this challenging process and help you move forward with confidence.
## **What Is an Uninsured Motorist Claim?**
An uninsured motorist (UM) claim is a type of insurance claim that allows you to seek compensation through your own auto insurance policy when the at-fault driver does not have liability coverage. In New York, insurance companies are required to offer uninsured motorist coverage, which provides protection for accidents involving uninsured drivers or hit-and-run incidents.
Uninsured motorist coverage can help pay for medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages caused by the accident. However, filing a UM claim can be a complex process, and insurance companies may attempt to minimize payouts. This is where having an experienced uninsured motorist claims lawyer is essential.
## **How Uninsured Motorist Coverage Works in New York**
Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is a critical safety net required by law in all New York auto insurance policies. This coverage is designed to protect individuals who are involved in accidents with drivers who lack the necessary liability insurance or in situations where the at-fault party cannot be identified.
When the at-fault driver in an accident does not carry liability insurance, uninsured motorist coverage steps in to cover your losses. These losses can include medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages caused by the accident. Without UM coverage, victims in these situations would likely face significant financial burdens, as there would be no other insurance policy to turn to for compensation.
In addition to accidents involving uninsured drivers, UM coverage also applies in hit-and-run scenarios. These incidents are all too common in a busy urban environment like New York City, where drivers may flee the scene of an accident to avoid legal consequences. If the responsible party cannot be identified, uninsured motorist coverage allows you to file a claim with your own insurance company to recover damages.
By law, every auto insurance policy issued in New York includes uninsured motorist coverage, providing peace of mind to drivers and passengers alike. However, the process of filing a UM claim can still be fraught with challenges, particularly when dealing with insurance companies that may attempt to limit or deny payouts. Understanding how this coverage works is essential to ensuring that you can access the compensation you are entitled to in the aftermath of an accident involving an uninsured or unknown driver.

## **Why You Need an Uninsured Motorist Claims Lawyer**
Pursuing an uninsured motorist claim can be a daunting and complex process. Insurance companies often prioritize their profits over providing fair compensation, leaving victims feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed. An experienced uninsured motorist claims lawyer can provide the expertise and advocacy you need to secure the compensation you deserve.
### **Initial Consultation**
[The process begins with an initial consultation with an experienced uninsured motorist claims lawyer](https://www.kalawyer.com/contact-us/). During this meeting, you will provide details about your accident, including how it occurred, the extent of your injuries, and any available evidence. Your attorney will review your insurance policy to determine the coverage available under your uninsured motorist protection and discuss your legal options.
### **Understanding Your Insurance Policy**
Uninsured motorist claims often involve deciphering complex insurance policies that contain intricate language and potential exclusions. An experienced attorney will carefully review your policy to identify all available coverage, ensuring that no potential benefits are overlooked. By understanding your policy’s nuances, your lawyer can position your claim for maximum recovery.
### **Gathering Critical Evidence**
[Evidence is the foundation of any successful uninsured motorist claim](https://www.kalawyer.com/learn/how-to-strengthen-your-personal-injury-claim/). Your lawyer will gather accident reports, medical records, photographs, and witness statements to substantiate your case. This evidence not only establishes the validity of your claim but also demonstrates the full extent of your damages, making it harder for insurers to undervalue your case.
### **Negotiating with Insurance Companies**
Dealing with insurance adjusters can be intimidating, as they are trained to minimize payouts. A skilled lawyer will handle all communication with the insurance company, sparing you from the stress of negotiations. They will leverage their expertise to push back against lowball offers and work to secure a settlement that accurately reflects your losses, including medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress.
### **Taking Your Case to Court**
In some cases, insurance companies refuse to offer a fair settlement. When this happens, your attorney will be prepared to take your claim to court. This involves filing a lawsuit, presenting evidence, and advocating on your behalf before a judge or jury. The willingness to litigate often strengthens your position, as insurers recognize the potential risks of going to trial against a skilled legal team.
At Koenigsberg & Associates, we are committed to protecting your rights and ensuring that you receive the compensation you deserve. By entrusting your uninsured motorist claim to our experienced team, you gain a dedicated advocate who will guide you through every step of the process and fight tirelessly on your behalf.
## **Common Challenges in Uninsured Motorist Claims**
Pursuing an uninsured motorist claim can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with uncooperative insurance companies or complicated legal procedures. From disputes over the value of your claim to proving the at-fault driver’s lack of insurance, numerous obstacles can hinder your ability to secure compensation. Understanding these challenges is essential to navigating the process effectively and protecting your rights.
### **Disputes Over the Value of Your Claim**
Insurance companies often attempt to minimize payouts by questioning the severity of your injuries or the extent of your damages. They may challenge medical records, undervalue pain and suffering, or dispute lost wages to reduce the compensation you receive. These tactics can delay your financial recovery and add stress to an already difficult situation.
### **Delays or Denials of Coverage**
One of the most common challenges in uninsured motorist claims is the insurance company delaying the processing of your claim or outright denying coverage. These delays can exacerbate financial strain as victims struggle to cover mounting medical bills and other expenses. Denials often occur under questionable reasoning, leaving victims uncertain about their next steps.
### **Proving the At-Fault Driver Was Uninsured**
[Demonstrating that the other driver lacked liability insurance can be a complex and time-sensitive process](https://www.kalawyer.com/learn/4-basic-elements-of-negligence-in-a-personal-injury-claim/). Insurance companies may require accident reports, witness statements, or correspondence from the at-fault driver’s insurer verifying their lack of coverage. Gathering and presenting this evidence without professional assistance can be overwhelming for accident victims.
### **Challenges in Hit-and-Run Cases**
In hit-and-run accidents, proving that the incident occurred and identifying the responsible party can be particularly difficult. Insurance companies often require substantial evidence, such as police reports, photos from the scene, and statements from witnesses. Without proper documentation, victims may struggle to validate their claims and access compensation.
At Koenigsberg & Associates, we understand the complexities of uninsured motorist claims and are committed to overcoming these challenges on your behalf. Our experienced team will advocate for your rights, gather critical evidence, and ensure your claim is handled efficiently. Let us guide you through this process and fight to secure the compensation you deserve.
## **Steps to Take After an Accident with an Uninsured Driver**
Being involved in an accident with an uninsured driver can be a stressful and confusing experience. However, taking the right steps in the aftermath of the collision can help protect your rights and strengthen your uninsured motorist claim. Proper documentation, timely communication, and professional legal guidance are essential to ensuring that you receive the compensation you deserve.
### **Seek Immediate Medical Attention**
Your health and safety should always be your first priority after an accident. Even if your injuries seem minor, seek medical attention immediately to ensure that no hidden injuries go untreated. Medical documentation is also crucial for building your claim, as it provides evidence of the injuries sustained and their connection to the accident.
### **Report the Accident to the Police**
[Filing a police report is an essential step in documenting the accident](https://www.kalawyer.com/learn/why-its-very-helpful-to-have-a-police-report-after-a-crash/). The police report serves as an official record of the collision, detailing important information such as the circumstances of the accident, statements from involved parties, and any citations issued. Be sure to obtain a copy of the report for your records, as it will be a critical piece of evidence for your claim.
### **Notify Your Insurance Company**
Inform your insurance company about the accident as soon as possible. While it is important to report the incident, avoid providing detailed statements or admitting fault until you have consulted with a lawyer. Insurance adjusters may attempt to use your statements against you to reduce or deny your claim.
### **Document the Scene of the Accident**
Thorough documentation of the accident scene can strengthen your case. Take photos of the damage to your vehicle, road conditions, traffic signals, and any visible injuries. If there are witnesses, collect their contact information and statements, as their accounts may support your version of events.
### **Consult an Uninsured Motorist Claims Lawyer**
Dealing with an uninsured driver adds complexity to an already challenging situation. Consulting with an experienced uninsured motorist claims lawyer ensures that your rights are protected and that you receive guidance throughout the process. Your lawyer will handle communication with the insurance company, gather evidence, and advocate for the compensation you deserve.
Taking these steps after an accident with an uninsured driver can make a significant difference in the outcome of your claim. At Koenigsberg & Associates, we are here to guide you through this process and fight for your rights every step of the way.

## **Types of Compensation Available**
Uninsured motorist claims offer a crucial safety net for victims of accidents involving uninsured drivers. By filing a claim, you can pursue compensation to address the financial, physical, and emotional burdens caused by the accident. Understanding the types of compensation available can help you ensure that all your damages are accounted for and adequately addressed.
### **Medical Expenses**
One of the primary components of an uninsured motorist claim is compensation for medical expenses. This includes coverage for emergency room visits, surgeries, hospital stays, medications, physical therapy, and any ongoing or future medical care required due to your injuries. It ensures that you receive the necessary care to recover from your injuries. Severe accidents can lead to long-term medical needs, such as rehabilitation or specialized treatments. Your claim should reflect these anticipated costs to ensure comprehensive care.
### **Lost Wages and Diminished Earning Capacity**
If your injuries prevent you from working, either temporarily or permanently, you may be entitled to recover lost wages. This can be done through your uninsured motorist claim. For individuals who suffer long-term disabilities that limit their ability to work or reduce their earning potential, compensation can also account for diminished earning capacity. This helps to address the financial impact of these limitations on your future income. This ensures that your financial stability is protected despite the challenges caused by the accident.
### **Pain and Suffering**
Beyond financial losses, uninsured motorist claims can provide compensation for the physical pain and emotional trauma experienced as a result of the accident. This coverage helps you recover from the non-financial consequences of the incident.[ Pain and suffering damages](https://www.kalawyer.com/learn/how-to-calculate-pain-suffering-damages-in-new-york/) address the impact of your injuries on your quality of life, including chronic pain, emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and the loss of enjoyment of activities you once valued. These damages acknowledge the non-economic toll the accident has taken on your well-being.
### **Property Damage**
Compensation for property damage covers the repair or replacement of your vehicle and any personal belongings damaged in the accident. This may include items such as electronics, clothing, or other valuables that were inside the vehicle at the time of the collision. Your claim can help compensate for these losses as well. Ensuring that these losses are accounted for can alleviate additional financial stress as you work toward recovery.
An uninsured motorist claim provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the various damages you have suffered. By working with an experienced lawyer, you can ensure that all aspects of your claim are thoroughly evaluated. This will maximize the compensation available to help you recover and rebuild. At Koenigsberg & Associates, we are dedicated to helping you secure the financial support you need to move forward with confidence. Contact us today to discuss your case and explore your legal options.
## **Frequently Asked Questions About Uninsured Motorist Claims**
### **What Should I Do If the At-Fault Driver Leaves the Scene?**
If the at-fault driver flees the scene of the accident, it is considered a hit-and-run. You should immediately report the accident to the police and obtain a copy of the police report. This report will be critical for your uninsured motorist claim. Be sure to document as much information as possible about the fleeing vehicle. Include details such as its color, make, model, and license plate (if available). Contacting an experienced uninsured motorist claims lawyer can help ensure your claim is properly handled.
### **How Long Do I Have to File an Uninsured Motorist Claim?**
In New York, the statute of limitations for uninsured motorist claims generally follows the same timeline as other personal injury claims. This timeline is three years from the date of the accident. However, insurance policies often impose much shorter deadlines for reporting claims. It’s essential to notify your insurance company promptly and consult a lawyer to ensure all deadlines are met.
### **Can I File an Uninsured Motorist Claim If I Was a Passenger?**
Yes, passengers injured in an accident with an uninsured driver can file a claim under the driver’s uninsured motorist coverage. They can also file under their own policy, depending on the circumstances. An attorney can review your options and help determine the best course of action to pursue compensation for your injuries.
### **What Happens If My Insurance Company Denies My Claim?**
Insurance companies may deny claims for various reasons. For example, they may dispute the severity of your injuries or argue that the at-fault driver was not uninsured. If your claim is denied, a lawyer can help you challenge the decision. A lawyer can present additional evidence, negotiate with the insurer, or file a lawsuit if necessary.
### **Can I Recover Compensation for a Hit-and-Run Accident on Foot or Bicycle?**
Yes, uninsured motorist coverage can apply to pedestrians and bicyclists injured in hit-and-run accidents. If you are hit by a car as a pedestrian or cyclist and the driver cannot be identified, your uninsured motorist coverage may compensate you. This coverage may help with medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.
### **What if I Was Partially at Fault for the Accident?**
New York follows a comparative negligence rule. This means you can still recover compensation even if you were partially at fault for the accident. However, your compensation may be reduced by the percentage of your fault. For example, if you are found 20% at fault, your compensation will be reduced by 20%. A lawyer can help minimize the impact of shared fault on your claim.
### **Do I Need a Lawyer to File an Uninsured Motorist Claim?**
While you are not required to have a lawyer, working with an experienced uninsured motorist claims attorney significantly increases your chances of receiving fair compensation. Insurance companies often attempt to minimize payouts. A lawyer can advocate on your behalf, gather evidence, and handle negotiations to protect your interests.
