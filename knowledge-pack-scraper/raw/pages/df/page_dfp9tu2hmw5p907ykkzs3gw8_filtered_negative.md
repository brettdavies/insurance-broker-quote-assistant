**By Will McCarthy and[CAMILLE VON KAENEL](https://www.politico.com/staff/camille-von-kaenel), POLITICO**
Wildfires are heating up the property insurance fight — and it’s boiling over on to the ballot measure campaign trail, [our colleague Will McCarthy reports](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook-pm/2025/07/07/the-next-big-insurance-fight-headed-to-californias-ballot-00441596?nname=california-playbook-pm&nid=00000177-6f21-d412-abff-6ff78f190000&nrid=bb9b7801-dc5f-4229-9f11-09f7a612101e).
Since its narrow passage in 1988, Proposition 103 has set the rules for insurers doing business in California, requiring an elected insurance commissioner to approve any rate changes. The initiative helped keep the state’s insurance rates below many other states, even those with lower cost of living, [saving consumers more than $150 billion](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2018/release128-18.cfm).
But the sight of insurers pulling coverage from risky neighborhoods has threatened that consensus. The rapidly intensifying effects of climate-related disasters — notably the tens of billions of dollars in covered losses due to the Los Angeles wildfires — [may push more companies out of the state entirely.](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/08/los-angeles-fires-insurance-california-00197196)
“If they want to start a war, we’re happy to finish it,” Consumer Watchdog President **Jamie Court** said of any insurance industry effort to revisit Prop 103. — ** _WM, CvK_**
