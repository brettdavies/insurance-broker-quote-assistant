## Geico Rental Car Coverage

### Liability Insurance

Geico liability insurance will usually extend to your rental as long as you are driving in the U.S. Your personal liability insurance will pay for others’ medical expenses and repairs to others’ property resulting from an accident you caused in your rental vehicle.

### Collision and Comprehensive Insurance

If you have collision and comprehensive insurance with Geico, this will typically cover any damage that occurs to the rental vehicle during your rental period. However, your Geico collision and comprehensive coverage limits may not be high enough if you are renting a car with a much higher value than your personal vehicle and the car gets totaled.

### Personal Injury Protection or MedPay

If you have [personal injury protection](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/pip-insurance/9248) (PIP) or [MedPay](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/med-pay/9255) through your personal auto policy, medical expenses for you and your passengers will be covered even after a rental car accident. If you do not have either type of coverage, you can purchase personal accident insurance through the rental car company.

## Geico Rental Car Reimbursement Coverage

Geico [rental car reimbursement coverage](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/rental-reimbursement-coverage/10240/) helps pay for the cost of a rental car while your personal vehicle is being repaired for a covered claim. If you add rental reimbursement to your policy, Geico will pay about $25 to $75 per day toward the cost of your rental, up to $2,250 per claim. You select specific rental car reimbursement limits when you purchase the add-on. For example, if you choose $25 per day/$750 per claim as your rental reimbursement limits, Geico will pay up to $25 per day but no more than $750 per claim for your rental.
