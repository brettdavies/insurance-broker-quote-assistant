## How to Qualify for Defensive Driving Discounts

To qualify for a defensive driving discount, all you really need to do is complete an approved course—either online or in person, depending on what your insurer allows. Before you start, it’s a good idea to double-check with your insurance company or agent to make sure the course counts toward a discount.

You’ll also need a clean driving record, and once you’ve finished, just send in your certificate of completion. From there, your insurer will usually apply the discount to your premium. The discount amount varies by company.

[Progressive Insurance](https://clearsurance.com/insurance-company/progressive-insurance-5835ece073b103329e91abec) offers the highest cut at 31%, while Travelers comes in at 20%, and Geico and State Farm each offer 15%. Progressive leads with the biggest defensive driving discount at 31%, while Travelers offers 20%, and both Geico and State Farm sit at 15%.

## Getting The Most Out of Defensive Driving Discounts

Use defensive driver discounts to cut down your car insurance rates, but keep in mind that some companies have strict restrictions and requirements for earning the discount.

* **Eligibility**: Complete an approved course to unlock insurance discounts. Eligibility varies by driving record and state regulations.
* **Course Requirements**: Some companies offer a free defensive driving course online, while others require drivers to take state-approved courses.
* **How to Apply**: You may have to submit a defensive driving course completion certificate to your insurer or earn it exclusively through the insurer’s course program.
