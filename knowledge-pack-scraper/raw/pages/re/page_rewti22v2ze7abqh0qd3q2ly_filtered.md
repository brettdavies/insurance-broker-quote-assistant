## Farmers Insurance: A reliable choice for most shoppers

Farmers earns a **good**rating from The Zebra’s experts for its nationwide reach, customizable policies, and strong digital tools. That said, its above-average premiums are worth noting.

Our customers tend to trust Farmers, but its average claims experience suggests the process can take longer than expected.

What customers like:

* **Digital policy management:** Farmers' online tools and mobile app are rated highly for smooth policy management.
* **Market consistency:** Customers trust Farmers' stability, with its high financial strength and consistent policy terms.

What customers don't like:

* **Slow claims processing:** While *filing* a claim is easy and straightforward, customers report a less-than-ideal experience with communication and transparency through processing.
* **Higher premiums:** When comparing Farmers to similarly-sized providers, rates are often more expensive for the same risk profile.

### How The Zebra evaluates insurance companies

| Rating | Explanation | Star rating equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subpar | Lowest ranking, suggesting instability or high risk | 0-1.9 |
| Fair | Somewhat stable but not consistently reliable | 2-2.9 |
| Good | Generally dependable with moderate stability | 3-3.9 |
| Solid | Strong, reliable and dependable with minor risks | 4-4.4 |
| Exceptional | Highest rating, indicating outstanding stability and reliability | 4.5-5 |

#### Methodology — how The Zebra reviews insurance companies

The team of insurance experts at The Zebra evaluates companies by focusing on **customer experience first**, with an emphasis on service quality, reliability, and ease of interaction. Unlike previous models, **pricing is not scored** but is instead presented separately as context for comparison.

Each category has been scored using a combination of our internal customer satisfaction survey results and published scores from reputable organizations such as AM Best and J.D. Power.

* **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%):** This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
* **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
* **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%):** This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
* **Trust & Reliability (25%):** This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.

**Price context:** *Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided.*

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

## Farmers' customer service & claims experience: Overall low

Farmers' customer service reviews have been declining as of late. Multiple reviews claim difficulty in cancellation, poor customer service over the phone and low claims payouts. These reports seem to be unique to drivers with claims, however, and new policyholders and those with a clean record have scored digital tools highly for policy services.

### "Horrible customer service"

"Farmers insurance auto claims department is has horrible customer service and treats their customers poorly."

-*BBB*

### "Other companies just plain do better"

"Horrible communications and customer service qualities. Everything that can go wrong is likely to go wrong and they can’t figure out why. Other companies just plain do better in all respects."

*-Trustpilot*

### "Decent insurance coverage"

"They covered damage repairs to my car fairly easily although my rates increased significantly. Also, there were some issue with the rep handling my case not being responsive, but the issue was escalated and the person who stepped in was very helpful."

Claims process: Middle of the road

Farmers earns high marks for making it easy to file a claim, with a simple process available online, in the app, or over the phone. But from there, the experience often takes a hit. Customers report issues with communication and transparency, citing long wait times and frustrating claim outcomes.
