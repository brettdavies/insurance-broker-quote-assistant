## How to Qualify for Anti-Theft Auto Insurance Discounts

Anti-theft devices are an easy way to save money on car insurance, but you’ll get the most savings by meeting specific conditions insurers look for. Whether your car came equipped with built-in protection or you added aftermarket security, these steps can help you qualify for the full discount available:

1. **Install a Verified Anti-Theft Device:** Choose a factory-installed immobilizer, alarm, or GPS tracker. If your car didn’t come with one, a professional installation can help you qualify.
2. **Check With Your Insurer:** Not every device will earn you a discount. Call your insurance company to confirm your system meets their requirements before you install it.
3. **Keep Proof of Installation:** If you added the device later, save your receipt, installation certificate, or a clear photo. Some insurers verify built-in devices by checking your VIN.
4. **Ask Your Provider to Apply the Discount:** Some insurers apply it automatically, but others need you to ask. Call your agent or update your policy online once your device is installed.
5. **Review Your Policy:** Once your insurer processes the request, check your billing statement or quote to make sure the discount shows up. If it doesn’t, follow up.

Pairing these steps with a top insurer like Geico, Progressive, or American Family Insurance can help you unlock up to 25% in anti-theft savings.

#### If your car has an approved anti-theft device, ask your insurer directly which documentation is needed to apply the discount. It’s often overlooked but easy to qualify for.

### Types of Anti-Theft Devices That Get You a Discount

If you’re serious about saving on your policy, focus on the [car insurance discounts you can’t miss](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/discounts/)—and anti-theft savings are one of them. But not every device qualifies. Insurers reward features that either stop a theft from happening or help recover your car quickly. Here are five of the most common options they’ll accept:

* **VIN Etching:** Marking your vehicle’s VIN on the windows makes your car harder to resell, and some insurers give you a discount for it.
* **GPS Tracking Systems:** Tools like LoJack and OnStar help recover your car if it’s stolen, often earning you bigger savings.
* **Engine Immobilizers:** Built into many modern vehicles, these prevent your engine from starting without the right key or code.
* **Disabling Devices:** Car alarms, kill switches, and steering wheel locks make it harder for thieves to drive off with your car.
* **Remote or Passive Disabling Systems:** These activate automatically when you turn off your car or allow you to disable the engine remotely if it is stolen.

If you want to cut your insurance bill, these devices are a great place to start. The more secure your car is—and the easier it is for your insurer to confirm that protection—the better your chances of getting a meaningful discount.

﻿﻿

Always check with your insurance company to make sure your specific device qualifies. With the right anti-theft setup, you’re not just protecting your car; you’re also taking a simple, smart step toward lowering your monthly payments.

## Types of Anti-Theft Devices

When it comes to protecting your car and lowering your insurance bill, anti-theft devices actually help. Some are built into newer cars, while others you can add yourself. Here’s how the most common ones work and why they matter to your insurer:

* **Engine Immobilizers:** Built into most modern cars, these stop the engine from starting without the right key or chip, making hotwiring nearly impossible.
* **Car Alarms:** Alarms use motion and door sensors to detect break-in attempts. If someone tries to force their way in, the alarm triggers a loud siren to scare off the thief and alert anyone nearby.
* **GPS Tracking Systems:** Tools like LoJack or OnStar help locate your car quickly if it’s stolen. Some systems allow you to track your vehicle in real-time, while others can disable the engine remotely.
* **Steering Wheel Locks and Kill Switches:** These manual devices block the steering wheel or shut off the car’s power, making it harder for thieves to steal your car.
* **VIN Etching and Window Security Film:** VIN etching makes your car harder to resell, while security film strengthens windows to prevent easy break-ins.

If you’re piecing together your own [guide to auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/visual-guide/), anti-theft devices and other safety features in your vehicle belong near the top of your checklist.
