State Farm can be weird with policy numbers. Only a few states seem to have multi-car policies under State Farm. State Farm usually does one policy number per vehicle so the system may just be changing over to that. You can ask your agent, they'll be able to tell you why.

It depends on your State, it’s definitely no big deal, I’d just reach out to your agent. State Farm is working on moving to a new system, but it needs to legalize and pass in each state that it does it so it is a slow roll out. I’m assuming you’re in a state moving over. Previously, each car had its own policy, own renewal, etc. Now, any vehicles that have the same named insureds, drivers, and liability coverages are being merged into one policy that has every car instead of each car being on its own

I see that, but what's behind it? If each car no longer has its own policy, and now several cars are on one policy (example 4 cars) and one (prior individual policy holder) has an accident, it's now going to affect rates of the entire policy consisting of 4 cars (higher premium across 4 cars versus 3 cars), is what I'm thinking. I wonder if there is more to it than simply a new system.
