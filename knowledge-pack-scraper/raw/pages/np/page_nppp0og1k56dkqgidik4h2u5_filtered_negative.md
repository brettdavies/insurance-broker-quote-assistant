Wind and hail insurance policies have a deductible — the amount you'll pay for damage before the company provides coverage. Your deductible may be either a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the policy's dwelling coverage limit. While windstorm insurance is sometimes referred to as [hurricane insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/what-is-hurricane-insurance "What is Hurricane Insurance and Do You Need It?"), certain hurricane damage may not be covered by a wind policy. For example, windstorm insurance doesn't cover storm surge or flood damage, so you'll need a separate flood insurance policy for protection.
Windstorm insurance, also called wind and hail insurance, isn't required by Texas, but it **will likely be required by your mortgage lender if you live in a high-risk area**. But even if it's not mandatory, consider it if your house is in a high-risk region, as direct damage from wind, hail and hurricanes is likely excluded from your [home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-texas "The Best and Cheapest Homeowners Insurance Companies in Texas") policy.

TWIA wind insurance policies also come with a [deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "What Is a Homeowners Insurance Deductible?"), which you would pay out of pocket before the policy pays for repairs. A higher deductible means lower premiums, because you'd pay for a larger amount of the damage yourself. You can choose a TWIA insurance deductible of:
In addition to the TWIA, a number of companies in Texas offer windstorm insurance to coastal homeowners. If you're unable to get wind and hail insurance from your [homeowners insurance company](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-homeowners-insurance-companies "Best Homeowners Insurance Companies"), you may want to compare quotes.
