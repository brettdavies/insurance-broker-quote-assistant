Why do you care what discounts they offer? You should care more about the final price. You could have a better premium with a policy that has 0 discounts than a super expensive one with a lot of discounts.

I worked at one of the biggest carriers in the US. I got the [employee discount](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+employee+discount&cId=fd156f95-b783-40d7-8311-af85869720ed&iId=b95330b9-dae7-48ad-a67c-ef244d5e703c). Another carrier still undercut them for the same coverage.
Discounts are mainly marketing.

Can confirm I work for a top 5 insurance company focused on mostly vehicles. Let me tell you we only get a 100$ discount per 6 months. Thankfully they are cheaper atm but not by much at the end of the day you vote with your wallet and idgaf about 70 discounts if it still costs me more.

So do some don't. In fact, some make it a requirement for [leak detectors](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=leak+detectors+insurance+requirement&cId=17daddc6-9d6a-4156-841d-608c6b0038e4&iId=483a7a5d-8cbe-4957-adf2-614f02434b35) to stay insured with them.

So they aren't going to discount prevention for loss they aren't going to pay for to begin with
Most people will notice when their fitting goes and you have full pressure pouring out of a line. Way less will pay attention to a slow leak.
Most policies won't pay for non abrupt, non sudden losses. A slow drip is not sudden
As for [dash cams](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=dash+cams+insurance+discount&cId=fc95de20-c3c6-49e7-bf45-e87b7a6ded96&iId=0d187681-17dd-48b2-9760-5e52d318ac98) they don't make you a safer driver, the other rating factors you have are far more important.

It's because it's hard to verify that a person actually has or uses these devices. So it leaves a lot of room for abuse. People can just say they have and use them and get a discount that shouldn't apply.

Why would you get a discount for having a dash cam? That doesn't prevent you from getting into an accident or your vehicle from being stolen/damaged.

It proves who’s side of the story is true in a car accident and who is at fault. If you can prove that someone else is at fault and crashes into you then their insurance gets billed and not yours so your insurance company won’t have to pay any claim.

Dash cams are one additional tool adjusters use when determining fault. They may or may not prove anything. Simply installing one in your car doesn't reduce the likelihood of being involved in a covered event. No carrier is going to give a discount because something _might_ help the adjusters process a claim.

I don’t know of any that offer discounts for those two things. It becomes a crazy list that would be hard to manage: home generators, battery backup on sump pump, smart locks, cameras, door man.

I haven't found any insurance that offers a discount for dash cams...they only want to consider it with their always on GPS tracking that doesn't actually provide context of why you have to do some sudden maneuver (e.g. hard braking being cut off or for people running stops/lights). One even point blank said if I was okay with a dash cam I should also be okay with an always-on tracking device which is an absurd comparison...especially given the dash cam cycles on/off with the key so I don't have a dead batteries if I don't drive at least 30 minutes a day like they said I'd have to do with the GPS tracker.
And apparently as a middle age adult you also can't get discounts for completing defensive driving courses (took it for my own skill enhancement, but still kinda annoyed it only counts for new teen and senior drivers to get discounts)

They don't care if you're doing a evasive maneuver once a month, but if you are doing one multiple times a week you are most likely a higher risk.

Your insurance has no way to monitor that your dash cam is in use at all times and a dash cam recording could work against you in a liability decision just as easily as it could hurt you

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors.
### Home Insurance
* **Coverage Types**: You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Rebuild Cost**: Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
* **Personal Property**: Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
* **Bundling**: Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
* **Deductibles**: Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)
### Life Insurance
* **Mortgage Protection**: This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Policy Types**: Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)
### Health Insurance
* **Premium Stability**: Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
* **Enrollment Periods**: You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
* **Employer Plans**: If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)
### Car Insurance
* **Coverage Considerations**: Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
* **Car Choice**: Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
* **VIN Quotes**: Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)
### Additional Tips
* **Use a Broker**: Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Read the Fine Print**: Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Check Claims Handling**: Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)
