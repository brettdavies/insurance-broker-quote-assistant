#  State Farm scales back its smart-home bet on ADT
Three years after pouring $1.2 billion into  **ADT** to bring smart-home technology into the insurance mainstream,  **State Farm** is pulling back.
_“We’re in the very early days of design. It’s not necessarily the last effort trying the traditional distribution with State Farm, but it’s a fresh tactic, and we’re going to lean in here and see if we can get some traction. An advantage is that it’s in the potential buy flow. And so there’s not a reliance on agent execution as there is in the traditional path. This is a digital process directed at relocating customers. I should also mention we’re continuing our data sharing program with State Farm, where with customer consent, we share alarm activity at the customer’s home with State Farm. And so we continue to kick tires on that front to see if there’s a source of value. But back again on your original question about the advantage of the digital program, I would say, is that it’s included in the buy flow, a more natural process and one we hope we get better traction with.” – DeVries._
