## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Oklahoma's state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car, regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, stolen, or otherwise damaged as the result of a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after a collision.
