Discounts are one of the easiest ways to save money on your auto insurance. If you’re a current or former military member, you may be eligible for an exclusive discount from many car insurance companies.
[Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) offers a military discount only in Louisiana, where the law mandates insurers provide a discount for eligible military personnel. Active and retired military personnel in Louisiana can get up to a 25% discount on their Progressive auto insurance.
We’ll explain how to get Progressive’s military discount and other discounts the company offers.
## **What Is the Progressive Military Discount?**
Progressive offers a [military discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/military-discount) to the following military members in Louisiana:[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-military-discount#cite-1)
  * Active-duty military members
  * Military reservists
  * Louisiana Air and Army National Guard personnel
  * Retired military members
  * Veterans who are at least 50% disabled


[Louisiana](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/louisiana) drivers who meet these qualifications can get up to 25% off their Progressive [premium](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium) — but the discount may apply only to [liability insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/liability-insurance) coverage. Check with your Progressive agent to find out how much the military discount can save you.

## **How Much Can You Save With the Progressive Military Discount?**
![Person in camouflage uniform typing on a laptop at a desk, with a blurred plant in the background.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/c55652afaf/military-laptop.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Military personnel in Louisiana may be eligible for up to 25% in savings on their Progressive auto insurance. But the amount you save can vary by policy, depending on your coverage and other discounts.
The military discount is less common than other [car insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts). Louisiana is the only state that requires insurers to offer a discount to military members. Progressive doesn’t provide much information about its military discount, most likely because the company only offers it in Louisiana.
### **How does Progressive’s military discount compare to competitors?**
Louisiana is the only state that requires insurers to provide military discounts, so many [car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) offer it only there.
Check out the table below to see how Progressive’s military discount compares to the competition, according to Compare.com data.

---|---|---|---  
Progressive | $171 | Only in Louisiana | Up to 25%  
[State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm) | $108 | Only in Louisiana | Up to 25%  
[GEICO](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/geico) | $138 | Nationwide | Up to 25%  
[Allstate](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/allstate-insurance) | $137 | Only in Louisiana | Up to 25%  
[Liberty Mutual](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/liberty-mutual) | $215 | Nationwide | Up to 25%  
Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Compare.com's 50-plus partner insurance providers and quote estimates from Quadrant Information Services. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.
Allstate and State Farm offer up to 25% savings with their military discount. But like Progressive, the companies offer it only in Louisiana. GEICO and Liberty Mutual offer military discounts everywhere in the country, but the discount amount can vary [by state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state).
## **How to Get the Progressive Military Discount**
![A family sits together on a couch, with a woman in military uniform, a man, and a child smiling. An American flag is in the foreground.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/f3c647b1e0/military-family.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
If you’re a Progressive customer, live in Louisiana, and are an active-duty military member or a veteran, contact Progressive to add the military discount to your auto insurance policy.
If you have insurance through another company, consider getting a [car insurance quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) from Progressive to see if it’s worth switching. Make sure you look at the same [coverages](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage), [policy limits](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-do-policy-limit-numbers-mean), and [deductibles](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles) for an accurate price comparison.
Many Progressive customers find the insurer offers much cheaper rates than other companies. But price isn’t the only factor to consider. J.D. Power ranked Progressive below average in the Southeast region for customer service and claims satisfaction.
## **Other Progressive Discounts to Consider**
![A man in camouflage clothing drives a car, using a prosthetic hand on the steering wheel.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/d7ebb58f21/military-driving.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Although Progressive offers a military discount only in Louisiana, the company offers other discounts in most states. Consider combining these discounts to [save](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) the most money on your car insurance policy:
  * **Bundling discount:** Progressive gives you a [multi-policy discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-policy-discount) if you combine your auto insurance with any other policy, including home, RV, boat, and motorcycle insurance. Your savings can vary depending on the policies in your [bundle](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/bundle-home-auto-insurance).
  * **Continuous coverage discount:** Depending on how long you’ve had continuous insurance, you could be eligible for a [loyalty discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/loyalty-discount) at your first policy renewal.
  * **Teen driver discount:** Insuring [teens](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens) is expensive. But if you’ve been with Progressive for at least a year and add a driver aged 18 or younger, you can offset your premium’s increase with a teen driver discount.
  * **Multi-car discount:** Insuring at least two vehicles with Progressive can save you an average of 12% with the [multi-car discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-car-insurance-discount).
  * **Online quote discount:** Getting a Progressive insurance quote online can get you an average of 7% in savings — even if you complete your policy over the phone with a Progressive representative.
  * **Sign online discount:** Get an average of 9% savings by signing your policy documents online.
