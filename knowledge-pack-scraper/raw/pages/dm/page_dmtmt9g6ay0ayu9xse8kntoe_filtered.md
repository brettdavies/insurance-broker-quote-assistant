## How much is car insurance for college students?

Student car insurance rates vary based on age, location, driving record and other criteria, including whether you qualify for a good student discount.   
  
The biggest factor, however, is whether you are on your own insurance or your parents’ plan: The average cost of adding an 18-to-21-year-old college student to a parent’s policy in 2024 was $1,610, according to data from Quadrant Information Services.   
  
College students with their own policies paid an average of $4,689 a year.

## What is a good student discount?

Many insurance companies offer a discount to drivers under 25 that are full-time students in high school or college and meet one of the following academic requirements.

* B average or better
* At least a 3.0 grade point average
* Rank in the top 20% of the class
* Make dean’s list, honor roll or comparable standing

Depending on the state and insurer, homeschooled students may also qualify.

You must have proof of your academic performance, like a transcript or report card, and the discount can range from 5% to 25%, depending on the insurer, your state and other factors.

## Other car insurance discounts for college students

Depending on your insurer and the state you live in, there are other ways for student drivers to save on premiums.  
  
**Distant student discount:** Insurers may lower your rates if your college is more than 100 miles away from home and you leave your car behind.

**Safe driver discount:** Young drivers who go three to five years without an at-fault accident or moving violation may qualify for a discount.

**Driver education discount:** Some insurers will lower the rates for young drivers who complete an approved defensive driving course.

**Volunteer discount**: Clocking a specific number of hours performing community service can earn you a discount with some providers.

**Military discount:** Some insurance companies lower premiums for ROTC members.

**Student organization discount**: Discounts may be available to members of approved college groups, Greek organizations, honor societies and alumni associations.  
  
And, of course, students are eligible for most discounts available to other drivers, including for paying in full upfront, going paperless or installing anti-theft and safety devices. If you live off campus, you may qualify for a [bundling discount](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-get-car-insurance-student-discounts/) if you get renters insurance and car insurance from the same provider.

## Student car insurance FAQs

### Why is car insurance so expensive for college students?

Because they have fewer years behind the wheel, drivers under 25 pay the highest premiums of any demographic. Leaving your car at home or maintaining good grades can help lower your rates, however.

### How long can a college student stay on their parents’ car insurance?

You can usually remain on your parents’ car insurance as long as you live at the same address and in some cases even if you have a car on campus. If you’re going to a college out of state, however, you may be required to have your own insurance. Check with your insurance company for details.

### What’s the best car insurance for college students?

No one insurance company is the best for all drivers or all college students. Our research indicates, however, that Geico, State Farm, Progressive, Auto-Owners, Milewise by Allstate, American Family and USAA have some of the best rates for young drivers.

## Why trust CNBC Select?

At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every car insurance review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of car insurance products. To research the best car insurance companies for students, we compiled dozens of data points on several car insurance companies. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics.

## Our methodology

To determine the best car insurance companies for student drivers, [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) gathered sample premiums for an 18-year-old on their parents’ policy with a good student discount and for a 21-year-old getting insurance for themselves.   
  
The sample policy included:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

In addition to sample premiums, we considered available discounts for young drivers, as well as coverage options, the ease of the claims process, state availability, customer satisfaction ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-j-d-power/) and complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  
  
We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.
