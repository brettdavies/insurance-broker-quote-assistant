One of the early adopters of telematics technology, Root was among the first insurance companies to assign rates based on driving habits in place of traditional rating factors. The company's long-term aim is to discontinue the use of credit scores in policy pricing by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive infrequently.

Root allows its auto insurance customers to add homeowners insurance bundles through a partnership with Homesite. Root home insurance is not available as a standalone insurance policy: a customer must be enrolled in Root's car insurance program to be eligible. Root claims customers who [bundle home and auto policies](/best-home-and-car-insurance/) receive 10% discounts on their home insurance premiums.

State Farm is one of the nation's most popular home insurance providers, carrying with it some definite pros and cons.

Our assessment found that State Farm's average rates are on the higher side, and there are only four discounts for home insurance. In short, while this company's home insurance has the backing of favorable ratings, those looking for an average, no-frills home insurance policy without specialized endorsements could get a cheaper rate by looking for an alternative.

In The Zebra's customer satisfaction survey of 15 popular homeowners insurance companies, State Farm finished in fifth place.
