Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-state-farm/)
One of the early adopters of telematics technology, Root was among the first insurance companies to assign rates based on driving habits in place of traditional rating factors. The company's long-term aim is to discontinue the use of credit scores in policy pricing by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive infrequently.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-state-farm/)
Our assessment found that State Farm's average rates are on the higher side, and there are only four discounts for home insurance. In short, while this company's home insurance has the backing of favorable ratings, those looking for an average, no-frills home insurance policy without specialized endorsements could get a cheaper rate by looking for an alternative.
