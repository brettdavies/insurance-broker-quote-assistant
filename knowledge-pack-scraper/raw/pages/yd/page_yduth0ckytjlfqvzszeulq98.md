Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-state-farm/)
One of the early adopters of telematics technology, Root was among the first insurance companies to assign rates based on driving habits in place of traditional rating factors. The company's long-term aim is to discontinue the use of credit scores in policy pricing by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive infrequently.

State Farm is one of the nation's most popular home insurance providers, carrying with it some definite pros and cons.
