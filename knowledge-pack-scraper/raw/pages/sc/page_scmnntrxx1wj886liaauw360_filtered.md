* ### Minimum car insurance requirements in New York City

  New York drivers need to meet New York state's auto insurance coverage requirements.

  New York auto insurance laws require car owners to carry liability insurance, personal injury protection (PIP) and uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage (UMBI).

  The minimum coverage limits in New York are:

  + $25,000 bodily injury liability per person.
  + $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
  + $50,000 liability for death per person.
  + $100,000 liability for death per accident.
  + $10,000 property damage liability per accident.
  + $50,000 PIP.
  + $25,000 UMBI per person.
  + $50,000 UMBI per accident.

  [Liability car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) covers the cost of any damage, injuries or deaths you cause in a car accident, up to your policy’s predefined limits.

  [Personal injury protection](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-injury-protection) will cover your medical bills and expenses if you’re injured in a car crash, up to your policy limits, no matter whose fault it was. Depending on your state, PIP may also pay for:

  + Lost wages if you’re unable to work due to injuries from an accident.
  + Services you can no longer perform, like house cleaning or child care, because of your injuries.
  + Funeral costs if an accident-related injury leads to death.
  + A small death benefit as a cash payout.

  [Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage) will cover expenses from injuries or damage after an accident with a driver who doesn’t have car insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage will cover the same expenses if you’re hit by a driver with some car insurance, but not enough to cover all costs from the crash.

  For the best financial protection, consider buying more than the bare minimum coverage. Any costs that surpass your coverage limits would have to come out of your own pocket, so with these minimums, a serious accident could easily leave you owing more than, say, $10,000 to repair another driver's car.

  **» MORE:** [Find out how much car insurance coverage you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-car-insurance-you-need)

#### **Is there anything wrong with getting a minimum coverage policy?**

Most drivers [need more insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-car-insurance-you-need) than the minimum amount that New York requires. One reason is that having full coverage is a condition of most loans and leases. Another reason is that it’s unlikely a policy with minimum coverage would cover the damage done by a serious accident. With a bare-bones policy, you could be on the hook for medical bills and property damage worth potentially thousands of dollars.

## Cheap car insurance in New York City by age

Age has a big effect on your car insurance rates. Younger drivers, for example, usually pay more than older drivers with similar driving histories due to having less experience on the road. Make sure to continue shopping around for [cheap car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies) as you age and gain more experience driving. This way, you can check to make sure that you’re not paying more than you have to for someone who’s your age.

## How to get cheap car insurance in New York

If you’re wondering [how to get cheap car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/ways-to-get-cheapest-car-insurance), here are six things you can try:

1. **Compare quotes from multiple insurers.** Use NerdWallet’s [car insurance comparison tool](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance) to easily shop for cheap auto insurance online. You may find that you already have the best car insurance deal, but prices can change, so check roughly once a year.
2. **Consider dropping coverage that you don’t need.** If you finish paying off your car loan, you may be able to lower your rates by getting rid of [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/comprehensive-and-collision-insurance). However, this should only be an option if you could afford to replace your car yourself if it were totaled.
3. **Ask for discounts.** You could save money from [car insurance discounts](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-discounts) you’re not taking advantage of. For example, maybe you work from home and don’t drive much. Mention that and you might get a low-mileage discount. Other common discounts are given for [bundling car insurance with homeowners insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles), insuring multiple cars on the same policy and being a student.
4. **Cash in on major life changes.** Certain life events could translate to cheaper car insurance, so shop for quotes whenever something major changes in your life. For instance, many companies offer a lower rate for married couples or domestic partners. Or perhaps you moved to a suburb with lower accident and crime rates. Even if you moved to a more expensive area for car insurance, shopping around can help you get cheaper coverage.
5. **Raise your deductible.** The higher your [car insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-deductible), the more you pay out of pocket before insurance pays for a covered claim. The upside is that by raising your deductible, you’ll usually be able to lower your premium. Just make sure you have enough money set aside to cover the higher deductible if you ever get in an accident.
6. **Revisit quotes after your driving record improves.** Shop for cheap auto insurance quotes online three to five years after any accidents, tickets or moving violations. They may have dropped off your driving record.
7. **Reconsider the car you drive.** The type of car you drive affects how much you pay for auto insurance. For example, new and expensive cars tend to cost more to insure than older or less expensive cars, among other factors. Check out NerdWallet’s analysis of the [cheapest cars to insure](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/cars-cheapest-auto-insurance-rates) to see if your vehicle made the list.

* $100,000 uninsured motorist coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist coverage per accident.
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible.

In states where required, minimum additional coverages were added. Some policies include additional coverages at the insurer’s discretion.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE for all drivers and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven.

We analyzed rates for drivers 20 to 70 years old in 10-year increments. For the average cost of full and minimum coverage in each state, we looked at 35-year-old drivers.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* For drivers with minimum coverage, we adjusted the numbers above to reflect the minimum required coverage by law in the state.
* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit.
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.

We looked at 35-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company overall, the cheapest company for minimum coverage and the cheapest company for drivers with poor credit in states where credit history is used to price rates. We looked at 20-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company for young drivers.
