## Progressive Home Insurance Overview
While it's arguably best known for auto insurance, Progressive Insurance started offering homeowners insurance through ASI (American Strategic Insurance) in 2014.
Operating primarily online, Progressive homeowners insurance offers 24/7 customer service, instant quotes, and the option to purchase policies from the comfort of your home. It also offers coverage for a broad selection of [homeowners insurance types](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/types-homeowners-insurance).
In short, some customers want the support of an agent when choosing the best homeowners insurance companies to meet their needs. Brokers who work with Progressive can quote auto, home, and other policies with bundling and other discounts.
## Progressive Home Insurance Plans and Coverage
Disasters can occur at any time. From household accidents to extreme weather, ensuring full coverage and generous liability limits is crucial. Progressive offers the policies you might expect for single-family residences and condos. It also sells renters and other residential insurance policies. Progressive provides standard coverage based on your property's estimated replacement cost.
### HO-3 Insurance
Here's what's covered in a standard homeowners (HO-3) insurance policy from Progressive:
#### Dwelling
Every homeowner's insurance policy includes [dwelling coverage](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-homeowners-insurance) (Coverage A). It covers your physical home, attached garage, and other structures integral to the dwelling, from chimneys and decks to kitchen countertops and built-in cabinets and/or vanities.
Generally speaking, a policy's dwelling coverage will pay for the costs associated with repairing, rebuilding, or replacing your home in the event of a loss due to covered perils from fires and falling objects to theft, vandalism, and some weather-related incidents. However, if you're buying a condo policy, you'll need a copy of your condo association's master policy.
Some policies cover "walls-in" with improvements, meaning you don't need a condo policy unless you want other coverages. If it has "walls-in as originally built," Coverage A could be $20,000 to fulfill conventional mortgage lender requirements. Dwelling coverage is based on the estimated cost of rebuilding your home after a total loss.
Note that standard policies typically do not protect against floods, earthquakes, or other specific natural disasters. Mortgage holders may be required to carry other regional coverages.
#### Other Structures
True to its name, this coverage applies to any free-standing structure, from garages and gazebos to patios and pergolas, standing separate from your primary dwelling. For example, this coverage will kick in if a tree falls and crushes your gardening shed. Generally speaking, other structures coverage (Coverage B) is typically set at 10% of Coverage A, dwelling coverage.
Again, this would not be included in condo policies as a condo would not have additional structures.
#### Personal Property
Often called contents coverage, this provision (Coverage C) helps cover the cost of replacing personal property, from clothing and furniture to electronics and appliances, in the event of damage, destruction, theft, or other covered events.
Personal property coverage comes with two types of settlement: replacement cost value (the cost of replacing stolen or damaged items) or actual cash value cost (the cost to replace your damaged items minus depreciation). Items of worth, like jewelry, fine art, or other collectibles, must be covered under a separate "schedule" or additional rider.
Don't underestimate the value of your personal property. You might not have designer jewelry or other high-value items (which would require additional coverage via riders). But everything from your couches to your clothes and kitchen appliances adds up quicker than you may realize.
#### Loss of Use
If your home is not inhabitable following a covered loss, loss of use coverage (Coverage D) pays for living expenses. This could include hotel rooms, restaurant meals, laundry services, parking, and storage units, to name a few things.
Coverage is based upon a percentage of your dwelling coverage, designed to help you find other accommodations as you still have to pay your original mortgage.
#### Personal Liability
This coverage, often called personal liability insurance (Coverage E), provides financial protection if someone is injured at your home. It is a standard inclusion on a homeowners policy. When choosing your limits, you must disclose liabilities, including swimming pools and trampolines.
Many insurance companies also ask about dogs, particularly those with a history of aggression. Progressive's marketing team has written about dog liability, but the pages we read did not specify Progressive's policy on certain breeds.
A licensed insurance agent can advise you on how much liability coverage you want. However, you should consider higher limits if you run a business or have other regular traffic outside your family.
Note that disclosure is critical when it comes to liability. For example, if a Progressive agent asks you if you have a trampoline or pool and you say no, it could lead the company to deny any claim associated with the non-disclosure.
#### Medical payments
This type of coverage is different from liability insurance. This part of your policy, medical payments (Coverage F), specifically pays for medical expenses if someone else is injured on your property due to a covered event.
### HO-4 Insurance
A [standard renters insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-renters-insurance) (HO-4) policy from Progressive includes personal property protection, liability coverage, loss of use coverage, and medical payments. You also have the option to add on water backup coverage and personal injury protection. Water backup coverage protects you in the event water or other liquid substances back up through sewers or drains and causes damage to your unit and property.
### HO-6 Insurance
Progressive offers standard [condo (HO-6) insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/condo-insurance) policies that provide coverage for your personal property, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments. In addition, Progressive will give you the option to add on water backup coverage and personal injury coverage.
### HO-7 Insurance
Progressive's standard HO-7 [insurance for mobile homes](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/mobile-home-insurance) or manufactured homes includes the following types of protection:
* Dwelling coverage
* Personal property coverage
* Liability coverage
* Loss of use coverage
With Progressive, you can also add replacement cost coverage, trip collision coverage, and a single deductible benefit. A single deductible benefit means that you only have to pay one deductible if you bundle your home and auto insurance.
### HO-1 Insurance
Basic form (HO-1) homeowners insurance or "bare-bones" is a named perils policy. Most mortgage companies won't accept this type of coverage due to its limitations. HO-1 policies provide coverage for specific perils, including fire or lightning, smoke, windstorm or hail, aircraft, explosion, vehicles, riot or civil commotion, vandalism, theft, and volcanic eruption.
### HO-2 Insurance
HO-2 insurance is commonly referred to as broad form homeowners insurance. This type of policy gives you more coverage than a HO-1 policy, but less than an HO-3 policy. HO-2 insurance only covers your home and personal belongings. It's a type of named perils policy that only provides coverage for what's specifically listed in your policy.
### HO-5 Insurance
HO-5 insurance, also known as a comprehensive form policy, provides a broad range of protection. It covers your home and personal belongings with an open perils policy. So, your home and possessions are protected from all types of risks unless they are specifically excluded in your policy details. Additionally, this type of insurance typically comes with higher limits for personal property coverage.
### HO-8 Insurance
Also known as a modified coverage form, an HO-8 policy was created to insure older homes. These types of homes may be difficult to insure with a standard HO-3 policy. HO-8 policies are tailored toward historic properties and older homes.
### Additional Cover Options (Riders) Offered by Progressive Homeowners Insurance
#### Flood Insurance
For homeowners in areas at high risk of floods, flood insurance provides additional protection (plus peace of mind) should rising waters damage your home and/or property. Flood insurance covers damage to your dwelling and foundation as well as attached and detached structures, personal property, and debris removal.
Generally, an insurance agent can check your flood zone to determine if you need it. It's issued by the NFIP, primarily for natural disasters. All policies are underwritten and backed by the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). So Progressive will service claims, but the prices should be identical to those of any other carrier for the same property.
#### Water Backup
Damage from unnatural water sources, like a backup or overflow from a sewer line or sump pump, can be costly and inconvenient. This additional option provides coverage if your home's physical structure and/or personal belongings are damaged or destroyed by a plumbing issue. This should not be confused with flood insurance, which generally costs a small amount per renewal period.
#### Personal Injury
This additional coverage pays for legal fees and damages stemming from extreme and uncommon (often legal) situations like a lawsuit, malicious prosecution, wrongful eviction/entry, or false arrest, to name just a few.
#### Scheduled Items
Special possessions with a high value may not be fully covered under your personal property coverage. Typical examples include jewelry, artwork, and other high-value collectibles. Therefore, an appraisal may be required for some items. In general, this is an affordable option based on the value of the specific item and the cost to replace it.
#### Computer Coverage
Like scheduled items coverage, computer coverage offers additional specialized coverage for computers and related equipment like monitors, docking stations, etc. This rider is ideal for remote workers, serious gamers, and others with specialized computer equipment.
## Progressive Home Insurance Cost
Progressive offers competitive rates for homeowners insurance. Cost depends on a handful of factors, including location, the age and condition of your home, coverage limits, and claims history. Progressive is a flexible carrier that offers coverage for various homes. However, it won't cover high-risk properties like beachfront properties, homes in certain fire zones, etc. If your home is older, you should also be prepared to document any recent roof and plumbing upgrades.
We used Progressive's quote system to request quotes on a single-family home in Albuquerque worth just over $400,000, purchased by a 38-year-old who hasn't filed any claims. We receive a quote of $1,134 for this home, underwritten by Stillwater Insurance Company.
According to its website, the average cost of a 12-month policy with Progressive for $200,000 to $400,000 in dwelling coverage ranges from $1,090.08 to $3,353.74, a figure that works out to between $90.84 to $279.48 per month on average (depending on where you live).
Homeowners insurance from Progressive or its partners is available in all 50 states. However, the average costs vary by state. States like Florida may face more significant risks of loss. Average rates reflect this risk.
Progressive continues to lead the way in affordable homeowners insurance. In 2017, the company launched HomeQuote ExplorerⓇ, a platform boasting side-by-side comparison of home insurance rates and coverage in fewer than two minutes from multiple companies.
In addition, Progressive has made calculating coverage limits for homeowners insurance quick and easy. Remember, insurance quotes are based on the specifics of your home. Bottom line: the goal is to estimate how much it would cost to rebuild your home in case of a complete or partial loss. This price, calculated by a "[replacement cost estimator](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/estimate-home-insurance)," is not the same as your home's fair market value (used when buying or selling an existing structure).
### Progressive Homeowners Insurance Discounts
Here are discounts commonly offered by Progressive and its network of home insurance companies:
* **Bundle home and auto**: Progressive claims that its customers who [bundle home and auto insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-insurance-bundling) save an average of 7%. You can also bundle your home and motorcycle policies, auto and boat policies, or home and RV policies.
* **Single deductible**: If you bundle your home and auto policies with Progressive and have to file a claim that applies to both policies, you'll only be responsible for one deductible.
* **Home safety**: When you install an alarm system, such as fire alarms or burglar alarms, you may earn a discount on your homeowners insurance policy.
* **Quote in advance**: You may be eligible for a discount when you get a quote for a policy at least 10 days before the policy starts.
* **New purchase**: If you're buying a new home, you may earn a discount on your homeowners insurance. What's more, your home does not need to be brand new or newly built to qualify.
* **Paperless**: If you opt to receive your policy documents by email, you may qualify for a discount.
* **Pay in full**: Progressive offers discounts when you pay for your 12-month policy in full when the policy begins.
* **Wind mitigation**: Residents of Florida may be eligible for a discount if their home has been fitted with Building Code-certified roof and/or wind mitigation upgrades. If your home was built in 2002 or later, you will likely automatically qualify for a discount.
## How to Purchase and Manage a Progressive Home Insurance Policy
You can easily purchase a Progressive homeowners insurance policy by heading to the insurer's official website and selecting the HomeQuote Explorer. This online tool quickly lets you compare policies from multiple providers side-by-side within minutes. You'll first need to enter your ZIP code, followed by your address, full name, and date of birth. Another option is to call to speak with a Progressive agent at 1-855-347-3939.
To manage your homeowners insurance policy from Progressive, you can log in to your online Progressive account through the insurer's website or mobile app. From there, Progressive will direct you to the appropriate home insurance provider.
Progressive can connect you with a home insurance provider in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C.
### How to File a Claim with Progressive Homeowners Insurance
If your home is damaged, you must initiate the claims process immediately. The sooner you file a claim, the sooner you can get paid. More importantly, homeowners insurance does not cover negligence. So, for example, if you experienced a loss due to water backup, waiting could lead to the buildup of mold, which is one of the most common signs of neglect used by insurance companies.
After locating your policy number, call Progressive directly at 1-800-776-4737. A customer service representative will connect you with an expert who can explain the details of your coverage and how a deductible will apply.
Be prepared to take photos, collect receipts (for damaged personal belongings), and schedule a home inspection with a certified insurance adjuster. All of this information will allow your insurer to complete an estimate of anticipated repair costs and your out-of-pocket expenses.
Once you receive a check for the covered portion of your loss, you can start repairs using your chosen experts. Companies in your area may be willing to start working on repairs while your claim is being processed. However, if more damage is discovered during the repair process, contact your insurer immediately, as you may be entitled to additional compensation.
Throughout the claims process, remain in close contact with your claims representative (who will be appointed by the insurer), who will remain available to answer your questions when they arise.
## Progressive Home Insurance Customer Reviews and Ratings
Progressive has mixed customer reviews overall. The Better Business Bureau awarded the insurer with an A+ rating. The BBB rates businesses based on several factors, including complaint history and transparency in business practices and advertising.
However, the NAIC, which keeps track of a company's complaint volume, reported that Progressive has a 2.52 on the complaint index. This indicates that the insurance company receives more than double the expected amount of complaints.
Progressive's mobile app received glowing reviews from customers. In the Apple App Store, the mobile app received 4.8 stars out of five. Similarly, in the Google Play Store, the app received 4.6 stars out of five. Many customers loved how the app was user-friendly and easy to navigate.
The insurer has an A+ (Superior) rating from AM Best, which measures the financial stability and strength of a company. This means that Progressive is likely able to meet its ongoing obligations and pay out claims.
​In the 2024 JD Power U.S. Home Insurance Study, Progressive received a customer satisfaction score of 634 out of 1,000, which placed it slightly below the industry average of 640. This score tied Progressive for 12th place with Auto-Owners Insurance.
## Progressive Home Insurance Alternatives
See how Progressive compares to other options for home insurance coverage: Liberty Mutual and Safeco.
### Progressive vs. Liberty Mutual Homeowners Insurance
Liberty Mutual Homeowners Insurance maintains reasonable customer satisfaction despite JD Power's assigning below-average ratings. In addition, it offers a variety of discounts for homeowners, including price breaks for new homes and online bill pay. More importantly, Liberty Mutual customers can file and monitor claims online for its many insurance products.
Unsurprisingly, Liberty Mutual customers like Namusisi of Tomkins Cove, New York, called the claims process "very streamlined" on ConsumerAffairs.
Liberty Mutual and Progressive offer online and insurance agent-based quoting (and the associated customer service and support. However, Progressive may offer lower prices. Liberty Mutual sells through both in-house and independent agents. So, if you quote with a Liberty Mutual agent, they may offer discounts exclusive to in-house agents.
Read our [Liberty Mutual homeowners insurance review](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/liberty-mutual-home-insurance-review).
### Progressive vs. Safeco Homeowners Insurance
Safeco Homeowners Insurance offers a distinct homeowners insurance benefit: choose your own deductible. While it's widely understood lower deductibles go hand-in-hand with higher premiums (and vice versa), customers keen on options will love its flexibility. That said, Safeco plays it safe regarding standard limits of coverage, which tend to be far lower than its competitors. This, coupled with lower-than-average customer satisfaction, makes Progressive a more reliable alternative. As a result, you're more likely to find affordable coverage with Progressive.
Progressive policies can be quoted online or through independent insurance agents. It offers affordable premiums and flexible coverage. Compared to Safeco, Progressive offers all options except a "choose your own deductible" feature.
