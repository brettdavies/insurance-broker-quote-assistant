In 2024, customers nationwide experienced property damage from severe hail, leading State Farm to pay out more than $3.8 billion for home repairs and over $1.2 billion for auto repairs. With recent devastating storms serving as a reminder, State Farm encourages homeowners to prepare for the spring and hailstorm season by taking preventative measures to minimize damage to their properties.

**Hail damage can be reduced with the right preparation.**

“Every spring storm season brings its own unique challenges, so it’s important to prepare ahead for what this season will bring,” said State Farm spokesperson Keiana Holleman. “Knowing what’s covered in your policy—and what isn’t—will inform your next steps so you can smoothly recover from any loss from hail damage. Reaching out to your State Farm agent is the best first step in the process.”

**1. Create a Home Inventory To Prep for Storms**

One way to prepare for spring and hail storm season is to meet with your agent to make sure you understand your policy, take photos or videos of everything in your home, or create a detailed list of your belongings. Having a home inventory at your fingertips can simplify the claims process after a storm.

**2. Prepare Before the Storm Hits**

When a storm approaches, execute your emergency plan to protect your family and your home. Here’s what to do:

* **Create a survival kit**. Include batteries, flashlights, water, non-perishable food, chargers and first aid supplies.
* **Bring pets indoors**. Ensure the safety of your animals by bringing them inside or another safe space.
* **Secure outdoor items**. Store furniture, potted plants and any valuables inside.

**3. Quick Recovery After the Storm**

After the storm passes, wait until it’s safe to assess any damage. Hailstorms can damage roofs, decks, outdoor personal property and vehicles parked outside. Document any damage to support your claims. State Farm customers can file claims by contacting their local agent, calling 1-800-SF-CLAIM, visiting statefarm.com or using the State Farm mobile app.

**4. Watch Out for Scams**

In the aftermath of hailstorms, scams targeting homeowners are common. Before hiring contractors for repairs, do your research to ensure they are licensed and reputable. To add an extra layer of security, contact your local agent for assistance. Taking the time to verify and keeping your insurance agent informed can help protect you from contractor fraud.

**5. Consider Upgrading Your Roof**

For residents in hail-prone areas, investing in an impact-resistant roof can reduce damage to your home. Replacing wood shingles with more durable materials may save you money in the long run.

By taking the right precautions and being prepared, you can minimize hail damage and ensure a smoother recovery process.
