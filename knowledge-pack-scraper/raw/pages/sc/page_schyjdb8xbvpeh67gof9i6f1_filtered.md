1. 1

   Contact your insurer

   Call customer service or log into your online account portal. Most insurers have dedicated education departments that handle student discounts more efficiently than general customer service representatives.
2. 2

   Request the good student discount

   Tell your insurer you want to apply for the good student discount and confirm you meet the basic requirements like age limits and GPA thresholds before proceeding.
3. 3

   Submit documentation

   Upload or mail official transcripts, recent report cards showing your GPA or certificates from honor roll programs. Some insurers accept standardized test scores as alternative proof of academic achievement.

   **Accepted documentation**:

   * Official school transcripts (most common)
   * Recent report cards showing GPA
   * Dean's List or Honor Roll certificates
   * Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)
4. 4

   Wait for processing

5. 5

   Receive confirmation

   Your updated policy documents will reflect the new discount, and you should see the savings on your next billing statement. Set calendar reminders to resubmit proof each renewal period.

3. **Multi-policy discounts:** If your family has bundled policies, you can still use those savings while keeping your good student discount.

When a good student discount isn’t available, other ways to save include these alternative discounts:

![blueCheckmark icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blue_checkmark_cucw0x.svg)

Safe driving discounts for clean records

Maintaining a clean driving record can save you hundreds of dollars each year. Most insurers offer discounts to drivers who avoid accidents and traffic violations for at least three to five years.

![blueCheckmark icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blue_checkmark_cucw0x.svg)

Defensive driving course discounts

Completing an approved defensive driving course, often available online, can cut your premium by 5% to 10%. The discount usually stays active for about three years, making it a practical way to save long term.

![blueCheckmark icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blue_checkmark_cucw0x.svg)

Low mileage discounts for students who rarely drive

If you drive less than 7,500 miles a year, you may qualify for a low mileage discount. Students who only use their cars for short trips, such as driving to campus and back home, often benefit the most.

![blueCheckmark icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/blue_checkmark_cucw0x.svg)

Telematics programs that reward safe driving

Some insurers offer mobile apps that track how you drive, measuring habits like braking, acceleration, and phone use. Safe driving through these programs can earn discounts of up to 30% over time.

### Other Ways Students Can Save on Car Insurance

Here are more ways students and teens can save beyond good student discounts:

1. 1

   Add a driver to the current insurance

   Young drivers usually pay higher insurance rates because of limited experience. Instead of buying a separate policy, adding a student to an existing plan is the [cheapest car insurance option](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) for young drivers.  
   Different rates apply by age. For example, the cheapest car insurance company charges $2,462 per year for 19-year-olds, while the most affordable policy for 22-year-olds costs $1,562 annually.
2. 2

   Practice good driving

   Keeping a clean driving record helps lower your costs over time. A [violation or accident on your driving record](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-the-average-cost-of-car-insurance-month-year/#why-your-rates-are-high) can quickly raise your premiums.
3. 3

   Pay in full

   [No-down-payment car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/no-down-payment-car-insurance/) offers low upfront costs, but paying your premium in full usually saves more in the long run.
4. 4

   Consider pay-per-mile insurance

   Students who drive less than 12,000 miles a year may save by choosing [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/). Premiums depend on total mileage and driving habits.
5. 5

   Set up automatic payments

   Automatic payments prevent missed bills that could lead to cancellation and may come with a small discount. Many insurers offer 2% to 5% off for using autopay.
6. 6

   Shop around

   The [best car insurance company](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies/) depends on your personal needs and situation. Compare insurance quotes from multiple insurers to find the best rate.

### Car Insurance Good Student Discount: FAQ

Good student discount policies often raise questions about eligibility, requirements, and savings. Here are clear answers to the most common ones:

### Should I stay on my parents’ car insurance policy or get my own?

It’s usually cheaper to stay on your parents’ policy because of shared premiums and family discounts. If you’re under 21, live at home during breaks, or regularly use a family car, staying on their plan makes sense. Once you graduate or move out permanently, it’s time to get your own policy.

### What happens if my GPA drops below the requirement mid-semester?

Many insurers offer a one-semester grace period if your grades temporarily fall below the cutoff. Contact your insurer within 30 days to discuss your options. They may accept alternate qualifications such as test scores or grant a short extension. Reaching out to the student services department is often more helpful than calling general customer service.

### Can homeschool students get good student discounts?

Most major insurers extend good student discounts to homeschooled students. Accepted documentation may include SAT scores of 1,200 or higher, ACT scores of 26 or above, dual-enrollment transcripts with at least a 3.0 GPA, or certified educator portfolio assessments. You’ll need to renew each year with updated records.

### Which states offer the best good student discounts?

Discount amounts vary by state because insurance regulations differ. Vermont offers the highest at 19%, while Hawaii doesn't allow this discount. Other strong savings include Ohio at 17%, Michigan at 16% and Texas at 15%. Massachusetts caps it at 5%, and California allows up to 20%. Check with your state insurance department for the exact limits.

### Do good student discounts work for graduate students?

Most insurers extend the benefit through graduate school until age 25, though some go up to 26. Professional students may qualify beyond that. You must maintain full-time enrollment and good academic standing. For example, State Farm covers PhD students through age 29. Contact your insurer’s education department to confirm eligibility.
