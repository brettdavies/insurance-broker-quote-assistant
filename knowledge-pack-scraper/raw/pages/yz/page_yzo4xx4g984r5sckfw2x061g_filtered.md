The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/)’ 2025 report on the largest car insurance companies in the U.S. reveals the industry is continuing to consolidate: The top five insurers held a cumulative market share of 63.59% in 2024, up from 62.49% in 2023.

The top two providers, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) and [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625), account for more than 35% of the market by themselves.

[Nationwide](https://secure.money.com/pr/l9470b585c8a), meanwhile, fell out of the top 10 entirely, slipping from No. 10 to No. 13.

The report also reinforces how car insurance rates [continue to outpace](https://www.cnbc.com/select/average-cost-of-full-car-insurance-went-up-in-2024/) the cost of living: While inflation increased 3% between 2023 and 2024, direct written premiums shot up more than 13%.

## How to save on car insurance

**Shop around:** There can be huge differences among insurance companies for the same basic policy. Get rate quotes from at least three providers [every time you’re up for renewal](https://www.cnbc.com/select/when-to-switch-car-insurance/) to ensure you’re getting the best deal.

**Pay your whole premium upfront:** Most companies charge a fee for dividing your premium into monthly payments. You can often receive a discount for setting up autopay, as well.

**Bundle home and auto insurance:** Getting multiple lines of insurance [from the same carrier](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) doesn’t just simplify your life, it can result in discounts of up to 25%.  
  
**Take advantage of other discounts:** Rate reductions are often available to safe drivers, [good students](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-get-car-insurance-student-discounts/), homeowners, [members of the military](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-military/) and others. The nation’s largest car insurance company, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) has a discount of up to 30% if you use its Drive Safe & Save mobile app to track your driving.  
  
**Consider pay-per-mile insurance:** If you don’t drive often, a [pay-per-mile policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/) can save you more than 40% over traditional insurance. You’re charged a daily flat rate plus a few cents per mile.  
  
**Improve your credit score:** In most states, insurance companies can use your credit history [when calculating your rates](https://www.cnbc.com/select/credit-score-save-on-car-insurance/). Paying off debts, lowering your [credit utilization ratio](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-credit-utilization-rate/) and reporting errors or fraud are all ways to boost your FICO score.

**Select a higher deductible:** Raising your deductible from $200 to $500 can reduce the cost of collision and comprehensive coverage by as much as 30%, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/nine-ways-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs#:~:text=Ask%20for%20higher%20deductibles&amp;text=By%20requesting%20higher%20deductibles%2C%20you,you%2040%20percent%20or%20more.), while upping it to $1,000 can save you 40% or more. Just make sure you have adequate savings to cover the difference.

Your car insurance deductible is the amount you’re responsible for paying for repairs or replacement of your vehicle before your insurer contributes anything. Drivers can select their deductible when buying a policy and, typically, a higher deductible means lower premiums.
