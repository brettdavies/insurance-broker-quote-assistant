**Drive Safe & Save** is State Farm’s usage-based (telematics) program that looks at how you drive and may adjust your auto premium accordingly. Safer habits can translate to lower rates, while risky patterns may reduce or negate discounts. Below, we unpack how the program generally works, what data it collects, who benefits most, and practical tips to maximize savings—plus how to compare alternatives “near me” if you want a side-by-side quote.

## Drive Safe & Save — program snapshot

Exact features and results can vary by state and policy. Always review your specific enrollment materials.

| Area | Typical approach | What to verify | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enrollment | Opt-in at policy start/renewal; app or device | Eligibility, vehicles, drivers included | Enroll all daily drivers for best results |
| Measurement | Smartphone telematics and/or car data | Which signals are used in your state | Keep Bluetooth & location services on |
| Discounting | Safe patterns → savings; risky → lower/no discount | Whether surcharges apply in your state | Focus on consistency over a few “perfect” trips |
| Review cadence | Feedback via app; adjustments at renewal | When data starts/stops impacting price | Set monthly reminders to check scores |

Programs update over time; the current policy documents and app disclosures control.

## What affects a Drive Safe & Save discount

| Signal | Why it matters | How to improve | Real-world tip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hard braking / rapid acceleration | Strong predictor of claim frequency | Increase following distance; anticipate lights | Use cruise control on open highways |
| Speed relative to limit | Excess speed increases severity | Obey limits; avoid late departures | Set phone reminders to leave 5–10 minutes earlier |
| Time of day (night) | Night driving has higher loss ratios | Shift errands to daylight where possible | Batch trips to reduce nighttime mileage |
| Phone interaction | Distraction raises crash risk | Enable Do Not Disturb While Driving | Use mounts and voice assistants only |
| Miles driven | Less exposure → fewer losses | Carpool, transit, remote days | Combine grocery, school, and gym in one loop |

The relative weight of each factor can differ by state and version of the program.

## Setup & data collected (typical)

| Step | What you do | Data involved | Privacy tip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Download & enroll | Install app, link policy/vehicles | Account, VIN, driver phone number | Use the primary driver’s device |
| Permissions | Enable location, motion, Bluetooth | Trip detection & driver ID | Check battery optimization settings |
| Trip tagging | Confirm you were the driver (not a passenger) | Trip time, speed, events | Fix misclassified trips within the app window |
| Ongoing use | Drive normally; review scores | Aggregated driving metrics | Read in-app privacy disclosures and FAQs |

Enrollment terms, device requirements, and data handling are governed by State Farm’s disclosures and your state’s rules.

## Pros & cons (who this fits—and who should skip)

| For you if… | Why it helps | Maybe skip if… | Alternative approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| You drive mostly in daylight, low miles | Signals favor smoother, lower-exposure driving | Frequent night/high-speed highway driving | Ask us to test non-telematics carriers too |
| You rarely touch your phone in motion | Reduces distraction penalties | You rely on maps/ride-share apps constantly | Use mounted, voice-only workflows or compare options |
| You’re comfortable with app permissions | Reliable trip detection improves results | Privacy concerns outweigh potential savings | Consider traditional discounts (bundle, defensive driver) |

Not financial advice. Your actual premium impact depends on your state, policy, and driving patterns.

## Troubleshooting & privacy escalation

| Issue | Quick fix | When to escalate | Documentation to keep |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trips not recording | Check location/Bluetooth/battery settings | If >48 hrs of trips missing | Screenshots of settings & app version |
| Passenger trips counted | Re-tag trips promptly in app | Pattern persists across weeks | Trip IDs and correction timestamps |
| Score seems off | Compare event map to routes | Frequent false hard-brake flags | Route screenshots; speed-limit evidence |
| Privacy questions | Review program disclosures | Need formal review of data handling | Download privacy notice; support ticket # |

Program support channels can vary. Keep written records of any enrollment or scoring issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Can Drive Safe & Save raise my premium?

Discounts and adjustments are state-specific. Some states only allow discounts; others may reduce or remove the discount if risky driving is detected. Your enrollment documents explain how pricing works where you live.

Do all drivers on my policy need the app?

You’ll generally get the best results when all regular drivers participate. If a driver opts out, their vehicle may not earn the same discount impact.

What if I drive for work or late at night?

Nighttime and high-mileage driving can reduce potential savings. We can compare your rate with non-telematics carriers to see whether a standard plan fits better.

Will the app track my exact location?

Telematics uses location and motion data to assess trips. Review the in-app privacy policy for details on collection, use, and retention in your state.

How quickly do I see savings?

You may see an initial enrollment benefit and then an updated discount at renewal based on recorded driving. Timing varies by state and policy term.
