Founded in Chicago in 1902 to advocate for the construction of a cross-country highway system, the [American Automobile Association (AAA)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/aaa/) is a not-for-profit member association of 32 regional motor clubs across the U.S. In addition to top-rated roadside assistance and other member benefits, AAA also sells auto and home insurance in all 50 states — but it’s underwritten by a number of different companies.
[State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/state-farm/) specialized in cheap auto coverage for farmers when founded in 1922, but it’s since expanded to become the [largest car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the U.S., with over 18 percent of the market share for private passenger auto. State Farm’s auto insurance, which is generally priced below the national average, is just one of a wide range of insurance and financial services products offered by the company.

Our verdict
While AAA auto insurance comes with some unique member perks and other services, especially for policyholders who take a lot of road trips, State Farm tends to score better in customer satisfaction and claims handling studies. However, rates and availability of both coverage and discounts may vary by state, especially for AAA customers, so a careful AAA vs. State Farm insurance review is warranted in every individual case.

## Is AAA cheaper than State Farm?
Actual car insurance rates from AAA and State Farm vary widely based on [personal rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), location and, in the case of AAA, the company underwriting the coverage. However, looking at [average auto insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) for both carriers may help you determine which company might fit better with your profile. Bankrate’s insurance editorial team compiled the latest rates available from Quadrant Information Services in the table below to give the big picture of AAA car insurance vs. State Farm costs.
Driver profile |  AAA avg. full coverage premium |  State Farm avg. full coverage premium  
---|---|---  
[Young driver (age 25)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) |  $2,752 |  $3,171  
[Senior driver (age 70)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) |  $2,261 |  $2,557  
[Good driver, good credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/good-credit/) |  $2,299 |  $2,711  
[Good driver, poor credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) |  $4,782 |  $10,005

Bankrate's take
It is important to mention that our comparison table usually includes rates for [drivers with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) on their record. State Farm typically does not write auto insurance policies for drivers with a DUI, so rates have not been included. Finding affordable auto coverage after a DUI conviction is a serious challenge, as some carriers will decline to write policies for customers with previous DUIs and others may quote exorbitantly high rates. If you’re struggling to find insurance with a DUI on your driving record, you may need to seek [quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) from multiple companies to find one willing to work with you.
As you can see, AAA’s average rates are cheaper than State Farm’s in most situations. However, it’s important to keep in mind that rates are subject to change and may vary considerably based on your individual profile. It’s also worth noting that State Farm [plans to raise rates in certain states](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/02/22/auto-home-insurance-rates-rising-illinois/) and may continue to institute rate hikes in various locations.
## AAA vs. State Farm: discounts
Most auto insurance companies offer at least a handful of potential discounts. Common [car insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) most providers offer include bundling discounts, safe driving discounts and telematics programs. Before you decide on a carrier, it’s worth looking into the ways each company allows policyholders to [save on car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/).
### Discounts available from both carriers
Both State Farm and AAA offer discounts for:
  * **Bundling home and auto insurance:** Customers who purchase both home and auto insurance from AAA are eligible for discounts, while State Farm offers bundling discounts to auto customers who are the named insured on a home, renters, life, health or condo policy.
  * **Insuring multiple vehicles:** If two or more vehicles in your household are insured by AAA or State Farm, you may earn a discounted rate.
  * **Good students:** Full-time high school or college students with at least a B average or a 3.0 GPA may be eligible for discounts from both AAA and State Farm.
  * **Defensive driving:** AAA and State Farm both offer discounts in some states to drivers who complete an approved defensive driving course.
  * **Teen driver education:** State Farm’s [Steer Clear](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/steer-clear) and AAA’s [teenSMART](https://www.adeptdriver.com/teensmart/) allow young drivers to complete driver training programs in exchange for insurance discounts. Note that AAA’s teenSMART availability may vary based on club region.
  * **Distant student:** If your household includes a college student studying at least 100 miles from home without a car, you might be eligible for a discounted rate from either carrier.
  * **Vehicle safety:** Both State Farm and AAA offer some discounts for vehicle safety equipment like airbags and antilock brakes.
  * **Anti-theft discount:** If your vehicle has an anti-theft device like an alarm, you may qualify for a discount from either AAA or State Farm.
  * **Good drivers:** Eligibility details vary, but both State Farm and AAA advertise discounted rates for good drivers who stay accident- and violation-free for a certain period.


#### AAA discounts
AAA discounts may vary depending on your regional club’s offerings and the company underwriting the coverage. To help drivers understand which discounts they’re eligible for, AAA offers a free [Triple Check](https://autoclubsouth.aaa.com/insurance/triple-check-auto-policy-review.aspx) policy review program.
  * **Member discounts:** AAA members can earn a discount of up to 10 percent discount on auto insurance, along with [discounts and deals](https://discounts.aaa.com/) for gas, rental cars and much more.
  * **Advanced shopping discount:** Drivers may be eligible for a discount of 5 percent if they purchase a policy more than seven days before the coverage begins on a vehicle that was previously covered by another policy for at least six continuous months.
  * **Loyalty discount:** Policyholders may save if they have had a continuous AAA auto insurance policy for a set number of years.
  * **Payment discounts:** Policyholders who set up paperless billing or pay their premium in full may be eligible for discounted rates from AAA.


#### State Farm discounts
  * **Accident-free discount:** Policyholders may receive [a discount](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts) for remaining accident-free for a set period of time. Savings may increase every year without an accident.


### AAA and State Farm telematics programs
In recent years, most major auto insurers have adopted smartphone-based telematics programs, which allow drivers to earn potential discounts based on safe driving data tracked by an app. Both AAA and State Farm offer telematics programs. We’ve highlighted State Farm’s [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) program, but it also offers a [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) program for drivers under 25. Depending on their location, AAA customers may be eligible for one of a few different telematics programs, including AAADrive, AAA OnBoard and SMARTtrek. We’ve highlighted AAADrive here.
|  AAADrive |  State Farm Drive Safe & Save  
---|---|---  
**Device** |  Mobile app |  Mobile app and Bluetooth beacon  
**Can it raise your rate?** |  No |  No  
**Availability** |  Select states |  All states where coverage is offered except CA, MA and RI (limited availability in NC)

**What it monitors** |  Mobile phone interactions, smooth driving, speed, time of day, trip duration, fatigue |  Annual mileage (in some states), acceleration, braking, cornering, phone distraction, speed

## AAA vs. State Farm: customer experience comparison
Customer service and satisfaction may be a key metric for many drivers choosing a car insurance company. Mobile app ratings may help drivers determine how easily they can access digital tools and file claims. We also analyzed the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study) to see how satisfied customers may be with each company’s service. For reference, the segment average in the J.D. Power study is 697/1,000.

### Customer complaints
The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) tracks customer complaints for U.S. insurers and assigns a score to each company based on its rate of complaints relative to market share. The resulting score, known as an NAIC Complaint Index, gives a general indication of how satisfied (or dissatisfied) policyholders are with a particular company. Scores above the baseline of 1.00 suggest overall dissatisfaction, while scores below 1.00 indicate that the company’s customer service may be better than most.
#### AAA auto insurance customer complaints
Because AAA auto insurance policies are underwritten by multiple companies, we looked at NAIC scores for three of the largest AAA insurers: Auto Club Property-Casualty Insurance Company, Automobile Club Group and CSAA General Insurance Company. CSAA and Automobile Club Group’s scores are the most consistently positive.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

  * **Tier 1 (Ratings):** To determine a life insurance company’s financial health and reliability, we assessed several industry-standard ratings, such as [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Comdex, the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC), and credit agencies like Moody’s, Fitch and [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage options):** We assessed companies’ coverage options, availability and policy features to help policyholders find a provider that best meets their needs. We examined each company’s life insurance product lines, including term, whole and universal life options.
  * **Tier 3 (Accessibility & process): **To assess the ease and transparency of applying for coverage, we reviewed the simplicity of obtaining a quote and insurers' underwriting processes — including eligibility requirements. We also considered insurers’ community engagement.
