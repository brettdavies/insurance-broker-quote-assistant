# State Farm is Fighting every step of my claim

I'll make it quick. I have an older home with a main ceramic roof of indeterminate age, a secondary ceramic roof that is about 20 years old, and a garage roof that is asphalt shingle. Last year, we had a large hail storm that damaged all three.

I filed a claim, but State Farm gave an estimate that was nearly an order of magnitude below what numerous roofing contractors, including the one sent by the insurance company, have said that it will cost to repair. They've all said that they won't even touch the roof for the amount that State Farm is estimating.

They keep coming up with different excuses for not adjusting the repair cost. Now they just want to "repair" a small part of each room wit non-matching USED tiles or shingles. Doing so would look horrific and compromise the look and functionality of the home. How can you replace 1/3 of a shingle roof or tiles on a ceramic roof with tile that doesn't even match and isn't the same spec? How can you guarantee the quality of a used material?

Their initial claim was that since one part of the roof had a pre-existing repair on it that they didn't have to match the look of any of the other parts of the roof. Now they are saying that my roof is "degraded" so they can't be expected to fix it.

Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not the one who decided to offer a policy to cover a "degraded" roof. It was obviously good enough to write a policy for and take my premiums, paid in good faith for coverage, every month. Has anyone had experience with this? What are my options? Any recommendations?
