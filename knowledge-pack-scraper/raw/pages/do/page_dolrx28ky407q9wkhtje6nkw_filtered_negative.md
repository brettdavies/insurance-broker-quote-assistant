Umbrella rates as others have said depending on area and variety of factors: Biggest cost drivers will be # of vehicles in the household and having younger (< 21 years old) drivers, especially males will make a big impact. Your biggest exposure/risk is certainly auto related over home liability.
I'm an insurance broker and feel that having umbrella to cover your net worth/assets is overkill once your net worth grows. Some other comments steer towards $2MM for higher networth folks as an adequate amount and I tend to agree. $1MM is recommended for anyone that owns a home IMO and has some assets, $2MM for those with a higher net worth and > $2MM if you have a much larger net worth and want to sleep better at night.

A decent rule of thumb for anyone is to do $1M or match your net worth.
Two additional thoughts would be: you can exclude your employer plans as part of the calculation as those ought to be protected by regulations, and it’s usually cheaper to go ahead and lock in now vs later.
I have $1M for roughly $168/year.
I also wouldn’t blink twice about protecting $2M for a diff of $700/year. Insurance is to protect against freak accidents. Better to have and never need vs kicking yourself over pennies in the grand scheme of it.

My understanding is that 1 million covers nearly all scenarios and 2 million covers virtually all scenarios with very few exceptions. There is a good bogglehead video on this.

Over about $2M, it's probably a good idea to consider setting up an asset protection trust instead of carrying higher umbrella insurance. Some states allow them, and if your state doesn't, you can get a foreign asset protection trust instead.

I’m paying $230 for $1m. I was thinking of upping it since it’s so cheap. I have all my policies with a single carrier so I think that plays into the rate.

In my opinion, the umbrella policy gets you professional representation against lawsuits. When there's a million dollars of the insurance company's money on the line, they send a decent lawyer to deal with it.
The main benefit to me is in the first $1MM of coverage so that's what I carry.

My planner showed us data on judgements in our state and recommended $2 mil in coverage. Costs about $350 per year. More if you consider your auto insurance premiums also may go up. My insurance company has higher minimum auto liability coverage when paired with an umbrella policy.

Specifics matter so don't trust random spot quotes from strangers on the internet. It's easy to get a quote through an agent (~10min and tailored to your particular circumstances since umbrella forms are striaghtforward) for both RLI (which I believe is what is being offered through the GEICO "bundle" that some folks mention in CA) and another company called Markel (which can be a good fit if you're not eligible for RLI for some reason-- often ownership of properties abroad or certain accident histories). You don't have to get on the phone or interact with a human at all unless you have specific policy questions/clarifications. There's no sales pressure from talking to an agent and its a low cost time investment so worth checking.
If you're not in one of those states RLI likely sells direct and online and can probably get you a quote fast through their online portal (can't vouch for this part though only heard about it second hand).
source: we sell hundreds of umbrella policies a year in CA, FL, NY, TX, and WA

My understanding is that you want umbrella insurance at least equal to your net worth.

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.
