## Steer Clear program: State Farm young driver discount

Each year young people begin learning the art of driving. State Farm understands young drivers are challenged by internal and external factors as they are driving on the roadways. To help them learn more about driving, State Farm has designed the Steer Clear program to stress how experience and awareness make a safer driver.  
   
 The Steer Clear program’s purpose is to help young drivers be aware of their surroundings, give them insight into their driving styles, help them review their driving skills and become a more aware, stress-free driver. The completion of the Steer Clear program can result in up to a 15 percent discount on the driver’s auto insurance. Drivers under the age of 25 are eligible for the discount; the program takes around 60 days to complete.  
   
 To begin the program, drivers must meet with their State Farm agent to receive the Steer Clear kit. After meeting with their agent, drivers must complete the following activities provided in the kit: watch an 11-minute video, read the Steer Clear magazine and complete a driver’s log. In completing the Steer Clear Driver’s Log, participants under age 18 must complete 30 driving trips with at least 10 supervised trips lasting a minimum of 15 minutes. Participants 18 years of age and older must complete 20 driving trips lasting a minimum of 15 minutes. Lastly, the participant must complete the quiz at the end of the driver’s log.  
   
 Once a driver has completed these activities, the participant must again meet with their State Farm agent and return their driver’s log in order to receive the discount. This program was developed by State Farm to encourage young drivers to build safe and roadworthy habits that will help them to make more responsible decisions when driving.
