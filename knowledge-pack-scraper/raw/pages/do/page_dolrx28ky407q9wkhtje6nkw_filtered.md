"Have enough in the bank to do what you want." This is a place for people who have reached or are interested in reaching the milestone of Coast Financial Independence / Retire Early (aka Coast FIRE). Coast FIRE is when you have enough saved and invested that with no additional contributions, your net worth will increase with compounding growth to support a traditional retirement. Coast FIRE is all about using your savings to unlock freedom before hitting regular FIRE.
