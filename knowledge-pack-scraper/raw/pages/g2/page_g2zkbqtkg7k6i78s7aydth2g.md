## Understanding SR-22 insurance in Colorado
SR-22 insurance isn't a separate type of insurance. It's a form your insurance company files with the state to show that you carry the minimum car insurance required to drive in Colorado. When people say SR-22 insurance, they're generally talking about car insurance that includes an SR-22 filing by the insurance company on your behalf.
Most drivers in Colorado don't need SR-22 insurance. The drivers who do need it usually have serious violations, such as DUIs, reckless driving, or several offenses within a short period. If you're required to file an SR-22, the state will tell you how long you need to keep it.
"Certain things trigger the requirement for an SR-22 filing, such as a DUI, having a lot of points on your license, getting into an accident without insurance, or having your license suspended or revoked. But in every case, the driver is notified by the DMV that they are required to have this form. You would have to check the box that you are required to have an SR 22 filing. The insurance company typically charges a fee to file or maintain that filing, which varies by insurance company," says Dorothy Cato with Skyway Insurance Services LLC in Monroe, North Carolina.
## How much does SR-22 insurance cost in Colorado?
Filing an SR-22 form doesn't cost much, but the fines and increased insurance rates can be expensive. On average, SR-22 insurance in Colorado costs $3,150 per year, but the actual rate depends on the driver and the specific violation.
Insurance companies charge different rates, so it's smart to shop around and find the cheapest SR-22 insurance available.
## Average SR-22 insurance cost in Colorado by violation
