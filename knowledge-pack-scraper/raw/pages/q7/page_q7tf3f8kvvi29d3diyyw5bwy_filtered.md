**Not available in Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana or Oklahoma.** Homeowners in these states will need to look for other insurers.

## What Nationwide home insurance covers

These types of home insurance coverage generally come standard:

Personal property coverage comes in one of two options: [actual cash value or replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

  **Typical amount:** 50-70% of dwelling coverage.
* ### Loss of use

For more details, see [What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/understanding-homeowners-insurance)

A Nationwide homeowners policy includes the standard coverage you’d expect as well as insurance that other companies often charge extra for. For instance, you may be able to get [ordinance or law coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/ordinance-or-law-coverage) for no additional cost; this pays to bring your house up to building codes during rebuilding or repairs after a claim, up to your policy limit.

In most states, a Nationwide home insurance policy also covers losses up to $500 due to unauthorized credit or debit transactions, forged checks or counterfeit money. You can upgrade to $10,000 worth of coverage.

Nationwide policyholders in most states can sign up to receive a free Ting sensor, which monitors your home for electrical problems to help prevent problems. The offer includes five years of monitoring and $1,000 to use for repairing any problems Ting identifies.

### Optional Nationwide home insurance coverage

Depending on where you live and which policy you have, you may be able to add the following features:

**[Extended replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/extended-replacement-cost)**, which increases your dwelling coverage limit in case it costs more than expected to rebuild your home after a covered disaster.

**Brand New Belongings**, which pays enough to restore damaged belongings or replace them with new items. (A default homeowners policy covers older items for only their depreciated value.) Learn more about [actual cash value vs. replacement cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost).

**Better Roof Replacement**, which pays to rebuild your roof with stronger materials if it’s damaged for a covered reason.

**[Identity theft coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance)** to monitor your personal data and help with resolution if your identity is stolen.

**Additional valuables coverage** for jewelry, art and other high-value belongings.

**[Water backup coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage)** for damage due to an overflowing sump pump or a backed-up drain.

[**Equipment breakdown coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/equipment-breakdown-coverage-homeowners), which pays to fix your appliances in case of an electrical, mechanical or pressure system breakdown.

Other optional coverage types may be available.

## More Nerdy Perspective

One of the biggest factors in how much you pay for homeowners insurance is the amount of coverage you buy. Get too little coverage, and you could find yourself underinsured after a major disaster. Get too much, and you’ll overpay. Here’s how to figure out [how much homeowners insurance you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need).

## Get home insurance quotes in minutes

Answer a few questions to see custom quotes and find the right policy for you.

Get Started

## Consumer satisfaction

**Complaints:** One strong sign of consumer satisfaction is how many people complain about their insurance company to state agencies. Nationwide is average on this measure, drawing a similar proportion of home insurance complaints compared to other U.S. insurers.

**How we determined our complaint scores**
We analyzed three years' worth of complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When comparing insurers, we accounted for company size and total premiums.

**Third-party ratings:** Nationwide ranked slightly above average in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study, which looks at customer satisfaction.[1] It was also above average in J.D. Power’s 2025 Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[2]

* ### What Reddit users say about Nationwide home insurance

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics, including financial subjects like home insurance. We used artificial intelligence to browse Reddit forums for posts about insurers, then manually sifted through the results and summed up consumer sentiment about each company. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.*

  Reddit comments about Nationwide include a mix of praise and complaints. Several posters say the company handles claims fairly, but others describe a rockier experience. One common complaint is that Nationwide may request modifications to your home in order to keep insuring it — for example, fixing cracked driveways, fencing in [trampolines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/trampoline-home-insurance) or repairing streaked roofs. Some Reddit users say that Nationwide and other insurance companies have gotten pickier about which homes they insure in an effort to reduce their risk.

## How to file a claim with Nationwide

You can file a Nationwide home insurance claim online, on the Nationwide mobile app or by calling 800-421-3535. Nationwide will assign an adjuster who will help you through the process from there.

Here are some key things to remember when filing a home insurance claim:

**Document the damage.** Take photos and create an inventory of damaged items. Provide details like labels and model numbers if possible, especially for more expensive items. Once you've documented the damage, you can make temporary repairs if it's safe to do so.

**File your claim as soon as possible.** This is especially important if the damage was caused by a storm, as it likely means other homes in the area were also affected.

**Save your receipts.** You may end up spending money on temporary repairs or living expenses before getting a payment from your insurance company. Keep all receipts so you can submit them for reimbursement later.

For more information, see [how to file a home insurance claim](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-damage-claims).

## How to contact Nationwide customer service

**Phone:** You can reach out to your local agent or call 877-669-6877 for help. Customer service staff is available weekdays between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET.

**Chat:** There's a chatbot on the Nationwide site that can answer basic questions.

## Online tools

**Website:** It’s easy to manage your homeowners policy on the Nationwide website, where you can pay bills, get quotes, and file and track claims. The site’s learning center features articles on a variety of home insurance topics.

**Mobile app:** On Nationwide’s mobile app, available for iOS and Android, you can view policy info, file claims, pay bills and enroll in autopay.

## Nationwide home insurance vs. competitors

### Nationwide home insurance vs. Allstate

The biggest differences between Nationwide and Allstate are:

**Consumer satisfaction.** Nationwide scored above average in two recent J.D. Power customer satisfaction studies, while Allstate ranked below average.

**Standard coverage.** Nationwide includes ordinance and law coverage as part of its standard home insurance policies, while Allstate charges extra for this coverage.

Read our [Allstate home insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/allstate-home-insurance-review) for more information.

### Nationwide home insurance vs. GEICO

The main difference between Nationwide and GEICO is that Nationwide sells its own policies, while GEICO sells homeowners insurance through third parties. The coverage you get from GEICO will depend on which insurer it pairs you with. If you have a claim, you’ll need to file with the third-party company.

## Frequently asked questions

### Does Nationwide home insurance cover mobile phones?

Yes, cell phones are covered for theft and certain types of damage up to the personal property limit on your policy. Note that a [home insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible) applies to this coverage, so if your phone is stolen but it’s worth less than your deductible, filing a claim probably doesn’t make sense.

### What other types of insurance does Nationwide offer?

Nationwide sells many types of coverage, from flood to umbrella insurance. Check out NerdWallet's take on several of these products:

* [Nationwide auto insurance review](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/nationwide-auto-insurance-review).

### Does Nationwide insure mobile homes?

No. If you’re looking for other options, see NerdWallet’s guide to [mobile home insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/mobile-home-insurance).

### Does Nationwide home insurance cover water leaks?

It depends. Homeowners insurance is designed to cover sudden, accidental losses, not wear and tear or maintenance. So if a pipe suddenly bursts, sending water all over your basement, your homeowners policy would likely cover any resulting damage. But if a drain has been leaking slowly for months and you didn’t discover it until mold started growing, that damage would be considered a maintenance issue and would not be covered. Learn more about [homeowners insurance and water damage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage).

### Why is Nationwide dropping my homeowners policy?

Insurance companies like Nationwide may refuse to renew your homeowners policy for a variety of reasons, even if you’ve never filed a claim or been late with a payment. Sometimes they’re trying to reduce their coverage in a certain geographic area. In other cases, they may be reluctant to insure your home because it has an older roof or some other potential risk factor for a claim.

### Why did Nationwide raise my homeowners premium so much?

It’s not just Nationwide. Insurance companies are raising rates across the U.S. Inflation has made it more expensive to repair and rebuild houses, and recent natural disasters (such as [hurricanes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/hurricane-insurance) and [wildfires](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/wildfire-insurance)) have led to substantial claim payouts. Insurance companies are passing these costs along to policyholders. [Shopping around](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-to-shop-for-homeowners-insurance) with other insurers may help you find a better price.

**Star rating methodology**

NerdWallet’s homeowners insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts, claims process and website functionality. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or star ratings.

Here’s how we weighted each category to come up with our list of the best home insurance companies:

* Consumer experience (40%).
* Financial strength (30%).
* Coverage (25%).
* Discounts (5%).

Read our [full home insurance ratings methodology](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-home-insurance) for more details.

**Homeowners insurance rates methodology**

NerdWallet calculated median rates for 40-year-old homeowners from various insurance companies in the 25 largest cities in each U.S. state by population. All rates are rounded to the nearest $5.

Sample homeowners were nonsmokers with good credit living in a single-family, two-story home built in 1984. They had a $1,000 deductible and the following coverage limits:

* $300,000 in dwelling coverage.
* $30,000 in other structures coverage.
* $150,000 in personal property coverage.
* $60,000 in loss of use coverage.
* $300,000 in liability coverage.
* $1,000 in medical payments coverage.

We made minor changes to the sample policy in cases where rates for the above coverage limits or deductibles weren’t available.

In states where credit is a rating factor, we changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for homeowners with poor credit.

These are sample rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different.

**Complaint methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2022-2024. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period.

NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
