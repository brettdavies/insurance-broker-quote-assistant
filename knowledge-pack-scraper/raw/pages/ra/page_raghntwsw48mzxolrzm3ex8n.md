California has specific laws to protect consumers’ personal information when dealing with insurance companies. The Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act (IIPPA) sets rules on how insurers collect, use, and share individuals’ data. This law aims to balance the industry’s need for information with consumer privacy rights. 
## Who Must Comply
The IIPPA applies to insurance companies, agents, brokers, and any business that collects, maintains, or discloses personal information in connection with insurance applications, underwriting, or claims processing. This includes health, life, property, casualty, and disability insurers operating in California. Third-party administrators and service providers handling consumer data for insurance purposes must also comply. 
Additionally, insurance support organizations, such as investigative firms, medical information bureaus, and consumer reporting agencies, fall under the law’s jurisdiction. These entities play a key role in risk assessment and fraud prevention and must meet the same transparency and accountability standards as insurers. 
## Permitted and Prohibited Disclosures
The IIPPA establishes strict guidelines on how insurance-related personal information can be shared, distinguishing between permitted and prohibited disclosures. Insurers may disclose personal data when required by law, for underwriting decisions, or to prevent fraud. For instance, they can share information with law enforcement if fraud is suspected, provided such disclosures are legally justified and documented. 
Insurers may also share data with reinsurers, regulatory agencies, or actuarial firms assessing risk, but only when necessary for legitimate insurance functions. For marketing or non-essential purposes, explicit consumer consent is required. 
Unauthorized disclosures are strictly prohibited. Insurers cannot release a policyholder’s medical history to an employer without consent or sell customer data for unrelated business purposes. They must also implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent breaches, ensuring internal databases are accessible only to authorized personnel. 
## Access and Correction Requests
The IIPPA grants individuals the right to access their personal information held by insurers and request corrections if inaccuracies are found. To exercise this right, a policyholder or applicant must submit a written request specifying the information they wish to review. Insurers must provide access within 30 business days under California Insurance Code 791.08. 
If errors or outdated information are identified, individuals can request corrections. Insurers must respond within 30 business days, either making the requested changes or providing a written explanation for denial. If a correction is refused, individuals can submit a statement of dispute, which insurers must include in future disclosures of the contested information. 
For medical records, insurers may require that they be provided through a designated medical professional rather than directly to the individual. This prevents misinterpretation of complex medical data while still ensuring compliance with access requests. 
## Enforcement Measures
The California Department of Insurance (CDI) enforces the IIPPA through audits, investigations, and regulatory actions. The Insurance Commissioner has the authority to issue subpoenas, conduct hearings, and compel document production to ensure compliance. 
If violations are found, the CDI can issue cease-and-desist orders, requiring insurers to revise procedures, retrain employees, or enhance security measures. Repeated violations can lead to license suspension or revocation, ensuring that companies handling sensitive consumer information adhere to privacy laws. 
## How to Report Violations
Consumers who suspect an insurer has violated the IIPPA can report it to the CDI through its online Consumer Complaint Center, by mail, or via the department’s consumer hotline. Complaints should include the insurer’s name, a description of the violation, and any supporting documentation. 
If the CDI does not take sufficient action, individuals may pursue legal remedies. Under California Insurance Code 791.13, they can seek civil damages if an insurer’s unlawful disclosure of personal information has caused harm. Additionally, violations may be prosecuted under California’s Unfair Competition Law, allowing the Attorney General or district attorneys to take legal action. These enforcement mechanisms ensure accountability and consumer protection.
