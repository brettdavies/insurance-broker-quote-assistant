## Country Financial car insurance review

With a Bankrate Score of 4.2 out of 5.0 for auto insurance, Country Financial is a competitive car insurance option in states where coverage is available. High customer satisfaction ratings from J.D. Power and a low rate of customer complaints put Country Financial above many competitors, but customers may pay higher premiums in exchange for superior service.

When it comes to [coverage](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/insurance/auto/car/coverage.html), Country Financial offers all the standard auto options along with some less-common endorsements like windshield replacement insurance, personal effects coverage and umbrella liability. The company also offers [some unique discounts](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/insurance/auto/car/discounts.html), like a discount for engaged couples and special rates for teachers and first responders. But policies are only available in 19 states, and customers who don't meet Country Financial's desired profile may have trouble finding affordable coverage.

### Pros and cons of Country Financial car insurance

While Country Financial excels in some areas, it might not be right for every driver.

## Country Financial life insurance review

In addition to home and auto insurance, Country Financial offers a range of life insurance products designed to meet various needs and budgets.

I’ve used Country Financial for the past ten years

“I’ve used Country Financial for the past ten years after State Farm dropped me over a small claim that I was told, by them, would not trigger them dropping me. My Country Financial rates have remained consistent since.”

Gotta play the game

"Our Country Financial after 24 years went up a lot the past few years with no claims. We are no longer with them, saved $2000 this year switching.
We know next year our new carrier will probably do the same, but gotta play the game."

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
