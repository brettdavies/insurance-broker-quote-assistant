* Hi. I’m thankful for Marlon Moss helping me. I can’t hear and with a lot of info to go through, he was willing to text with me instead of using video phone. It was easier for me to send pictures and private info. And on top of that, he found a good deal for me, enabling me to keep my old insurance from out of state. Thank you Marlon!!
