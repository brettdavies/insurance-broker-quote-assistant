## Is State Farm General Too Big to Fail? Calif. Rate Hearing Concludes

April 15, 2025 by [Susanne Sclafane](https://www.carriermanagement.com/author/susanne-sclafane/)
![](https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/bigstock-Home-In-Life-Preserver-On-Wate-8007654-620x564.jpg)
_During a three-day hearing about State Farm General’s request for an interim emergency homeowners insurance rate increase last week, testimony centered on the financial condition of the California affiliate of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company._
_There was much less discussion of factors used to develop and trend catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses to support an indicated double-digit rate increase_.
The extent of actuarial analysis required to support the stipulation remained a subject of debate during the hearing. Lawyers for CW argued that there needs to be a ratemaking analysis (comparing premiums to developed and trended losses on a prior-approval rate template) to show “plainly invalid rates.” The “plainly invalid” language comes from a 1989 Supreme Court of California decision outlining the commissioner’s power to grant interim rate relief (_[Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian](https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/calfarm-ins-co-v-deukmejian-31141)_). CDI and SFG take the position that a provision in the California Code of Regulations (CCR) regarding Proposed Stipulations and Settlements governs the process instead. That requires a showing to the ALJ that a stipulation is “fundamentally fair, adequate, reasonable and in the interests of justice” ([Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 10, § 2656.1 – Proposal of Stipulations or Settlements](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/10-CCR-2656.1)).
_Under_[ _Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian – 48 Cal.3d 805 S007838 – Thu, 05/04/1989_](https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/calfarm-ins-co-v-deukmejian-31141) _: “[T]he commissioner has the power to grant interim relief from plainly invalid rates… The power to grant interim relief is necessary for the due and efficient administration of Proposition 103, and may fairly be implied from its command that ‘[n]o rate shall…remain in effect which is excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory.'”_
_According to_[ _Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 10, § 2656.1 – Proposal of Stipulations or Settlements_](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/10-CCR-2656.1) _, “[P]arties supporting the stipulation or settlement shall file and serve supporting declarations indicating the reasons that the settlement or stipulation is fundamentally fair, adequate, reasonable and in the interests of justice.”_
_“Every mudslide, wildfire, major atmospheric river event…could open the floodgates to insurers demanding emergency interim rate hikes based solely on temporary financial setbacks or market fears,” Consumer Watchdog’s lawyer said._
![](https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/bigstock-Man-Help-To-Save-Life-Preserver-Insolvency-Vector-B-455171015-300x205.jpg)
_“There is no universe in which a 25 percent rate decrease is appropriate given the circumstances here,” a lawyer for State Farm General said._
(_Editor’s Note: There were three homeowners rate indications discussed during the hearing at different points._
_In June 2024, SFG originally filed for a 30 percent increase, in part, justifying that with reference to a section of the CCR that allows variance from the maximum permitted earned premium “in order to protect the insurer’s solvency” ([Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 10, § 2644.27 – Variance Request](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/10-CCR-2644.27), Variance 6)._
_Absent the Variance 6 request, the indicated change was a 10 percent decrease according to a table included in a Feb. 3, 2025, letter to Commissioner Lara. The table updated that prior template indication with a new catastrophe load incorporating loss estimates for the LA fires, resulting in an indicated 21.8 percent increase._
_In an April 4, 2025, stipulation, CDI and SFG agreed to a reduced increase—17 percent—in conjunction with State Farm Mutual providing a $400 million surplus note to SFG.)_
![](https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/flood-clock-245x300.jpg)“State Farm General has paid more in claims than it has collected in premiums for many years. That’s basic math. And we’re trying to fix the equation through the interim rate increases,” Wellington said. At one point in her summation, she also debunked an idea advanced by Armstrong that SFG created its own problems by failing to file for rate hikes in past years. That “suggests Consumer Watchdog believes that State Farm General’s rates should be higher now… And to be frank, a significant reason State Farm General has not been able to obtain the rate increases needed in years past is because of the inherent challenges with obtaining rate increases in California,” she said, noting that litigation over the insurer’s 2014 was not resolved until 2022.
_“A significant reason State Farm General has not been able to obtain the rate increases needed in years past is because of the inherent challenges with obtaining rate increases in California.”_
**_State Farm General Attorney Katherine Wellington_**
_“Why is that?” McKennedy asked._
_“These broader systemic problems, like other too-big-to-fail problems, need a whole of government response. They belong with the legislature, with the governor, the insurance commissioner through his market conduct powers, but they can’t be allowed to be relevant in a rate hearing.”_
**_William Pletcher, Attorney for Consumer Watchdog_**
_**Unasked Question**: Are SFG’s rates “plainly invalid” when analyzed with a modernized process that allows for the use of catastrophe models and a provision for reinsurance?_
