![A man and woman calling their agents to see if they have collision insurance after a car accident.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/do-i-need-collision-insurance.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_ **_Collision coverage is vital for protecting your vehicle. This coverage may help cover repair costs if your car sustains damage in a crash involving another vehicle or an object, such as a fence, regardless of who caused the incident. It’s important to understand what collision coverage includes and excludes, how deductibles and actual cash value (ACV) function and how to determine if this protection is the right decision for your vehicle and financial situation._
Auto insurance can be complicated, especially when you’re deciding whether you need collision coverage. This type of insurance is designed to protect your car in the event of a crash, covering damages regardless of who is at fault. Understanding [what collision insurance covers](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-collision-coverage), how it works and whether it’s right for your vehicle can make this decision easier. Let’s explore what you need to know about this coverage.

* [Liability coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage) — typically required by law depending on the state, this coverage can help pay for damages or injuries you cause to others. It does not cover your own vehicle or injuries.
* [Collision coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) — designed to protect your car, collision insurance pays for repairs or replacement if you’re involved in a crash, whether with another vehicle or an object like a pole or fence. This is often optional unless you are financing your car.
* [Comprehensive coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) — this covers non-collision-related damages, such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters or [hitting an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car). Like collision coverage, this is usually optional unless required by a lender.
[Hit-and-run](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-after-a-hit-and-run) damage to your parked car
[Car theft](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft)
[Hail](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/hail-damage-car), [flood](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-has-flood-damage) or [fire damage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-fire-what-to-do-if-it-happens-to-you)
* Premium — this is the regular fee you pay (monthly, quarterly, bi-annually or annually) for coverage. Generally, choosing a higher deductible results in a lower premium and vice versa. Balancing your premium and deductible [based on your budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown) is key.
Whether or not you need collision coverage depends on your car’s value, financial situation and whether you’re [leasing or financing your vehicle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/leasing-vs-buying-a-car). In most cases, collision insurance pays up to your car’s ACV at the time of the accident. ACV is determined by a car’s market value minus depreciation for wear and tear, age and mileage. It’s important to note that collision coverage will not pay for a brand-new replacement vehicle—it pays what your car was worth just before the accident.
* **Assess your car’s value.** Check online resources like [Kelley Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/) or the [National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)](https://www.nada.com/) to determine your car’s current worth.
* **Understand your deductible.** Can you comfortably afford to pay your deductible amount in the event of an accident? Choosing a higher or lower deductible can help you adjust your insurance premium.
* **Compare your premium.** How much does adding collision coverage cost per year?
* **Consider repair costs.** Without collision insurance, would you be able to pay for repairs or replace your car out-of-pocket?
If you’re still wondering, “Do I need collision coverage?” or “What is a collision deductible?” [talking to your insurance agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) can be helpful. They can offer personalized advice based on your car, budget and driving habits, and explain how potholes and related damages might be covered under your auto insurance policy. Additionally, reviewing your specific policy documents will help clarify what’s included in collision coverage.
