Renters insurance policies don't cover car theft, even if it happens on the rental property. If your car is stolen, your auto insurance policy should provide coverage. However, if personal belongings are stolen from your vehicle, both insurers' renters insurance policies will help cover them.
### Do State Farm and Lemonade Cover Moving Costs?
Neither insurer covers moving costs. However, if you must temporarily relocate due to a covered peril, the additional expenses portion of your policy may help cover moving costs.

Both insurers cover temporary housing costs if you're displaced from your home due to a covered peril. The additional living expenses portion of your renters insurance policy helps pay for costs that exceed typical living expenses, such as hotel and restaurant bills.

Both insurers offer a multi-policy discount when you bundle your renters and car insurance policies. Bundling discounts are a common way to help you save on your premium.
