_This post is part of a series sponsored by Darkhorse Insurance._
Ever wonder how much you’re really earning every time you close a deal? Understanding your insurance agent commission structure is the key to knowing where your income comes from and how to maximize it. Regardless of the policies you sell, your revenue depends on how those percentages stack up.
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but the good news is you’re in control of a lot of the variables. Let’s break it down so you can take charge of your earnings and build the career you want.
![](https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Caluclating-an-insurance-agent-commission-580x435.png)
## What is an Insurance Agent Commission?
This is the percentage of the premium you earn for selling an insurance policy. This is the primary way most agents get paid, especially for[ independent agents](https://darkhorseinsurance.com/benefits-of-becoming-an-independent-insurance-agent/). Your commission structure varies depending on the type of insurance product, the company you represent, and sometimes even the volume of policies you sell.
For example, commissions on commercial insurance policies are typically higher, and provide more stability because of increased profitability for the insurance carriers. On the other hand, personal lines commissions tend to offer lower commission rates, and the rates tend to be less stable.
![](https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Agent-offering-an-homeowners-insurance-580x435.png)
## How Much Do Insurance Agents Make**?**
Let’s talk numbers. One of the most common questions new agents ask is: how much do insurance agents make? The answer largely depends on:
1. **Policy Type and Structure –** Different insurance products come with different commission structures. For instance:
* Commercial insurance policies often generate more revenue due to the fact that premiums are often higher. The composition of the policies required can vary based on the size and type of the business.
* Personal insurance policies typically generate lower revenue compared to commercial policies. However, the target market usually has more volume.
2. **Carrier Compensation Plans –** Insurance companies each have their compensation model, which affects your commission. Some carriers offer higher initial commissions to attract agents. In contrast, others provide more generous renewal commissions to encourage long-term client retention. It’s important to understand how your specific carrier compensates you, as it can drastically impact your overall earnings.
3. **Commission Splits –** For agents who work under an agency or broker, commission splits are common. These splits dictate how much of the commission you earn versus what the agency keeps. As you gain experience or hit performance milestones, you might be able to negotiate a better split, increasing your take-home commission.
4. **Sales Volume and Bonuses –** Some insurance carriers offer bonuses or higher commission rates if you reach certain sales targets. These performance incentives can be a significant boost to your income, especially if you have a strong year or month. Be sure to take advantage of these opportunities to maximize your earnings potential. Plus, by taking advantage of[ sales and marketing tools](https://darkhorseinsurance.com/insurance-broker-marketing/), you can make your work a lot easier, helping you hit those targets faster and close more deals.
5. **Renewal and Persistency Rates –** You don’t just earn a commission when you make the initial sale. If your clients stay on their policies, you can earn renewal commissions each year. The longer your clients renew their policies, the more money you make over time.
6. **Geographic Market –** Where you sell your policies can impact your commission structure, especially for certain types of insurance. For example, [insurance agents in certain states may have different opportunities to sell insurance](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/guides/how-do-insurance-agents-make-money-452548.aspx "Opens in new tab") based on the risk.
For example, commercial property insurance rates in Texas are typically three times higher due to weather risks, leading to larger commissions. Similarly, auto insurance rates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah for example are significantly higher because of No-Fault laws, which can result in increased commissions for agents in those states.
7. **Experience and Reputation –** Your experience in the industry plays a huge role in how much you can earn. Established agents with a strong client base and proven track record often command higher commissions or better splits. Furthermore, agents with a good reputation may be able to sell more easily and gain referrals, thus increasing their overall income potential.
![](https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Insurance-agent-commission-aggreement-580x435.png)
## How Are Insurance Agents’ Commissions Structured?
Your commissions can be broken down into two main categories:
1. **Initial Commissions –** This is what you earn immediately after selling an insurance policy. For commercial insurance, the initial commission can be significant due to the needs of the business and the risk involved.For example, if you sell a commercial property policy with an annual premium of $10,000 and your commission rate is 15%, you’ll earn $1,500 upfront. The commission structure for commercial insurance is typically higher in the first year because it involves customized coverage and negotiation. On top of standard commission, agents can also charge an additional broker fee as compensation for the work done brokering the account to several different insurance companies.
2. **Renewal Commissions –**[Renewal commissions](https://darkhorseinsurance.com/how-much-do-independent-insurance-agents-make/) in commercial insurance, for instance, are important for long-term income. These are the percentages you earn when your clients renew their policies. While renewal commissions in commercial insurance can vary, they accumulate steadily over time, providing agents with a steady and growing income stream.Commercial insurance policies (except for builders risk insurance) are typically annual contracts, with a high renewal rate exceeding 80%. This high renewal rate provides a stable and recurring source of income for insurance agents, especially as their client base expands. While commercial insurance often involves more ongoing client relationship management, the focus is still on maintaining renewals, as they cost less to maintain compared to acquiring new clients.
## Tips to Maximize Your Commission
1. **Focus on High-Commission Products –** Not all policies are created equal. If you’re aiming for higher payouts, focus on commercial lines, which often offer more lucrative [commissions](https://www.hourly.io/post/insurance-agency-commission-structures "Opens in new tab").
2. **Upsell and Cross-Sell –** Adding coverages to policies or bundling insurance products can increase the premium amount—and your commission along with it. For instance, a business that needs workers compensation insurance in addition to their commercial property & liability insurance might bump your earnings significantly.
3. **Leverage Technology –** Using tools like an agency management system can help you determine which policies will offer the best return on your effort.
4. **Build Strong Client Relationships –** Retention is key. By maintaining excellent client relationships, you’ll not only secure renewal commissions but also increase your chances of gaining referrals.
5. **Work With a Supportive Agency –** Partnering with a forward-thinking platform like Darkhorse Insurance can significantly boost your income potential. Agencies that offer advanced tools,[ agent training](https://darkhorseinsurance.com/insurance-agency-growth/), and a supportive environment can help you close more deals and earn higher commissions.
