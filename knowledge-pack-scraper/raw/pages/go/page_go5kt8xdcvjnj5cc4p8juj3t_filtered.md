## Florida’s 15-Year Roof Rule Explained

[Florida’s](/florida) 15-Year Roof Rule is an insurance regulation designed to protect homeowners from being unfairly denied coverage due to roof age alone. The rule, part of [Florida Statute 627.7011](https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.7011.html), prevents insurers from refusing to issue or renew a homeowner’s policy simply because a roof is under 15 years old. Also this is something every first time Florida home owner should be aware of. Getting emergency insurance can be costly. Hidden things they don’t tell you about.

If your roof is 15 years old or older, your insurance company may require a roof inspection before renewal or issuing a new policy. If the inspection certifies that your roof still has at least five years of useful life, the insurer cannot deny coverage based solely on its age.

This rule helps balance homeowner protection with safety standards—ensuring older but well-maintained roofs remain insurable while limiting risk for insurers.

## What the 15-Year Roof Rule Means for Florida Homeowners

* Roofs under 15 years old: Insurance companies cannot deny coverage or non-renew policies due to age alone.
* Roofs 15 years or older: Homeowners must provide proof—typically via an inspection report—that the roof has at least five more years of life remaining.
* Replacement not required: The law does not force homeowners to replace a roof simply because it’s over 15 years old.
* Insurance pricing impact: Some insurers may still increase premiums or limit coverage based on roof material or inspection results.
