I paid $140 a month with Tesla Insurance. I’ve been driving for over 10 years, good driving record.

It’s like $200 a month. 3 hour wait times. Worth it though

That rate sounds pretty reasonable but there are too many factors to give a comparison answer. I.e. it also depends on coverage levels and annual driving etc. In my experience, Tesla Insurance has been the absolute cheapest and I’ve had it since it was available in CA. Only way it’s cheaper is if you have bundled insurance discounts with a specific insurer.
State Farm for example can be cheaper if everything you have is insured through them but they refuse to work with Tesla Collision centers. They make you use third party certified repair shops and I was told by one during my own claim process that they hate State Farm and get pushed to fix with used parts.
Tesla Insurance is all done through the Tesla app. It’s an easy claim process and everything is pretty on you to file and follow up (trade off for being cheaper). Your experience also highly depends on your claims adjuster. I’ve been through two claims now and first time was a breeze. Took 1.5 months to close out a total loss. State Farm has really great service and takes care of everything but with Tesla Ins you’re kind of on your own. They tend to operate more on a reimbursement basis so you tow the car, get your rental, and then submit everything for reimbursement. Rental car process is automated and easy but my second claim process required a couple calls back and forth with due to some clerical errors from either Hertz or Tesla. Calls to Tesla insurance have generally been an hour wait. If you call when they open it’s 5-10 min wait and during midday I’ve waited on hold for 40-70 minutes. My second claims adjuster was/is an absolute bozo and has never contacted me or followed up on anything. I had to call to get reimbursement for after market stuff and for rental car because he/hertz screwed up. He might be dead/fired but phone reps say he still works there from what they can tell.
Tesla Collision centers on the other hand have been pretty great to work with and have been communicative. Third party shops also seem capable but I’ve never gone through a repair with one of them.

In California, you will generally - not always - but generally get the lowest rates with Tesla insurance. I am paying $110. 100/300/100. Progressive/geico/everyone else offered ludicrous quotes. One wanted $1300 per month! California is not very insurance friendly…

AAA quoted me 430. Almost double my current rate from my old car at 100/300/100. I’ll probably end up switching to Progressive or Geico

I have a 2023 M3P insured to 250/500/300 @ 10k/yr (I drive way more but they never change it, even though they can see the data)
25 years old, Los Angeles. 0 at fault claims ever, 0 infractions.
Been paying around 240-250/mo since I got the car in Aug of 2023.
I had a '19 LRawd before, same coverage and everything, was paying 260/mo.
Edit: Never filed a claim, but wait times suck. Call right when they open (5a or 6a I think) and you will have a >10min wait.

SoCal, M38, clean record.
For my 19 M3 I recently got-full coverage with glass ($250 deductible), roadside, and liability for my older Lexus for $115 a month for both. I have had progressive for years and didn’t even consider anyone else.

Data point for you: I’m 32 7 years driving experience, partner 33, more experience but 2 points. Car is 2022 Model 3 LR. Our insurance is $290/month
All other companies wanted almost $1k to just start the plan. We asked AAA, Progressive and Geico.
