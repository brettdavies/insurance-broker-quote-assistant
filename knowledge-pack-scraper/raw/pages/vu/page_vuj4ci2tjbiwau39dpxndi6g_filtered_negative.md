## Benefits of Home and Auto Insurance Bundles
Bundling refers to purchasing multiple insurance policies, like home and auto, from a single provider. Along with offering big discounts, bundling can make managing policies and payments easier for owners and renters alike.
Whether you own a house or a condo, the benefit of bundling your auto and home insurance is obvious: Bundling often comes with discount opportunities for various insurance plans. In some cases, you can save as much as **25 percent** on your car insurance when you bundle home and auto.
Second, you might find it easier to manage your policies under one provider. Most providers allow you to manage your policy, track claims, and make payments for different policies with the same app or online account.

### Big Savings for Homeowners
There are several ways homeowners can save on their auto insurance with Liberty Mutual. For one, you may be eligible for a significant home and auto bundling discount (an average of $950). Liberty Mutual will also give you a discount just for being a homeowner, regardless of which provider insures your home.
FYI:
Review your coverage at least annually. The cost of your home and auto insurance can change from year to year, so it pays to get quotes for both bundled and separate policies to ensure you get the best coverage at the lowest rate.
### Flexible Bundling Options
Liberty Mutual offers several bundling options for drivers, including bundling auto with home, condo, renters, or motorcycle policies. You may also be able to bundle RV and boat insurance policies. Discounts for specific bundles can vary, so speak with an agent during the quote process to verify what you may be eligible for.
On top of earning discounts, it will be easier to manage your various insurance policies by integrating them under one Liberty Mutual account.
### Partner Programs
Liberty Mutual has strong affinity partnerships with over 15,000 partner companies and organizations, such as the Autism Society of America and the Navy Federal Credit Union. With over 40 years of experience building affinity partnerships, it’s no wonder 96 percent of affinity policyholders say they are satisfied with Liberty Mutual’s program.
Homeowners receiving insurance through one of Liberty Mutual’s partner organizations can see the following:
* Lower annual premiums
* Expert program support from specially trained representatives
* Convenient payment options, like electronic funds transfer, recurring credit card, and payroll deduction

### Condo Owners Insurance
With all-inclusive options to protect condo units, State Farm offers protection against weather and non-weather damage when you bundle condo and auto coverage. Get protected from sleet, wind, lightning, theft, [vandalism](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/vandalism/), and fire. Knowing the value of your belongings, like electronics, jewelry, clothes, and furniture, will help you decide how much coverage you need in your bundle. A State Farm agent can help you determine the value of your unit and understand the replacement cost of your personal property.
If you qualify for both condo and auto policies, you can get condo owners coverage often for just a few dollars more per month.
### Bundle and Save
You can earn up to $1,356 off your auto insurance premium when you bundle home and auto insurance. Ask about how much you can save when you bundle any of the following policies:
* Auto + home
* Auto + condo
* Auto + renters
* Auto + life insurance
* Auto + auto (multi-vehicle discount)
Pro Tip:
You can save up to 20 percent on your policy when you sign up for a multi-vehicle discount with State Farm. Ask your agent about what multi-vehicle and multi-policy discounts you’re eligible for.
### 3. Best for High-Risk Drivers - Direct Auto

Formerly known as Direct General, [Direct Auto](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/direct/) has a history of insuring high-risk drivers. Auto insurance providers determine rates and decide to insure (or reject) certain drivers based on their age, gender, credit score, driving history, vehicle type, and other relevant factors. High-risk drivers tend to have a lower credit score, lapses in coverage, very expensive vehicles, a history of accidents or speeding tickets, and other factors that indicate they might be more costly to insure.
Direct Auto specializes in insurance for [high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/), including renters and homeowners who have a hard time finding insurance.

### Best for High-Risk Drivers
If you’re a renter or homeowner with bad credit, a history of missed payments, a history of claims, a [DUI](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/dui/) on your record, or other moving violations on your record, you might find it difficult to find a company that will offer you auto or renters insurance.
This won’t be the case with Direct Auto. As a high-risk provider, Direct Auto likely won’t deny your application. It can also offer additional insurance requirements — like an SR-22 or non-owner insurance — if you need insurance after a serious traffic violation.
### Customizable Payments
To make your plan more affordable, Direct Auto allows you to customize your payment options to match your budget. You can speak with a representative online, in person, or over the phone to customize your payment plan. Your representative will guide you through each step toward the right renters policy so you can find a price that works for your budget.
With this small, regional provider, you can do the following:
* **Choose your payment date.** Pick the best day to make your insurance payment based on your personal financial schedule.
* **Plan your payment schedule.** According to your spending ability, you can pay in full or choose from multiple installment plans.
* **Decide on your monthly payment.** Choose how much money you want to put down and, in turn, determine your monthly payment.
* **Decide how you want to pay.** You can pay with cash at a Direct Auto or partner location, make a one-time or auto payment online via credit or debit card, or pay online by e-check.
### Massive Insurance Bundle Discounts
Direct Auto offers sizable [savings on insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/) bundles for people renting homes, townhouses, and condominiums. If you purchase at least two qualifying policies from Direct Auto, like auto and renters insurance, you can save up to 10 percent on your insurance.

GEICO is the third-largest insurer in the U.S. and offers a wide range of policy and coverage options. It’s also consistently one of the cheapest insurers, making it a great option for those prioritizing the most affordable coverage. Something to keep in mind is that GEICO doesn’t write its own home insurance policies, instead outsourcing to third-party partners. For this reason, homeowners may prefer to bundle home and auto with another provider, but it’s certainly still possible to get a home policy and bundle through GEICO.

Some providers, like Direct Auto, don’t offer bundling discounts for auto and mobile homes. With GEICO, you can save by bundling auto with home, renters, condo, or mobile home insurance. If you’re one of America’s 22 million mobile home residents[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/home/#citation-4), you should ask your GEICO agent about how much you can save by bundling auto and mobile home insurance.
Did You Know?
Nearly 15 percent of all mobile homeowners live in areas with a high risk of flooding. Mobile home insurance with GEICO will protect your mobile home and belongings from damage by flooding, fire, hail, wind, hurricanes, and more.[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/home/#citation-5)

### RV Insurance
Some RVs, like motor homes, are considered vehicles in their own right, which means you’ll be required to obtain insurance for them. Allstate offers insurance plans for most RVs, including motor homes and mobile homes.
On top of your standard coverage (liability, comprehensive, personal injury protection, etc.), you can add the following coverage options for your RV:
* **Towing and labor costs coverage:** This coverage pays for any labor and towing costs if your RV breaks down.
* **Total loss replacement:** If your RV is totaled, you can replace it with a new one of the same make and model.
* **Vacation liability:** You can add additional liability protection if someone is injured in or around your RV while you’re on vacation.
* **Full-timer’s liability coverage:** You can gain liability coverage, similar to that of homeowners, if you live in your RV for more than six months each year.
* **Emergency expenses:** This coverage will pay for expenses, like transportation and hotel costs, if your RV breaks down in a covered loss more than 50 miles from home.
### Allstate HostAdvantage Plans
If you share your home or apartment with renters, you can sign up for Allstate’s HostAdvantage plan. The plan offers some nice perks and coverage for homesharers who want some added protection.
Here’s what the plan offers:
* **Theft protection:** Allstate will help pay for belongings that are stolen when renters are in your home.
* **Property damage:** If a renter accidentally damages your personal property, like a TV, Allstate can help cover what your home insurance doesn’t (up to $10,000 per rental host period).
* **Merry Maids discount:** Signing up for HomeAdvantage comes with $25 off your first four cleanings with Merry Maids.
## Frequently Asked Questions
Is bundling home and auto policies always cheaper?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
In most cases, it is cheaper to bundle home and auto policies. In some instances, however, bundling your home and auto policies may not be cheaper than paying for the policies separately. If you own a luxury vehicle or live in a high-risk area, for example, you may find a combined policy from one company is more expensive than separate policies from two companies.
Additionally, discounts may be deceiving because insurance companies with higher discounts may have higher premiums to begin with.
What kinds of insurance can I bundle?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
The kinds of insurance policies you can bundle depend on the coverages your provider offers. Typically, insurance companies offer bundling for auto, home, motorcycle, life, boat, or other types of recreational equipment insurance policies.
How much coverage do I need when bundling?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
If you can afford it, we recommend increasing your bodily injury per person and property damage limits to at least $100,000 each. On top of that, we suggest you add collision and comprehensive coverage equal to your vehicle’s actual market value and add uninsured motorist coverage. For home insurance, we recommend you have enough coverage to fulfill the cost of repairs, including labor and materials, to replace your home — also known as the “replacement cost” of your home.
Can I over-insure my property when bundling?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes, you can over-insure your property for more than it’s worth. While this tactic could help avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses in the event of an accident, you could be paying less for a policy with reasonable coverage and using that for immediate expenses like home improvement and maintenance.
Is it wise to bundle home and auto insurance?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
You should bundle home and auto insurance if you appreciate the convenience that bundling provides and/or if it’s cheaper.
Keep in mind, however, that bundling isn’t always the most cost-effective option. While it’s true that you can earn a discount by bundling, your overall policy may be more expensive than if you were insured by two different providers.
For example, you might find two very cheap policies for auto and home insurance from two separate providers. Your overall premium might be lower than if you were to bundle with the same provider.
Here’s an example of how your insurance premiums might be more expensive, even with bundling.
Policy Type | Annual cost of auto insurance | Annual cost of home insurance | Bundling discount | Savings | Total annual premium
---|---|---|---|---|---
Multi-policy bundle from the same provider | $1,800(Provider A) | $1,600(Provider A) | 15% | $510 | $2,890
Policies from two separate providers | $1,800 (Provider A) | $800(Provider B) | None | None | $2,600
Rates will vary from person to person and provider to provider, so you should expect to find different rates for both home and auto insurance among different insurance companies.
## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we evaluate home and auto insurance bundles based on four key factors:
* **Price (40 percent):** We analyze average premiums for auto and home insurance as well as bundling discounts and other saving opportunities.

We assess claims practices through sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings.
* **Customer Experience (25 percent):** We evaluate various customer service metrics, including how easy it is for customers to get a quote and purchase a policy. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
* **Coverage Options (10 percent):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and value providers with a broad range of policy bundle options, such as auto, home, motorcycle, condo, and RV.
