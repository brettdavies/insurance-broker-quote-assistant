## The cheapest car insurance companies in Boston
If you’re looking for the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-massachusetts/) in Boston, you may want to request quotes from Plymouth Rock, Travelers and Geico. Bankrate’s research indicates that these are the three cheapest minimum coverage auto insurance carriers, on average, in Boston. 
Keep in mind, though, that [individual car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) will vary based on your driver profile — so the cheapest company listed here may not offer the cheapest rates for every Boston resident. Experts recommend comparing personalized quotes from multiple companies to find a [cheap car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies//) that fits your budget and coverage needs.

## How much is car insurance in Boston, Massachusetts?
Massachusetts is one of the [less expensive states for car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/), but Boston stands out from the rest of the state. Car insurance costs drivers in Boston an average of $2,482 per year for full coverage and $714 for state minimum coverage. That’s below the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), but 18 percent more than the [Massachusetts average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-massachusetts/). 
### Boston rates for teens
Even in Massachusetts, where insurance companies can’t legally consider driver age when setting auto insurance premiums, [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) tend to pay higher rates. That’s because insurers _can_ still base premiums on years of driver experience — and teenagers have less driving experience than the average adult driver. The result: a statistically higher risk of accidents and insurance claims. 
Teens who stay on their parents' insurance policy generally save compared to those on their own policy. As you can see below, Boston 18 year olds on their own policies pay an average of 51 percent more for full coverage than those on their parents' policies.

### Boston rates for senior drivers
Senior drivers have decades of on-road experience and generally pay fairly low insurance rates. However, [driving as a senior](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) comes with certain renewed risks, particularly past age 70. Vision problems, slower reaction times and greater vulnerability to serious injury can raise the risks associated with insuring a senior driver — and as a result, some carriers may quote higher rates for Boston drivers in this age group.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Boston
A conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious matter. [Massachusetts state law](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-drunk-or-drugged-driving) imposes major financial and legal penalties on drivers with DUI convictions — and most auto insurance companies will raise rates or deny coverage for drivers with one or more [DUI convictions](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) on their driving record.

Minimum coverage requirements in Boston
All drivers in Boston must carry at least the minimum auto insurance coverage required by [Massachusetts state law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/massachusetts-car-insurance-laws/): 
  * $20,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $40,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $5,000 property damage liability per accident
  * $20,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
  * $40,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
  * $8,000 personal injury protection (PIP)


[State minimum coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) will result in the lowest premiums, but it does not include physical damage coverage like comprehensive and collision coverage. Most insurance professionals also recommend selecting higher liability limits than the minimum required by state law in order to protect your assets and future income. If you’re not sure [how much auto coverage you need](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-really-need/) in Boston, consider speaking with an insurance agent or broker for specific advice on your situation. 
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Boston?
Caret Down Icon
Comparing car insurance quotes from multiple carriers can help you find the lowest rate available for your driver profile in Boston. You may also want to research discounts to find a company with [discount offerings](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) that match your profile. Lastly, maintaining a clean driving record will help stabilize your rates over time in Boston. Car insurance companies look at your driving record as a significant indicator of claim risk, so avoiding tickets and accidents could help [keep your premium low](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/).
  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in Boston?
Caret Down Icon
Boston car insurance rates are relatively inexpensive, especially considering the fact that cities often have higher rates due to the greater possibility of accidents and theft. As of September 2025 Boston drivers pay $2,482 per year for full coverage and $714 for state minimum coverage. The citiy's full coverage rate is 8 percent less than the national average, though it is 18 percent more than the state average rate.   
  
Boston's rates are comparable to those in other MA cities; with Boston drivers paying 3 percent more than Worcester drivers and 4 percent less than Springfield residents.
  * ###  How can I get car insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
Obtaining [car insurance online](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/?page=40) isn't difficult. It's a good idea to ask for quotes from a range of carriers, and most major insurers allow you to get free quotes just by answering a few questions on the website. This is likely to include personal information about every driver in your household, vehicle details such as year, make, model and vehicle identification number and information on the coverage you currently have. You will also need to know how much and what [types of coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/coverage-types/) you'd like.
Ask for the same coverage options from each company you query, so you can make an apples-to-apples comparison. Check and be sure that your quote includes any discounts for which you are eligible. Once you have chosen the company you want to be insured with, you're typically able to complete your application and purchase the policy via the company's website.
  * ###  Why are car insurance rates in Boston so high?
Caret Down Icon
Boston’s car insurance rates trend higher than the state average thanks to the city’s dense traffic, which leads to a higher risk of accidents. A higher crime rate also contributes to higher costs for comprehensive coverage, which pays for losses from auto theft and vandalism. Lastly, Boston has a higher cost of living compared to the rest of the state, meaning the cost of repairs is higher, further increasing coverage costs.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
