## The cheapest car insurance companies in Boston

If you’re looking for the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-massachusetts/) in Boston, you may want to request quotes from Plymouth Rock, Travelers and Geico. Bankrate’s research indicates that these are the three cheapest minimum coverage auto insurance carriers, on average, in Boston.

Keep in mind, though, that [individual car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) will vary based on your driver profile — so the cheapest company listed here may not offer the cheapest rates for every Boston resident. Experts recommend comparing personalized quotes from multiple companies to find a [cheap car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies//) that fits your budget and coverage needs.

## How much is car insurance in Boston, Massachusetts?

Massachusetts is one of the [less expensive states for car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/), but Boston stands out from the rest of the state. Car insurance costs drivers in Boston an average of $2,482 per year for full coverage and $714 for state minimum coverage. That’s below the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), but 18 percent more than the [Massachusetts average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-massachusetts/).

### Boston rates for teens

Even in Massachusetts, where insurance companies can’t legally consider driver age when setting auto insurance premiums, [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) tend to pay higher rates. That’s because insurers *can* still base premiums on years of driver experience — and teenagers have less driving experience than the average adult driver. The result: a statistically higher risk of accidents and insurance claims.

Teens who stay on their parents' insurance policy generally save compared to those on their own policy. As you can see below, Boston 18 year olds on their own policies pay an average of 51 percent more for full coverage than those on their parents' policies.

### Boston rates for senior drivers

Senior drivers have decades of on-road experience and generally pay fairly low insurance rates. However, [driving as a senior](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) comes with certain renewed risks, particularly past age 70. Vision problems, slower reaction times and greater vulnerability to serious injury can raise the risks associated with insuring a senior driver — and as a result, some carriers may quote higher rates for Boston drivers in this age group.

* ### Why are car insurance rates in Boston so high?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Boston’s car insurance rates trend higher than the state average thanks to the city’s dense traffic, which leads to a higher risk of accidents. A higher crime rate also contributes to higher costs for comprehensive coverage, which pays for losses from auto theft and vandalism. Lastly, Boston has a higher cost of living compared to the rest of the state, meaning the cost of repairs is higher, further increasing coverage costs.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
