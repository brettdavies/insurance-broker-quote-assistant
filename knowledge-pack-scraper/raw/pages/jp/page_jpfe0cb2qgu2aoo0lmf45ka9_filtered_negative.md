Even in Massachusetts, where insurance companies can’t legally consider driver age when setting auto insurance premiums, [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) tend to pay higher rates. That’s because insurers _can_ still base premiums on years of driver experience — and teenagers have less driving experience than the average adult driver. The result: a statistically higher risk of accidents and insurance claims.
