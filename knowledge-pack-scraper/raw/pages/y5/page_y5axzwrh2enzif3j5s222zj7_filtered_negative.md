##  **#1:**[**Verizon**](https://www.verizon.com/)
**_For small businesses with field technicians or salespeople,_** this means your team can stay connected and productive even in rural areas, reducing downtime and improving customer service.
However, what truly sets Verizon apart is **_its commitment to evolving with technology._** Verizon was one of the first carriers to pioneer 5G connectivity, a game-changer for businesses that depend on fast online activities such as large file transfers or video conferencing.
**_But what if 5G isn’t available in your area yet?_**
There’s also the** _added benefit of TravelPass,_** which allows small businesses with global dealings a hassle-free travel communication solution; there’s no need to fret over costly roaming charges anymore! All these factors make Verizon a true business partner.
Verizon offers[ three main Business Unlimited cell phone plans](https://www.verizon.com/business/products/mobile/plans/business-unlimited/) with the following pricing structure when you have five or more lines:
1. **_Business Unlimited Start 5G_**: $30/line/month. Includes unlimited 4G LTE/5G Nationwide and Verizon Call Filter
2. **_Business Unlimited Plus 5G_**: $40/line/month. Includes 100 GB mobile hotspot data, unlimited 5G Ultra Wideband, 1080p streaming, Verizon Call Filter, and TravelPass (2 days/month)
3. **_Business Unlimited Pro 5G_**: $45/line/month. Includes 200 GB mobile hotspot data, unlimited 5G Ultra Wideband, 1080p streaming, Verizon Call Filter, TravelPass (4 days/month), Business Mobile Secure Bundle, and 50% off a Business Unlimited Tablet Pro plan
##  **#2:**[**AT &T**](https://www.att.com/)
The first of these benefits is the **_number of flexible plans to choose from_**.
Another salient feature of AT&T’s cell phone plans is their **_multi-line discounts,_** which can lead to significant savings when applied to multiple employees.
Some users have expressed **_concerns about customer service experiences and billing issues_** that have occurred over time.
### **AT &T Pricing**
AT&T offers[ three business cell phone plans](https://www.business.att.com/content/attbusiness/en/categories/mobile-rate-plans.html) with the following pricing structure:
1. **_AT &T Business Unlimited Elite_**: It starts at $85/month per line for 1 line, with discounts for additional lines (e.g., $40/month per line for 6 or more lines). It includes unlimited talk, text, and data, a 100GB mobile hotspot, HD and 4K video streaming, and advanced mobile security.
2. **_AT &T Business Unlimited Performance_**: It starts at $75/month per line for 1 line, with discounts for additional lines (e.g., $35/month per line for 6 or more lines). It includes unlimited talk, text, and data, a 40GB mobile hotspot, HD video streaming, and advanced mobile security.

**_What if you prefer paper bills or don’t want autopay?_**
##  **#3:**[**Xfinity**](https://www.xfinity.com/)
Let’s start with the **_coverage_**.
Xfinity stands out, though, because of its **_unique bundling option_**. Adding mobile services can lead to significant savings if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer.
But as we all know, no plan is perfect. One thing worth noting about Xfinity is that **_you must be an existing customer of their internet services_** before you can use their mobile offerings.
Comcast offers the following[ pricing for its Xfinity Mobile business cell phone plans](https://business.comcast.com/learn/mobile/plan):
**_Worried about surprise data charges?_**
##  **#4:**[**RingCentral**](https://www.ringcentral.com/)
The distinguishable feature is its **_flexibility_** – regardless of your company’s size or industry, there’s almost certainly a plan for you.
And here’s another cool thing – you don’t need to use RingCentral with existing hardware; **_it also offers softphone capabilities_**. RingCentral caters to small businesses with its integrated communications platform on your mobile device.
Now let me tell you about the **_cost-effectiveness_** aspect! With RingCentral, expect no hidden costs and an attractive total cost of ownership compared to traditional on-premises phone systems.
Plus, options like **_Glip by RingCentral_** offer free video meetings combined with messaging so teams can follow up quickly.
So, lovable tech-geeks out there might ask about **_security_**. Fear not, my friends!
**_But what if your internet goes down?_**
RingCentral has a strong reputation for **_customer service, offering 24/7 support to all customers_**.
RingCentral offers[ three main business phone plans under their RingEX offering](https://www.ringcentral.com/office/plansandpricing.html), with prices ranging from $20 to $45 per user per month:
1. **_Core plan_** ($20/user/month annually or $30/user/month monthly): This entry-level plan is best for small businesses with basic VoIP needs. It includes unlimited calls in the US/Canada, voicemail-to-text, call management features like call queues, team messaging, document sharing, video meetings for up to 100 participants, and 24/7 support.
2. **_Advanced plan_** ($25/user/month annually or $35/user/month monthly): Built for growing businesses, this mid-tier plan adds advanced call handling features like automatic call recording, 1,000 toll-free minutes, enhanced admin and analytics features, integrations with apps like Salesforce and Zendesk, and video meetings for up to 100 participants.
3. **_Ultra plan_** ($35/user/month annually or $45/user/month monthly): RingCentral’s top-tier plan is designed for larger enterprises and includes everything in the Advanced plan plus unlimited storage for messaging/files, automatic call recording, advanced analytics, and video meetings for up to 200 participants.
RingCentral also offers a[ 15-day free trial](https://signup.ringcentral.com/signup-v8.0/) for up to 20 phone lines, after which you can choose a plan. Annual billing provides a discount compared to month-to-month payments.
##  **#5:**[**T-Mobile**](https://www.t-mobile.com/)
They also have a **_reputation for excellent customer service_**, which is critical for small businesses that often encounter technical difficulties.
Their **_flexible and feature-rich plans_** make it easy for businesses to stay connected, whether employees are in the office or working remotely. One of T-Mobile’s most popular offerings is its Magenta plan, which includes unlimited talk, text, and data.
It comes with **_3GB of 4G LTE mobile hotspot data_**, which can be crucial when you’re on the go and need to connect your laptop or other devices to the internet.
The plan also offers **_one hour of free Gogo in-flight Wi-Fi for each flight you take_**, which can be particularly beneficial if your business requires frequent flying.
They’ve been **_focusing_** mainly on **_improving their 5G coverage_**, which is important considering that more devices are becoming 5G compatible.
**_What if you sometimes work in areas with spotty coverage?_**
T-Mobile offers[ four business cell phone plans](https://www.t-mobile.com/business/wireless-business-plans) with different pricing tiers based on the number of lines and features included:
1. **_Business Unlimited Select_**: $25/line for 6+ lines ($150/mo)
2. **_Business Unlimited Advanced_**: $30/line for 6+ lines ($180/mo)
3. **_Business Unlimited Ultimate_**: $40/line for 6+ lines ($240/mo)
4. **_Business Unlimited Edge_**: $45/line for 6+ lines ($270/mo)
**_Verizon_** arguably has the best network across the country. If you’re running a business where you or your employees need to travel frequently, especially to more remote areas, Verizon should be at the top of your list.
Next up is **_AT &T_**, which also boasts a strong network across most of the U.S. Its business plans are flexible and can accommodate businesses of all sizes.
**_Xfinity_** is another strong contender but takes a different approach to its offering. It utilizes Verizon’s network, which gives it solid coverage, but it focuses on offering cost-effective solutions rather than packing in all kinds of features.
**_RingCentral_** stands out as different from traditional cellular providers. It’s a cloud-based phone system provider that allows businesses to use existing internet connections (like Wi-Fi or cellular) for voice calls and other communication needs.
We have **_T-Mobile,_** which emerged as a fierce contenders after merging with Sprint in recent years.
Not letting** _the price tag be your sole determining factor is critical_**.
1. The first factor you should consider is **_coverage_**.
1. **_The reliability of service_** is another fundamental aspect to consider.
1. Beyond coverage and reliability, consider **_your company’s specific needs_**. How much data do you need?
1. Yet, significantly, **_affordability_** cannot be overlooked.
**_What if your usage varies month to month?_**
If, for instance, you find that **_data usage_** is a significant cost for your company, it could be worth discussing this with your provider. They might offer an increased data limit for a reduced price or unlimited data at no extra cost.
Similarly, if **_international calls_** make up a large part of your monthly bill, see if there’s any flexibility to lower these costs. Remember – the worst they can say is no.
**_What if the provider won’t budge on price?_**
One of the most effective negotiation tactics is **_comparison shopping_**. If another provider offers better deals or packages than the one you’re currently with, don’t hesitate to mention this during negotiations.
Remember **_equipment,_** too. If one carrier offers free upgrades or lower device costs on top-tier smartphones or tablets, use that information as leverage when negotiating with other carriers.
**_Patience and persistence are vital in the negotiation process_** when dealing with service providers, especially those related to technology like cell phone carriers. You might not get exactly what you want right off the bat, but sticking at it and approaching each conversation professionally can lead to eventual success—improved terms that better fit your business needs.
Remember to consider the value of **_forming good relationships with service representatives_**. They can become champions for your cause within their organization, making further negotiations easier.
**_Take action now to enhance your business communication:_**
