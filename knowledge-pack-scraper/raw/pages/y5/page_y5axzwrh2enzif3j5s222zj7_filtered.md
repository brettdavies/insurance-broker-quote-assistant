## **Overview of the Best Small Business Cell Phone Plans**

 In brief, we’ll explore each of the following five contenders in detail:

1. [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/)
2. [AT&T](https://www.att.com/)
3. [Xfinity](https://www.xfinity.com/)
4. [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/)
5. [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/)

## **#1:**[**Verizon**](https://www.verizon.com/)

Verizon, a leader in telecommunications, stands out as a top choice for small business cell phone plans. With its commitment to providing unparalleled network reliability and superior customer service, it’s no wonder why many entrepreneurs consider Verizon’s offerings to be the best for businesses. The company has left a trail of satisfied customers who praise their seamless experiences, quick problem-solving, and steadfast connections.

***For small businesses with field technicians or salespeople,*** this means your team can stay connected and productive even in rural areas, reducing downtime and improving customer service.

If we look closer at Verizon’s small business plan portfolio, it’s easy to see why they’ve captured such loyalty with their business wireless options. They offer an extensive array of options that cater to businesses of various sizes—whether you’re a fledgling startup or an established enterprise.

Their Business Unlimited Plan features unlimited talk, text, and data. Plus, it offers mobile hotspot data, crucial for on-the-go meetings or remote working situations.

However, what truly sets Verizon apart is ***its commitment to evolving with technology.*** Verizon was one of the first carriers to pioneer 5G connectivity, a game-changer for businesses that depend on fast online activities such as large file transfers or video conferencing.

***But what if 5G isn’t available in your area yet?***

Don’t worry – Verizon’s 4G LTE network offers fast speeds for most business needs. Check Verizon’s coverage map to see what’s available where you work.

There’s also the ***added benefit of TravelPass,*** which allows small businesses with global dealings a hassle-free travel communication solution; there’s no need to fret over costly roaming charges anymore! All these factors make Verizon a true business partner.

### **Verizon Pricing**

Verizon offers [three main Business Unlimited cell phone plans](https://www.verizon.com/business/products/mobile/plans/business-unlimited/) with the following pricing structure when you have five or more lines:

1. ***Business Unlimited Start 5G***: $30/line/month. Includes unlimited 4G LTE/5G Nationwide and Verizon Call Filter
2. ***Business Unlimited Plus 5G***: $40/line/month. Includes 100 GB mobile hotspot data, unlimited 5G Ultra Wideband, 1080p streaming, Verizon Call Filter, and TravelPass (2 days/month)
3. ***Business Unlimited Pro 5G***: $45/line/month. Includes 200 GB mobile hotspot data, unlimited 5G Ultra Wideband, 1080p streaming, Verizon Call Filter, TravelPass (4 days/month), Business Mobile Secure Bundle, and 50% off a Business Unlimited Tablet Pro plan

The plans offer progressive discounts, with the per-line price decreasing by $5-15 for each additional line, up to the maximum savings at five lines.

Verizon is also running a promotion where you can save $600 over 24 months when you switch and bring your compatible device on the Business Unlimited Plus 5G or Pro 5G plan, both of which are the best-unlimited options.

## **#2:**[**AT&T**](https://www.att.com/)

If you’re looking for an idyllic blend of cost-effectiveness and comprehensive coverage, AT&T is the perfect fit for your small business. AT&T is known for its robust network coverage and reliability, critical factors for any business.

The benefits of opting for an AT&T plan are multifold.

The first of these benefits is the ***number of flexible plans to choose from***.

Each is designed to meet a unique set of requirements. Whether your organization demands unlimited data or basic calling features, there’s likely an AT & T plan that will perfectly suit your needs.

Plans also come with additional benefits, such as mobile hotspot data and high-quality streaming options, which can be helpful in today’s interconnected world.

Another salient feature of AT&T’s cell phone plans is their ***multi-line discounts,*** which can lead to significant savings when applied to multiple employees.

This facet alone can make it a favorite among small businesses trying to balance budget constraints while providing robust communication options.

However, to make the most informed decision, it’s crucial to recognize the potential drawbacks of specific providers, such as AT&T.

Some users have expressed ***concerns about customer service experiences and billing issues*** that have occurred over time.

Despite these caveats, many businesses looking at potential providers find themselves drawn back towards AT&T due to its extensive nationwide coverage coupled with competitive pricing structures—all factors that make it a noteworthy contender in this list of top cell phone plans ideal for small businesses.

### **AT&T Pricing**

AT&T offers [three business cell phone plans](https://www.business.att.com/content/attbusiness/en/categories/mobile-rate-plans.html) with the following pricing structure:

1. ***AT&T Business Unlimited Elite***: It starts at $85/month per line for 1 line, with discounts for additional lines (e.g., $40/month per line for 6 or more lines). It includes unlimited talk, text, and data, a 100GB mobile hotspot, HD and 4K video streaming, and advanced mobile security.
2. ***AT&T Business Unlimited Performance***: It starts at $75/month per line for 1 line, with discounts for additional lines (e.g., $35/month per line for 6 or more lines). It includes unlimited talk, text, and data, a 40GB mobile hotspot, HD video streaming, and advanced mobile security.
3. ***AT&T Business Unlimited Starter***: It starts at $65/month per line for 1 line, with discounts for additional lines (e.g., $30/month per line for 6 or more lines). It includes unlimited talk, text, data, a 5GB mobile hotspot, SD video streaming, and basic mobile security.

The prices above include monthly plan charges for talk, text, and data and assume enrollment in autopay and paperless billing, which provides a $10/month discount per line.

***What if you prefer paper bills or don’t want autopay?***

You can still get AT&T plans, but you’ll pay $10 more per line monthly. Factor this in when comparing the costs of different business wireless plans.

For rapidly growing startups, you can quickly scale your communication needs without worrying about unexpected costs or service interruptions as you add new team members.

## **#3:**[**Xfinity**](https://www.xfinity.com/)

So, next to our list is Xfinity. While known for broadband and cable, Xfinity has also become a strong contender in cell phone services.

Xfinity ticks quite a few boxes, especially for small businesses looking to balance affordability and quality of service.

Let’s start with the ***coverage***.

Xfinity uses Verizon’s network, offering extensive nationwide coverage with high-speed data—precisely what every growing business needs! Their plans are also flexible, with choices ranging from unlimited talk and text to shared data plans or even ‘by the gig’ options if your monthly usage needs to be more consistent.

Xfinity stands out, though, because of its ***unique bundling option***. Adding mobile services can lead to significant savings if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer.

And hey, who doesn’t like a good bundle deal?

On top of that, they offer up to five lines without additional line access fees, which is an excellent feature if your small business has multiple employees needing connection.

But as we all know, no plan is perfect. One thing worth noting about Xfinity is that ***you must be an existing customer of their internet services*** before you can use their mobile offerings.

While it isn’t necessarily a problem for those already using their services or considering switching over completely (especially given the potential savings!), it might not be ideal for everyone!

To wrap this up, if cost-efficiency coupled with reliable service ranks high on your priority list and you don’t mind using the same provider for both internet and cell phone plans (or are already an Xfinity Internet user), this could be an excellent choice for your small business needs!

### **Xfinity Pricing**

Comcast offers the following [pricing for its Xfinity Mobile business cell phone plans](https://business.comcast.com/learn/mobile/plan):

* If one of the following Comcast Business services is not maintained: TV, Internet, or Voice, a $25/line/month charge applies. Pricing is subject to change.
* A minimum $20/month charge applies for lines with By the Gig data, regardless of actual data usage. Charges apply to each GB or partial GB of shared data, with no data rollover.
* Unlimited plans have multi-line pricing based on the total number of lines on the account. Tablets and By the Gig lines are not eligible for unlimited multi-line pricing.

In summary, Xfinity Mobile business plans have a $25/line monthly access charge unless the business maintains another Comcast service, such as TV, Internet, or landline phone.

By the Gig data is charged at a minimum of $20/month per line plus the cost of each GB used.

***Worried about surprise data charges?***

Set up alerts in your Xfinity account to notify you when your data limit is nearing. This helps avoid unexpected bills.

Unlimited plans offer discounted per-line pricing as more smartphone lines are added, but this multi-line discount does not apply to tablet devices or By the Gig lines.

Xfinity’s bundling option is particularly beneficial for home-based businesses because it allows you to consolidate your personal and business internet and mobile services, simplifying billing and potentially reducing overall costs.

## **#4:**[**RingCentral**](https://www.ringcentral.com/)

RingCentral has become a leader in small business phone plans as more businesses go digital. This cloud-based phone system provider shines brightly, offering a robust line-up of features.

The distinguishable feature is its ***flexibility*** – regardless of your company’s size or industry, there’s almost certainly a plan for you.

And here’s another cool thing – you don’t need to use RingCentral with existing hardware; ***it also offers softphone capabilities***. RingCentral caters to small businesses with its integrated communications platform on your mobile device.

For businesses with remote or distributed teams, you can maintain seamless communication and collaboration regardless of location, fostering team cohesion and productivity without needing a physical office.

It combines voice calls, video conferencing, team messaging, and collaboration. You can text a colleague, make an international call, start a video conference, or share files from within the app—this is genuinely unified communication brought to life!

Now let me tell you about the ***cost-effectiveness*** aspect! With RingCentral, expect no hidden costs and an attractive total cost of ownership compared to traditional on-premises phone systems.

With plans starting as low as $19.99 per user monthly when billed annually for unlimited calling and SMS in the US and Canada, it’s easy on finances, too, making it one of the best for businesses!

Plus, options like ***Glip by RingCentral*** offer free video meetings combined with messaging so teams can follow up quickly.

Its unique features include HD voice calls that promise clear sound quality. At the same time, visual voicemail lets you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them, which can be handy during meetings or presentations.

With Internet fax service included at no extra charge and seamless integrations with over 200+ apps such as Google G-Suite or Microsoft Office 365 – productivity is sure set onto an unparalleled trajectory.

So, lovable tech-geeks out there might ask about ***security***. Fear not, my friends!

To protect your business communications, RingCentral uses seven layers of security, redundant data centers, and 24/7 monitoring to ensure 99.999% uptime.

***But what if your internet goes down?***

RingCentral offers a mobile app that can use cellular data as a backup. This keeps your business phone working even if your primary connection fails.

RingCentral has a strong reputation for ***customer service, offering 24/7 support to all customers***.

RingCentral also offers a [15-day free trial](https://signup.ringcentral.com/signup-v8.0/) for up to 20 phone lines, after which you can choose a plan. Annual billing provides a discount compared to month-to-month payments.

## **#5:**[**T-Mobile**](https://www.t-mobile.com/)

With its competitive pricing on its cell phone plans, T-Mobile has long been a favorite among smaller businesses.

They also have a ***reputation for excellent customer service***, which is critical for small businesses that often encounter technical difficulties.

Their ***flexible and feature-rich plans*** make it easy for businesses to stay connected, whether employees are in the office or working remotely. One of T-Mobile’s most popular offerings is its Magenta plan, which includes unlimited talk, text, and data.

For small businesses operating primarily in cities, this means you can enjoy high-speed data and reliable coverage at competitive prices, allowing you to stay connected with customers and team members without breaking the bank.

It comes with ***3GB of 4G LTE mobile hotspot data***, which can be crucial when you’re on the go and need to connect your laptop or other devices to the internet.

The plan also offers ***one hour of free Gogo in-flight Wi-Fi for each flight you take***, which can be particularly beneficial if your business requires frequent flying.

While T-Mobile’s coverage isn’t quite as comprehensive nationwide as some competitors like Verizon or AT&T, it continues to expand its network each year.

They’ve been ***focusing*** mainly on ***improving their 5G coverage***, which is important considering that more devices are becoming 5G compatible.

Furthermore, if your business operates primarily in urban areas where T-Mobile’s coverage is robust, this may not even be an issue for you.

***What if you sometimes work in areas with spotty coverage?***

T-Mobile offers Wi-Fi calling on most phones. This lets you make calls and send texts over any Wi-Fi network, filling in possible coverage gaps.

One should not forget that T-Mobile’s plans do not include annual contracts—a liberating feature for small businesses that prefer not to feel tied down.

### **T-Mobile Pricing**

T-Mobile offers [four business cell phone plans](https://www.t-mobile.com/business/wireless-business-plans) with different pricing tiers based on the number of lines and features included:

1. ***Business Unlimited Select***: $25/line for 6+ lines ($150/mo)
2. ***Business Unlimited Advanced***: $30/line for 6+ lines ($180/mo)
3. ***Business Unlimited Ultimate***: $40/line for 6+ lines ($240/mo)
4. ***Business Unlimited Edge***: $45/line for 6+ lines ($270/mo)

The per-line price decreases as more lines are added, with the lowest prices starting at six lines. For example, Business Unlimited Advanced is $30/line for 6+ lines but a higher per-line cost for fewer lines.

T-Mobile also has special offers like Up to $10,000 ($1,000 per line) for new accounts, adding at least ten lines on Business Unlimited Edge.

Go5G Business Plans are another option, starting at $36/line for five lines with AutoPay and a free third line discount.

## **Comparing The Top 5: How do They Vary?**

The top 5 plans differ in more than just pricing and data allowances.

Several factors can impact your business, depending on its specific needs.

***Verizon*** arguably has the best network across the country. If you’re running a business where you or your employees need to travel frequently, especially to more remote areas, Verizon should be at the top of your list.

For example, if your business requires travel to rural areas more than 20% of the time, Verizon’s coverage could mean the difference between closing a deal or missing out. Their network reaches 99% of Americans, including in many remote locations where other carriers struggle.

They offer unlimited plans with premium data and 5G Ultra Wideband support for those who need high speeds for stuff like video conferencing on the go.

Next up is ***AT&T***, which also boasts a strong network across most of the U.S. Its business plans are flexible and can accommodate businesses of all sizes.

The highlight of their offering is undoubtedly their Business Unlimited plan, which includes unlimited talk time, text messages, and data usage at competitive prices. This is an excellent option for small businesses looking to stay connected without worrying about overage charges.

***Xfinity*** is another strong contender but takes a different approach to its offering. It utilizes Verizon’s network, which gives it solid coverage, but it focuses on offering cost-effective solutions rather than packing in all kinds of features.

Xfinity makes a lot of sense for small businesses with less demanding connectivity needs or those looking to save on telecom expenses without compromising quality.

As a hypothetical example, a small retail shop with five employees might save $50-100 per month by switching to Xfinity from a primary carrier. This could add up to $600-1200 in annual savings—potentially enough to upgrade its point-of-sale system or fund a marketing campaign.

***RingCentral*** stands out as different from traditional cellular providers. It’s a cloud-based phone system provider that allows businesses to use existing internet connections (like Wi-Fi or cellular) for voice calls and other communication needs.

This type of setup can be great for very small companies or startups working remotely where everyone already has home internet or cell service.

We have ***T-Mobile,*** which emerged as a fierce contenders after merging with Sprint in recent years.

T-Mobile’s coverage has vastly improved, thanks partly to the merger, and they’ve always been known for their budget-friendly plans. For small businesses with limited budgets, T-Mobile offers a good balance between cost, coverage, and features in its small business plans.

It’s clear that while these five providers are all excellent choices for small business cell phone plans, they each have unique strengths.

It boils down to your specific needs and which provider can best meet them.

## **Factors to Consider When Choosing a Plan**

Choosing a small business cell phone plan involves balancing cost, reliability, and coverage to ensure smooth communication.

Not letting ***the price tag be your sole determining factor is critical***.

1. The first factor you should consider is ***coverage***.

After all, a cell phone plan without adequate coverage can be more disadvantageous than beneficial. This becomes even more significant if your business requires you to travel frequently or if your team members are spread across different geographical locations.

Coverage is crucial because poor signal strength can lead to dropped calls or slow data speeds, potentially causing missed opportunities or frustrated customers. This is especially important for businesses that rely on mobile communication for client interactions or remote work.

Check each provider’s network coverage map and note any potential issues, such as dead zones or weak signals, in critical areas for your business operations.

Spend 30 minutes studying coverage maps for your top 3 provider choices. Pay special attention to areas where your team frequently travels or works remotely. For example, if you have salespeople who regularly visit clients in suburban areas, ensure the coverage extends at least 20 miles outside major city centers.

2. ***The reliability of service*** is another fundamental aspect to consider.

In today’s fast-paced business environment, dropped calls or slow data speeds can mean missed opportunities. Check independent reports on network reliability and customer reviews for an unbiased opinion about each provider’s services.

3. Beyond coverage and reliability, consider ***your company’s specific needs***. How much data do you need?

Do you require international capabilities? And what kind of customer service does the provider offer in case of technical difficulties?

Each business has unique requirements for a mobile plan; thus, picking one should be an informed decision based on those specific needs.

4. Yet, significantly, ***affordability*** cannot be overlooked.

While comprehensive plans are attractive, they must fit your budget to be assets rather than liabilities.

Generally, keep your cell phone expenses under 5% of your total operating budget. For a small business with $10,000 in monthly expenses, this means targeting a cell phone plan that costs at most $500 per month. Adjust this percentage based on how critical mobile communication is to your business model.

***What if your usage varies month to month?***

Look for plans with flexible data options or the ability to adjust your plan mid-cycle. This can help you avoid overpaying during slower months or incurring overage fees during busy periods.

So compare different plans, considering not just upfront costs but any possible hidden charges, such as overage fees or early termination fees.

Making an informed choice about a small business cell phone plan hinges on understanding these essential criteria: coverage area, reliability of service, unique requirements tailored to your company’s needs, and finally, monetary considerations, which encompass not just upfront costs but potential hidden charges as well.

Armed with this information, you should be able to decide to enhance your business’s communication capabilities without straining your budget.

## **Negotiating with Providers**

As a small business, you have more negotiating power than you might think. Providers often see you as a valuable client, not just a customer. Many providers are willing to offer special deals and discounts to secure your business, and it’s always worth asking what kind of perks they can provide.

If, for instance, you find that ***data usage*** is a significant cost for your company, it could be worth discussing this with your provider. They might offer an increased data limit for a reduced price or unlimited data at no extra cost.

Similarly, if ***international calls*** make up a large part of your monthly bill, see if there’s any flexibility to lower these costs. Remember – the worst they can say is no.

Set a goal to negotiate at least three aspects of your plan. For instance, aim for a 10% discount on your monthly bill, 5GB of extra data, and waived activation fees. Even if you only succeed on one or two points, you’ll likely save hundreds of dollars throughout your contract.

***What if the provider won’t budge on price?***

Ask about non-monetary perks like free device upgrades, additional lines at a discount, or extended customer support hours. These can add value to your plan without affecting the base price.

One of the most effective negotiation tactics is ***comparison shopping***. If another provider offers better deals or packages than the one you’re currently with, don’t hesitate to mention this during negotiations.

It might encourage them to match (or potentially even beat!) those offers to retain your business.

Remember ***equipment,*** too. If one carrier offers free upgrades or lower device costs on top-tier smartphones or tablets, use that information as leverage when negotiating with other carriers.

***Patience and persistence are vital in the negotiation process*** when dealing with service providers, especially those related to technology like cell phone carriers. You might not get exactly what you want right off the bat, but sticking at it and approaching each conversation professionally can lead to eventual success—improved terms that better fit your business needs.

Remember to consider the value of ***forming good relationships with service representatives***. They can become champions for your cause within their organization, making further negotiations easier.

So always keep communication open, friendly, and respectful even when pushing hard for what seems like unattainable concessions – who knows, the person on the other end of the line might just have that extra bit of sway to get you exactly what you want.
