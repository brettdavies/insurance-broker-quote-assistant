# Can I add a driver to my car insurance?

Whether it's a roommate, a spouse or significant other, or even a teenage child or college student, there are many situations when adding a driver to your car insurance makes sense. Most insurance companies allow you (and may require you) to add another driver to your car insurance policy if the person drives the insured cars regularly or shares the same permanent residence. Most insurers will also allow you to share a single car insurance policy with someone if you live with them.

## How to add someone to your car insurance policy

When adding someone to your car insurance, you can either call your car insurance company or log in to your account online to add a new driver to your policy. Your insurance company will typically need the driver's name, date of birth, driving history, license information, as well as their [vehicle identification number](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-a-vin/) (VIN) if you also plan to share one policy that covers both of your vehicles.

You can typically make a change to your policy at any time to add a new driver at your residence, such as a teenage child, or a driver that just started driving your car regularly.

ADDING A DRIVER VS. SHARING A POLICY

Adding a driver to your insurance policy means they're an insured driver under your policy when they drive your car. So, if they get into an accident, your insurer is more likely to cover the damage than for an unlisted driver. Sharing a policy with someone typically means both of your vehicles are covered under one policy.

## Who should I add to my car insurance?

You should add any regular drivers of your car to your insurance policy so that damages from accidents are covered. Also, you can add any drivers that live at your permanent address, and most insurance companies will require it. Some states may allow you to [exclude a driver](https://www.progressive.com/answers/excluded-driver/) from being covered by the policy.

Here are some common drivers that are added to a policy:

### Roommate

Roommates may add each other to their policies because they live at the same address. You and your roommate could also share a car insurance policy for convenience and potential savings. Learn more about [sharing car insurance with roommates](https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-insurance-with-roommates/).

### Significant other

Unmarried couples who live together should add each other to their policies or share one policy. If you don't live together, but your significant other regularly drives your car, then you should add them to your policy.

### Spouse

Many insurance companies require married couples who live together to be on the same policy. Learn more about [adding a spouse to car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-with-spouse/).

### Teen driver or college student

If your teen driver or college student has a valid driver's license or permit, you should add them as a driver on your policy. If your teen drives your car regularly, then they should be added to your policy. This may be necessary even if they're also insured on another auto policy, like another parent's policy. Learn more about [car insurance for teens](https://www.progressive.com/answers/teen-driver-insurance/).

If your college student attends school away from home, then they should be added to your policy if they stay with you and drive your car when home on school breaks. Find out more about [car insurance for college students](https://www.progressive.com/answers/college-student-insurance/).

### Friend

If you don't live together, but your friend drives your car regularly, then you should add them to your policy. See more about [adding a friend to your car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/adding-friends-to-car-insurance/).

## Can I add someone to my car insurance that doesn't live with me?

Yes, if the person drives your car regularly, then you should add them to your insurance policy.

## How much does it cost to add a driver to my car insurance?

The cost of adding a driver to your car insurance or sharing a policy varies based on factors like the driver's age and their [motor vehicle record](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-a-motor-vehicle-record/).

For example, many insurance companies offer a discount if you have a teen driver or a good student listed on your policy. On the other hand, a driver with a history of insurance claims and traffic violations may increase the cost of your policy.
