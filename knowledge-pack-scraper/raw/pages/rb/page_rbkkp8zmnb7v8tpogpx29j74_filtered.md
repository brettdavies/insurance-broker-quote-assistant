## What’s New in Illinois Auto Insurance Laws for 2025

Illinois continues to require liability coverage for every registered vehicle. Beginning in 2020, the state has enforced this law with an electronic verification system that runs continuously and checks active policies twice a year. If your policy lapses, expect a notice and possible registration suspension until you show proof of coverage.

To avoid these consequences, make your insurance payments on time, ensure your policy stays active, and keep proof of coverage handy. If you switch companies, make sure there’s no gap in coverage, even for a few days, or the system may flag your plates and trigger a suspension notice. Staying continuous with your insurance is the easiest way to avoid interruptions.

## Illinois Mandatory Auto Insurance Requirements in 2025

To drive legally in Illinois, you need liability and uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage. Lenders often also ask for physical damage coverage on financed vehicles, which can include both collision and comprehensive coverage. Let’s take a closer look at the state-mandated coverages you need to carry in 2025.

### Bodily Injury Liability Coverage

[Bodily injury liability insurance](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/bodily-injury-liability/) pays for injuries you cause to other people in an accident. This coverage can include hospital bills, lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and even legal defense costs if you’re sued. Illinois requires minimum limits of 25/50, which means:

* **$25,000 bodily injury per person:** This is the maximum your policy pays for one injured person’s medical bills, rehabilitation, and related costs.
* **$50,000 bodily injury per accident:** This is the total coverage available for all injured people in one crash, which can be divided among them as needed.

However, those amounts may not cover a serious accident. Medical bills can rise quickly, especially if multiple people are injured, so you may want to choose higher limits for increased protection.

### Property Damage Liability Coverage

[Property damage liability coverage](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/property-damage-liability-coverage/) pays for damage to another person’s car or property when you’re at fault for an accident. This can include repairs to vehicles, fences, buildings, or other structures. The state minimum is $20,000 per accident, but one crash involving several cars or even a single brand-new vehicle can easily exceed that amount.

### Uninsured Motorist Coverage

Illinois requires [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/uninsured-motorists-coverage/) to protect you and your passengers if you’re injured by an uninsured driver or in a hit-and-run. As with regular bodily injury liability coverage, the minimum limit is 25/50, though you can choose to raise that coverage for additional protection from extensive out-of-pocket expenses after a serious accident. This coverage helps pay for medical bills and related expenses that would otherwise fall to you.

It’s also worth noting that uninsured motorist coverage doesn’t automatically reimburse you for damage to your vehicle. Adding uninsured motorist property damage is a smart step, giving you added protection in the all-too-common situation where another driver lacks adequate coverage.

### Medical Payments Coverage

Medical payments coverage is optional but helpful, as it handles medical costs for you and your passengers regardless of who is at fault for the accident. Common limits range from $2,500 to $10,000. This coverage can fill gaps if your health plan has deductibles or copays, so many families choose to add it for peace of mind.

## Understanding Illinois No-Fault Insurance Laws

Illinois is an at-fault state. That means claims typically go through the at-fault driver’s insurer. This matters when you compare liability insurance versus full coverage.

If you’re at fault in an accident, liability coverage takes care of damages for the other party. Full coverage includes collision and comprehensive to help repair or replace your car after incidents such as crashes, theft, or storm damage. Like medical payments coverage, collision and comprehensive coverage can be used regardless of who was at fault for an accident.

## Penalties and Consequences for Noncompliance in 2025

Skipping auto insurance coverage in Illinois is expensive. If the electronic verification system flags your vehicle for a violation, the state will send you a registration suspension letter. You’ll then need to provide sufficient proof of insurance, or your registration can be suspended, requiring you to submit proof of an active policy and pay a $100 fee to have it reinstated.

If you’re pulled over for a traffic infraction or involved in an accident and can’t provide proof of insurance, you’ll typically incur a minimum $500 fine. Drive with suspended plates due to a prior violation, and the fine jumps to $1,000. Repeat violations may trigger a four-month suspension.

Illinois auto insurance claim laws can also cause complications if you’re uninsured and another driver hits you. If the other driver is also uninsured or has insufficient coverage to take care of your injuries or damages, you’ll be responsible for all of your own costs out of pocket, in addition to the standard legal penalties for driving uninsured. Carrying at least the required coverage keeps you on the right side of Illinois insurance laws and helps you avoid long-term rate hikes linked to violations.

## Special Situations and Coverage Scenarios in Illinois

Some Illinois drivers must file an SR-22 certificate if the state deems them high-risk. This isn’t insurance — it’s proof that you carry the state’s required coverage. Illinois courts may require it for a variety of reasons, such as three or more mandatory insurance violation convictions, DUIs, or unsatisfied judgment suspensions. We file these forms on your behalf and provide instant proof so you can get back on the road as soon as possible. Start with an [SR-22 insurance quote](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/sr-22-quote/).

### Finding Affordable Protection

We help drivers balance cost with protection, including liability insurance versus full-coverage choices.

## Your Next Step for Illinois Auto Insurance

While Illinois law sets the baseline, you decide how much protection you want beyond the mandated minimum coverages. Choose limits that fit your car, driving habits, and budget, and keep your coverage active so the state’s checks don’t sideline your plates.
