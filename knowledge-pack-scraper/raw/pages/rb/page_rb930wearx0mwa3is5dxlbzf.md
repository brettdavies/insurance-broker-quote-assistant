Progressive’s [Snapshot program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive/snapshot) helps safe drivers save money on car insurance. You could get a [discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) with Snapshot by avoiding hard stops, speeding, and late-night driving.
The average driver saves around $322 per year with Snapshot, according to Progressive’s website. But be careful, because risky driving behaviors could raise your [insurance premium](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium).
We’ll explain how the [Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) safe driver discount works and what real Progressive customers say about the program. Plus, we’ll give you driving tips to help you maximize your savings.
## **What Is the Progressive Safe Driver Discount?**
You can get Progressive’s [safe driver discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/safe-driver-discount) only if you enroll in the Snapshot program. New Progressive customers can get an enrollment discount, which will be replaced with your personalized discount once the policy renews. Your discount savings depend on your driving habits while using the Snapshot mobile app or plug-in device.
Eligibility criteria and discount restrictions vary by [state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state). Progressive doesn’t offer the Snapshot program in [California](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/california), and drivers in [Hawaii](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/hawaii) and [New York](https://www.compare.com/by-state/new-york) can’t get the enrollment discount.
Most auto insurers offer a safe driving discount, a telematics program, or both. Progressive has only the Snapshot program, which includes a rate reduction incentive for allowing the insurer to collect telematics data, including your GPS location and driving patterns.
Let’s take a look at how much you can save with Progressive’s safe driver discount.
## **How Much Can You Save With the Progressive Safe Driver Discount?**
Your driving behavior determines how much you can save with the Progressive safe driver program. Progressive advertises average savings of $169 for signing up, and $322 per year with the Snapshot program. Although most drivers save with the Snapshot driving app, around 20% see their insurance rates increase due to risky driving habits.
That said, Snapshot may offer more savings than [other usage-based insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) programs. One Reddit user reported $455 in savings with Snapshot after GEICO’s DriveEasy raised their premium by more than $100.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-safe-driver-discount#cite-1) Another had similar results, receiving a discount of $232 at their renewal, for $462 in annual savings.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-safe-driver-discount#cite-2)

## **How to Get the Progressive Safe Driver Discount**
![A tree-lined street with parked cars on both sides, leading uphill toward residential buildings in the background.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/b502265336/parallel-parked-cars.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
You can enroll in Progressive Snapshot when you buy your policy or by calling Progressive at 1 (877) 329-7283. Only new Progressive customers get a discount when enrolling.
You’ll receive periodic Snapshot emails tracking your driving habits and potential discount savings. You can also log into your account to view your progress.
Snapshot assesses your risk as a driver and uses that data to determine your insurance rates. Snapshot monitors:
  * Mileage
  * The time of day you drive
  * Hard braking
  * Fast acceleration
  * Speed
  * Phone activity


Some insurance companies offer a [defensive driver discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/defensive-driver-discount), but you have to complete a [defensive driving course](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/driver-safety-discount) to qualify. You can use Snapshot to improve your driving without having to pay for a course.
You should check your driving status frequently and review how Snapshot scores your driving patterns. Then, use that information to improve your driving skills and increase your chances of receiving the most savings. But remember that risky driving behavior can lead to higher premiums.
Here are a few safe driving tips to get you started:
  * Avoid using your phone while driving.
  * Avoid unnecessary driving.
  * Don’t drive between midnight and 4 a.m. on the weekends.
  * Avoid accelerating quickly.
  * Avoid speeding and tailgating, which can help reduce hard braking.


Although Snapshot may offer the most savings, it’s not the only way to [lower your car insurance premiums](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). Let’s look at some other ways you can save money with Progressive.
