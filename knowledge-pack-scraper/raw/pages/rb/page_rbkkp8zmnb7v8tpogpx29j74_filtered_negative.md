[Bodily injury liability insurance](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/bodily-injury-liability/) pays for injuries you cause to other people in an accident. This coverage can include hospital bills, lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and even legal defense costs if you’re sued. Illinois requires minimum limits of 25/50, which means:
* **$25,000 bodily injury per person:** This is the maximum your policy pays for one injured person’s medical bills, rehabilitation, and related costs.
* **$50,000 bodily injury per accident:** This is the total coverage available for all injured people in one crash, which can be divided among them as needed.
[Property damage liability coverage](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/property-damage-liability-coverage/) pays for damage to another person’s car or property when you’re at fault for an accident. This can include repairs to vehicles, fences, buildings, or other structures. The state minimum is $20,000 per accident, but one crash involving several cars or even a single brand-new vehicle can easily exceed that amount.
Illinois requires [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.americanautoinsurance.com/uninsured-motorists-coverage/) to protect you and your passengers if you’re injured by an uninsured driver or in a hit-and-run. As with regular bodily injury liability coverage, the minimum limit is 25/50, though you can choose to raise that coverage for additional protection from extensive out-of-pocket expenses after a serious accident. This coverage helps pay for medical bills and related expenses that would otherwise fall to you.
Some Illinois drivers must file an SR-22 certificate if the state deems them high-risk. This isn’t insurance — it’s proof that you carry the state’s required coverage. Illinois courts may require it for a variety of reasons, such as three or more mandatory insurance violation convictions, DUIs, or unsatisfied judgment suspensions. We file these forms on your behalf and provide instant proof so you can get back on the road as soon as possible.
