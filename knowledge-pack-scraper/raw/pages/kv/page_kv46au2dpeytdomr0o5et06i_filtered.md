## Why Is Home Insurance so Expensive in Illinois?

Home insurance is expensive in Illinois because of the increasing number of claims, the high risk of severe weather and natural disasters, rising material and labor costs and state insurance laws. Below, we explain each factor in detail.

![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)

Rising Claims

When homeowners frequently file insurance claims, insurers may raise premiums to offset the cost of payouts. More claims suggest greater risk, leading to higher insurance costs for everyone in the area.

![rain icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/rain_fkozzi.svg)

High Weather Risks

Areas prone to severe weather, such as hurricanes or wildfires, face higher home insurance costs due to the increased likelihood of damage, resulting in more claims and greater expenses for insurers.

![hammer icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/hammer_yk2psa.svg)

Rising Material and Labor Costs

As the cost of building materials and labor increases, so does the cost to repair or rebuild homes. Insurers raise premiums to cover these higher expenses in the event of a claim.

![bond icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/bond_sjrp2s.svg)

State Insurance Laws

State-specific insurance regulations can influence costs. Mandates on coverage types or minimum limits can increase the baseline cost of insurance policies for homeowners.

## What Affects Illinois Home Insurance Costs?

Like for most home insurance companies, regardless of state, pricing is affected by these factors:

We've highlighted below how much each factor affects rates specific to Illinois.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Illinois State Remnant Tier Aggregate | $211 | $2,530 |

Coverage choices are the second most influential factor in home insurance rates in Illinois, with annual costs ranging from $1,600 to $8,087. Higher coverage limits and lower deductibles increase premiums, while lower limits and higher deductibles reduce costs.

| Cost Category | Coverage Level | Deductible | Average Monthly Rate | Average Annual Rate |

| Lowest | $100K Dwelling / $50K Personal Property / $100K Liability | 2000 | $133 | $1,600 |
| Highest | $1MM Dwelling / $500K Personal Property / $1MM Liability | 500 | $674 | $8,087 |

### How Much Do Home Details Affect Home Insurance Costs?

Home details like age, construction materials and roof type are the third most influential factor in Illinois homeowners insurance rates, averaging from $104 to $245 per month. These factors affect replacement costs and the risk of damage or theft, leading to rate differences.

| Cost Category | Home Age | Construction Type | Roof Type | Average Monthly Rate | Average Annual Rate |

| Lowest | Nationwide | $132 | $1,585 |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### How Much Does Claims History Affect Home Insurance Costs?

In Illinois, claims history has a smaller impact on homeowners insurance premiums than other factors, affecting rates by up to 11% or about $331 annually. Filing more claims increases perceived risk, leading to higher premiums.

| Cost Category | Claims History | Average Monthly Rate | Average Annual Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest | Claim free for 5+ years | $229 | $2,754 |
| Highest | 2 claims in past 5 years | $288 | $3,460 |

## Tips to Save on Illinois Home Insurance

Especially with high costs in Illinois, you need to find ways to save on premiums to buy a home or cut expenses for your current home. Below are some tips to help you find the best and [cheapest home insurance in Illinois](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/cheap-homeowners-insurance-illinois/).

1. 1

   Find How Much Coverage You Need Beforehand

   [Determining how much home insurance you need](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/how-much-home-insurance-do-you-need/) before buying allows you to frame how you search for coverage and avoid being oversold by agents. In addition to [standard coverage options](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/types-of-homeowners-insurance/), you should also consider if you need add-ons to protect any additional items you own.
2. 2

   Research Costs and Discounts Beforehand

   To know whether you’re actually getting a good deal, you’ll need to understand [average costs for you](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-cost-of-home-insurance/) and your home specifically. Also, be sure to ask about all home insurance discounts with agents since insurers are not required to apply some of their reductions unless you ask them for home policies.
3. 3

   Compare Multiple Providers Through Different Avenues

   Compare multiple insurers apples to apples to find the best coverage for your needs. Use various methods, including online comparison sites, brokers, provider websites, and agents, as quotes vary significantly across these channels.
4. 4

   Consider Bundling Policies

   Bundling policies can lead to significant savings. For example, [combining home and auto insurance in Illinois](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-auto-bundle-in-illinois/) can help you save on both policies annually.
5. 5

   Reduce Your Personal Risk Profile

   To get cheaper premiums on your home, consider making improvements like adding storm shutters or home security systems. Also, improving your credit score can decrease premiums drastically. For instance, moving from a fair to a good credit score can save you 28% on average.
6. 6

   See if You Are Eligible for State Programs

   Check if your state offers programs to help get affordable coverage if denied traditional home insurance. For example, Illinois offers the TFPA policy to insure you if traditional insurers deny you coverage. While TFPA plans don’t offer the same coverage amount as traditional policies, they meet mortgage requirements.
