Our experience with USAA was horrendous. We lost our home to Hurricane Beryl. Having been a member for 27 years and never making any claims, this experience was indescribable. USAA, to whom we had paid $410.36 for years, had me doing their job. No tickets, no DUI, and a 20-year-old driver. That is too expensive for anyone. After Beryl, there was no power, which meant no electricity, no internet, no open stores, no food, and no gas. By the beginning of the second month, USAA tried to make Texas Wind and Air responsible, then FEMA, for paying for the broken roof, fallen trees, flooded home, and damaged AC. We decided to pack up and move on our own dime again. USAA is and always will be a ripoff. Very expensive to be a USAA member. Never again. We are just fine with AAA. Personally, the old ways of taking care of folks with insurance are only found and available with AAA. USAA has not stopped offering me a job with their claims department since Hurricane Beryl, though. I must know what I am doing better than my agent, who got fired for drinking and falsifying claims documents. There's more to the storyline with USAA. Plan on having to call them constantly to make sure they are at work.
