No tickets, no DUI, and a 20-year-old driver. That is too expensive for anyone. \n\nAfter Beryl, there was no power, which meant no electricity, no internet, no open stores, no food, and no gas. \n\nBy the beginning of the second month, USAA tried to make Texas Wind and Air responsible, then FEMA, for paying for the broken roof, fallen trees, flooded home, and damaged AC. We decided to pack up and move on our own dime again. \n\nUSAA is and always will be a ripoff. Very expensive to be a USAA member. Never again. We are just fine with AAA. Personally, the old ways of taking care of folks with insurance are only found and available with AAA. \n\nUSAA has not stopped offering me a job with their claims department since Hurricane Beryl, though. I must know what I am doing better than my agent, who got fired for drinking and falsifying claims documents. \n\nThere's more to the storyline with USAA.

Most major companies allow you to bundle your auto insurance with renters insurance. You may not save as much, but you’ll still benefit from streamlined billing and account management."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does bundling affect your coverage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bundling doesn’t change your coverage, but it may limit your flexibility if you need to change one of your policies. For example, some insurance companies don’t offer gap coverage or rideshare insurance. Make sure each policy meets your needs before bundling them together."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do all insurers offer bundling discounts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Not all insurance companies offer bundling discounts, and the discount amount varies from company to company. Some may offer only minimal savings, so it’s important to get quotes from multiple companies and compare the total cost — not just the discount percentage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you unbundle your policies later if needed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. You can unbundle anytime, but you’ll lose your multi-policy discount and have separate bills. If you’re considering switching one policy, make sure to check how it will affect your overall costs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What’s the best combined home and auto insurance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The best home and auto insurance bundle for you depends on several factors, including the types of policies you have and where you live.

Bundling home and auto insurance is one of the easiest and most effective ways to save on both policies. For example, people who bundle with Allstate can save up to 25% on both policies.

class="b5_kn">SCAM</span></div><div class="b5_kv">Reviewed in Colorado on July 2025</div><div class="b5_kx">Our experience with USAA was horrendous. We lost our home to Hurricane Beryl. Having been a member for 27 years and never making any claims, this experience was indescribable. 

USAA, to whom we had paid $410.36 for years, had me doing their job. No tickets, no DUI, and a 20-year-old driver. That is too expensive for anyone. 

After Beryl, there was no power, which meant no electricity, no internet, no open stores, no food, and no gas. 

By the beginning of the second month, USAA tried to make Texas Wind and Air responsible, then FEMA, for paying for the broken roof, fallen trees, flooded home, and damaged AC. We decided to pack up and move on our own dime again. 

USAA is and always will be a ripoff. Very expensive to be a USAA member. Never again. We are just fine with AAA. Personally, the old ways of taking care of folks with insurance are only found and available with AAA. 

USAA has not stopped offering me a job with their claims department since Hurricane Beryl, though. I must know what I am doing better than my agent, who got fired for drinking and falsifying claims documents. 

There's more to the storyline with USAA. Plan on having to call them constantly to make sure they are at work.</div></div></div><div class="cw_km"><div class="lt-vstack b5_km b5_kw"><div class="b5_kr"><div class="b5_kp">Barbara</div><div
