Bundling your home and auto insurance can be a smart move. It offers the convenience of managing both policies with one company and could save you money — up to 25%, depending on the insurer. But not all bundles are created equal.

But not all bundles are created equal. For example, State Farm advertises average savings of well over $1,000 from bundling home and auto insurance. Allstate, on the other hand, offers potential savings of 25%. And companies like Farmers and USAA advertise up to 10% off premiums.

We’ll explain how bundling works, what to watch out for, and how to decide if it’s the right choice for you. We’ll also cover tips for finding the [best insurance company](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) so you can protect your assets and stretch your dollar.

Key Takeaways

* Bundling multiple insurance products with the same company is one of the single most effective ways to lower your premiums.
* Some good options for bundling include State Farm, Allstate, USAA, Farmers, and Progressive.
* Bundling also offers convenience, simplified billing, and maybe a single deductible for claims affecting both your home and vehicle.

## **5 Best Companies to Bundle Home and Auto Insurance**

Not all insurance companies offer the same bundling experience. Some provide deeper discounts, while others stand out for their customer service.

To find the best home and auto bundling deals, we analyzed top insurers’ customer satisfaction, available coverages, and discount amounts.

We chose the following five companies based on those factors, as well as their average rates and claims processes.

SCAM

Reviewed in Colorado on July 2025

Our experience with USAA was horrendous. We lost our home to Hurricane Beryl. Having been a member for 27 years and never making any claims, this experience was indescribable.
USAA, to whom we had paid $410.36 for years, had me doing their job. No tickets, no DUI, and a 20-year-old driver. That is too expensive for anyone.
After Beryl, there was no power, which meant no electricity, no internet, no open stores, no food, and no gas.
By the beginning of the second month, USAA tried to make Texas Wind and Air responsible, then FEMA, for paying for the broken roof, fallen trees, flooded home, and damaged AC. We decided to pack up and move on our own dime again.
USAA is and always will be a ripoff. Very expensive to be a USAA member. Never again. We are just fine with AAA. Personally, the old ways of taking care of folks with insurance are only found and available with AAA.
USAA has not stopped offering me a job with their claims department since Hurricane Beryl, though. I must know what I am doing better than my agent, who got fired for drinking and falsifying claims documents.
There's more to the storyline with USAA. Plan on having to call them constantly to make sure they are at work.

## **How Much You Can Save by Bundling Home and Auto Insurance**

How much you save by bundling home and auto insurance depends on several factors, including your location, driving record, home value, and the insurance company you choose. While you’re not guaranteed to save money, most insurers offer discounts for bundling multiple policies.

Discounts vary from company to company, but we found that you can generally save anywhere from 10% to 25% by bundling your home and auto policies with the same company.

## **Benefits of Bundling Home and Auto Insurance**

The main reason many people bundle their home and auto insurance is simple: [savings](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). Insurance companies often reward [customer loyalty](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/loyalty-discount), so bundling can unlock discounts you wouldn’t get by buying policies from two different companies. But the benefits go beyond saving money.

Other benefits of bundling include:

  #### Simplified billing and account management

  Bundling offers the convenience of dealing with one company, one bill, and often one point of contact for service or claims.

  #### Single deductible for related claims

  If a storm damages your home and vehicle, some insurance companies offer a single [deductible](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles), so you’ll only pay once for both claims. That can make a big difference when disaster strikes.

  #### Streamlined communication

  With just one insurance company, you can get answers and resolve issues quickly and easily.

## **Downsides of Bundling Insurance Policies**

While bundling can offer up-front savings, it’s not always the best long-term deal. Some insurance companies may raise rates over time, and bundling could limit your ability to shop for the cheapest price for each policy. You might also find fewer options to customize coverage if one policy doesn’t fully meet your needs.

To avoid overpaying, review your bundled policies annually and compare quotes from other companies to make sure you’re still getting the value you signed up for.

Our team analyzed and scored each company based on criteria such as cost, customer satisfaction, policy management, availability, and industry reputation.

Additionally, we analyzed each company’s advertised bundling discounts and maximum savings figures to select the five companies you see here.

Usually. Most major companies allow you to bundle your auto insurance with renters insurance. You may not save as much, but you’ll still benefit from streamlined billing and account management.

Bundling doesn’t change your coverage, but it may limit your flexibility if you need to change one of your policies. For example, some insurance companies don’t offer [gap coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/gap-insurance) or rideshare insurance. Make sure each policy meets your needs before bundling them together.

No. Not all insurance companies offer bundling discounts, and the discount amount varies from company to company. Some may offer only minimal savings, so it’s important to get quotes from multiple companies and compare the total cost — not just the discount percentage.

Yes. You can unbundle anytime, but you’ll lose your multi-policy discount and have separate bills. If you’re considering switching one policy, make sure to check how it will affect your overall costs.

The best home and auto insurance bundle for you depends on several factors, including the types of policies you have and where you live. That said, some of our top choices include State Farm, Allstate, and USAA.

Yes. Bundling home and auto insurance is one of the easiest and most effective ways to save on both policies. For example, people who bundle with Allstate can save up to 25% on both policies. And State Farm advertises potential annual savings of nearly $1,400.
