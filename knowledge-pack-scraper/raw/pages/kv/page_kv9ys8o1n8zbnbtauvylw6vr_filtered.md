Progressive's pricing structure for renters insurance is among the industry's most affordable. Coverage before discounts can start at $14.48 a month, with a $500 deductible. Progressive offers a wide range of deductibles both lower and higher than $500 that will then proportionally affect the price. This affords flexibility to Progressive's renters insurance product. Most customers qualify for the majority of the discounts that Progressive offers, thereby lowering their premium even further.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Annual Premium | Starting at $191 |
| Deductible Options | $250, $500, $1,000 and $2,500 |
| Maximum Liability Coverage | $0 |
| Property-Level Discounts | Security / Lobby Staff |

## Customer Experience

### Customer Service - 4.5 / 5

Progressive offers a quick 6-minute-long online quote form and also allows customers to purchase insurance online or over the phone with an agent. Progressive offers many customer contact options, which makes it easily accessible. It has a 24/7 customer service phone line where customers can report an accident, make a claim, pay a bill, make policy changes, get a quote, buy a policy, and get roadside assistance. They also offer a separate phone number specifically to report fraud or identity theft, and a fax number. Progressive can also be reached by online chat Monday through Friday from 5:00 am to 12:00 am EST or by email, but these are only available to customers with a login.  
  
The Better Business Bureau (BBB) has awarded Progressive with a high A- rating. This rating takes into consideration that the company failed to respond to two complaints lodged against it at the BBB, which is minimal compared to the 2,124 complaints that Progressive has closed in the past three years. Although Progressive received a higher than average complaint ratio at the NAIC, it is offset by the fact that only 5 complaints were resolved in favor of the consumer. Please note that the NAIC complaint ratio reflects the number of complaints a company receives divided by the total premiums written during a calendar year. The national median complaint ratio score is 1. Finally, JD Power and Associates awarded Progressive's underwriter with an "among the best" rating for customer interaction. This means that customers opined that Progressive's underwriter's customer service exceeded their expectations.

### Customer Ratings

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| TrustPilot Rating | 4.0 out of 5 |
| BBB Rating | A- |

### National Association of Insurance Commissioners

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| NAIC Complaint Ratio | 6.88 |
| NAIC Total Complaints | 5 |

\*The NAIC complaint ratio (in this case 6.88) is a ratio of the number of complaints a company received to the its total premiums written in a calendar year. The median complaint ratio across all companies is 1. A score below 1 means the company received fewer than average complaints. A score above 1 means the company received a higher number of complaints than average.

## Financial Strength Ratings

### Financial Strength - 5 / 5

Progressive is a respectable and solid organization, evinced by its 82 years of experience in the insurance industry. The company enjoys financial ratings that exceed the industry standard. It received the third-highest ratings from S&P (AA) and Moody's (Aa2), which are classified as high grade ratings. In addition, A.M. Best awarded Progressive with its second highest rating, an A+. The company's creditworthiness is undeniable, and likely to be long-term, which provides customers with the peace of mind that Progressive can successfully pay its claims.
