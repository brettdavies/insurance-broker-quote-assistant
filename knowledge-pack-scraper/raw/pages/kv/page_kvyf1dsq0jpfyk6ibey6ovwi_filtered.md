It’s good to note that the Drive Safe and Save program is unavailable to State Farm customers in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, or California. Instead, these drivers must look into additional [State Farm auto insurance discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.org/state-farm-auto-insurance-discounts/) or choose a different usage-based auto insurance program from another company to lower their rates.

![Usage-Based Insurance Definition Card: State Farm Drive Save & Save Review](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Usage-Based Insurance Definition Card: State Farm Drive Save & Save Review")![Usage-Based Insurance Definition Card: State Farm Drive Save & Save Review](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Usage-Based-Insurance-AI-4.png "Usage-Based Insurance Definition Card: State Farm Drive Save & Save Review")

What does the Drive Safe and Save track? Drive Safe and Save is a usage-based telematics service that keeps track of your driving patterns and mileage through the State Farm safe driving app.

The connected car program or the Drive Safe and Save app will monitor a number of aspects of your driving, including:

* **Acceleration:** If you accelerate too quickly, you may lose control of your vehicle and risk getting in an accident. Rapid braking and acceleration can both be signs of risky driving techniques. If you keep a safe distance from the car in front of you, you can slow down more smoothly and save money.
* **Cornering:** Telematics can monitor quick, sharp corners, which are typically not considered to be safe driving practices. You may be less in control of your car when making quick or sudden bends, which could cause accidents.
* **Speed:** As one of the riskiest driving practices, speeding can result in more frequent and serious accidents. By obeying the speed limit, you can get a bigger discount through the Drive Safe and Save program.
* **Phone Use:** Even though using a mobile phone while driving is dangerous, many people continue to do so. State Farm Drive Safe and Save phone use can negatively impact your score — utilizing a phone handsfree while driving can increase your State Farm Drive Safe and Save discount while making the roads safer for everyone.

State Farm compiles all these elements, incorporates them into your State Farm Drive Safe and Save grades, and determines your discount percentage. As a result, you can receive a sizable reduction on your auto insurance rate if you drive carefully and steer clear of dangers like forceful braking and speeding.

> State Farm uses Drive Safe & Save data to evaluate driving habits at renewal, potentially applying a discount of up to 50% based on factors like acceleration, braking, and other key metrics.

Always look around online for State Farm Drive Safe & Save reviews from policyholders to see if the program is a good fit for you.

### OnStar With State Farm Drive Safe & Save

The State Farm Drive Safe and Save OnStar app and beacon device are replaced with OnStar technology to track and reward safe driving. The key difference is that State Farm now collects your driving data through OnStar instead of the Drive Safe & Save app.

> An active OnStar membership is also required, with prices ranging from $14.99 to $44.99, depending on the tier.

OnStar, a division of General Motors, integrates telematics technology and other services into automobiles. However, some automobiles can be fitted with OnStar telematics even if GM doesn’t produce them. Check out our [GM auto insurance review](https://www.autoinsurance.org/companies/gm-auto-insurance-review/) to for more details about OnStar.

Drive Safe & Save’s OnStar version works much like the mobile app. You can enroll, track your driving, and review your performance through the app or web account. Higher discounts are awarded for safer driving.

We advise weighing the value of the other OnStar features against the cost of OnStar Drive Safe and Save before committing. Otherwise, using the State Farm Drive Safe and Save mobile app might be more advantageous, which has the benefit of being free. Be sure to check out Drive Safe and Save app reviews to see if the mobile app is better for you.

The majority of programs offer feedback on your driving to help you save money and promote driving safety. If you use this information to improve your habits, you can get [cheap auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/cheapest-auto-insurance-companies/) regardless of the company chosen.

It’s important to evaluate reviews of State Farm Drive Safe and Save to see if you would benefit from enrolling.

## Determining Whether State Farm Drive Safe & Save Is Right for You

State Farm Drive Safe and Save, also called Drive and Save, is a good option if you’re comfortable with continuous monitoring of your driving behavior. By allowing this, you could get even lower rates from State Farm, which already offers some of the most [affordable auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/cheapest-auto-insurance-companies/) policies.

We recommend you check out various Drive Safe State Farm reviews from sites such as Reddit or Consumer Reports to learn more about the program. Our research of Drive Safe reviews on Reddit found that there aren’t many major disadvantages to the program.

> [Is there a downside to State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/17s9nxl/is_there_a_downside_to_state_farms_drive_safe_and/)  
> by[u/earthboy17](https://www.reddit.com/user/earthboy17/) in[Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/)

Reddit users explain a big downside of the program is that you could eventually lose your low-mileage discount if you report incorrect mileage to State Farm when signing up.

> For example, if you claim to drive 5,000 miles a year and receive a low-mileage discount, you could lose it if your actual mileage reaches 10,000 miles.

Check out our guide titled, “[How Annual Mileage Affects Your Auto Insurance Rates](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-does-annual-mileage-affect-car-insurance/)” to see how low mileage with a usage-based program could save you big.

However, take into account a different telematics program if you’d prefer not to be under constant observation. For example, Progressive Snapshot and Liberty Mutual RightTrack only keep track of users for a short time before applying the savings you’ve accrued to subsequent policy renewals.

You should sign up for State Farm Drive Safe and Save if:

* **You Want to Save:** While State Farm Drive Safe and Save monitors your driving, it also allows you to reduce your auto insurance costs by up to 50%.
* **You Operate a Car Without a Phone:** Of course, the Drive Safe and Save app uses phone battery. So, it might be worthwhile to look into alternative programs if you frequently use your phone while driving, like delivery and rideshare drivers.
* **You Only Have One Car:** Drive Safe and Safe doesn’t need you to enroll all of the vehicles and drivers covered by your insurance, though your discount will go up if you do.
* **You Have Onstar:** You can receive a discount on your auto insurance by sharing your data through OnStar’s monitoring technology through State Farm Drive Safe and Save.

You shouldn’t consider using State Farm Drive Safe and Save if:

* **You Want a Steady Discount:** Your discount may vary from term to term since State Farm modifies it based on your performance at each policy period. Choose a program that only monitors for a short time if you want more consistency.
* **You Drive Late or in Rush-Hour Traffic:** Our Drive Safe and Save State Farm review found that rush-hour and late driving is in the company’s list of monitored behaviors, unlike most telematics solutions that punish you for just late-night driving. If you can’t avoid it, it would be worthwhile to look into alternative programs.
* **You’re Wondering How to “Cheat” Drive Safe and Save:** There is no State Farm Drive Safe and Save cheat. The program’s purpose is to allow policyholders to monitor their driving behaviors and earn a discount in return. Attempts to cheat the State Farm Drive Safe and Save program could result in your policy’s termination.

Weigh these pros and cons before you decide to try Drive Safe and Save or other types of usage-based insurance programs. In addition, some states may not offer the 50% maximum discount.

Visit www.drivesafeandsave.com for more info about the State Farm driving tracker. You should also check out State Farm safe driver reviews to see if the program is a good fit for you.

### Why Drivers Should Choose State Farm Auto Insurance
