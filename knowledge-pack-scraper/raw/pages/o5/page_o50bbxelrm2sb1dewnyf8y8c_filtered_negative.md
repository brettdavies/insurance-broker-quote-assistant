City | Average coverage rate | Average annual cost for $500,000 of coverage
---|---|---|---
Alameda | $6.47 | $3,233
Big Bear Lake | $3.41 | $1,704
Burbank | $4.21 | $2,104
Calexico | $5.82 | $2,912
Chula Vista | $3.04 | $1,518
Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Echo Park, Silver Lake and El Sereno tend to see cheaper rates for [earthquake coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/earthquake-insurance "What Earthquake Insurance Covers"). Residents in Mar Vista, Culver City and West Los Angeles typically pay higher rates for the same coverage.
The CEA offers two policies for [earthquake insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/earthquake-insurance "Earthquake Insurance, Explained"): Homeowners Choice and Standard Homeowners. The biggest difference between the two policies is that **the Homeowners Choice policy does not automatically include personal property or loss of use coverage**. Homeowners Choice policies are usually cheaper, but we generally recommend getting the Standard Homeowners policy. Unless you are confident you could replace your personal property and you have a place to stay after an earthquake, paying for loss of use and personal property coverage is worth it.
---|---|---|---|---
Your [deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-deductibles "What Is a Homeowners Insurance Deductible?") will work slightly differently depending on whether you have a Standard Homeowners policy or a Homeowners Choice policy. If you have a Standard Homeowners policy, your insurance company will only subtract the cost of one deductible — the dwelling coverage deductible — from your claim payment.
You can buy California Earthquake Authority policies through the CEA’s member insurance companies. Participating insurers include some of [California's major homeowners insurance providers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-california "The Best and Cheapest Homeowners Insurance Companies in California"), like State Farm, Allstate and USAA.
Earthquake insurance costs are based on the value of your home. You should insure your home based on its [replacement cost](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-replacement-cost-estimator "How to Estimate the Replacement Cost of Your Home"), which should be listed on your homeowners insurance policy.
The deductible on an [earthquake insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/earthquake-insurance "Earthquake Insurance, Explained") varies by company but is usually between 10% and 20%.
The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) is one of the largest providers of residential earthquake insurance in the world. The CEA is a publicly managed not-for-profit entity that partners with some of [California's top insurers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-california "The Best and Cheapest Homeowners Insurance Companies in California") to help residents manage their earthquake-related risks and losses.
Your auto insurance covers earthquake damage if you have [comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance"), which covers damage to your car that isn't a result of a collision.
There are earthquake policies available for renters. Since renters insurance [does not cover earthquake damage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/renters-insurance-earthquakes "Does Renter's Insurance Cover Earthquakes?"), it's recommended that renters buy a separate policy to protect their personal property and help reimburse costs if their home becomes uninhabitable due to earthquake damage.
Whether the damage from a tsunami is covered by your earthquake insurance depends on the direct cause of the damage. If the tsunami triggers mudslides that damage your home and belongings, your earthquake insurance may cover the damage. However, any damage done by floodwater would require a separate [flood insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/how-get-flood-insurance "How to Get Flood Insurance: Everything You Need to Know").
