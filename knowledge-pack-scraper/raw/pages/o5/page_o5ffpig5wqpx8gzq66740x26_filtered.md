## **High-Risk Auto Insurance Requirements**

[Car insurance](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive/)[is so expensive](https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive/) for high-risk drivers that it may be required for many reasons. One of the most significant purposes for high-risk insurance is to offset the risk of a driver filing an auto insurance claim.

But what are the specific reasons why you need high-risk auto insurance? Check out the table below to see the characteristics that define a high-risk driver.

**High-Risk Driver Factors**

| Driving Factors | Non-Driving Factors |
| --- | --- |
| At-fault claims | Age |
| Speeding tickets | Bad credit |
| Reckless driving | Location |
| Racing | Gaps in coverage |
| DUI | Vehicle use |
|  | Vehicle type |
|  | License points |

Compare Rates[Start Now →](#mdatop)

Age indicates the driving experience of the insured, but location considers the risk of you filing claims based on the statistics of where you live. Gaps in coverage show how long you’ve been uninsured while owning a car.

Vehicle use is another way of showing how often you drive. Generally, cars don’t get in accidents when they’re not moving. Therefore, the more you drive, the more you’re at risk of an accident.

> Although driving factors make sense, it may be confusing to understand why non-driving factors should affect your car insurance policy.

Even vehicle types can determine whether you’re at high risk. Some vehicle types have higher accident frequencies, and some vehicle types generate expensive car insurance claims.

Therefore, your auto insurance company may drive up your rates to balance the risk.

## The Need for SR-22 Auto Insurance

[What is SR-22 insurance?](https://www.AutoInsuranceEZ.com/blog/sr-22-insurance/) Whether you require an SR-22 hinges on your driving history, with insurance rates typically elevated for individuals with a poor driving record and often necessitating SR-22 certification.

Drivers who have too many accidents or severe traffic violations (DUI, reckless driving, or racing) may require an SR-22 form before their driving privileges are restored.

![SR-22 Insurance: Costly High-Risk Coverage]()![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg)

SR-22 certification is like a promise to your state that says you’ll carry the state minimum car insurance. Your state could suspend or revoke your driver’s license for failing to meet state requirements for auto insurance.

If you’re a high-risk driver in Indiana, you’re required to get SR-50 certification. Meanwhile, Florida and Virginia’s high-risk drivers who commit serious driving offenses need double the minimum requirements through FR-44 certification. (For more information, read our “[Cheap FR-44 Insurance](https://www.AutoInsuranceEZ.com/fr-44-insurance/)“).
