## Do you need boat insurance in Texas?

Boat insurance isn't required by Texas law, but some marinas may mandate [boat liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/boat-liability-coverage/). In addition, if you lease or finance your watercraft, your lender may require [comprehensive and collision coverages for your boat](https://www.progressive.com/answers/boat-collision-comprehensive-coverage/), which may pay to repair or replace your damaged or stolen watercraft.

| Coverage | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| Bodily injury and property damage liability | What it coversInjuries you're liable for and damage you cause to another boat or property while boating |
| Comprehensive | What it coversTheft, vandalism, fire, glass breakage, collisions with animals, and weather-related issues |
| Collision | What it coversCollisions with another watercraft, docks, or objects |

If you own your boat outright and you aren't required to carry liability coverage, protecting your watercraft investment — as well as your assets if you cause an accident on the water — can still be important for boaters in Texas.
