Florida drivers wishing to reinstate a suspended driver’s license or vehicle registration may need to file an SR-22 with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). An [SR-22](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-sr22/) is an insurance filing that certifies you purchased the required bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage. Typically, you’ll need it after an accident to reinstate your license per the Florida Financial Responsibility Law requirements.
In addition to SR-22s, Florida is one of two states that use FR-44 forms for alcohol-related offenses. FR-44s certify you hold coverage higher than the typical state minimum requirements. In either case, these forms indicate that you’re a high-risk driver, which will increase your auto insurance premium.
## Cheapest SR-22 Car Insurance in Florida
Travelers, GEICO, and Progressive have some of the [cheapest car insurance in Florida](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/cheap-car-insurance/) with an SR-22. See below for what your average annual [cost of Florida car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/cost/) with an SR-22 may be.
Average annual cost by carrier | Clean driving history | SR-22 | Percentage difference
---|---|---|---
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) | $2,333 | $3,555 | 52%
[GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) | $2,508 | $4,285 | 71%
[Travelers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/travelers/reviews/) | $2,142 | $3,094 | 44%
UAIC | $3,102 | $5,300 | 71%
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/reviews/) | $4,480 | $5,973 | 33%
[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/) | $3,884 | $4,302 | 12%
[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $2,716 | $4,562 | 68%
### Non-Owner SR-22 Insurance
If you receive a court order to file an SR-22 but don’t own a vehicle, you will need to purchase a [non-owner car insurance policy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-non-owner-car-insurance/) that provides enough liability coverage to meet the state’s requirements.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/sr-22/#citation-1)
Not all insurers offer an SR-22 for non-owner or even standard car insurance policies, so ask your insurer if it will file for you. If it won’t, check out the [best non-owner car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/non-owner/).
## How Does SR-22 Insurance in Florida Work?
Florida has a unique circumstance compared to other states. Here’s what you need to know about SR-22s and [FR-44s](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/fr-44-insurance/) in Florida.
### When You’ll Need One
You might need an SR-22 in Florida after certain traffic or legal violations, not including DUIs (which require FR-44s). Some common reasons include:
* Your license has been revoked or suspended and you need to reinstate it
* You’ve recently been caught driving without insurance or on a suspended license
* You’ve committed serious traffic violations, like a hit-and-run, reckless driving, and other incidents
* You’ve accumulated too many points on your license
An SR-22 is a certified document which proves that you have minimum liability insurance for your vehicle. In Florida, that’s $10,000 property damage liability per crash, and $10,000 PIP per person per crash. Generally, you will need to file your SR-22 for three years.
Unlike most states, Florida requires an FR-44 for [DUI convictions](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/dui/). An FR-44 form certifies you hold bodily injury liability coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident and property damage liability of $50,000.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/sr-22/#citation-2) These requirements apply to both in-state and out-of-state drivers. Note that this is more than the minimum coverage requirement in Florida, reflecting the severity of the conviction.
In the event of multiple offenses, your insurance company will not need to file both an SR-22 and an FR-44. Rather, an FR-44 will cover both limits. Whichever one you need, you must file it within 15 working days of issuance.
### How to Submit an SR-22 in Florida
Your insurance company will file the SR-22 or FR-44 on your behalf. Here is a step-by-step overview of the process.
1. To find affordable coverage, compare quotes from different companies.
2. When you choose your provider, be sure to confirm that they can file the SR-22 or FR-44 form for you.
3. Purchase your desired policy.
4. Contact your auto insurance company to let it know you need a certificate of financial responsibility so it can begin the process of filing on your behalf.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/sr-22/#citation-3)
### SR-22 Fees
Most auto insurance companies charge a one-time filing fee for SR-22 and FR-44 forms. In Florida, the average filing fee is $15. Florida also requires a reinstatement fee of $150, $200, or $500 if you fail to provide [proof of insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/do-you-need-proof-of-auto-insurance/).
An SR-22 or FR-44 filing increases your auto insurance premium because it indicates you might be at higher risk for an accident due to your prior driving history. Plus, an FR-44 requires additional coverage, which increases the cost of insurance.
### How Long to Maintain an FR-44?
After a court-ordered suspension, you must show proof of current PIP and [property damage liability coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/property-damage/), certified on a six-month non-cancellable SR-22, for two years from the original suspension date.
If you require an FR-44 filing after a DUI, you must maintain it for three years from the date of reinstatement of your driving privileges.
### Does an SR-22 Cover Any Car You Drive?
Whether the policy tied to your SR-22 covers any car you drive depends on the type of policy you purchase:
* **Owner policy:** Covers only the specific vehicle(s) listed on your policy, which you own.
* **Non-owner SR-22 policy:** Covers you when driving vehicles you don’t own, such as borrowed, rented, or employer’s cars—but only for liability, not damage to the car you’re driving.
* **Owner-operator policy:** Offers coverage in any car — whether you’re driving your own or someone else’s.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/sr-22/#citation-4)
Note that a non-owner policy does not cover vehicles belonging to someone in your household or immediate family — instead, you should be listed on that person’s insurance policy.
## How to Get Cheap Car Insurance With an SR-22
Here are our money-saving tips for drivers with an SR-22 or FR-44:
1. **Choose a provider that caters to high-risk drivers.** Some companies cater to high-risk drivers, which means you’ll pay less than you would with a traditional company.
2. **Get pay-per-mile insurance.** If you don’t drive often, you can save money by using pay-per-mile insurance. Instead of a flat rate, you would pay a base rate and a small per-mile fee for the miles you drive.
3. **Buy minimum coverage.** If you file an SR-22, you need to purchase only the legal minimum auto insurance required in Florida to reinstate your driving privileges. Incidents that require you to file an FR-44 form require additional coverage.
4. **Complete a Basic Driver Improvement course.** Basic Driver Improvement, or BDI, is a voluntary election to complete an approved driver safety course in lieu of points on your license.
5. **Drive safely.** Additional incidents will raise auto insurance premiums and reinstatement fees, so avoid accidents and violations by practicing [defensive driving](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/defensive-driving/). Many providers offer programs to track your braking, phone usage, and other behaviors, and reward safe driving behaviors with discounts.
## Minimum Required Coverage in Florida
[Florida is a no-fault auto insurance state](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/no-fault/), which affects the minimum required coverage. Here’s how much coverage you need at a minimum:
* **Personal injury protection (PIP):** You are required to purchase PIP in no-fault states. In Florida, the amount is $10,000 worth of PIP per person and per accident. If you get into an accident, each person will file first-party personal injury claims. PIP covers the costs of injuries, deaths, lost wages, child care, and other losses medical expenses coverage does not cover.
* **Property damage liability:** You need $10,000 worth of property damage liability coverage. As in at-fault states, the at-fault driver will pay for the other party’s property damage with their liability coverage.

## Recap
Florida requires SR-22s for non-DUI driving offenses, such as insurance lapses or accumulating excess points on your license. FR-44s are reserved for DUIs. Even if you don’t own a vehicle, Florida may require either an SR-22 or an FR-44 filing to reinstate your driving privileges. Whether you require an SR-22 or an FR-44, it is important to know that you must file it within 15 working days of issuance, and you will have to maintain it for two to three years. These types of insurance filings come with additional costs, and can increase your monthly premium. But, there are still ways to keep your overall insurance costs as low as possible, like driving safely and completing a basic driver improvement course.
