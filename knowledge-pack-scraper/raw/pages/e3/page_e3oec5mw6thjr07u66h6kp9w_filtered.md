Progressive is a car insurance company available in all 50 states with mostly competitive rates, especially if you're an older driver. It has a lot of insurance coverages, including some specialty coverages that other companies don't have. However, it doesn't have a ton of discounts compared to other insurance companies.

USAA is also available nationwide, but it only provides coverage to active military members, veterans, and their families. If that applies to you, USAA is a good car insurance company with lower-than-average prices and high claims satisfaction marks.

For most people comparing USAA and Progressive, Progressive is the best choice since it's available to anyone. However, if you qualify for USAA, I recommend getting a quote and seeing how much you can save.

## Which company is better?

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | USAA | Progressive |
| AM Best | A++ (Superior) | A+ (Superior) |
| J.D. Power claims satisfaction | 726 out of 1,000 | 672 out of 1,000 |
| BBB | A+ | A+ |
| NAIC complaints (private passenger) | 0.96 (Private Passenger) | 0.97 (Private Passenger) |

Both Progressive and USAA earned A+ ratings from the Better Business Bureau (BBB). AM Best, which measures an insurance company's financial stability and ability to pay claims, gave Progressive an A+ rating and USAA an A++. That means both are financially sound and can pay claims.

However, while Progressive earned a lower-than-average score in the J.D. Power 2024 Claims Satisfaction survey, USAA was well above average. Progressive earned 672 out of 1,000 while USAA was 54 points higher, earning 726. The survey average was 697.

Interestingly, both earned similar scores on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index based on marketwide data. The index is expressed as a score of 1.00, and found that both USAA and Progressive received fewer than expected complaints in 2024. Progressive scored 0.97 in 2024 while USAA just edged past Progressive with a score of 0.96.

## Which company is cheaper?

I compare insurance companies about twice a year and occasionally include Progressive. It generally has higher premiums than my current insurance company, so I typically don't go further than requesting a quote.

Since I'm not part of the military, I can't get a quote from USAA. However, USAA's rates are generally among the lowest available, according to data from Insurify. Although Progressive's rates may be closer to USAA's for senior drivers specifically, USAA is usually significantly cheaper across the board.

Here's a look at how USAA's average rates across driver type:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **USAA liability-only monthly premium** | **USAA full-coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $54 | $102 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $69 | $131 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $70 | $132 |
| DUI on driving record | $78 | $148 |
| Teen driver | $100 | $189 |
| Senior driver (60s) | $41 | $79 |
| Senior driver (70s) | $42 | $81 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | |  |

  

And here are Progressive's for comparison:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **Progressive liability-only monthly premium** | **Progressive full coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $104 | $182 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $125 | $204 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $136 | $223 |
| DUI on driving record | $164 | $268 |
| Teen driver | $187 | $306 |
| Senior driver (60s) | $62 | $101 |
| Senior driver (70s) | $52 | $86 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | |  |

  

### Clean driving record

If you have a clean driving record, USAA customers pay an average of $102 monthly for full coverage, compared to $182 monthly with Progressive. Liability-only coverage with USAA costs a monthly average of $54 while Progressive averages $104 monthly.

### Speeding ticket on driving record

If you're wondering [how to lower your car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/how-to-lower-car-insurance), avoiding speeding tickets and other moving violations is a good place to start. Multiple speeding tickets can lead to higher auto insurance prices. Progressive charges an average of $204 a month after a speeding ticket, compared to $131 from USAA. If you only want liability coverage, you can expect to pay an average of $125 a month with Progressive or $69 a month with USAA.

### At-fault accident on driving record

Similarly, an accident on your record will likely increase your car insurance premium, no matter which company you select. USAA's liability-only coverage after an accident averages $70 a month and $132 for full coverage. Comparatively, Progressive's liability-only coverage averages $136 a month, and its full coverage car insurance costs, on average, $223 monthly.

### DUI on driving record

Driving impaired is not only dangerous, it can be really expensive. With USAA, a DUI conviction will raise your rates to a monthly average of $148 for full coverage and $78 for liability-only.

Progressive is significantly more expensive, charging an average of $268 per month for full coverage and $164 for liability-only with a DUI on your record.

### Teen driver

Teen drivers and their parents typically pay more for their insurance than older drivers. However, if you use USAA, you'll likely pay less than Progressive. USAA teen drivers pay an average of $189 monthly for full coverage and $100 a month for liability. Comparatively, Progressive is much higher for teen insurance, averaging $306 and $187 monthly, respectively.

### Senior driver

While insurance rates are based on various factors, older drivers typically pay the least for car insurance. With USAA, people in their 60s may pay as little as $41 a month on average for liability-only coverage and $79 for full coverage. On the other hand, senior drivers who use Progressive pay on average $62 for liability-only and $101 for full coverage.

## Discounts

If you qualify for USAA coverage, I highly recommend getting a quote since it can be a great [way to save money on car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/save-money-on-car-insurance).

USAA has many standard discounts and multiple discounts specifically for the military. For instance, you can save up to 15% if you garage your car on base while deployed. You'll also be eligible for USAA perks, which offer discounts and deals on shopping, car repair, car rentals, and travel.

While Progressive has some general discounts, it doesn't have as many as some other insurance companies. For example, unlike USAA, Progressive doesn't offer a military discount or a discount for taking a defensive driving course.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Discount** | **Does USAA have it?** | **Does Progressive have it?** |
| Loyalty | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-policy/bundling | Yes | Yes |
| Multiple vehicle | Yes | Yes |
| Airbag | No | No |
| Anti-lock brakes | No | No |
| Anti-theft | Yes | No |
| Safe driver | Yes | Yes |
| Good student | Yes | Yes |
| Away-from-home student | No | Yes |
| New car | Yes | No |
| Pay in full | No | Yes |
| Automatic payments | No | Yes |
| GAP insurance | No | No |
| Senior | No | No |
| Military | Yes | No |
| Defensive driving course | Yes | No |

Does Professive offer a military discount?

While USAA only offers auto insurance to military members and their families, Progressive is available to just about anyone. But if you're looking for military-specific savings with Progressive, you're unlikely to find them. Progressive only offers a military discount of up to 25% to eligible Louisiana drivers, and it only does so because the state requires it for liability coverage.

### USAA SafePilot vs. Progressive Snapshot

Telematics programs offer drivers a potentially lower insurance premium based on their safe driving habits. However, you usually have to let your insurance company monitor your driving through a plug-in device or provide access to your phone through an app running in the background. I worry about privacy with these programs, so I don't participate.

However, if it appeals to you, both Progressive and USAA have telematics programs.

Progressive offers the Snapshot program. Users must install a plug-in device to track their driving habits. In some states, drivers can use a mobile app that runs in the background instead. People with safe driving habits might see savings on their insurance premiums. However, if you frequently drive late at night, brake or accelerate quickly, or drive more than average, your rates might increase instead.

USAA offers the SafePilot program through a phone app. Once downloaded, the app runs in the background of your phone and monitors your driving habits. After you sign up, you're eligible for a 10% discount at first and up to 30% based on your driving metrics at renewal. Tips for better driving metrics include reducing the number of times you touch your phone while driving, enrolling all drivers on your policy, limiting phone calls while driving, and slowing down earlier to reduce harsh braking.

## Coverage

When it comes to coverage types, both USAA and Progressive offer typical coverage options like liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage. However, Progressive typically offers more specialty coverages than USAA, like rideshare insurance and loan/lease payoff insurance. Progressive also provides insurance for other vehicles like ATVs, snowmobiles, boats, and classic cars.

## FAQs

### How do I contact USAA?

USAA members can contact a virtual agent for help by clicking the chat button on the [USAA website](https://www.usaa.com/?wa_ref=pub_global_home). You can also call the main number at 1-210-531-USAA (8722) or 1-800-531-USAA (8722). Customers can try the shortcut mobile number #USAA (8722), although it may not work with all carriers.

### How do I contact Progressive?

Progressive customer service is available at 1-888-671-4405 or through the [Progressive.com](http://Progressive.com) chat feature. You can also ask for help through an email form on Progressive's website or by logging into your account through the Progressive app or website.

### Does USAA partner with Progressive?

USAA partners with Progressive to offer motorcycle insurance and other specialty policies, such as travel trailer insurance. However, the two companies are independently licensed and operated. The two companies have worked closely together for over 30 years. USAA also partners with other companies to offer additional types of insurance.

If you're looking for more information about Progressive for USAA members, you'll want to work with a USAA agent to get started.

### Is USAA cheaper than Progressive?

According to Insurify data, USAA offers lower average rates than Progressive across various driver profiles, so it could often be cheaper.

Drivers with clean records pay an average of $102 per month for full coverage car insurance with USAA, compared to $182 per month with Progressive. For liability-only coverage, USAA's average monthly rate is $54, while Progressive's is $104. Especially if you have incidents in your driving history, such as speeding tickets or accidents, USAA's rates tend to be lower than Progressive's, and well below the national average.

There might not be as much of a difference in rates for some people, such as senior drivers, but USAA is usually one of the cheapest car insurance providers out there. However, you have to be affiliated with the military to qualify for USAA.

  

## Bottom line

While USAA offers the best pricing and discounts, it's only available to a relatively small population. It also doesn't have as many coverage options as some other carriers. While Progressive is more expensive than USAA, it's available to most people.

No matter the insurance companies you're comparing, getting quotes from at least two other companies is worth it. That way, you ensure you get the best deal and the right coverage. As you look for the [best car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies), read customer reviews and pay attention to policy coverages and limits when comparing quotes.
