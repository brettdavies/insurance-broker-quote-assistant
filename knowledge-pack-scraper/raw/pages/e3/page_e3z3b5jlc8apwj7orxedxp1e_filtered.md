* As of January 1, 2025, California requires minimum auto liability limits of $30,000 per person for injury or death, $60,000 per accident for all people, and $15,000 for property damage.

**Higher Policy Limits Offer Greater Financial Protection for Accident Victims**

* Updated limits aim to better cover rising medical bills, repair costs, and reduce out‑of‑pocket expenses for those injured or harmed in at‑fault crashes.

**Drivers Without Updated Coverage Risk Penalties or Liability Gaps**

* Policies that renew on or after January 1, 2025 must meet the new minimums to avoid fines, license issues, or being underinsured in liability claims.

* With at‑fault policy limits rising, UM/UIM coverage is more important than ever to protect victims when the responsible party’s insurance is inadequate.

## California Increases Minimum Insurance Policy Limits for 2025

Starting January 1, 2025, California’s minimum insurance liability limits have received a much-needed update to better align with the rising costs of medical treatment and vehicle repairs following a motor vehicle accident. These changes have increased coverage to $30,000 for injury or death of one person, $60,000 for all persons, and $15,000 for property damage.

Why does this matter? Policy limits are the maximum sums an insurance company will pay for damages. With rising medical bills and repair costs, the new limits provide better financial protection for drivers. In the past, accident victims were often left with out-of-pocket expenses because the insurance settlements would not cover all of the damages caused by the accident.

These updates also align with inflation and aim to address growing claim expenses. Keep reading for a breakdown of what this means for you and how it affects your coverage.

## **Old vs. New Policy Limits**

Drivers have seen significant changes to the state’s [California car insurance](https://www.rmdlaw.com/blog/car-insurance-guide-types-coverage-and-claim-process/) requirements, specifically regarding the minimum auto insurance liability coverage requirements. These updates are designed to provide greater financial protection in the face of rising medical costs and property repair expenses.

Before January 1, 2025, California law required all drivers to carry liability insurance with the following minimum limits:

* + - * **$15,000** for injuries or the death of one person in an accident.

* + - * **$30,000** for injuries or deaths of multiple people in a single accident (shared among those injured).

* + - * **$5,000** for property damage, such as repairs to someone else’s vehicle or other property.

These limits, however, have doubled starting in 2025 to reflect current costs better. Under the new law, drivers must carry at least:

* + - * **$30,000** for one person’s injuries or death.

* + - * **$60,000** total for multiple people injured or killed in one accident.

* + - * **$15,000** for property damage.

Liability insurance is mandatory in California, and driving without it can result in steep fines, license suspension, or even vehicle impoundment. These minimum limits ensure drivers can pay for damages caused by an accident they’re at fault for, whether it’s covering medical expenses, lost wages, or property repairs.

The increased limits offer much-needed financial protection for both drivers and accident victims, especially as medical and repair costs continue to rise. To avoid penalties and ensure compliance, make sure your policy meets or exceeds these updated requirements.

## **How Do The New Insurance Policy Limits Affect California Drivers?**

California’s updated minimum liability insurance requirements, effective January 1, 2025, significantly impact drivers across the state. These new limits address rising medical costs and property repair expenses, but they also introduce several key changes that drivers navigate daily.

First, the increased coverage provides stronger financial protection. In serious accidents, both at-fault and not-at-fault drivers benefit from reduced out-of-pocket costs. The higher limits ensure that victims have greater access to compensation for medical bills, lost wages, and property damage.

After accidents, personal injury lawyers play a vital role in helping victims manage claims and secure the compensation they deserve. The higher coverage limits improve victims’ chances of recovering their entire expenses, providing essential financial support for recovery.

However, this update results in slightly higher premiums for many drivers. While the added financial security benefits most, the increased costs pose challenges for low-income drivers, leading to a rise in uninsured motorists. This heightens risks for insured drivers, as accidents involving uninsured or underinsured motorists leave some victims struggling to cover expenses.

To mitigate these risks, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage becomes even more critical. This coverage acts as a financial safety net, helping drivers manage medical bills, property damage, and other costs if involved in accidents with drivers lacking adequate insurance.

For low-income individuals, the California Low-Cost Auto Insurance Program (CLCA) provides a viable alternative. The CLCA offers lower coverage limits—$10,000 per person, $20,000 per accident for injuries or death, and $3,000 for property damage—but remains an affordable option for basic protection. Eligibility criteria include holding a valid California driver’s license, meeting income guidelines, and owning a vehicle valued at $25,000 or less.

Drivers must review their policies to ensure compliance and avoid fines or penalties. By consulting with insurance providers, making necessary adjustments, and shopping for competitive rates, Californians can manage potential premium increases. With careful planning, drivers ensure they remain financially protected under the new regulations.

## **Why Did California Increase Its Insurance Policy Limits?**

For the first time in over 50 years, California have updated its minimum auto insurance liability limits. These changes are long overdue and reflect the significant economic shifts that have occurred since the limits were last adjusted in 1974.

The original limits were established to ensure drivers could provide financial protection for those injured or who suffered property damage due to an accident. However, the decades-old limits are no longer adequate. The rates of medical care and vehicle repairs have risen dramatically, leaving accident victims under-compensated for their losses.

Medical expenses associated with [car accidents](https://www.rmdlaw.com/orange-county/car-accident-lawyers-in-orange-county/) have surged in recent years, fueled by advancements in treatment technology and higher healthcare costs. Similarly, vehicle repairs have become more expensive due to the increasing complexity of modern cars and rising labor costs. These factors have clarified that the previous limits no longer offer sufficient financial protection.

The updated limits aim to address these issues. They are designed to provide better compensation for accident victims, ensuring they can recover from injuries and financial losses.

At the same time, the changes protect at-fault drivers by reducing the risk of personal financial liability for damages exceeding their policy limits. This update represents a significant step toward fairer outcomes for everyone on the road.

## **What Are the Planned Future Increases for 2035?**

The [California Senate Bill 1107 (SB 1107)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1107) includes a provision that increases the minimum required liability insurance coverage for drivers starting January 1, 2035. This change means that drivers in California must carry higher amounts of liability insurance to cover damages in the event of an accident.

The updated minimum liability coverage requirements will be as follows:

1. 1. 1. 1. **Bodily Injury or Death for One Person**: The minimum coverage will increase by $20,000, bringing the total to **$50,000**.
      1. 1. **Bodily Injury or Death for All Persons in an Accident**: The minimum coverage will increase by $40,000, bringing the total to **$100,000**.
      1. 1. **Property Damage**: The minimum coverage will increase by $10,000, bringing the total to **$25,000**.

This adjustment reflects an effort to ensure that insurance policies provide adequate financial protection for those injured in car accidents and for property damage. It aligns the minimum coverage limits with the rising costs of medical care and vehicle repairs, reducing the financial burden on victims of car accidents.

## **Understanding Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) Coverage**

SB 1107 does not mandate automatic updates to uninsured or underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage, which remains optional in California. Key points to note:

* + - * **Optional Coverage:** Drivers can decline UM/UIM coverage in writing.

* + - * **Impact on Coverage Limits:** Your UM/UIM policy limits will not automatically increase to match the new liability requirements. If you wish to align your UM/UIM limits with the updated liability minimums, you must contact your insurer to request an adjustment or purchase new coverage.

Having [uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.rmdlaw.com/blog/un-underinsured-motorist-coverage-in-california/) provides significant protection in cases where the at-fault driver lacks sufficient insurance to cover your damages. This type of coverage can pay for your medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages when the at-fault party’s insurance falls short or is nonexistent. An experienced [car accident attorney in California](https://www.rmdlaw.com/car-accident-lawyers-in-california/) can maximize the benefits of UM/UIM coverage by combining it with the at-fault party’s liability coverage, ensuring that all possible avenues of compensation are explored. This strategic approach can help you recover the full amount of your losses and provide financial relief during a challenging time.

## **Medical Payments (MedPay) Coverage**

SB 1107 does not alter MedPay, an optional form of insurance. However, with higher liability limits, it’s a good idea to review your MedPay coverage to ensure it meets your overall insurance needs.

In summary, SB 1107 mandates higher liability coverage but leaves updates to UM/UIM and MedPay coverage up to the driver. It’s a good opportunity to evaluate your policy and ensure you’re adequately protected.

## **What to Expect from the Policy Limit Changes**

Here’s what you need to know about these changes and how these impact their auto insurance policies.

### **Timeline of implementation**

The new limits officially took effect on **January 1, 2025**. If your policy renews on or after this date, it must automatically comply with the latest coverage requirements. For example, if your insurance renews in February 2025, your policy will reflect the updated minimum liability limits.

However, if your policy renewed before January 1, 2025, you can continue with the existing coverage limits until your next renewal. This means you don’t have to worry about updating your policy immediately but should ensure your renewal schedule aligns with the changes. It’s important to contact your insurance provider to confirm the exact dates and ensure compliance when your policy is renewed.

## **How Are Insurance Companies Communicating These Changes?**

If your insurance policy is up for renewal soon, it’s essential to understand how recent changes to California’s minimum liability limits impact your coverage.

### **Notices from your insurance provider**

In the months leading up to renewal, insurance companies will send out notices—either letters or emails—explaining the changes to California’s auto insurance laws. These notices will detail how the new minimum liability limits will affect your coverage.

For example, you may receive a letter outlining the exact amounts of bodily injury and property damage coverage now required and explaining why these changes are being implemented. It’s important to read these notices carefully, as they will clearly show how your current policy compares to the new requirements and what adjustments, if any, need to be made.

### **Updated policy documents**

Along with notices, your insurance provider will update your policy documents to reflect the new minimum coverage requirements. When these updates happen, you should receive a revised version of your policy showing the new limits for personal injury and property damage insurance.

These documents are crucial as they officially outline your coverage after January 2025. To ensure everything is in order, review your updated policy carefully. If there are any discrepancies or questions, contacting your insurer before the changes can prevent confusion or issues.

### **Premium adjustments**

As the minimum liability limits increase, you may notice an adjustment in your premium rates. Insurance providers often recalibrate premiums based on the level of coverage you choose, and the new required limits may raise your costs.

It’s important to prepare for this possibility, as the adjustments could vary depending on factors like your driving history, location, and vehicle type. Most insurance companies will notify you of these changes in advance, allowing you to understand what to expect before your policy renews.

If your premium increases more than expected, you may want to discuss this with your provider or compare rates from other companies to find more affordable options.

### **Important reminders**

With the January 2025 deadline now in effect, keeping an eye on communications from your insurance provider is essential. Insurance companies are expected to send notifications about the new coverage requirements, giving you time to review and make any necessary changes.

If you don’t hear from your insurer, be proactive and reach out to confirm whether your policy complies with the new regulations. This will ensure that you are not caught off guard and that your coverage meets the updated minimum requirements with your policy renewal.

Additionally, if you encounter issues with your policy after an accident, such as disputes over coverage or compensation, [consulting a lawyer](https://www.rmdlaw.com/personal-injury-blog/how-to-choose-and-hire-a-personal-injury-lawyer-for-your-case/) can help you address the legal challenges and work toward a resolution.

## **Tips for Reviewing and Adjusting Your Policy Proactively**

With your policy renewal approaching, now is the perfect time to review and adjust your coverage to align with California’s new insurance regulations. Proactively evaluating your options can help you avoid unexpected costs and ensure your financial protection on the road.

### **Review your current policy**

Take some time to review your current policy. Check if your existing liability coverage already meets or exceeds the new requirements.

For instance, if your current policy only provides $15,000 for bodily injury per person, you must update it to at least $30,000 to comply with the new minimums. Similarly, if your property damage coverage is still at $5,000, you must pay $15,000. It’s crucial to ensure your policy aligns with the updated regulations so that you’re not caught unprepared when your policy renews.

Having the right coverage can also provide the necessary protection if you ever need to [negotiate a settlement](https://www.rmdlaw.com/personal-injury-blog/how-to-negotiate-with-an-insurance-company/) after an accident, ensuring that you’re adequately covered for any potential claims or damages.

### **Contact your insurer**

Contact your insurer to discuss how the changes impact your coverage and premiums. Many insurers send notices or updates about the new requirements, but it’s always a good idea to take the initiative.

Make specific inquiries about the impact of the new minimum liability limits on your premium and whether any other adjustments need to be made. For example, if you’re unsure how the changes affect your premium, your insurer can provide a clear breakdown. By being proactive, you can prevent surprises and modify your budget accordingly.

### **Consider higher coverage**

While the new minimum liability limits offer more protection, you might want to consider increasing your coverage beyond the required limits. For example, if the updated limits raise bodily injury coverage to $30,000 per person, you should increase it to $50,000 for added peace of mind.

Accidents can lead to higher-than-expected medical costs; higher coverage could help cover those expenses more effectively. Think of this as an investment in your financial security. Raising your limits reduces the risk of paying out of pocket in case of a serious accident.

### **Shop around**

If your insurance premiums increase significantly due to the updated limits, consider shopping for the best deal. Premiums can vary between providers, and some companies may offer discounts or better rates based on your driving history, location, or other factors.

By comparing quotes from multiple insurance companies, you may find more affordable options that still provide the coverage you need. When deciding, factor in the quality of customer service and the insurance company’s reputation, not just the price.

### **Bundle policies**

Another great way to manage potential premium increases is by merging your auto insurance with different insurance, like home or renters insurance. Many insurers offer discounts for customers who merge various policies, which can help reduce overall costs.

For instance, if you already have a home insurance policy, adding your auto coverage to the same provider may lead to a significant discount. Bundling can also simplify your insurance handling by having all your policies with one company, making it easier to keep track of renewals and changes.

## **Get Prepared for 2025: Your Insurance Coverage Checklist**

California’s updated auto insurance liability limits now provide better financial protection for drivers. With higher coverage requirements for bodily injury, death, and property damage, these changes benefit both accident victims and at-fault drivers.

Ensure your policy meets the updated requirements, review how the changes affect your premiums, and contact your insurer for any necessary updates. If you or someone you know has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, [RMD Law](https://www.rmdlaw.com/) offers expert legal guidance.
