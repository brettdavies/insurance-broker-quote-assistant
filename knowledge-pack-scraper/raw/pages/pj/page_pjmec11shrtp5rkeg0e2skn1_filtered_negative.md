“Blue states” are states that have a more liberal population and culture, as opposed to the [conservative](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-conservative-states) “red states.” While there are many more red states than blue states, the blue states tend to have much higher populations, so they have higher numbers in indexes like the electoral college and the number of congressional representatives.
There are also neutral states, usually referred to as “swing states” because these states could go either [Democratic](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-democratic-states) or [Republican](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-republican-states) in an election. Candidates typically do most of their campaigning in the swing states, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, and Florida.
Just like some states can be more liberal than others, [some cities are more liberal than others](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-city-rankings/most-liberal-cities). These cities tend to have high minority populations and public expressions of LGBTQ+ acceptance. The most liberal city is San Francisco, California, followed by Washington, DC; Seattle, Washington; Oakland, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Detroit, Michigan; New York City, New York; Buffalo, New York; and Baltimore, Maryland. Notice that all of these cities are in blue states.
