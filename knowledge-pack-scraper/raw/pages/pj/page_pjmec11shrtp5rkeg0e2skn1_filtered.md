* Insider Monkey’s Liberal-to-Conservative Ratio is derived from the percentages of residents identifying as liberal compared those identifying as conservative. For example, in Massachusetts, ranked as the most liberal state, 35% of the population identified as liberal and 21% as conservative, for a Liberal-to-Conservative Ratio of 1.67 to 1, which indicates that the state is home to 1.67 liberals for every 1 conservative. The top 20 most liberal states are displayed.
* On the Center for Legislative Accountability (CLA) scale, a lower rank indicates a higher level of liberalism. The CLA is a division of the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC). CLA rankings conceived as a “most conservative” ranking have been reversed to reflect the most liberal states.
* The Cook PVI is calculated by comparing the average of the Democratic or Republican Party’s share of the two-party presidential vote in a given state or district to the nation’s average share of the same. For example, if the US as a whole had a 48% Republican vote and a state had a 60% Republican vote, the state would have a PVI score of R+12.
* The Cook PVI formula uses a 75/25 weighting in favor of the more recent presidential election. For example, in the 2022 dataset, the 2020 presidential election results account for 75% of the PVI score, while the 2016 results account for 25%.
* Gallup 2018 data have been rounded by the original source to the nearest full percentage point.

“Blue states” are states that have a more liberal population and culture, as opposed to the [conservative](/state-rankings/most-conservative-states) “red states.” While there are many more red states than blue states, the blue states tend to have much higher populations, so they have higher numbers in indexes like the electoral college and the number of congressional representatives.

There are also neutral states, usually referred to as “swing states” because these states could go either [Democratic](/state-rankings/most-democratic-states) or [Republican](/state-rankings/most-republican-states) in an election. Candidates typically do most of their campaigning in the swing states, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, and Florida.

> The most liberal state in the country is Massachusetts, where the equally progressive city of Boston is located. Next is Hawaii, followed by Rhode Island, California, New York, Vermont, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Oregon. This index of how liberal a state is is based on how many liberals there are compared to conservatives.

Just like some states can be more liberal than others, [some cities are more liberal than others](/us-city-rankings/most-liberal-cities). These cities tend to have high minority populations and public expressions of LGBTQ+ acceptance. The most liberal city is San Francisco, California, followed by Washington, DC; Seattle, Washington; Oakland, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Detroit, Michigan; New York City, New York; Buffalo, New York; and Baltimore, Maryland. Notice that all of these cities are in blue states.

States can change from liberal to conservative over time due to factors like immigration, empowerment of minority groups (which tend to support liberal policies over conservative ones), and taxation. New York, for example, used to be highly conservative but is now much more progressive.

## Top 10 Most Liberal States

Below are the ten most liberal states in the United States. The data is based on “most conservative” rankings by the Center for Legislative Accountability.

### 1. Massachusetts

Massachusetts is the most liberal state in the U.S., with 35% of voters identifying as liberal. With 21% of voters identifying as conservative, Massachusetts has a liberal advantage of 14 points. Moderates are the largest group in Massachusetts, with 38% of the voting population identifying as moderate. In the 2016 presidential election, 60% of voters voted Democratic.

Massachusetts is also the home state of well-known politicians such as Elizabeth Warren, Michael Dukakis, Jill Stein, and the Kennedys. That state also has many urban areas and a highly educated population – two factors that strongly contribute to a liberal environment.

### 2. Hawaii

Hawaii is the second-most liberal state in the United States. 28% of voters in Hawaii identify as liberal, and 22% identify as conservative, giving Hawaii a liberal advantage of 6 points, the second-highest in the country.

In 2016, 62.2% of Hawaii voters voted Democratic in the presidential election.

### 3. Rhode Island

The smallest state in the country is also the third-most liberal. Rhode Island has 25% of residents who identify as liberal, compared to 29% who identify as conservative, and 40% who identify as moderate. Rhode Island has only voted for a Republican presidential candidate twice since 1960.

### 4. California

California is the fourth-most liberal state in the United States. 29% of voters identify as liberal, and 29% identify as conservative, giving California a liberal advantage of zero points. 36% of voters in California identify as moderate. As the state with the most electoral votes, California’s vote is a big deal in elections. In the 2016 presidential election, 61.5% of voters voted Democratic, a 30% lead over the Republican vote.

### 5. New York

New York is the fifth-most liberal state in the U.S. 30% of voters identify as liberal in New York versus 27% who identify as conservative, giving New York a 3-point liberal advantage. New York is geographically split, a majority of upstate areas vote conservative, and the larger metro areas vote liberal. In the 2016 presidential election, 59% of voters voted Democratic.

### 6. Vermont

Vermont is the sixth-most liberal state in the country, with 32% of voters identifying as liberal.

In 2012, Barack Obama won Vermont by 35.6 percentage points.

### 7. Maryland

Maryland has 28% of voters identifying as liberal. Maryland voters are 29% conservative, giving the state a -1 point liberal advantage. The largest group of voters is moderate, at 39%. Most of Maryland’s liberal base is in the Washington D.C. metro area and Baltimore. In the 2016 presidential election, 60.3% of voters voted Democratic.

Maryland legalized gay marriage, pushed for major gun restrictions, and imposed tax increases, among other progressive policies.

### 8. New Jersey

Although New Jersey is another state with a negative liberal advantage (-2 points), many of the state’s moderate voters tend to vote for more progressive social policies. As a result, New Jersey has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.

### 9. Connecticut

Similar to New Jersey, although there are 27% of residents who identify as liberal and 30% who identify as conservative, many of the 38% of self-identified moderates lean more liberal than conservative. The state attracts many of the same highly-educated citizens as neighboring Massachusetts.

### 10. Oregon

Oregon is the tenth-most liberal state in the country, with 28% of voters identifying as liberal.
