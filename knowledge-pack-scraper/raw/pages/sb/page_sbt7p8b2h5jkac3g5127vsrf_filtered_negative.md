Full-coverage premiums rose by 24% in 2023 and have increased by 15% so far in 2024, according to [**Insurify’s latest report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/). Insurify’s data science team predicts a 22% total increase by the end of the year.
Insurify turned to its database of more than 90 million [**car insurance quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) to find out where coverage is the most and least expensive and which drivers face the largest auto insurance rate increases by state.

An area’s vehicle crime and accident rates, population density, severe weather risk, and incidence of insurance fraud can drive up insurance costs. For example, Connecticut’s higher median income could contribute to its higher car insurance rates since residents may have more expensive cars to insure. Severe accidents can result in costly claims that increase insurance costs, and Nevada and Kentucky have high traffic fatality rates.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-1) [[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-2)

North Carolina and Iowa — the two states with the [**least expensive car insurance rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) — have more rural populations as well as state regulations limiting auto coverage costs. North Carolina’s insurance commissioner can approve or deny rate increase requests from insurance companies, which helps keep rates lower. Iowa has lower liability requirements than many states, so without high accident or crime rates, insurers may charge Iowans less since they’re taking on less risk.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-1) [[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-2)

This coverage protects you or family members on your policy if you cause injuries to someone else. If someone sues you, your [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) insurance may cover the cost of your court defense or a settlement. It also goes toward the injured person’s medical costs. You can buy more coverage than your state minimum to have greater financial protection.
Not every state requires this coverage, but it’s an important protection. [**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) reimburses you if an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or damages your vehicle. If the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough liability coverage to pay for the damage, this coverage will kick in to make up the difference. This also applies in a hit-and-run accident.
[**Personal injury protection (PIP)**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) pays for your and your passengers’ medical and non-medical expenses after an accident. It can cover medical bills, lost wages, replacing services the injured people usually perform, and funeral costs.
All states with car insurance requirements mandate bodily injury and property damage coverage. States with no-fault insurance laws typically require PIP coverage, although it’s also an optional coverage in some at-fault states. Currently, 21 states — both at-fault and no-fault states — require drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage, and it’s an optional coverage in some other states.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-3)
Every state except New Hampshire requires a certain amount of liability insurance to register and drive a motor vehicle. But New Hampshire drivers must prove financial responsibility by either depositing money with the state treasurer or buying a specific amount of liability coverage.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-4)

If your current insurer provides coverage in your new state, you can stay with the same company. You’ll also have to determine whether your current coverage is sufficient since every state has its own [**minimum insurance requirements**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/). In some cases, that might require increasing your bodily injury and property damage liability coverages.
Finally, you’ll have to learn if your new state has any additional requirements your former state didn’t have. Several states require uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. And a handful of states have [**no-fault insurance laws**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/no-fault-insurance/), which require drivers to carry personal injury protection (PIP).
Having [**full coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) or liability only, increasing your liability limits, and qualifying for auto insurance discounts will all change your premium.
Having a [**speeding ticket**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/), at-fault accident, or DUI on your record will increase your rates, so maintaining a clean driving record could save you money.
Generally, men pay more than women for car insurance. Data shows that men are more likely to engage in reckless driving behaviors like speeding.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-5) Some states restrict insurers from considering gender when setting rates.
