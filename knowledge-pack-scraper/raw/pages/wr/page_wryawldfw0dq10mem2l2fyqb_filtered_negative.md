*![](https://illinois.propertychecker.com/img/icns/outline/32/home_insurance.svg) **Dwelling:** Dwelling coverage pays to replace or repair your home if it is damaged or destroyed by a covered peril such as fire or hurricane.
*![](https://illinois.propertychecker.com/img/icns/outline/32/garage.svg) **Other Structures:** Other structures' coverage pays to replace detached items like a garage, shed, fence, or pool.
*![](https://illinois.propertychecker.com/img/icns/outline/32/hand_dollar.svg) **Personal Property:** Personal property refers to your personal belongings; if they are destroyed or stolen, this coverage will pay to replace them.
* **Liability:** If someone gets hurt while on your property (falls down some unsafe stairs) and sues you, this coverage will pay your legal bills.
* **Medical Payments:** When someone is injured on your property due to your negligence (e.g., icy steps), this coverage will pay for their medical bills.
* **Additional Living Expenses (ALE):** If you must leave home for a while until it is repaired or rebuilt, ALE coverage pays for your expenses to live at a hotel, eat food out, and do your laundry at a laundromat, among other things.
* **Size & Condition:** The size and condition of your home also matter. The larger the house, the more it will cost to rebuild, so your rates will be higher. If your home is in poor condition, it will be more expensive to insure.
* **Level of Coverage:** If you own your house without a mortgage, you can decide how much coverage you want. If you have a mortgage, your lender will dictate how much you need, possibly increasing your premiums by a good amount.
* **Deductible:** The higher your deductible, the lower your rates. Choose a deductible you can afford that lowers your rates but provides you with adequate coverage.
* **Claims History:** If you have a lot of small claims, your insurance rates will be higher than someone without any. The more the insurer must pay out, the more they will charge you.
* **Credit Score:** People with good credit are perceived as responsible and low risk. If you have a good credit score, you will pay less than someone with poor credit.

###  Home Renovations that Increase Your Rates
###  Home Renovations that Decrease Your Rates
* **Location:** Your rates will be lower if you live in a safe area with low crime. Your rates will be higher if you live in an area with frequent disasters.
* **Coverage Limits:** The more coverage you choose, the higher your rates will be. Balance how much coverage you need with how much you can afford.
* **Number of Units:** The number of units in your building also matters. The more units, the lower your rate.
