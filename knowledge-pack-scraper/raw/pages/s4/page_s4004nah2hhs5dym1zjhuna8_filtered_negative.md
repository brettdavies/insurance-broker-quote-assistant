The National Archives and Records Administration is closed to normal operations due to a lack of appropriations. FederalRegister.gov will automatically provide the daily Federal Register and Public Inspection List but we will not provide technical support. The official, published Federal Register is available at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/fr.
This site displays a prototype of a “Web 2.0” version of the daily Federal Register. It is not an official legal edition of the Federal Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.
The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status. For complete information about, and access to, our official publications and services, go to [ About the Federal Register ](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/the-federal-register/about.html "About the Federal Register") on NARA's archives.gov.
The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for legal research should verify their results against an official edition of the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.

Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection: Luke H. Brown, Associate Director, 202-898-3842, _LuBrown@FDIC.gov_; Meron Wondwosen, Chief, Supervisory Policy, 202-898-7211, _MeWondwosen@FDIC.gov;_ Edward J. Hof, Senior Policy Analyst, 202-898-7213, _EdwHof@FDIC.gov_. Legal  (_KMarks@fdic.gov_; Chantal Hernandez, Counsel, 202-898-7388, _ChHernandez@FDIC.gov_.
On December 20, 2023, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a final rule revising the sign and advertisement of membership regulations implementing section 18(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.[[1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03790/fdic-official-signs-and-advertising-requirements-false-advertising-misrepresentation-of-insured#footnote-1-p11660)]  On January 18, 2024, the final rule was published in the **Federal Register**.[[2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03790/fdic-official-signs-and-advertising-requirements-false-advertising-misrepresentation-of-insured#footnote-2-p11660)]
The final rule became effective on April 1, 2024, and required full compliance by January 1, 2025. Based upon feedback from IDIs and other industry participants, the FDIC delayed the compliance date for the amendments in subpart A of [12 CFR part 328](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/part-328) to May 1, 2025.[[3](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03790/fdic-official-signs-and-advertising-requirements-false-advertising-misrepresentation-of-insured#footnote-3-p11660)]  The delay was intended to provide additional time for IDIs to put in place processes and systems and make technological updates.
Compliance with all other provisions in subpart A remains unchanged and generally is required by May 1, 2025.[[4](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/11/2025-03790/fdic-official-signs-and-advertising-requirements-false-advertising-misrepresentation-of-insured#footnote-4-p11660)]
