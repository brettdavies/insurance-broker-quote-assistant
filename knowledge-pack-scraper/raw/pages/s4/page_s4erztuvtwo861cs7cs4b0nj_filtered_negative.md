Research [home insurance costs in Illinois](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-cost-home-insurance-illinois/) for your profile and available discounts to understand what qualifies as affordable. When ready to buy, ask agents directly about all discounts you may qualify for, as insurers won't apply them automatically.
If you have a high-risk profile and face coverage denials or unaffordable rates, Illinois offers a [state program through the FAIR Plan](https://www.illinoisfairplan.com/). This program provides coverage for those denied by traditional insurers, often at a lower cost than insurers willing to approve you.
Nationwide offers the lowest rates for newer homes in Illinois at $60 per month or $716 per year. However, homeowners with older properties or higher fire protection needs may find better rates with State Farm or Nationwide.
