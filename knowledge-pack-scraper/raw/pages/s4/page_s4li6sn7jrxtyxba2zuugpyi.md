## **Geico Policy Coverage**
For most insurance companies that partner with Geico, the types of coverage outlined below are included in a standard policy. However, reading over a home insurance policy’s terms and conditions before signing is crucial since coverage can vary.
## **Dwelling:**
This coverage protects the physical structure of your home from damage and destruction caused by covered perils, such as fire, hail, or windstorms. It also includes any attached structures like a garage or porch.
## **Personal Property:**
Personal property coverage safeguards any belongings inside your home, including furniture, appliances, and electronics. It usually covers damages caused by theft, vandalism, or covered perils.
## **Liability:**
Liability coverage protects you in case someone gets injured while on your property and files a claim against you. It also covers any damages caused by negligence, such as if your dog bites a visitor or a tree from your yard falls onto your neighbor’s property.
## **Medical Payments:**

[ ➤ Check Your Home’s Eligibility ](https://t.vivint.com/?c=3513&lp=10)
Or speak with a specialist: [888-669-9621](tel:8886699621)
This coverage helps pay for the medical expenses of individuals who get injured on your property, regardless of who is at fault. It can cover ambulance fees, hospital bills, and other medical expenses.
## **Other Structures:**
This coverage protects any structures on your property that are not attached to your home, such as a shed or fence. It usually has a limit of up to 10% of the dwelling coverage.
## **Additional Coverage Options**
In addition to standard policy coverage, Geico offers several endorsements and add-ons for homeowners seeking extra protection. These include:
## **Personal Property Replacement Cost:**
This endorsement ensures that your personal belongings are covered at their current value rather than depreciated. This can be especially beneficial for expensive items like electronics or jewelry.
## **Water Backup:**
Water backup coverage protects against damages caused by water backing up into your home from sewer or drain systems. It can cover repairs and replacements of damaged property due to this type of incident.
## **Earthquake Coverage:**
While not typically included in standard policies, Geico offers earthquake coverage for those living in earthquake-prone areas. This endorsement can cover repairs and replacements due to damages caused by earthquakes.
## **HOA Loss Assessment**
For homeowners belonging to a homeowners association (HOA), there may be shared responsibility for damages or losses in common areas. The HOA loss assessment endorsement helps protect homeowners from paying these shared costs out of pocket.
## **Replacement Cost Coverage**
Homeowners insurance provides two types of coverage: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Replacement Cost Value (RCV). ACV covers the cost of a product after depreciation, resulting in a smaller payout for claims. On the other hand, RCV covers the entire original value of the item, leading to a higher payout when filing a claim.
## **Geico Home Insurance Cost**
According to data from 2018 used in a [2021 study by the Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance), the national average annual premium for homeowners insurance is $2,511.25. Several factors will determine the specific cost for individual policyholders.
  * **Location:** Where you live plays a significant role in determining the cost of your premium. Areas prone to natural disasters or high crime rates may increase premiums.
  * **Condition:** The age and condition of your home can also impact the cost of your insurance. Older homes may require more maintenance, leading to a higher risk for insurers.
  * **Age of the Home:** Older homes may have expensive or difficult materials to replace, and they generally require more maintenance. This can lead to higher insurance costs due to the increased risk of needed repairs.
  * **Policy Customization:** The amount of coverage and the deductible level you choose will impact your premium. Opting for a higher deductible and lower coverage limits can reduce your premium, though it means higher out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim.
  * **Personal Information:** Factors like your credit score and claims history are considered. A lower credit score or a history of many claims can increase your premium, although improving your credit score can reduce costs over time.
  * **Discounts:** Geico offers discounts for bundling different insurance products, such as auto and home insurance. Discounts may also be available if your home has security systems, fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and other safety features.


## **Geico Discounts**
Geico offers several discounts, although they may be somewhat limited compared to other home insurance providers. The discounts available from Geico include:
  * **Multi-Policy Discount:** Bundling Geico auto and homeowners insurance can lead to savings. This discount can be combined with other discounts, such as good driver and defensive driving discounts for auto policies. Additionally, bundling discounts are available for car and renters insurance.
  * **Home Security Systems:** Homes equipped with alarm systems are eligible for reduced rates.
  * **Fire Safety Features:** Features like smoke detectors and fire extinguishers can qualify homeowners for discounts, promoting a safer home environment.
  * **Military and Federal Employee Discounts:** Active and retired military members and federal employees can save through Geico’s special discounts for these groups.


While Geico offers these standard discounts, the provider matched with you may have additional savings opportunities.
