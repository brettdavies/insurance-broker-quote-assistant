## How To Find the Cheapest Illinois Home Insurance for You

Finding affordable home insurance in Illinois can be challenging, but you can significantly lower your costs with some effort. Below are our core recommendations to help you maximize savings on your policy.

1. 1

   Determine your coverage needs

   Having your coverage limits in mind before buying can keep you from being oversold on coverage. Make sure you determine your [home insurance coverage needs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/how-much-home-insurance-do-you-need/) beforehand and understand the [types of home insurance coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) to get what you need.
2. 2

   Research home insurance cost information

   Research [home insurance costs in Illinois](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-cost-home-insurance-illinois/) for your profile and available discounts to understand what qualifies as affordable. When ready to buy, ask agents directly about all discounts you may qualify for, as insurers won't apply them automatically.
3. 3

   Bundle your policies

   Lower your premiums with [bundled home and auto insurance packages in Illinois](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/best-home-auto-bundle-in-illinois/).
4. 4

   Once you know your coverage levels and type, compare quotes from different companies for that coverage to get the best deal. We recommend gathering as many quotes as possible using different methods to get your best rate.
5. 5

   Use state-provided programs

   If you have a high-risk profile and face coverage denials or unaffordable rates, Illinois offers a [state program through the FAIR Plan](https://www.illinoisfairplan.com/). This program provides coverage for those denied by traditional insurers, often at a lower cost than insurers willing to approve you.
