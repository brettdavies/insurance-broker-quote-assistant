# Insurance company won't believe me when I say my home construction is masonry

[Home Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)

I'm shopping for home insurance - current insurer Nationwide has increased my annual premium from $2200 to $3100 in one year.

Home is in Tempe AZ, built 1973. Brick (or block) masonry walls, truss and shingle roof.

Through [policygenius.com](http://policygenius.com) I found Hubinternational insurance agent.

They got me a quote from Hartford which is $1975. (deductibles are higher but Nationwide still can't match it). So I want to switch.

Contract came through on Docusign; says home is "*stucco on frame construction*". I told the agent, no, it's masonry, I can't sign this.

Agent came back and said underwriter believes the home is stucco on frame and we're not going to change it. WTF? For the record, I can tell the difference between stucco on frame and masonry.

If home construction is listed wrong, can that cause claims problems down the road? I'm signing a statement I know to be incorrect - could there be repercussions?

Or do I dig in and say change it to masonry, or I can't sign.

cheers

Update - agent couldn't help and advised me to speak to the underwriter at Hartford. But when I called I can't get through - the number I was given obviously flags Hartford that I'm an "agent" customer, and tells me I need to speak to the agent. So I'm done with that agent.

I decided to get a quote directly from Hartford and whaddyaknow they list the property as block construction. premium is $200 more than the other Hartford quote, but still $900 less than Nationwide.

It shouldn't be this hard, but thanks for the responses.
