While rates vary widely by state, the average combined premiums for “C&C'' coverage are about $425 a year, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/what-is-covered-by-collision-and-comprehensive-auto-insurance). [_Consumer Reports_](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2013/05/4-big-insurance-mistakes-to-avoid/index.htm#:~:text=Collision%20covers%20damage%20to%20your,covered%20by%20another%20driver's%20policy.&text=We%20usually%20recommend%20that%20you,of%20your%20car's%20cash%20value.) is among the expert sources that recommend dropping “collision and/or comprehensive [coverage] when the annual premium equals or exceeds 10% of your car’s cash value.” Using that measure, and assuming you pay average premiums, you might consider dropping C&C coverage if the car your kid will be taking to college is worth less than about $4,500.
