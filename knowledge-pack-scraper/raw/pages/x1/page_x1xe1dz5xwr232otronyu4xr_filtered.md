* Nationally, [drivers aged 55 and up experience the cheapest rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-50-year-olds/).
* A 16-year-old driver with a policy of their own would pay, on average, [$6,600 per year for car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-16-year-olds/) — more than three times the average for drivers ages 23 to 85.

## Auto insurance and technology statistics

Many new car models are outfitted with advanced technology that enhances safety and prevents theft. However, this technology also increases the cost of vehicle repairs or replacement, so it won’t save you much on car insurance.

* Implementing electronic stability control (ESC) in your vehicle will lower auto insurance premiums by $8 a year on average.
* All other safety devices (including a blind-spot warning device, lane departure warning, and night vision) offer essentially no additional savings in auto insurance premiums.
* There is no anti-theft device out there that saves more than 1% on average auto insurance costs.

## Car insurance violations trends

Your driving record is one of the most significant factors in determining your car insurance rates.

* A citation for leaving the scene of an accident, i.e., a hit and run, will affect your auto insurance premiums more than any other violation. This is true for every year from 2011-2019.
* Getting caught texting or otherwise using your phone while driving will raise your insurance rate by an average of 23% ($356) — and in some states by more than 63%.
* Based on the average American driving about 12,000 miles per year, drivers can save about 6% if they reduce their mileage from 15,000 per year to less than 7,500 miles per year.

### Average increased cost of auto insurance by accident/violation

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Year** | **2015** | **2016** | **2017** | **2018** | **2019** |
| Cell Phone Violation | $84 | $184 | $238 | $321 | $355 |
| Texting while Driving | $84 | $185 | $240 | $323 | $357 |

## Auto insurance policy trends and analysis in the insurance market

Car insurance coverage can be divided into two primary categories: liability and bodily injury (together forming [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/best-full-coverage-auto-insurance/)). Liability coverage protects other drivers and their property from the physical damage you cause. Physical coverage, i.e., collision and comprehensive, protect the integrity of your vehicle from property damage.

* Motorists with usage-based insurance (UBI) policies save about 3% on their car insurance premiums.
* Raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000 saves an average of 13% on your total insurance rate for the year with your insurance provider.
* A driver who maintained 100/300 liability coverage for five years would save 15%.
* If you have insurance for five years or more, you can save 9% on your premiums. The history of car insurance is more important than staying with a specific car insurance company.
* Maintaining a state minimum liability cost offers the least amount of protection for the lowest price.
* Adding [rideshare coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/profession/rideshare-insurance/) if you use your own vehicle to drive for Lyft or Uber can raise your rates by 15%.
* In order to save about $186 or 12% in savings on your rates, be sure to use these discounts:
  + Pay online
  + Payment in full
  + Advanced payment

## Telematics' impact on car insurance rates

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Telematics status** | **Average Annual Premium** |
| Telematics - No | $1,548 |
| Telematics - Yes | $1,502 |

## Car insurance discounts via bundling

Taking out two separate policies from the same insurance company is known as bundling.

* When you [bundle](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/) coverage for your apartment, house, or condo with coverage for your car, you can save 5-10% on car insurance.
* Nationally, renters pay slightly more for car insurance than home or condo owners (regardless of whether or not they choose to bundle policies). In some states, renters pay as much as 7.3% more than homeowners for car insurance.

### Methodology

*The auto insurance rates displayed in our articles are based on the 2019 results of The Zebra’s comprehensive car insurance pricing analysis. In our analysis of all US ZIP codes — including Washington D.C. — our user profile consisted of a 30-year-old single male driving a 2013 Honda Accord. To generate pricing specific to particular rating factors, we altered the driving profile based on the common pricing factors utilized by top car insurance companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, credit score, coverage level, and driving record.*

*Our homeowner's results are compiled from the same ZIP code but a 45-year-old homeowner with a $200,000 and $400,000 dwelling value. Our renter's insurance results are determined from a 30-year-old male with $25,000 or $50,000 of personal property contents. Each of these profiles uses the same ZIP codes as our auto insurance rates.*
