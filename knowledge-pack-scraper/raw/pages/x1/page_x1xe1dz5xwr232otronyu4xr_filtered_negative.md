_The auto insurance rates displayed in our articles are based on the 2019 results of The Zebra’s comprehensive car insurance pricing analysis. In our analysis of all US ZIP codes — including Washington D.C. — our user profile consisted of a 30-year-old single male driving a 2013 Honda Accord. To generate pricing specific to particular rating factors, we altered the driving profile based on the common pricing factors utilized by top car insurance companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, credit score, coverage level, and driving record._
_Our homeowner's results are compiled from the same ZIP code but a 45-year-old homeowner with a $200,000 and $400,000 dwelling value. Our renter's insurance results are determined from a 30-year-old male with $25,000 or $50,000 of personal property contents. Each of these profiles uses the same ZIP codes as our auto insurance rates._
