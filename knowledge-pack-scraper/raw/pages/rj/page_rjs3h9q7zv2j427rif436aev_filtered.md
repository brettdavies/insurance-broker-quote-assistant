[**Allstate**](/car-insurance/companies/allstate/) and [**State Farm**](/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/) are two of the largest companies in the auto insurance industry, primarily because of their brand awareness and financial strength.

Quick Facts

* Both Allstate and State Farm earned an Insurify Quality (IQ) Score of above 4 out of 5.

Why we picked this company

Founded by retail giant Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 1931, Allstate offers auto, home, motorcycle, ATV, renters, condo, and term life insurance. Operating in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Chicago-area based company has superior ratings from AM Best for financial strength and credit. However, Allstate has many negative reviews on consumer websites, and a slightly higher-than-average complaint rating in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Consumer Complaint Index. Allstate offers many discounts, including for good students, multiple policies, bundling auto and home insurance, new vehicles, safe driving, and good payment history.

Pros 

* Ample opportunities for bundling discount
* Offers a pay-per-mile option
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* Low customer satisfaction
* Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
* Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study

## State Farm

State Farm is the largest U.S. property/casualty insurer based on direct premiums written.[[2]](#cite-2) But even with its large size, State Farm keeps policyholders happy with a high level of customer satisfaction and relatively low car insurance rates.

## Allstate Drivewise vs. State Farm Drive Safe & Save

Allstate’s Drivewise and State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save usage-based telematics programs both offer an opportunity for safe drivers to earn a discount on their insurance premiums.

Allstate’s Drivewise program is a free option you can add to any Allstate insurance policy. You can sign up for the program by downloading the mobile app, which will track your driving behavior. Every six months, you could receive a policy credit for practicing safe driving habits. But the exact discount you receive varies based on your driving behavior and location.[[3]](#cite-3)

In contrast, State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save program advertises a discount of up to 30%. Most drivers will connect to the program through a mobile app. But if you have an eligible Ford or Lincoln vehicle, you can link the program directly to your vehicle. The program rewards safe drivers with a discount on their insurance premiums.[[4]](#cite-4)

Neither program will raise your rates if it detects poor driving habits.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Every driver has a unique situation, which means the right insurance company is different for everyone. But in general, State Farm offers lower rates and earned a higher J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating in most regions.

State Farm is a bigger insurance company than Allstate based on market share. But in terms of direct premiums written, both companies rank in the top five largest car insurance companies.

State Farm is the largest auto insurer in the U.S. by market share, owning a cumulative 16.84% of the market, according to NAIC data. In terms of direct premiums, Progressive is the second-largest U.S. auto insurer. GEICO, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, is the third-largest car insurer by market share, while Allstate and USAA are fourth and fifth, respectively.

Price is one main difference between Allstate and State Farm auto insurance policies. In general, State Farm offers lower average rates than Allstate. However, Allstate offers more add-on coverage options, including gap coverage and accident forgiveness for all customers.
