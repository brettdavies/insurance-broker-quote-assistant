* Collision vs. Comprehensive Insurance
![Drivers are filling out an accident report.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/collision-vs-comprehensive-insurance.jpg)
_Overview: Collision and comprehensive car insurance both help protect your vehicle, but in different ways. Collision coverage helps cover damage from accidents involving other cars or objects, while comprehensive coverage helps cover non-collision incidents, such as theft, weather damage or hitting an animal. It’s important to understand deductibles, situations where these coverages may be required (such as for a leased or financed car) and tips for choosing options that fit your needs._
When it comes to helping protect your vehicle, understanding [collision](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) vs. [comprehensive](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) insurance may be important. Both coverages are optional and help safeguard your vehicle from damage, but they apply to different situations. Understanding the difference between collision and comprehensive insurance can help you make better informed decisions.

For example, if your car hits a guardrail and sustains $2,500 in damage, collision coverage can help [repair your car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-know-when-discussing-car-repairs-with-mechanic). You would need to pay the deductible first—let’s say it’s $500—and then your insurance would cover the remainder of the repair costs.
* **Hitting wildlife** — [if your vehicle collides with an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-likely-are-you-to-have-an-animal-collision) like a deer, it can cause extensive damage.
Covers damages from non-crash incidents, such as [theft](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft) or storms.
Theft, vandalism, [fire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-fire-what-to-do-if-it-happens-to-you), weather events, falling objects or [hitting animals](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car).
* **Deductible options** — choosing a higher deductible can help reduce your insurance premium, but increases out-of-pocket costs in the [event of a claim](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/auto).
These coverages can help you protect your car and financial security during life's unexpected challenges.
