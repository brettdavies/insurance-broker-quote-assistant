[Malaysian Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia "Prime Minister of Malaysia") [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad "Mahathir Mohamad") driving a car in [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam")

**Driving** is the controlled operation and movement of a [land vehicle](/wiki/Land_vehicle "Land vehicle"), including [cars](/wiki/Car "Car"), [taxis](/wiki/Taxi "Taxi"), [ambulances](/wiki/Ambulance "Ambulance"), [fire engines](/wiki/Fire_engine "Fire engine"), [tanks](/wiki/Tank "Tank"), [vans](/wiki/Van "Van"), [trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck") and [buses](/wiki/Bus "Bus"). A driver's permission to drive on public [highways](/wiki/Highway "Highway") is granted based on a set of conditions being met, and drivers are required to follow the established [road and traffic laws](/wiki/Traffic_code "Traffic code") in the location they are driving. The word "driving" has etymology dating back to the 15th century. Its meaning has changed from primarily driving [working animals](/wiki/Working_animals "Working animals") in the 15th century to automobiles in the 1800s. Driving skills have also developed since the 15th century, with physical, mental and safety skills being required to drive. This evolution of the skills required to drive have been accompanied by the introduction of driving laws which relate not only to the driver but also to the driveability of a car.

The term "driver" originated in the 15th century, referring to the occupation of driving working animals such as pack or [draft horses](/wiki/Draft_horses "Draft horses"). It later applied to [electric railway](/wiki/Electric_railway "Electric railway") drivers in 1889 and motor-car drivers in 1896. The world's first long-distance road trip by automobile was in 1888, when [Bertha Benz](/wiki/Bertha_Benz "Bertha Benz") drove a [Benz Patent-Motorwagen](/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen "Benz Patent-Motorwagen") from [Mannheim](/wiki/Mannheim "Mannheim") to [Pforzheim](/wiki/Pforzheim "Pforzheim"), Germany. Driving requires both physical and mental skills, as well as an understanding of the rules of the road.

In many countries, drivers must pass practical and theoretical driving tests to obtain a driving license. Physical skills required for driving include proper hand placement, gear shifting, pedal operation, [steering](/wiki/Steering "Steering"), [braking](/wiki/Braking "Braking"), and operation of [ancillary](/wiki/Ancillary "Ancillary") devices. Mental skills involve hazard awareness, decision-making, evasive maneuvering, and understanding [vehicle dynamics](/wiki/Vehicle_dynamics "Vehicle dynamics"). [Distractions](/wiki/Distractions "Distractions"), [altered states of consciousness](/wiki/Altered_states_of_consciousness "Altered states of consciousness"), and certain medical conditions can impair a driver's mental skills.

Safety concerns in driving include poor road conditions, low visibility, [texting while driving](/wiki/Texting_while_driving "Texting while driving"), [speeding](/wiki/Speeding "Speeding"), [impaired driving](/wiki/Impaired_driving "Impaired driving"), [sleep-deprived driving](/wiki/Sleep-deprived_driving "Sleep-deprived driving"), and [reckless driving](/wiki/Reckless_driving "Reckless driving"). Laws regarding driving, [driver licensing](/wiki/Driver_licensing "Driver licensing"), and [vehicle registration](/wiki/Vehicle_registration "Vehicle registration") vary between jurisdictions. Most countries have laws against driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Many jurisdictions use point systems for driver's licenses to track offenses and maintain road safety. A modern, data-driven counterpart in the commercial and insurance sectors is [driver scoring](/wiki/Driver_scoring "Driver scoring"), which uses [telematics](/wiki/Telematics "Telematics") to monitor and evaluate driving behavior.

The [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization "World Health Organization") estimates that 1.35 million people are killed each year in road traffic; it is the leading cause of death for people aged 5 to 29.[[1]](#cite_note-WHO2018-1)

## Etymology

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Etymology")]

Further information: [Coachman](/wiki/Coachman "Coachman") and [Chauffeur](/wiki/Chauffeur "Chauffeur")

The origin of the term *driver*, as recorded from the 15th century, refers to the occupation of driving [working animals](/wiki/Working_animal "Working animal"), especially [pack horses](/wiki/Packhorse "Packhorse") or [draft horses](/wiki/Draft_horses "Draft horses"). The verb *to drive* in origin means "to force to move, to impel by physical force". It is first recorded of electric railway drivers in 1889 and of a *motor-car driver* in 1896. Early alternatives were *motorneer*,[[2]](#cite_note-2) *motor-man*, *motor-driver* or *motorist*. French favors "*conducteur*" (the English equivalent, "*[conductor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conductor "wikt:conductor")*", being used—from the 1830s—not of the driver but of the person in charge of passengers and collecting fares), while German influenced areas adopted *Fahrer* (used of coach-drivers in the 18th century, but shortened about 1900 from the compound *Kraftwagenfahrer*), and the verbs *führen*, *lenken*, *steuern*—all with a meaning "steer, guide, navigate"—translating to *conduire*.

## Introduction of the automobile

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Introduction of the automobile")]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Driving_to_top_of_Mt_Washington_1899.jpg/250px-Driving_to_top_of_Mt_Washington_1899.jpg)](/wiki/File:Driving_to_top_of_Mt_Washington_1899.jpg)

In 1899, an automobile was driven to the summit of [Mount Washington](/wiki/Mount_Washington_(New_Hampshire) "Mount Washington (New Hampshire)"), New Hampshire, for the first time

The world's first long-distance [road trip](/wiki/Road_trip "Road trip") by automobile was in August 1888, when [Bertha Benz](/wiki/Bertha_Benz "Bertha Benz"), wife of *[Benz Patent-Motorwagen](/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen "Benz Patent-Motorwagen")* inventor [Karl Benz](/wiki/Karl_Benz "Karl Benz"), drove 66 mi (106 km) from [Mannheim](/wiki/Mannheim "Mannheim") to [Pforzheim](/wiki/Pforzheim "Pforzheim"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany "Germany"), and returned, in the third experimental Benz motor car, which had a maximum speed of 10 mph (16 km/h), with her two teenage sons Richard and Eugen but without the consent and knowledge of her husband.[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5) She had said she wanted to visit her mother, but also intended to generate publicity for her husband's invention, which had only been taken on short test drives before.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

In 1899, F. O. Stanley and his wife Flora drove their *[Stanley Steamer](/wiki/Stanley_Steamer "Stanley Steamer")* automobile, sometimes called a *locomobile*, to the summit of [Mount Washington](/wiki/Mount_Washington_(New_Hampshire) "Mount Washington (New Hampshire)") in [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire "New Hampshire") in the United States to generate [publicity](/wiki/Publicity "Publicity") for their automobile.[[7]](#cite_note-twsZc44-7) The 7.6-mile (12.2 km) journey took over two hours (not counting time to add more water); the descent was accomplished by putting the engine in [low gear](/wiki/Low_gear "Low gear") and much braking.[[7]](#cite_note-twsZc44-7)

## Driving skills

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Driving skills")]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bus_driver_%285171124305%29.jpg/250px-Bus_driver_%285171124305%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bus_driver_(5171124305).jpg)

Driving a bus in traffic.

Driving in [traffic](/wiki/Traffic "Traffic") is more than just knowing how to operate the mechanisms which control the vehicle; it requires knowing how to apply the rules of the road (which ensure safe and efficient sharing with other users). An effective driver also has an intuitive understanding of the basics of [vehicle handling](/wiki/Vehicle_handling "Vehicle handling") and can drive responsibly.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

Although direct operation of a [bicycle](/wiki/Bicycle "Bicycle") and a mounted [animal](/wiki/Animal "Animal") are commonly referred to as *riding*, such operators are legally considered drivers and are required to obey the [rules of the road](/wiki/Traffic#Rules_of_the_road "Traffic"). Driving over a long distance is referred to as a [road trip](/wiki/Road_trip "Road trip").

In many countries, knowledge of the rules of the road, both practical and theoretical, is assessed with a driving test(s), and those who pass are issued with a [driving license](/wiki/Driving_license "Driving license").

### Physical skill

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Physical skill")]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Cesta_za_V._Prapratnu_01935.webm/250px--Cesta_za_V._Prapratnu_01935.webm.jpg)

Control direction, acceleration, and deceleration.

A driver must have physical skills to be able to control direction, acceleration, and deceleration. For motor vehicles, the detailed tasks include:[[9]](#cite_note-9)

* Proper hand placement and seating position
* Starting the vehicle's engine with the [starting system](/wiki/Automobile_self_starter "Automobile self starter")
* Setting the [transmission](/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics) "Transmission (mechanics)") to the correct gear
* Depressing the [pedals](/wiki/Automobile_pedal "Automobile pedal") with one's feet to accelerate, slow and stop the vehicle and
  + If the vehicle is equipped with a [manual transmission](/wiki/Manual_transmission "Manual transmission"), to modulate the [clutch](/wiki/Clutch "Clutch")
* [Steering](/wiki/Steering "Steering") the vehicle's direction with the [steering wheel](/wiki/Steering_wheel "Steering wheel")
* Applying [brake](/wiki/Brake "Brake") pressure to slow or stop the vehicle
* Operating other important ancillary devices such as the [indicators](/wiki/Turn_signals "Turn signals"), [headlights](/wiki/Headlights "Headlights"), [parking brake](/wiki/Parking_brake "Parking brake") and [windshield wipers](/wiki/Windshield_wiper "Windshield wiper")
* Speed and [skid](/wiki/Skid_(automobile) "Skid (automobile)") control

### Mental skill

Observing the environment. Driving in a snowy condition can pose serious hazards. The snow affects the [dynamics of the car](/wiki/Vehicle_dynamics "Vehicle dynamics").

Avoiding or successfully handling an emergency driving situation can involve the following skills:[[10]](#cite_note-10)

* Observing the environment for road signs, driving conditions, and hazards
* [Awareness of surroundings](/wiki/Spatial_contextual_awareness "Spatial contextual awareness"), especially in heavy and city traffic
* Making good and quick decisions based on factors such as road and traffic conditions
* Evasive maneuvering
* Understanding [vehicle dynamics](/wiki/Vehicle_dynamics "Vehicle dynamics")
* [Left- and right-hand traffic](/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic "Left- and right-hand traffic")

[Distracted driving](/wiki/Distracted_driving "Distracted driving").
> Driver distraction is a significant risk factor in traffic. It occurs when attention is diverted away from activities needed for safe driving towards a competing activity

— [[11]](#cite_note-11)

[Distractions](/wiki/Distracted_driving "Distracted driving") can compromise a driver's mental skills, as can any [altered state of consciousness](/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness "Altered state of consciousness"). One study on the subject of [mobile phones and driving safety](/wiki/Mobile_phones_and_driving_safety "Mobile phones and driving safety") concluded that, after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, drivers talking on a phone exhibited greater impairment than drivers who were suffering from alcohol intoxication.[[12]](#cite_note-Strayer-12) In the US "During daylight hours, approximately 481,000 drivers are using cell phones while driving according to the publication on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association. Another survey indicated that music could adversely affect a driver's concentration."[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-15)

Seizure disorders and Alzheimer's disease are among the leading medical causes of mental impairment among drivers in the United States and Europe.[[16]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-16) Whether or not physicians should be allowed, or even required, to report such conditions to state authorities, remains highly controversial.[[16]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-16)

### Safety

Safety is always the most important thing.

Safety issues in driving include:

* Driving in poor road conditions and low visibility
* [Texting while driving](/wiki/Texting_while_driving "Texting while driving")
* [Speeding](/wiki/Speeding "Speeding")
* [Drug–impaired driving](/wiki/Drug%E2%80%93impaired_driving "Drug–impaired driving") and [driving under the influence](/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence "Driving under the influence")
* [Distracted driving](/wiki/Distracted_driving "Distracted driving")
* [Sleep-deprived driving](/wiki/Sleep-deprived_driving "Sleep-deprived driving")
* [Reckless driving](/wiki/Reckless_driving "Reckless driving") and [street racing](/wiki/Street_racing "Street racing")

## Teenagers

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Teenagers")]

There is a high rate of injury and death caused by motor vehicle accidents that involve teenage drivers.[[17]](#cite_note-:0-17) There is evidence that the less teenagers drive, the risk of injury drops.[[17]](#cite_note-:0-17) There is a lack of evidence as to whether educational interventions to promote active transport and share information about the risks, cost, and stresses involved with driving are effective at reducing or delaying car driving in the teenage years.[[17]](#cite_note-:0-17)

## Driveability

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Driveability")]

Driveability of a vehicle means the smooth delivery of power, as demanded by the driver. Typical causes of driveability degradation are rough [idling](/wiki/Idle_(engine) "Idle (engine)"), [misfiring](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/misfiring "wikt:misfiring"), [surging](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/surging "wikt:surging"), [hesitation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hesitation "wikt:hesitation"), or insufficient power.[[18]](#cite_note-18)

## Driving laws

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Driving laws")]

Drivers are subject to the laws of the [jurisdiction](/wiki/Jurisdiction "Jurisdiction") in which they are driving.

### International conventions

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: International conventions")]

Some jurisdictions submit to some or all of the requirements of the [Geneva Convention on Road Traffic](/wiki/Geneva_Convention_on_Road_Traffic "Geneva Convention on Road Traffic") of 1949.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

Additionally, the [Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals](/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals "Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals") standardises road signs, traffic lights and road markings to improve safety.

### Local driving laws

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Local driving laws")]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Permiso_de_conducir_plastificado.jpg/250px-Permiso_de_conducir_plastificado.jpg)](/wiki/File:Permiso_de_conducir_plastificado.jpg)

Driver's license from Spain. Spanish driving licenses use a point system

The rules of the road, [driver licensing](/wiki/Driver%27s_license "Driver's license") and [vehicle registration](/wiki/License_plate "License plate") schemes vary considerably between jurisdictions, as do laws imposing [criminal responsibility for negligent driving](/wiki/Vehicular_homicide "Vehicular homicide"), [vehicle safety inspections](/wiki/Vehicle_inspection "Vehicle inspection") and compulsory [insurance](/wiki/Vehicle_insurance "Vehicle insurance"). Most countries also have differing laws against driving while under the [influence of alcohol or other drugs](/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence "Driving under the influence"). [Aggressive driving](/wiki/Aggressive_driving "Aggressive driving") and [road rage](/wiki/Road_rage_(phenomenon) "Road rage (phenomenon)") have become problems for drivers in some areas.

Some countries require annual renewal of the driver's license. This may require getting through another driving test or vision screening test to get recertified.[[20]](#cite_note-20) Also, some countries use a [points system](/wiki/Point_system_(driving) "Point system (driving)") for the driver's license. Both techniques (annual renewal with tests, points system) may or may not improve road safety compared to when the driver is not continuously or annually evaluated.[[21]](#cite_note-21)

#### Ownership and insurance

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Ownership and insurance")]

[Car ownership](/wiki/Car_ownership "Car ownership") does not require a driver's license at all. As such, even with a [withdrawn driver's license](/wiki/Point_system_(driving) "Point system (driving)"), former drivers are still legally allowed to possess a car and thus have access to it. In the USA, between 1993 and 1997 13.8% of all drivers involved in fatal crashes had no driver's license.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

In some countries (such as the UK), the car itself needs have a [certificate that proves the vehicle is safe and roadworthy](/wiki/MOT_test "MOT test"). Also, it needs to have a minimum of [third party insurance](/wiki/Car_insurance "Car insurance").[[23]](#cite_note-23)

#### Driver training

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Driver training")]

Drivers may be required to take lessons with an approved [driving instructor](/wiki/Driving_instructor "Driving instructor") (or are strongly encouraged to do so) and must pass a [driving test](/wiki/Driving_test "Driving test") before being granted a license. Almost all countries allow all adults with good vision and health to apply to take a driving test and, if successful, to drive on public roads.

In many countries, even after passing one's driving test, new drivers are initially subject to special restrictions under [graduated driver licensing](/wiki/Graduated_driver_licensing "Graduated driver licensing") rules. For example, in Australia, novice drivers are required to carry "P" ("provisional") plates,[[24]](#cite_note-24) while in [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand") it is called restricted (R).[[25]](#cite_note-25) Many U.S. states now issue graduated drivers' licenses to novice minors. While graduated driver licensing rules vary between jurisdictions, typical restrictions include newly licensed minors not being permitted to drive or operate a motorized vehicle at night or with a passenger other than family members, zero blood alcohol, and limited [power-to-weight ratio](/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio "Power-to-weight ratio") of the vehicle.[[26]](#cite_note-26)

## Driving bans

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driving&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Driving bans")]

It is possible for a driver to be suspended or disqualified (banned) from driving, either for a short time or permanently. This is usually in response to a serious traffic offence (for example, causing death due to drink driving), repeated minor traffic offences (for example, accruing too many demerit points for speeding), or for a specific medical condition which prevents driving, pending a future assessment (for example, a traumatic brain injury).

Some jurisdictions implement [road space rationing](/wiki/Road_space_rationing "Road space rationing"), where vehicles are banned from driving on certain days depending on a variety of criteria, most commonly the letters and digits in their [vehicle registration plate](/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate "Vehicle registration plate").

A few countries banned women driving in the past. In [Oman](/wiki/Oman "Oman"), women were not allowed to drive until 1970.[[27]](#cite_note-27) In [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), women were not issued driving licenses until 2018. Saudi women had periodically staged driving protests against these restrictions and in September 2017, the Saudi government agreed to lift the ban, which went into effect in June 2018.[[28]](#cite_note-28)
