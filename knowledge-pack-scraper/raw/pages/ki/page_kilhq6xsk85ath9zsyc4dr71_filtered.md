GEICO is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, one of the five largest commercial auto insurers in the U.S.[[1]](#cite-1) That standing reflects the company’s proven ability to pay for claims if your business truck gets sideswiped or your delivery van needs major repairs after an accident.

One of GEICO’s strengths is its DriveEasy Pro program, which uses technology to track employee driving and offers discounts to business owners for safe driving. Although this program isn’t available in every state, GEICO’s strong financial foundation makes it a company worth considering, especially if you’re shopping for [**cheap commercial insurance**](/car-insurance/cheap-commercial-insurance/).

Quick Facts

* GEICO offers combined single-limit liability policies for flexible coverage.
* AM Best gives the company an A++ financial strength rating.
* The DriveEasy Pro Dashcam option provides road-facing cameras and instant safety alerts.

Overview

GEICO’s commercial auto insurance offers the same straightforward approach to vehicle insurance coverage as its [**personal auto policies**](/car-insurance/companies/geico/). You can buy liability, collision, comprehensive, and personal injury protection for fleets of any size. Commercial auto policies also have higher liability limits than standard personal auto insurance and include access to DriveEasy Pro to monitor driving behavior.

GEICO’s competitive rates, financial stability, and digital tools for fleet management make it one of the [**top commercial auto insurance companies**](/car-insurance/commercial-car-insurance/). It’s well suited for small and midsize companies prioritizing financial strength and practical features over white-glove service.

Pros and cons

Pros 

* High financial strength ratings
* Emergency roadside service and expanded towing available
* Customizable coverage types and deductibles

Cons

* Few physical locations
* Many complaints reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
* Can’t update vehicles or drivers online by yourself — requires a specialist

## How GEICO commercial auto insurance works

During the underwriting process, GEICO reviews your business operations, including vehicle types and driver histories. It also considers your industry, business size, operating locations, and even the type of cargo you’re hauling (if applicable) to personalize your insurance quotes.

With that information, GEICO builds a policy that can include bodily injury and property damage liability, collision and comprehensive coverage for vehicle repairs, medical payments, and uninsured/underinsured motorist protection.

You can also access specialized coverage tailored to your [**business needs**](/car-insurance/commercial-insurance-small-business/). For example, freight haulers may need cargo insurance, businesses that rent or borrow vehicles can benefit from hired and non-owned vehicle coverage, and trucking companies using trailers they don’t own may require trailer interchange insurance.

Once your policy is active, you can use digital tools to manage your fleet, make payments, and get ID cards or proof of insurance.

GEICO also offers optional telematics through its DriveEasy Pro program. Each vehicle gets an onboard diagnostics (OBD) device to track driver behavior and location. With GEICO’s fleet management dashboard, you can get live updates and a bird’s-eye view of your entire operation.

### GEICO commercial auto discounts

Discounts can affect your business insurance costs significantly, especially when insuring multiple vehicles.[[2]](#cite-2) GEICO offers several ways to trim your commercial auto premiums. While the company outlines a few discounts specifically for commercial policies, it may adapt other discounts from its personal auto offerings.

Remember that potential savings and eligibility requirements may vary depending on your state, vehicle types, and business operations. It’s best to call GEICO directly for personalized policy info and [**discount information**](/car-insurance/discounts/).

| **Business Discount Type**  sort ascsort desc | **Potential Savings**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-vehicle fleet | 25% |
| Safety training programs | Varies |
| Anti-theft devices | 23% |
| Multi-policy bundling | Varies |
| Accident-free discount | Varies |
| Military discount | 15% |
| Telematics | Varies |
| New vehicle | 15% |

### GEICO commercial auto ratings

Financial strength and customer satisfaction ratings in commercial insurance carry extra weight, along with prompt claims handling and professional support. GEICO shows mixed performance in these categories.

For example, AM Best awards GEICO its top A++ rating for financial strength, indicating a “superior” ability to process claims and service accounts.[[3]](#cite-3) But GEICO doesn’t appear in the J.D. Power Small Commercial Insurance Customer Satisfaction rankings.

Additionally, the NAIC Complaint Index gives GEICO a score of 90.91 for commercial auto insurance, indicating the company receives more customer complaints than the industry average. While not alarming, this suggests GEICO may have some service issues that commercial customers should consider when evaluating policy options.

| **Rating Source**  sort ascsort desc | **Score**  sort ascsort desc | **What This Means**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AM Best Financial Strength | A++ | Superior |
| J.D. Power Small Commercial Insurance Customer Satisfaction | Not rated | No available data |
| NAIC Commercial Complaint Index | 90.91 | More complaints than expected |
