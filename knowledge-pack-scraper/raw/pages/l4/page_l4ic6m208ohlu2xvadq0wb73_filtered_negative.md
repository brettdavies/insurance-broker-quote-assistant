* ####  Overview
**Why USAA made our list:** In addition to low average rates, USAA offers several potential discounts, including for low mileage, bundling, good grades and garaging a vehicle on a military installation. However, USAA does not offer 24/7 customer service, which may deter some drivers. Additionally, its lack of brick-and-mortar insurance locations in Washington (and nationwide) might not be best for customers who prefer face-to-face service.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Unique discount and coverage options for military members
* Excellent customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power
* Coverage is limited to military members, veterans and their immediate family
* Policy management and claims handling only available online or by phone
