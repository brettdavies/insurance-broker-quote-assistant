  **Why Geico made our list:** Geico helps make finding [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) easy for Washington drivers. On its website, Geico advertises an impressive 16 different potential discounts across five categories: vehicle equipment, driving history and habits, driver’s education, driver affiliation and customer loyalty. Although Geico does incentivize drivers to practice good habits with its five-year accident-free good driver discount, drivers with less-than-perfect driving records may still get a cheap deal. Keep in mind that the rates for Washington drivers with an at-fault accident can fluctuate, so you may want to shop around if you have infractions on your record.

However, USAA does not offer 24/7 customer service, which may deter some drivers. Additionally, its lack of brick-and-mortar insurance locations in Washington (and nationwide) might not be best for customers who prefer face-to-face service.

How Bankrate chose the best car insurance companies in Washington

Bankrate’s insurance editorial team started the search for the [best car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in Washington by analyzing dozens of carriers available in the state. We reviewed [average car insurance premiums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) from Quadrant Information Services for minimum and full coverage and compared coverage options. Third-party ratings from agencies like J.D. Power and AM Best were used to assess customer satisfaction and financial strength. We understand that many customers like to handle their insurance needs digitally, so mobile app accessibility was also factored in to calculate a company's overall Bankrate Score.

The better a company scored in each of these categories, the higher its overall Bankrate Score for a maximum Score of 5.0 out of 5.0 points. As you learn more about the insurance carriers below, this Bankrate Score may help provide a high-level summary of how each insurer compares to another.

## How to find the best car insurance in Washington

Finding the best car insurance in WA for your situation may take a bit of research, but knowing what coverage types and company features you want can make the process easier. Consider the following strategies to narrow down the list of providers you’re interested in:

* Number 1 Icon

  ### Consider minimum insurance requirements in Washington

  Caret Down Icon 

  [Washington state laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) require drivers to carry minimum levels of bodily injury and property damage [liability coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-vs-full-coverage/). Insurers are also required by law to offer uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and personal injury protection, but these optional coverage types can be declined in writing. Although minimum-only coverage is cheaper, it leaves you exposed to greater financial risk. Liability only covers accident-related costs for the other driver, their vehicle, their passengers and pedestrians if you are found at fault. You will not have financial protection for your vehicle, yourself and your passengers without adding collision and comprehensive coverage — colloquially referred to as full coverage.

* Number 2 Icon

  ### Consider lender requirements

  Caret Down Icon 

  Washington state laws are not the only authority that has a say in how much coverage you need to carry. If you’ve financed your vehicle with a loan or a lease, your financial lender will likely require you to carry higher liability limits than what state laws require. Depending on your lender, you may need to carry a [full coverage car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) policy and [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/). A lender has made a financial investment in your vehicle, and its more robust insurance requirements are a way for it to protect that investment.

* Number 3 Icon

  ### Consider your individual needs

  Caret Down Icon 

  Drivers may also evaluate their car insurance needs based on their individual circumstances. Understanding what you need from your policy could help you choose a company and coverage options. For example, if you have a [teen driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) to insure, you might want to look for a company that offers several young driver discounts that could help lower your policy costs. If you’re a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/) who has accidents, tickets or a DUI conviction on your record, you might need to research nonstandard car insurance options. Getting a sense of what your specific situation calls for could help you narrow down your options when shopping for coverage.

## How much is car insurance in Washington?

The [average Washington auto insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-washington/) costs $589 per year for minimum coverage and $1,919 per year for full coverage, according to 2024 rate data obtained from Quadrant Information Services. Washington drivers pay less than the national annual average of $806 for minimum coverage and $2,671 for full coverage.

When compared to [surrounding states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/), Washington drivers see fairly affordable average rates. Oregon drivers pay $2,121 per year for full coverage, on average, while California drivers pay an average of $3,102 annually. The difference in rates could be attributed in part to the population of each state and the number of drivers on the road, as well as an increased cost of living in California compared to Washington and Oregon.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### How much is car insurance in Washington?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The average cost of car insurance is $1,582 per year for full coverage and $487 for minimum coverage.

Request the same coverage types and amounts to make it easier to compare policies and costs. Keep in mind that insurance premiums can change at renewal periods, so you might want to regularly shop for car insurance.

* ###### Can car insurance companies use my credit score in Washington?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Yes, car insurance companies can use credit-based insurance scores when determining how much to charge you for auto insurance in Washington. That means that drivers with strong credit will tend to pay less for auto insurance than people with poor credit. While the state suspended this practice for a brief period in 2022, a court ruling on August 29, 2022, allowed insurers to once again use credit history when calculating premiums. If you’re looking to reduce your insurance premiums, consider boosting your credit score.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
