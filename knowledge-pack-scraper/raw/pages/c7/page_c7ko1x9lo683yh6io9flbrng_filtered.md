When you are involved or injured in a car accident, one of your first thoughts may be whether or not your insurance company will cover the costs of your recovery. While you may have paid into your plan regularly, that does not always mean you are guaranteed coverage. Navigating claims with an insurance company can be complex, so what can you expect from your claim?

With more than 16 million policies and 28 million cars insured, you may expect Geico to provide the services you expect, but do not be surprised by an act of bad faith. Geico is still an insurance company, and you may struggle to get the total settlement amount you are due when filing a claim. Reach out to us to learn more about how the dedicated, focused car accident attorneys at [Crockett Law Group](/) can help you.

## Is Geico a Good Insurance Company?

According to Geico’s website, the company offers millions of auto insurance policies and is, in fact, the third-largest private passenger auto insurer in the United States. Geico also offers the following accolades from companies that watch the ratings and benefits of insurance companies like Geico:

* AA+ rating from [Standard and Poor’s](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/)
* Aa1 from Moody’s
* A++ from A. M. Best

However, according to rankings created by [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/geico-car-insurance-review), Geico is only number 5 in their rankings of top insurance companies. While this is still a significant number, this report states that Geico performs worse than the national average in most categories, but the company is also more cost-effective than many other options.

## How Do I Contact Geico Insurance in California?

Geico offers a few key ways to contact their team about your policy or to report an accident, making it easy for everyone to navigate their insurance policy, especially after an accident. When you are ready to contact Geico, one of the easiest ways to do so is through their [app](https://www.geico.com/web-and-mobile/mobile-apps/). With a few taps, you can be in touch with an agent or through the filing process for your claim.

For those who have specific questions or need the help of a technician, there are options for contact via phone. Geico offers a toll-free number for contact across the nation: [(800) 841-3000](tel:(800) 841-3000). This number is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

## How to File a Claim with Geico?

When filing a car accident insurance claim with Geico, remember that you are not alone. You always have a way to pursue a claim with the at-fault party, though this process can be easier, streamlined, and faster with attorneys like [ours at Crockett Law Group](/kevin-crockett/). We offer legal services to help you navigate your insurance claim and ensure you are getting the coverage you are due.

With Geico, your claim begins with a call or through their app, where you will file your claim and schedule an appointment for a vehicle inspection. If your vehicle is not safe to drive, you can have an auto damages adjuster come to you. In some cases, that means your claim can be settled within 48 hours of the accident.

If the other driver struck you, you would file a liability claim at this point, while the other driver may instead try to build a defense during this time. Once Geico receives your claim, they begin the process of identifying your claim’s value and offering you a settlement that covers the needs they see. however, if your settlement offer is not enough, you can always reach out to us to negotiate a claim and make decisions regarding the next steps for your case.

## How Long Do You Have to Report an Accident to Geico Insurance?

The good news is that Geico does not limit how much time you can take to file your report when pursuing compensation through their insurance. Generally, your insurance notification should have been as soon as possible after the accident, but Geico does not provide specific deadlines for these reports. However, you may have difficulties getting coverage if you wait too long, so do not hesitate to pursue compensation.

However, following your accident, reporting your accident to Geico as soon as possible can help your case succeed. Acting now rather than later, especially with our attorneys on your side, can help you keep evidence fresh and keep the incident fresh on your mind as you speak about your situation. If you are struggling to report quickly, you can always reach out to us for help.

But, while your insurance provider may not have a specific deadline for filing your claim, state laws do. Under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 312-366, you only have three years to file a case and pursue compensation in the courtroom. If you fail to act within this time limit, you may have difficulties getting compensated appropriately for your damages.

##### Tip

Your best plan after a car accident is to contact your insurance company immediately. You should also do your best to record and document the scene, especially if you plan to speak with a lawyer as well.

## Is Geico Good at Paying Claims?

According to the [J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), Geico ranked a little lower than the average rating for insurance companies. With a score of 857, the company fell behind the industry average of 861. However, other sources find relatively high customer satisfaction with Geico.

For example, [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/insurance-services/geico-insurance-reviews/#:~:text=Geico%20Insurance%20Reviews%3A%20J.D.%20Power,stage%20of%20the%20shopping%20experience.) found in one study that 36% of respondents were very satisfied with their coverage. Another 45% were satisfied, and less than 3% were dissatisfied at all. Participants in this study who had filed a claim with the company were overall satisfied with the results of their claim, as part of the 40% of policyholders who had filed a claim with the company.

##### Note

While customer satisfaction scores can tell you some things about an insurance company’s reliability, they do not answer every situation. For example, those with especially serious or expensive cases may face much different results than those with only minor injuries or property damage.

## How Long Does Geico Take to Pay a Claim?

The [severity](/irvine/catastrophic-injury-lawyer/) of your injuries and damage may be crucial to determining how fast Geico will pay your claim. For example, if your injuries include [severe brain trauma](/irvine/traumatic-brain-injury-lawyer/) or a totaled car, it may take longer to untangle the many specifics of your case to give you answers about your case. However, for minor accidents, the results may not be so complex or difficult to determine.

In fact, Geico boasts about the speed of their claim payouts. In some cases, your claim may be settled in as little as [48 hours](https://www.geico.com/claims/claimsprocess/handling-your-claim/), giving you the funds for your claim as soon as possible following your accident. However, if you have any questions about the specifics of your case or its value, you can always reach out to a [car accident lawyer](/irvine/car-accident-attorney/) for aid before you settle.

## How Much Does Geico Pay for Bodily Injury?

When someone is injured in a car accident, bodily injury insurance coverage is there to cover the costs of their physical recovery. Geico insurance policies cover at least the state requirements for coverage for these types of accidents, which are $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident. However, if you opt for higher coverage, your results may differ.

However, this coverage may not be enough for you or another injured party. Even what seems like a minor injury can escalate to a major expense, especially if you need surgery or long-term physical therapy to recover from these injuries. You may need to [take your claim to court](/irvine/car-accident-attorney/) when your injuries escalate beyond what insurers like Geico will cover.

##### Pro Tip

When you are hurt in a car accident, take detailed notes of your injuries and recovery progress. It is easy to forget certain milestones or setbacks, which can impact the value of your claim.

## How Do I Dispute a Claim with Geico?

You may feel that you did everything right for your insurance claim, but unfortunately, you may have still been denied the coverage you need. This is not an uncommon occurrence, but it can be difficult to recover from. Fortunately, there are certain steps you can take to pursue a higher settlement offer or appeal a denial:

* Review the denial letter to determine why you were denied
* Pursue further evidence like witness statements and medical exams
* Contact Geico about the decision with a lawyer
* File an appeal if direct discussion does not resolve the denial or issues with the offer

The most important step is to be patient and never give up on your claim. Many insurance claims are denied daily, and a denial does not have to end your claim. With our legal guidance behind you, you have an opportunity to take action and get results.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Geico Insurance

As you navigate an insurance claim, you may feel lost and confused, dealing with both the pain and trauma of the accident and the anxiety of pursuing compensation from Geico. You may currently have more questions than answers. Fortunately, we are here to provide guidance, starting with the most commonly asked questions below.

###### What is an insurance claim?

When you have an insurance policy, you have a promise that, if you are injured in an accident, your insurance company will provide funds for your recovery from the accident. Your insurance claim is payment for your car accident damages based on the coverage you have for your claim. These damages may be repaid once the insurance company reviews and approves your claim.

###### Can you file an insurance claim without a police report?

While insurance companies generally do not require a police report to file an insurance claim, reporting your accident can help strengthen the validity of your case. These police reports contain key evidence from the point-of-view of a police officer, which may be taken more seriously in the courtroom. You may also be obligated to do so, as the [CA Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/educational-materials/fast-facts/vehicle-collisions-ffdl-16/) requires reports of accidents with more than $1,000 in property damage or when another party is injured or killed.

###### How soon can you file a claim after getting insurance?

In some cases, you may be eligible to file a claim the same day your insurance policy was filed, though exceptions may apply. As long as your coverage is active, it does not matter how long you have had the policy, it should still provide a payout. If not, we can help you pursue compensation for your claim.

###### Does insurance go up after a claim?

In many cases, your insurance rate will go up if you are involved in a wreck and file a claim about that accident. However, determining whether it will rise and by how much depends on the claim itself, liability for an accident, and any previous history of accidents. Any of these impacts can have a major effect on your insurance rate.

###### Can insurance deny a claim?

Yes, Geico has the right to deny certain claims. For example, your claim may be rejected if you do not have enough evidence to pursue a settlement, have a lapse in coverage, or are facing policy exclusions. You may also face difficulties with a claim denial and beyond if your insurance company accuses you of fraud, so talk to us about the specifics of your claim.

###### Does Geico cover rental cars?

Yes, Geico offers a rental reimbursement plan that can help you avoid paying out of pocket for a rental car while yours is being repaired. If you need a rental car for these reasons, Geico offers a daily and claim limit, meaning your rental vehicle is covered within that budget. You can also use this coverage with any provider.

## Contact Our Car Accident Lawyers Today for Legal Help with Your Geico Insurance Claim

While Geico is one of the top choices for insurance coverage and one of the most recognizable brands in U.S. auto insurance, remember that this is still a company trying to make a profit. That means you may face issues with your case, including a dispute on your coverage, delays, and even denials. Companies like Geico are focused on protecting their profits, not on protecting your health following a car accident, no matter how minor or severe.

That is why we recommend reviewing any settlement offer you receive with our team at [Crockett Law Group](/reviews/). We offer a detailed review for our clients so that you are always ready if something goes wrong and the company refuses to compensate you properly for your suffering. When you are prepared to reach out to compassionate, dedicated car accident attorneys, give us a call or fill out our [online contact form](/contact-us/) for a free consultation.
