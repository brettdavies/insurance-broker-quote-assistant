# How Does Florida Hurricane Insurance Work? A Guide for Homeowners
In Florida, **hurricane insurance** is not a standalone policy but a combination of coverage options, including[ windstorm damage](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/why-wind-damage-insurance-claims-often-get-denied-in-florida/), flooding, and additional protections under a standard homeowners insurance policy. Because Florida is prone to severe hurricanes, insurance companies break down coverage into several components to protect homeowners from storm damage.
* **Flood Insurance covers damage from flooding caused by** storm surges or heavy rainfall. Standard homeowners’ insurance policies **do not cover flood damage;** this requires a separate flood insurance policy.
In Florida,[ **hurricane deductibles**](https://www.williamspa.com/faq/what-is-a-hurricane-deductible-and-when-does-it-apply/) are a unique feature of homeowners’ insurance policies. The deductible is typically a percentage of your home’s insured value and applies to hurricane-related damage.
If your hurricane insurance claim is delayed, denied, or underpaid, **[hiring an expert Florida insurance claim lawyer](https://www.williamspa.com/faq/can-i-hire-an-insurance-claim-lawyer-before-filing-a-claim/) **can help ensure you receive the full compensation you’re entitled to. An experienced lawyer can assist you with the following:
Additionally, adding flood insurance and reviewing your policy before hurricane season will help you be prepared for any scenario.
