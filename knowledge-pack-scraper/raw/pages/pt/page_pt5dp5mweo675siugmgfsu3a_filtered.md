## **Understanding Hurricane Insurance in Florida: What Homeowners Need to Know**

In Florida, **hurricane insurance** is not a standalone policy but a combination of coverage options, including [windstorm damage](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/why-wind-damage-insurance-claims-often-get-denied-in-florida/), flooding, and additional protections under a standard homeowners insurance policy. Because Florida is prone to severe hurricanes, insurance companies break down coverage into several components to protect homeowners from storm damage.

However, Floridians must know the key differences between regular homeowners’ insurance and the specific hurricane-related coverage.

## **What is Hurricane Insurance in Florida?**

**Hurricane insurance** is not a standalone policy but a combination of coverage options that protect against hurricane-related damage. While your standard homeowner’s insurance policy may cover some aspects of storm damage, it’s essential to understand the specific coverage you need for full protection.

#### Key Components of Hurricane Insurance:

* **Windstorm Coverage**: Protects your home from damage caused by hurricane-force winds, such as broken windows, [roof damage](https://www.williamspa.com/faq/when-storms-cause-damage-up-on-the-roof/), and structural damage.
* **Flood Insurance covers damage from flooding caused by** storm surges or heavy rainfall. Standard homeowners’ insurance policies **do not cover flood damage;** this requires a separate flood insurance policy.
* [**Hurricane Deductible**](https://www.williamspa.com/faq/what-is-a-hurricane-deductible-and-when-does-it-apply/): Florida homeowners insurance policies include a special deductible that applies only to hurricane damage. This deductible is typically higher than the standard and is calculated as a percentage of your home’s insured value.

### **What Does Florida Hurricane Insurance Cover?**

Hurricane insurance in Florida typically covers the following types of damage:

* [**Wind Damage:**](https://www.williamspa.com/practice-areas/insurance-claims/wind-damage/) This includes damage to your roof, siding, windows, and other structural components of your home caused by high winds during a hurricane.
* **[Water Damage](https://www.williamspa.com/practice-areas/insurance-claims/water-damage/) (Not Flooding):** Homeowners’ insurance may cover water damage caused by wind-driven rain entering through damaged areas of your home, such as broken windows or a compromised roof. However, this does not include flooding.
* **Personal Belongings:** Your items, such as furniture, electronics, and clothing, may be covered if they are damaged by wind or rain during a hurricane.

It’s essential to note that **flood damage is not included in standard homeowners’ insurance policies**. To be fully protected, you must purchase a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private insurer.

### **What Hurricane Insurance Doesn’t Cover**

While Florida hurricane insurance provides critical coverage, it does have some limitations. It’s essential to be aware of what it won’t cover:

* **Flood Damage:** As mentioned earlier, [flood damage](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/tips-for-filing-a-successful-insurance-claim-for-flooding/) requires a separate policy. Since hurricanes can cause severe storm surges and flooding, having flood insurance is crucial for Florida homeowners.
* **[Additional Living Expenses](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/additional-living-expenses-for-a-hurricane-claim/):** Depending on your policy, some standard homeowner’s insurance policies may not cover temporary living expenses if your home becomes uninhabitable due to hurricane damage. Check your policy to see if this is included, and consider adding this coverage if necessary
* **Maintenance Issues:** Damage caused by poor maintenance or wear and tear is not covered. If your roof was in bad shape before the storm, any resulting damage may be excluded from coverage.
* **Mold and Water Damage:** While some [water damage](https://www.williamspa.com/practice-areas/insurance-claims/water-damage/) caused by wind-driven rain may be covered, damage caused by gradual leaks or mold is often excluded from hurricane insurance coverage.

### **How Does the Hurricane Deductible Work?**

In Florida, [**hurricane deductibles**](https://www.williamspa.com/faq/what-is-a-hurricane-deductible-and-when-does-it-apply/) are a unique feature of homeowners’ insurance policies. The deductible is typically a percentage of your home’s insured value and applies to hurricane-related damage.

* **Percentage-Based Deductible:** Unlike the flat deductible for other types of damage, hurricane deductibles are usually between **1% and 5%** of the insured value of your home. For example, if your home is insured for $400,000 and your deductible is 2%, you would be responsible for the first $8,000 of hurricane-related repairs.
* **When Does It Apply?** The hurricane deductible applies when the National Weather Service issues a hurricane watch or warning that lasts until the storm has passed. Any damage caused by the hurricane during this period would be subject to the deductible.

### The Importance of Having Flood Insurance in Florida

Because Florida is highly susceptible to storm surges and flash flooding during hurricanes, having a [flood insurance policy](https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/consumers/understanding-insurance/flood-insurance-overview#:~:text=You%20can%20purchase%20flood%20insurance,by%20a%20stand%2Dalone%20policy.) is just as essential as hurricane coverage. Many homeowners mistakenly believe their standard policy will protect them from [flood-related damage](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/most-common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-filing-a-flood-insurance-claim/), but this is not true. Flood insurance is critical if you live in a designated flood zone. Still, it’s also wise for those outside high-risk areas since flooding can occur virtually anywhere during a hurricane.

## **Steps to Take Before Hurricane Season**

1. **Review Your Policy:** [Before hurricane season begins](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/hurricane-preparation-tips-for-florida-homeowners/), you must review your homeowners’ insurance policy to understand your coverage and deductible. Ensure your policy includes adequate coverage for the replacement value of your home and belongings.
2. **Consider Increasing Coverage:** If you’ve upgraded your home or accumulated more valuable personal property, you may consider increasing your coverage limits. It’s also wise to add extra coverage for living expenses if they aren’t already part of your policy.
3. **Purchase Flood Insurance:** If you don’t already have flood insurance, getting it before hurricane season is a good idea. Remember that flood insurance policies often have a 30-day waiting period, so don’t wait until a storm is on the horizon.
4. **Prepare for the Deductible:** Since hurricane deductibles are typically higher than standard deductibles, be sure to have enough savings to cover this cost in the event of a hurricane claim.

## **Filing a Hurricane Insurance Claim in Florida**

After a hurricane, if your home sustains damage, it’s essential to [file your insurance claim](https://www.williamspa.com/blog/why-florida-homeowners-shouldnt-fear-filing-a-hurricane-damage-insurance-claim/) as soon as possible. Follow these steps to make the process smoother:

* **Document the Damage:** Take photos and videos of damage to your home and belongings. This will serve as substantial evidence when filing your claim.
* **Make Temporary Repairs:** Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage if necessary.

**For example,** you may need to place a tarp over a hole in the roof to stop rain from entering your home. Keep receipts for any expenses incurred for these temporary fixes, as they may be reimbursable.
