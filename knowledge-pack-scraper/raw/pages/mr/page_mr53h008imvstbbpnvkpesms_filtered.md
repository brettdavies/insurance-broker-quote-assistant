## Cheapest car insurance for military families in Iowa

If you're an active member of the military or a veteran — or have an immediate family member who is — chances are you'll get a relatively cheap rate with USAA, a company that isn't available to the general public.

Because of that restriction, USAA isn't ranked with the others, but it was among the cheapest three auto insurance options for 56 of the 70 driver profiles we examined.

## Minimum required auto insurance in Iowa

Iowa drivers must carry liability insurance with the following minimum limits:

* $20,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $40,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
* $15,000 property damage liability per accident.

If you're ever found at fault in a crash, liability insurance kicks in to help cover others' property damage and injury bills. Since any damage that exceeds your insurance limits will have to come out of your own pocket, it's usually wise to purchase more than the legally required minimum. You may also want to consider common optional coverages such as collision, comprehensive and uninsured motorist insurance.

#### METHODOLOGY

For our “good driver” profile, NerdWallet averaged insurance estimates for single male and female drivers with good credit and no tickets or violations. The analysis included 5-10 of the largest insurance companies in each state; smaller insurers were also included when rates were available. Liberty Mutual and its subsidiaries were excluded from our analysis as rates were not available.

For full coverage policies, we used the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist coverage per accident.
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible.

In states where required, minimum additional coverages were added. Some policies include additional coverages at the insurer’s discretion.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE for all drivers and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven.

We analyzed rates for drivers 20 to 70 years old in 10-year increments. For the average cost of full and minimum coverage in each state, we looked at 35-year-old drivers.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* For drivers with minimum coverage, we adjusted the numbers above to reflect the minimum required coverage by law in the state.
* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit.
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.

We looked at 35-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company overall, the cheapest company for minimum coverage and the cheapest company for drivers with poor credit in states where credit history is used to price rates. We looked at 20-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company for young drivers.

These are rates generated through Quadrant Information Services. Your own rates will be different. Some insurance companies included in this article may have made changes in their underwriting practices and no longer issue new policies in your state.
