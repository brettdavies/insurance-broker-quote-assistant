## North Carolina car insurance rates by city

Car insurance rates [vary by state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/); they can also vary by city. This is why figuring out how much car insurance is in North Carolina requires more information than just your vehicle make and model. For example, Fayetteville and Charlotte’s average annual full coverage premiums are slightly higher than the state average.

[Larger cities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-city/) tend to have higher insurance costs for a few reasons. Higher medical care costs may increase bodily injury liability payouts, and higher costs for vehicle repairs and labor may increase property damage liability, comprehensive coverage and collision coverage payouts. Additionally, larger cities tend to have more traffic, which could lead to a higher likelihood of accidents. In contrast, if you reside in a ZIP code with few vehicle thefts and accident claims, you may be able to take advantage of lower-than-average rates.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in North Carolina

Car insurance rates [vary by age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) in most states, including North Carolina, with younger drivers usually paying more for coverage due to a higher likelihood of accidents and subsequent claims. Recognizing and responding to sudden road hazards is a learned skill that takes time to develop, which is why [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) who lack driving experience typically face the highest insurance rates.

In most cases, young drivers can save money by staying on their parents’ policies as additional drivers for as long as possible. Premiums generally decrease with age but may begin to increase again when drivers reach their senior years. In some states, male drivers see higher average rates than female drivers, but [North Carolina car insurance laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/north-carolina-car-insurance-laws/) do not allow the use of gender as an insurance rating factor.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Insurance rates are based on risk and statistical data. Historically, men tend to have riskier driving behavior than women. In fact, [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females) data reveal that men are less likely to wear a seat belt and more likely to drive while intoxicated and speed. Males tend to average more miles on the road per year than their female counterparts, as well. However, North Carolina, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania prohibit the use of gender as a rating factor when pricing policies.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in North Carolina

If a young driver is still living in their parents’ household, it’s usually cheaper to keep that driver listed on their parents’ policy. By staying on their parents’ policy, new drivers get the fiscal benefit of having more experienced drivers on the policy to keep the cost lower. You can see from the rates here that the newest drivers — those who are 16 and 17 years old — pay the highest average rates. Premiums may start to lower after just one year of driving experience, provided the young driver maintains a clean driving record.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in North Carolina?

Safe drivers usually enjoy the cheapest car insurance. Policyholders who are caught [driving without insurance in North Carolina](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/) or who have driving incidents on their records may be viewed as [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/), which often results in higher premiums. The severity of the infraction, other marks on your record and the insurance company you choose can all affect how much car insurance is in NC. A driving under the influence (DUI) conviction has the most significant impact on your premiums in North Carolina. The table here provides an overview of the average annual premium increase for a North Carolina policyholder with a single speeding ticket, accident or DUI on their record.

## Car insurance rates in North Carolina by credit

Another major factor that may contribute to your [car insurance rate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-calculator/) is your credit. In most states, major auto carriers will use credit-based insurance scores as an insurance rating factor, with drivers with better credit paying lower premiums, on average.

## How to save on car insurance in North Carolina

Generally, North Carolina car insurance is cheaper than comparable coverage in many other states. However, there are still ways to potentially shave more money off your premium.

* **Shop around:** Each car insurance company calculates rates in a slightly different way, which is why your insurance premium can vary from company to company. In order to find the lowest possible premium, it may help to [request quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) from several companies. Specify the same coverage types, policy limits and deductibles in order to do an apples-to-apples comparison.
* **Bundle your policies:**[Bundling your auto and home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) with the same company usually makes you eligible for a multi-policy discount. This is generally one of the most significant discounts you can get. Some companies offer a bundling discount for auto and renters, condo, mobile home or life insurance, if you don’t own a home, though the discount may be less.
* **Maintain a clean driving record:** Drivers with incidents like tickets, at-fault accidents and DUI convictions pay quite a bit more for car insurance coverage, on average. Practicing safe driving habits may help you avoid these costly surcharges. You could save even more by allowing your insurer to track your driving behaviors through a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/).
* **Look for discounts:** In addition to bundling, most car insurance companies offer at least a handful of [discount opportunities](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). Some of the most common include multi-car, paperless billing and claims-free discounts.

Keep in mind that North Carolina prohibits many common discounts, though. One example is the good student discount. The state also doesn’t allow insurers to offer programs that have the potential to raise a policyholder’s premium (like some telematics programs).

To ensure you’re taking advantage of the discounts that are available, talk to your agent or a representative from your company.

  Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

* ### Age:

  Caret Down Icon 

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
