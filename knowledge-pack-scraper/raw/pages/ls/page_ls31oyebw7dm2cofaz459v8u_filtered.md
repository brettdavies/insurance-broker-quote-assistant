## Geico Insurance Coverage Options

[Does Geico offer gap insurance?](https://www.autoinsurance.org/does-geico-offer-gap-insurance/ "Does Geico offer gap insurance? (2024)") Unfortunately, one of Geico’s biggest failings is its lack of key policy options, including gap insurance for auto loans.

> Geico new car insurance isn’t the best option if you’re financing or leasing a vehicle as it won’t cover what you owe if the car is totaled in an accident or collision.

However, you can buy all the coverage you need to meet your state requirements from Geico, including:

* **[Liability Auto Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/cheapest-liability-only-auto-insurance/)**: Liability insurance is required in most states and ensures you can pay for damage you cause in an accident. There are two parts to liability insurance: bodily injury and property damage.
* **[Collision Auto Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-is-collision-insurance/)**: Liability doesn’t cover damage to your car — for that, you’ll need collision insurance. Collision insurance helps repair your vehicle after an accident, even if you’re at fault.
* **[Comprehensive Auto Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/comprehensive-auto-insurance/)**: Your car can get damaged in a lot of ways outside of accidents. Comprehensive insurance protects against weather, vandalism, animal contact, theft, and fire damage.
* **[Personal Injury Protection (PIP)](https://www.autoinsurance.org/personal-injury-protection-insurance/)**: Personal injury protection helps pay for medical bills, lost wages, and other related health care expenses if you get injured in an accident.
* **[Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-uninsured-and-underinsured-motorist-coverage/)**: Most states require drivers to carry a minimum amount of insurance, but not everyone follows the law. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage protects you against drivers with inadequate or no insurance and hit-and-runs.
* **[Emergency Roadside Assistance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-roadside-assistance-plans/ "Roadside Assistance Coverage (2024)")**: If you find yourself stranded on the side of the road, Geico’s roadside assistance helps with battery jumps, tire changes, fuel delivery, and other related issues.
* **[Rental Car Reimbursement](https://www.autoinsurance.org/rental-car-reimbursement/)**: Although Geico promises fast claims resolution, your car might get stuck in the shop after an accident. Geico will cover a rental car from Enterprise or reimburse you if you go elsewhere.

The coverage you need depends on various factors. For example, if you own an older car outright and need to keep your payment low, your state’s minimum requirement is probably all you need. Full coverage — including liability, comprehensive, collision, uninsured motorist, and PIP — is typically required if you have a car loan or lease.

![Geico Auto Insurance Review: Full Coverage Insurance](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Geico Auto Insurance Review: Full Coverage Insurance")![Geico Auto Insurance Review: Full Coverage Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Full-Coverage-Insurance-Def-Card-1.png "Geico Auto Insurance Review: Full Coverage Insurance")

Another factor you should consider is your location. For example, it might be best to add comprehensive insurance to your plan if you live in a rural area. If you have Geico and hit a deer, you can only file a claim with comprehensive coverage.

Don’t worry about figuring out which insurance you need by yourself — if you’re not entirely sure, call the 1-800 number for Geico customer service (1-800-270-7847).

### Geico DriveEasy Review

The average American drives more than 13,000 miles annually, but many people now work from home or cut back on their drive time. So it doesn’t seem fair to pay for a full insurance policy when you’re not driving as many miles.

To meet the needs of low-mileage drivers, Geico offers the DriveEasy program. DriveEasy is a monitoring program that rewards you for good driving behavior and low mileage. It’s available in 25 states plus Washington, D.C. Read our [Geico DriveEasy review](https://www.autoinsurance.org/geico-driveeasy-review/) to see if it’s available in your state.

![Geico Auto Insurance Review: Geico DriveEasy Site Screenshot](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201896%20905'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Geico Auto Insurance Review: Geico DriveEasy Site Screenshot")![Geico Auto Insurance Review: Geico DriveEasy Site Screenshot](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/geico-2.png "Geico Auto Insurance Review: Geico DriveEasy Site Screenshot")

The DriveEasy program monitors you through the Geico app and looks at the following while you drive:

* Phone use
* Hard braking
* Rapid acceleration
* Mileage
* Sharp turns
* Time of day

Safe drivers can save up to 25% on their Geico insurance quote simply by using DriveEasy. However, drivers who engage in poor behaviors might see their rates increase.

### Other Geico Auto Insurance Options

Does Geico have accident forgiveness? Yes, Geico offers accident forgiveness to loyal, claim-free customers. It also has a few other options for car insurance, all of which can add policy value and increase your car’s protection:

* **[Rideshare Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-rideshare-auto-insurance/)**: Geico rideshare insurance is a hybrid policy replacing your traditional plan. Whether running errands or driving for a rideshare company, your hybrid policy covers you.
* **[Mechanical Breakdown Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/mechanical-breakdown-insurance/)**: Mechanical breakdown coverage pays for repairs if your car suffers mechanical issues. It doesn’t cover routine wear and tear, so check before filing a claim.
* **[Classic Car Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/classic-car-insurance/)**: If you have a vintage vehicle, you need special classic car insurance to protect it. Geico classic car insurance reviews show it offers agreed value and spare parts coverage.
* **[Mexican Auto Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-auto-insurance-when-traveling-to-mexico/)**: American car insurance doesn’t work in Mexico. Geico Mexico insurance will cover your car if you’re planning a trip south of the border.
* **[Accident Forgiveness](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-is-accident-forgiveness/)**: There are two ways to get Geico accident forgiveness: by buying it or earning it for being a safe driver and loyal Geico customer.

Aside from additional products, Geico also offers policyholders an easy-to-use app, 24/7 access to claims handling and tracking, and representatives always ready to help you.

* **Increase Your Deductible:**A [car insurance deductible](https://www.autoinsurance.org/auto-insurance-deductibles/) is the amount you must pay before insurance kicks in. The higher your deductible, the lower your rates. However, don’t increase it to an amount you can’t afford to pay.
* **Drive Safely:**Generally, insurers reward safe drivers with lower rates and additional savings. Avoid traffic violations and accidents to get cheaper premiums (Learn More: [Best Auto Insurance for Good Drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.org/best-auto-insurance-for-good-drivers/)).
