For drivers with [very poor credit](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-bad-credit-drivers/), GEICO could be the best option for you. Typically, GEICO offers more affordable premiums than USAA for drivers with credit scores of 579 or less. But for those with Fair to Exceptional credit, our data indicate that USAA would be a more affordable option. View common insurance costs by credit tier for GEICO and USAA:

If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA could be a better choice than GEICO. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA before GEICO: USAA offers average yearly savings of $644, compared to GEICO. USAA was also cheapest for drivers of all ages.
