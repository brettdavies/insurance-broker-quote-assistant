What our customers say 
[Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ticketschool.com)
### Commonly Asked Questions 
####  [ How long is the course?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse1)
Per New York DMV requirements, the course must be six hours in length. The course contains page timers to ensure that the proper amount of time is spent. You can log in and out of the course as your schedule requires from any internet-enabled device and our site will automatically save your progress.
####  [ What tests do I have to take?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse2)
The course will have a short multiple-choice quiz at the end of each unit that must be passed with a score of 80% or higher. We DO NOT have a final exam. This design allows you to answer the course questions while the content is fresh on your mind.
####  [ How does the course work?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse3)
You will register for the course and receive a course login code that you can use to log in and out of the course. You have 30 days from the date you register to complete the course. That is a DMV rule. You will move through each of the 6 units in the course. You can log out from any page in the course and our system automatically saves the furthest unit and page you have reached so that you can pick back up when ready. After you pass the last unit quiz and complete a short survey, your course will be complete and we will process a certificate of completion and send it to you via the delivery method chosen. GEICO will also automatically apply the discount to your policy and send you an email confirmation.
####  [ Can I take this course for a ticket?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse4)
No. This course should only be taken if you are seeking an insurance discount, and you have a GEICO auto insurance policy. You will also receive a point reduction benefit if eligible with the NY DMV. 
####  [ How can I contact you?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse5)
We are available from 8AM to 6PM EST Monday through Saturday at 1-800-558-9887. If you have any questions. You can also email us at info@ticketschool.com
### Geico Specific Questions 
####  [ What if I am not a GEICO customer?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse6)
The course registration available on this page is at a special discounted price for GEICO auto insurance customers only and requires your GEICO policy number. If your auto policy is with another carrier, then you will need to go through the standard New York course registration [here](https://ticketschool.com/courses/new-york-defensive-driving-online/)
####  [ How long is the discount good for?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse7)
The discount for completing a New York defensive driving course is good for three (3) years. After the three years is up, you are eligible to complete the course again to continue receiving the discount. 
####  [ Can my family take the course too?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse8)
The course can be taken by any GEICO insured who is the primary driver of a vehicle on a policy and meets the age requirement. Check [here](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/defensive-driver-discounts/?hl=en&base_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geico.com%2F&trafficType=GEICO) for further eligibility details. 
####  [ How much money will I save?](https://ticketschool.com/courses/geico-ny/#collapse9)
In New York, state law requires a 10% discount be applied to the base of the collision and comprehensive portion of your GEICO policy. The exact amount of your discount will depend on the details of your policy, but for some customers it can range between $900-$1500 over the three years.
