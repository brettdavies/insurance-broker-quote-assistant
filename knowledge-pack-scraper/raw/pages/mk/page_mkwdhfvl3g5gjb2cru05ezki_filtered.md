Customer rep said it was not due to any demographic, car details or fault of my own. He first claimed the hike was in part to increased bodily injury minimums from 15/30 up to 30/60 in California, but mine was already 50/100, so rep conceded no impact. Then rep stated price hike was due to the cost of car parts inflation etc, but the hike is 10% vs 2.4% last 12 months. Anyone else seeing this? Will this actually ever come down if said inflationary impacts subside?
