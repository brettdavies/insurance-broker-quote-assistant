When your driver’s license has been suspended or revoked in Illinois, the process of getting it reinstated can feel overwhelming. A critical step in this process is obtaining SR-22 insurance. Understanding what an SR-22 is and how to get it will help you move forward with confidence.

SR-22 is not a type of car insurance policy. Instead, it is a certificate that your insurance company files with the Illinois Secretary of State to prove that you have the state’s required minimum auto liability coverage. Without this proof of financial responsibility, you will not be able to legally drive again.

## 

## Who Needs an SR-22 in Illinois?

An [SR-22](https://www.cheapinsurance.com/sr22-insurance/) is typically required if your license has been suspended or revoked due to a serious traffic violation. Common reasons include:

* Driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI).
* Being at-fault in an accident without insurance.
* Accumulating [multiple traffic violations](https://www.isba.org/public/guide/illinoistrafficcourts#:~:text=For%20any%20Illinois%20license%20holder,trigger%20a%20suspension%20or%20revocation.) in a short period.
* Driving with a suspended or revoked license.
* Failing to pay court judgments or child support.
* Evading highway tolls.

## Understanding Illinois’ Minimum Coverage Requirements

All drivers in Illinois are required to carry minimum liability insurance. An SR-22 filing proves that you meet or exceed these coverage limits.

The required minimums are:

* **$25,000** for bodily injury liability per person.
* **$50,000** for bodily injury liability per accident.
* **$20,000** for property damage liability per accident.
* **$25,000** for uninsured motorist bodily injury per person.
* **$50,000** for uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident.

## Types of SR-22 Insurance

The type of SR-22 you need depends on whether you own a vehicle and how you plan to use it.

* **Owner SR-22:** This applies to drivers who own a vehicle or plan to buy one. It covers your own car and is the most common type.
* **Non-owner SR-22:** This is for drivers who do not own a car and do not live with someone who does. It provides liability coverage when you drive vehicles you do not own, such as rentals or borrowed cars. This is typically the least expensive option.
* **Owner and Operator SR-22:** This is for drivers who own one or more vehicles but also regularly drive vehicles they do not own. It offers the most flexibility.

## The Process and Costs of Getting an SR-22

The process of getting an SR-22 begins only after you have completed all court-ordered requirements from your violation.

1. **Fulfill all legal obligations:** Pay all fines and penalties, complete community service, and attend any required [court ordered DUI programs](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcohol/rehab-treatment/dui).
2. **Find an insurer:** You must find an insurance company that offers SR-22 filings in Illinois. Not all insurers do.
3. **Purchase a policy:** Buy a policy that meets the state’s minimum liability requirements.
4. **Have your insurer file the form:** Your insurer will file the SR-22 form electronically with the Illinois Secretary of State. This usually involves a one-time filing fee of $25 to $50.

The biggest cost associated with an SR-22 is the increase in your insurance premiums. Since insurance companies will classify you as a high-risk driver, your rates will be significantly higher for the duration of the requirement. 

## 

## SR-22 Duration and Penalties for Lapses

In most cases, you must maintain your SR-22 filing for three years. More severe or repeated violations may require a longer period.

If you fail to maintain continuous SR-22 coverage, your insurer is required by law to notify the state. This will immediately lead to the suspension of your license and registration, and you will have to restart the reinstatement process. The clock on your three-year requirement will also reset.

## Frequently Asked Questions: SR-22 Insurance in Illinois

**How long do I need to maintain an SR-22 in Illinois?**

The Illinois Secretary of State typically requires the SR-22 Certificate of Financial Responsibility to be maintained for a minimum of three continuous years (36 months). A single lapse in coverage, even for one day, will require the driver to re-file the SR-22 and may cause the three-year period to restart from the beginning.

**What are the minimum liability coverage limits required with an Illinois SR-22?**

Drivers with an SR-22 in Illinois must adhere to the state's minimum liability limits (often referred to as 25/50/20): $25,000 for bodily injury per person, $50,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $20,000 for property damage per accident. Uninsured motorist coverage of 25/50 is also required.

**Can I get an SR-22 filing if I do not own a car in Illinois?**

Yes. If you are required to file an SR-22 but do not own a vehicle, you can purchase a Non-Owner SR-22 insurance policy. This is a certificate of financial responsibility that covers your liability when driving a borrowed or rented car, and is often the cheapest way to satisfy the state's filing requirement for license reinstatement.
