If you’re a California homeowner living in a wildfire-prone area, chances are you’ve heard of the California FAIR Plan, or you’ve been forced to consider it after your private insurer backed out. Between 2019 and 2024, FAIR Plan policies surged by over 164%, jumping from 126,709 to more than 334,000 policies.
(Source:[ California Department of Insurance (CDI](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/)))
With record-breaking wildfires and growing insurance pullouts from top providers like [State Farm](https://www.agencyheight.com/insurance-reviews/statefarm-insurance-reviews/) and [Allstate](https://www.agencyheight.com/insurance-reviews/allstate-insurance-review/), tens of thousands of residents are turning to this last-resort coverage. But what exactly is the FAIR Plan, what does it cover, and how can it work in your favor?
This guide cuts through the confusion, exposes the fine print, and helps you make a smart, informed decision, without getting burned.
![California FAIR Plan for Homeowners](https://www.agencyheight.com/wp-content/uploads/California-FAIR-Plan-for-Homeowners.jpg)
## What Is the California FAIR Plan?
The California FAIR Plan (short for Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) is a state-mandated insurance program created to provide basic fire coverage to homeowners who can’t find insurance through the traditional market.
It’s not a government-funded plan. It’s a pool of all licensed property insurers in California, who are legally required to fund it and share the risk.
### **Why Was It Created?**
Back in August 1968, [California faced a property-insurance crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_FAIR_Plan) following urban unrest and wildfire losses. Lawmakers amended the Insurance Code (Section 10090 et seq.), creating the FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) Plan to ensure every homeowner could get basic fire coverage, regardless of risk level. Today, it remains a vital safety net for those denied coverage in the private market.
### **How It’s Funded Today (Private Carriers Pool)?**
* **Insurance company pool:** Every [insurer licensed](https://www.agencyheight.com/insurance-license/) in California participates and shares profits and losses proportional to their market share
* **No taxpayer funding:** It operates independently—the government oversees but doesn’t bankroll it.
* **Reinsurance and assessments:** The Plan maintains reinsurance (about $5.75 B) but can tap private insurers via assessments in catastrophic events
* **Current financial exposure:** As of early 2025, it’s protecting over 550,000 homes, double since 2020, while facing exposure of over $4–4.8 B versus only ~$377–458 M in reserves.
### **Who Oversees the FAIR Plan? Role of State Commissioner.**
* **Regulatory oversight:** The [California Department of Insurance (CDI)](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/California-FAIR-Plan.cfm/), led by Commissioner Ricardo Lara, regulates rates, policy structure, solvency, and transparency
* **Modernization push:** Since 2019, Lara has driven reforms, doubling residential limits to [$3 M, launching $20 M commercial limits](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release031-2024.cfm), enforcing reporting standards, requiring wildfire-hardening discounts, and improving financial safeguards
* **Enforces financial discipline:** CDI can approve assessments, require plan transparency (board composition, finances), and intervene to protect policyholders.
## Who Qualifies for the FAIR Plan?
The California FAIR Plan isn’t for everyone. It’s considered a last resort policy. You qualify if:
* You’ve been denied coverage by at least one admitted carrier, or
* You live in a high wildfire risk area where no insurer will write a policy for you.
* You don’t have to be low-income. Everyone uses FAIR Plan policies from middle-class families in the foothills to wealthy homeowners in Malibu.
## Who Isn’t Eligible for the California FAIR Plan?
Not every property qualifies for FAIR Plan coverage. Here are situations where your application may be denied:
* **Long-term vacant homes** — Properties left unoccupied for more than half the year typically don’t qualify.
* **Homes with unresolved damage** — If your property has existing, unrepaired structural issues, coverage may be denied.
* **Illegal property use** — Any home involved in activities that violate state or federal laws is automatically disqualified.
## Why Have Policyholders Turning to It?
More and more homeowners in high-risk zones are choosing the FAIR Plan because private insurers are backing away, and wildfire risk is becoming too costly to ignore.
### **Private Insurers Pulling Out of High‑Risk Zones**
Major carriers like State Farm, [Farmers](https://www.agencyheight.com/insurance-reviews/farmers-insurance-reviews/), and Allstate have repeatedly stopped writing or renewing homeowner policies in California due to the escalating risk of wildfires, rising construction costs, and increasing catastrophe exposure
In exclusive fire zones like the Pacific Palisades, an LA Chronicle study shows State Farm covers just ~20% of homes, while the FAIR Plan steps in with about 16%, up from around 5% statewide.
### **Year‑over‑Year Policy Surge (+164% from 2019–2024)**
California FAIR Plan policies skyrocketed by an astonishing 164% between Sept 2019 and June 2024, jumping from roughly 127,000 to over 334,000 in-force policies.
That means hundreds of thousands of homeowners, especially in wildfire-affected zones, now rely on this essential safety net.
### **Market Share in Wildfire Areas (20%+ vs ~2.5% Statewide)**
While FAIR Plan policies only make up about 2.5% of California’s total homeowner insurance market, in the highest-risk ZIP codes, that share soars to 20% or more.
The shift shows just how much the private market is retreating from risky areas. The FAIR Plan has effectively become the default insurer where others won’t go.
## What Does the FAIR Plan Cover?
The FAIR Plan offers basic fire insurance and a few other limited protections. Here’s what you’re getting:
#### **Standard Coverage Includes:**
* Fire & Smoke Damage
* Lightning
* Internal Explosions
* Vandalism & Malicious Mischief
* Riot or Civil Commotion
These are known as perils. If it’s not named, it’s not covered.
You can also get optional coverage like:
* Dwelling Replacement Costs
* Contents Coverage (for your belongings)
* Fair Rental Value (if you’re a landlord)
The maximum dwelling limit is currently $3 million, increased from $1.5 million in 2020 after pressure from regulators and homeowners.
## Cost & Premium Trends
Homeowners on the FAIR Plan typically pay around $3,200 per year—more than double the average private policy in California—driven by wildfire risk, location, and claims history.
#### **Avg Premium ~$3,200/year vs. ~$1,429 Private**
On average, FAIR Plan policies cost around $3,200 annually, whereas a standard homeowner’s policy in California runs about $1,429/year for similar dwelling coverage ($300,000).
In some high-risk areas, combined FAIR + DIC premiums can climb to $5,000–$6,000 annually, as [reported by homeowners near Tahoe and San Diego.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/1crfoxo/fair_plan_premiums/)
### **Risk-Based Pricing Drivers (Wildfire Risk, Location, Claims History)**
Premiums are influenced by several key risk factors:
* **Wildfire risk zone:** Properties in “Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones” can see FAIR Plan-only premiums reach $2,500–$3,800/year; adding DIC pushes totals higher.
* **Proximity to fire protection infrastructure:** Being close to a fire station or low low-hazard zone may reduce your risk.
* **Claims history:** Before losses, even old ones, drive rates up sharply under FAIR’s risk-based underwriting.
* **Reinsurance & inflation:** Rising reinsurance costs and construction inflation have forced the FAIR Plan to file multiple rate increases—up to 15% approved in late 2023, with some homeowners bracing for 15–33% more in early 2025.
* **State assessments:** FAIR imposed a $1 billion assessment on member insurers after the early 2025 California wildfires. Member insurers may pass on half of the assessment to policyholders as temporary surcharges.
FAIR Plan premiums average about $3,200/year—more than twice the state average, because wildfire risk, location, claims history, and rising reinsurance costs all drive policyholder rates.
## Recent Developments & Legal Shifts
In 2025, California’s FAIR Plan faced pivotal changes, from court rulings reshaping smoke-damage claims to transparency mandates and a groundbreaking $1 billion assessment, all signaling a turning point in consumer protection.
#### **Smoke‑Damage “Sight & Smell” Test Removed in June 2025 After Lawsuit**
[A Los Angeles Superior Court judge](https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-smoke-damage-fair-plan-insurance-f9d6d781b3d897884dc23432b38100fa) ruled in June 2025 that the FAIR Plan’s policy requiring smoke damage to be visible or smellable was illegal. It contradicted California law which demands coverage for all fire-related losses, even those detectable only by lab tests. FAIR Plan officials confirmed this “sight and smell” requirement was removed in June 2024, and they’re updating policy language with CDI oversight.
#### **Transparency Reforms – More Reporting, Board Disclosures**
Following a CBS News investigation revealing that FAIR Plan’s board meetings, minutes, and reinsurance details were secret, Commissioner Lara stepped in. As of July 1, 2025, the FAIR Plan must now publish its financials, board roster, meeting minutes, reinsurance structure, and cash distribution history.
#### **Financial Strain After 2025 Fires, Exposures Up to $5 B and Reinsurance Gap**
Following the Palisades and Eaton wildfires, the FAIR Plan’s wildfire exposure hit nearly $5 billion, while its reinsurance coverage stood at about $5.78 billion. However, actual liquid reserves were only about $377 million, leaving a large gap if multiple claims and high reinsurance deductibles overlap.
#### **$1 B Assessment, Cost Possibly Passed to Californians**
In early 2025, the CDI approved a $1 billion assessment on member insurers to shore up FAIR Plan solvency after the wildfire crisis. Insurers may pass up to 50% of that on to homeowners via a temporary supplemental fee, and if assessments exceed $1 billion a year, up to 100% of the remaining portion can be recouped. Critics warn these surcharges could raise homeowners’ premiums across the board
##  Pros & Cons of FAIR Plan

Limited perils - no theft, water damage, or liability coverage
*![](https://agencyheight.com/wp-content/themes/agencyheight/images/cons.svg)
Not all mortgage lenders accept it as stand-alone coverage
## How to Get California FAIR Plan Insurance?
Getting FAIR Plan coverage is simple if you follow these steps:
* **Check Eligibility:** You must prove you’ve been denied by at least two standard insurers. An agent or broker can help confirm this.
* **Work with an Agent:** A licensed insurance professional can help you find the right FAIR Plan coverage for your property.
* **Choose Your Coverage:** FAIR Plan offers basic fire protection. You may need to add separate policies for theft, liability, or earthquakes.
* **Apply & Submit Details:** Complete the application with your home info, desired deductible, and mortgage details.
* **Pay the Premium:** Expect higher rates than traditional home insurance, especially in high-risk areas.
* **Keep Exploring Options:** After securing FAIR Plan coverage, continue shopping for a regular policy to lower costs or expand coverage.
## Conclusion
The California FAIR Plan is a critical but limited safety net, not a full replacement for traditional homeowners’ insurance. It protects those in high-risk wildfire zones whom private insurers have dropped. Insurance companies offer narrow “named peril” coverage. They cap dwelling limits. They exclude liability or water protection without a DIC policy. Homeowners should view it as a temporary solution.
Homeowners should stay proactive: invest in wildfire mitigation, review coverage annually, and watch for policy or legal reforms. Use the FAIR Plan wisely, but always aim to return to full private coverage when possible.
