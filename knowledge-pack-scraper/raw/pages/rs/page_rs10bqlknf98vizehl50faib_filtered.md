## What is State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save?

State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save is an insurance program that monitors your driving habits to help you save on car insurance. State Farm says safe drivers can save up to 30% on their insurance rates.

It is a usage-based program that relies on telematics. A State Farm app collects data on how you drive.  
State Farm isn’t alone. Many other insurance companies also use telematics to give [discounts to good drivers](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/good-driver-discount.aspx).

## Drive Safe & Save: How it works

The program is optional. Customers who want to join download the Drive Safe & Save app to their smartphone. They then log in with their driver’s license information or their State Farm user ID and password.

The company then mails the small Bluetooth beacon and instructions. The company suggests attaching the beacon to your windshield. State Farm has more information about the setup on its website and has posted a [setup video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cO7HxzGRxg).

### Enrollment process

The process starts by opening the State Farm mobile app. From there, you’ll log in and make any necessary updates to your phone settings to record your trips.

### Technology and tools

Drivers interested in the program must use a smartphone that’s able to support the State Farm mobile app. After you enroll in the program, State Farm will send you a beacon to install in your vehicle. This beacon gathers information for State Farm to use when determining how safely you drive.

### How the Drive Safe & Save app calculator driving scores

The Drive Safe & Safe program takes several factors into account when determining your safe driving score. Generally, safe drivers avoid the following actions:

* **Quick acceleration:** If you speed up too quickly on a regular basis, this could be a red flag.
* **Hard braking:** Abrupt braking frequently usually hurts your score.
* **Fast cornering:** Taking turns too fast often hurts your score.
* **Speeding:** If you break the speed limit, State Farm takes this into account.
* **Distracted driving:** If you use your phone while driving, you’ll likely see your score tank.

A safer driving score will lead to a better discount.

### Who is eligible for this insurance program?

Drivers with a State Farm auto insurance policy are eligible to sign up for the Drive Safe & Save program.

## Is Drive Safe & Save worth it?

“If you’re a safe, low-mileage driver who avoids risky behaviors like hard braking, rapid acceleration or late-night driving, signing up for a telematics program makes sense,” says Nick Schrader, owner of Texas General Insurance.

However, it won’t be as beneficial for careless drivers who speed or are heavy on the brake. Still, State Farm will not increase your insurance rates for using their Drive Save & Save program.

## Pros and cons of State Farm’s Drive Safe and Save program

Before signing up, consider the following advantages and disadvantages:

Let’s start with the pros:

* **Potential savings on car insurance coverage:** You might see lower premiums if you have safe driving habits.
* **Monitor your driving:** You can see how your driving stacks up against State Farm’s metrics in the mobile app. This might give you a chance to adjust your habits to maximize savings.

Now for the cons:

* **Tracking:** State Farm will track your driving behaviors and location. Although it won’t share this information, it’s still collected.
* **Physical device in your vehicle:** Although the beacon isn’t large, it’s another item taking up space in your car.

### Helpful tips to maximize your savings

If you want to make the most of the Drive Safe & Save program, use the following tips:

* **Stay off your phone:** Don’t pick up your phone when you are behind the wheel.
* **Take it slow:** Avoiding speeding and fast accelerations will help you maintain a better driving score.
* **Watch the road:** Try to anticipate the need to slow down to avoid the need to apply the brakes too hard.

## Drive Safe & Save: Some important things to note

Enrollment is free. However, State Farm warns that the program is partly based on miles driven, and rates for people already enrolled in low-mileage programs could see their premiums increase if they drive more than 7,500 miles.

“If you currently receive a premium reduction for low estimated annual mileage (under 7,500 miles annually for personal use) and your vehicle is actually driven more than that, your premium may increase at a future policy renewal period,” the company’s website states.

## A look at the broader pay-as-you-drive insurance landscape

Beyond State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save, several other insurers also offer pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) programs. They include:

* American Family’s DriveMyWay
* Progressive’s Snapshot
* Allstate’s Drivewise
* The Hartford’s TrueLane
* Travelers’ IntelliDrive
* Esurance’s DriveSense
* Safeco’s RightTrack

No matter which PAYD program you consider, make sure you read the fine print to learn all the details about how it works.
