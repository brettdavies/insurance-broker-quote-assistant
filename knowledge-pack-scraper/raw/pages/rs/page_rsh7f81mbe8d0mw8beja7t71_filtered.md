The main Geico NAIC number is 22063. Geico's NAIC number is the five-digit code given by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which assigns numbers to authorized insurance providers in order to track customer complaints and ethics violations across state lines.

With Geico's NAIC number, anyone can learn more about the company’s financial data, the kinds of complaints that have been filed by customers, and any enforcement actions taken against the company. Customers will need Geico's NAIC number to report fraud or file an insurance claim, as well.

Although the main Geico NAIC number is 22063, the NAIC has assigned a separate code for each of Geico's affiliate companies, which are listed below. You can find the number that applies to your particular policy on your Geico insurance card.
