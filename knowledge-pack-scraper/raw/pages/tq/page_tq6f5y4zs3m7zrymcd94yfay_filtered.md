Homeowners insurance rates vary widely from state to state, even city to city. Currently, the average national homeowners insurance rate is **$1,915 a year for $300,000 worth of dwelling coverage**.(2) In 2023, the average premium was around $1,700. There is little hope that rates will go down in the near future, unless there are fewer severe storms and wildfires.

While most states have seen an increase in homeowners insurance rates, not all states have been hit very hard. Those who live in low-crime areas that are not much affected by extreme weather or wildfires will see a less dramatic increase in 2025, maybe less than 4%.

Vermont currently has the lowest average homeowners insurance rate of $918 and Florida residents pay the most at an average of $11,000 a year.(7)

In 2024, insurance companies raised California homeowners insurance rates by 20%, largely due to unexpected losses caused by severe wildfires. This came as no surprise, seeing that home insurance rates have gone up, on average, around 27% in many parts of the country.(1)

Florida also experienced the same fate because it was hit hard by severe weather, lawsuits and insurance fraud. Other states also lost insurers due to heavy losses.

See how your state will fare in 2025.

## Will Homeowners Insurance Go Down in 2025?

In 2023, home insurance rates went up 11.3% across the country, and 20% in Texas, Arizona and Utah. Some states were spared, namely Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi and Vermont, who saw increases of 4% or less.(9)

In 2024, property and casualty insurance prices went up again for both [car insurance](https://smartfinancial.com/state-of-car-insurance) and [homeowners insurance](https://smartfinancial.com/how-does-home-insurance-work). Some experts predicted that prices would level off towards the end of year, but continuing severe storms and wildfires caused more rate hikes in many parts of the country.

In 2025, insurers will still be catching up on COVID-era losses and shortages, and new catastrophes caused insurance companies to leave some states altogether. The current and previous years’ losses are largely related to [wildfires](https://smartfinancial.com/wildfires-and-your-insurance), [floods](https://smartfinancial.com/how-much-does-flood-insurance-cost) and other forms of [extreme weather](https://smartfinancial.com/natural-disasters-statistics).

Even though interest rates dropped and inflation has cooled off, prices for labor, parts and construction materials will remain high in 2025.

Here are 10 states with the highest home insurance prices(7):

| State | Homeowners Insurance Prices |
| --- | --- |
| Florida | $11,759 |
| Louisiana | $7,809 |
| Oklahoma | $5,711 |
| Texas | $4,437 |
| Mississippi | $4,482 |
| Colorado | $4,367 |
| Nebraska | $4,292 |
| Alabama | $4,281 |
| Kansas | $3,666 |
| Arkansas | $3,662 |

## Why Did Some Insurers Leave California, Florida, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas?

Extreme weather, inflation, roofing scams, excessive litigation and the cost of materials as well as labor and other factors, which include [insurance fraud](https://smartfinancial.com/examples-of-home-insurance-fraud), have impacted [California and Florida](https://smartfinancial.com/insurance-companies-drop-california-florida) more than most other states, and many insurers cut back or stopped selling both home and car insurance in those two states. North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas soon joined the list of excluded states due to rising construction prices and labor costs, along with severe weather.(5)

While [hurricane](https://smartfinancial.com/hurricane-insurance) season has always made insurance rather expensive in Florida, the losses have become insurmountable in recent years, causing Bankers Insurance, Lexington Insurance and Farmers to pull out of the state. AAA did not renew some of its higher risk policies.[5]

California wildfires, floods and even a rare tropical storm in 2023 caused some insurers to step back while others raised rates for existing policyholders. Allstate, State Farm, Merastar Insurance Company, Unitrin Auto and Home Insurance Company, Unitrin Direct Property and Casualty Company and Kemper Independence Insurance Company said they would not renew policies in California. Of the carriers who’ve remained in California, the average rate offered to California homeowners is $1,300 a year.(1,3)

In December 2024, wildfires even scorched celebrity homes in Malibu, California, and 20,000 people had to evacuate the area as firefighters tried to contain the fires.(10)

## Factors Causing a Spike in Homeowners Insurance Rates

### Low Inventory

Supply line disruptions caused by COVID pandemic caused shortages in construction materials and the kinks are still being worked out. Until then, the cost of materials will remain quite high.

### High Labor Costs

Not only is labor more expensive than ever, there is a shortage of construction workers, making the job of repairing the home much more expensive than ever. This problem is still a problem in 2025, unless more construction workers join the workforce across the country.

### Severe Weather and Wildfires

Just when insurers began recovering from the wildfires and severe storms of 2021 and 2022, 2023 came in with a new phenomena called atmospheric rivers, which caused 80% of flood damage on the West Coast.[1] Finally, 2024 turned out to be an unimaginable nightmare in terms of losses due to hurricanes. It’s hard to say that 2025 will be without any severe weather events, which are becoming the norm.

See what exactly insurers are still struggling to pay off:

| Type of Extreme Weather | Name/Location | Year | Losses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wildfires | Colorado Wildfires | 2021 | $801.17 million |
| Winter | Winter Storm Uri | 2021 | $195.6 billion |
| Hurricane | Hurricane Ida | 2021 | $75 billion |
| Hurricane | Hurricane Ian | 2022 | $67 billion |
| Hurricane | Hurricane Idalia | 2023 | $20 billion |
| Wildfires | Hawaii Wildfire | 2023 | $6 billion |
| Atmospheric Rivers | West Coast | Annually | $1.1 billion |
| Hurricanes | Hurricanes Beryl, Helene, Kirk, Milton and Rafael | 2024 | $500 billion |

Data from Acuweather(8)

Rates went up across the country, but went up much more in the states that have been greatly impacted by severe weather, which includes wildfires caused largely by droughts as well hurricanes and winter storms. The extreme surge in rates in newly devastated states like Colorado, California and Florida does not apply to all states.

### Reinsurance Prices Have Gone Up

Insurance companies rely on reinsurance companies to make sure they are whole after paying out all claims. Reinsurers have raised their prices, which forces insurers to raise theirs.

### Rise in Insurance Fraud

The average consumer pays more for rampant insurance fraud, which costs the U.S. $308.6B every year. It’s estimated that 10% of all auto and home insurance claims in the country are fraudulent. Florida saw the most number of fraudulent insurance scams in 2024.[6]

### Higher Medical Costs

Prices will continue to increase by around 8% in 2024, for both medications and medical services.[4] This increase in medical costs applies to the liability portion of a homeowners insurance policy. Injuries to third parties are covered by homeowners insurance, if they occur on the insured property.

## Flood, Earthquake and DIC Insurance

[Floods](https://smartfinancial.com/homeowners-insurance-cover-floods) and [earthquakes](https://smartfinancial.com/homeowners-insurance-cover-earthquakes) have their own insurance products, because homeowners insurance does not cover related claims.

A DIC policy is also sold separately and covers [landslides and mudslides](https://smartfinancial.com/are-mudslides-and-landslides-covered-by-home-insurance). For protection against these types of disasters, look into what type of risk your location poses and buy a policy if the risk is worth the cost.

A flood or earthquake can have devastating consequences, and FEMA is only able to pay out small claims for immediate recovery, which will not cover the cost of rebuilding.

## Tips on How To Lower Homeowners Insurance Costs

### Shop Around for the Best Rate

Using an [online insurance comparison tool](https://smartfinancial.com/), you can do the work of gathering quotes much quicker than calling the carriers directly. Also, pricing changes daily so avoid taking days to gather your information and quotes. You never know which insurer will offer you the best rate until you ask. Doing it all in one shot just saves time and it’s free.

### Ask About All Discounts

Before you buy the policy, take a good look at the discounts each carrier offers. Some offer more than others. Are you a veteran? Do you own more than one property and qualify for a multi-policy discount? Is there a discount for having a graduate degree? Discounts can easily knock off 25% of your monthly cost if you qualify for more than one discount. Do the math after the discounts are applied and see which carrier will charge the least.

### Bundle Home and Auto

Sometimes, [bundling home and auto](https://smartfinancial.com/bundle-insurance) will save you money, but not always. That’s why it’s important to compare prices, both separately and in bundles, as well as across several carriers. Ask what it would cost with the bundle and without. Then, see which option saves you the most money.

### Schedule an Insurance Review

Sometimes insurance agents will schedule an annual review but sometimes they just auto-renew the policy without much fanfare aside from an email. It’s your duty to get on the phone and go over your policy. Be reasonable: everyone’s rates went up, but be persistent to see what you can do to lower your cost.

### Improve Your Credit Score

Your credit score is a big factor in how you’re rated for home and car insurance, in most states. Take some time to catch up on debts and pay your bills on time. In six months to a year, check in with your insurance agent because you may be eligible for a lower home insurance rate.

### Increase Your Deductible

When you increase your [deductible](https://smartfinancial.com/homeowners-insurance-deductible), your monthly payments will be lower. Having a higher deductible will also make you more discriminating over which claims to file and which to pay out of pocket.

Filing a claim will only raise your rate so avoid filing one unless it’s an expense you simply cannot shoulder alone. Filing too many claims may even get you dropped by an insurer.

### Install a Home Security System

The more comprehensive a [system](https://smartfinancial.com/smart-home-device-insurance-discount) you have, the higher the discount on your policy. A 24-hour monitoring system will get you a bigger discount than cheap cameras you buy for $20. However, you can set up your own security system using a moderately priced security system from Nest, Ring, SimpliSafe or Abode, all of which offer great security packages at reasonable prices.

## State of Homeowners Insurance 2025 FAQs

### What happens if you don’t have homeowners insurance?

The problem with going without homeowners insurance is that most people have a mortgage, which most often requires home insurance coverage. Even people who are not required to have home insurance are taking a big gamble by betting that their home will not need extensive repairs or rebuilding.

### Will home insurance rates go down in 2025?

Home insurance prices will be level by the time 2025 rolls in, but whether or not prices will drop is yet to be seen and highly unlikely, if weather patterns and frivolous lawsuits continue.

### Which states have the highest homeowners insurance rates?

The top five states with the highest home insurance rates are Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi.
