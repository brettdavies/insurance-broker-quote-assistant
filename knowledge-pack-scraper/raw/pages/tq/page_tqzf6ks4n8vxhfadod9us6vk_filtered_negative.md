* ####  Overview
**Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm, the [largest U.S. home insurer](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), scored above the segment average in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Home Insurance Study, thanks to high customer satisfaction. The company’s A++ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best could give you peace of mind that this carrier has historically been able to handle the financial burden of claims. It also boasts [hundreds of local agents](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/us/ny) across New York State. Additionally, State Farm offers plentiful online tools, like a highly-rated mobile app and full-service online portal. However, the company doesn’t have nearly as many discounts or optional endorsements as some of its competitors.
**Who State Farm may be good for:** Although State Farm's digital tools are state of the art, the company hasn't forgotten that the human connection matters to many policyholders. It might be a good option for you if you wish to do business with one of its many local agents rather than using its online services.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Hundreds of local agencies in New York
* Strong digital presence for hands-on policy management
* Highly rated for customer satisfaction
* Fewer discounts compared to other carriers
* Endorsement options could be lacking
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Personal articles coverage:** Raises coverage limits for expensive items you keep in your home, including jewelry, antiques, cameras, computers and more
* **Boat insurance:** If you own one of the around [431,000 recreational boats](https://parks.ny.gov/documents/recreation/boating/RecreationalBoatingReport2023.pdf) registered in New York, you can add State Farm boat insurance to your home policy. Coverage includes physical damage and liability coverage for qualifying watercraft.
* **Farm and ranch insurance:** New York has nearly [7 million acres](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=NEW%20YORK) of registered farmland, which you can insure with State Farm. This endorsement includes physical damage, liability and personal injury protection.
* **Identity restoration coverage:** Covers up to $50,000 for costs related to restoring a stolen identity

* ####  Overview
**Why NYCM made our list:** As the name suggests, New York Central Mutual (NYCM) is a mutual insurance company, which means policyholders own the company versus it being publicly traded. In addition to a wide range of coverage options, this regional carrier offers numerous potential discounts, including savings opportunities for at-home workers and senior citizens. Unfortunately, online home insurance quotes are not available through the company’s website, so you will need to work with a local independent agent to obtain a quote.
**Who NYCM may be good for:** If you're pinching pennies after the purchase of your new home, NYCM may offer a way to save money going forward. Its average rates are low and discounts could bring them even lower.
* ####  Pros and cons
* Low average rates compared to most carriers
* Uncommon discount opportunities
* Not rated by J.D. Power
* No online quotes available
* ####  Additional coverage
* **Valued possession coverage:** Specialized all-risk coverage for a breadth of valuables like furs, jewelry, cameras, sports equipment, musical instruments and even boats and snowmobiles
* **Equipment breakdown coverage:** Helps with the costs of repairing or replacing household appliances and equipment such as an HVAC and hot water system
* **Utility line expense coverage:** Includes coverage for utility line repairs and property damage that results from those repairs, like damage to your driveway or lawn
