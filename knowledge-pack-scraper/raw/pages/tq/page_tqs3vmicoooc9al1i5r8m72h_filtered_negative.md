* The average driver travels more than [**14,000 miles per year**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/traffic-stops-auto-insurance-premiums#counties "#counties") and **has just a 1% chance of getting pulled over** anywhere in the country.
* However, the chance that someone will get pulled over depends heavily on the location: Drivers in **South Carolina**, for example, have a [**20% chance of experiencing a traffic stop**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/traffic-stops-auto-insurance-premiums#states "#states"). With a 24% share, **Los Angeles accounted for the greatest portion of traffic stops** of any police department surveyed.
* Getting [**one speeding ticket can increase your car insurance premiums by an average of nearly 50%**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/traffic-stops-auto-insurance-premiums#consumers "#consumers") among the nation's most well-known providers.
We recommend [comparing car insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Auto Insurance Companies") from more than one company. The methods companies use to assess the cost of a policy differ depending on the insurer. While one company may heavily penalize drivers who have been pulled over, it's not a guarantee this will be the case with every provider. In fact, as is evident from MetLife's static prices in the example above, it's not a given that companies will increase their rates at all.
ValuePenguin analyzed data from [Stanford University's Open Policing](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/#raw-data "Stanford University's Open Policing Project") report. The university compiled its database from traffic stop data it requested from state and local departments across the country. The university received more than 100 million data points from 20 state departments and 35 municipalities. Using Stanford's data and travel figures from the Federal Highway Administration, we estimated the total number of stops nationwide. We also calculated the per-mile rate of [traffic](https://www.valuepenguin.com/traffic-deaths-miles-traveled-study "Traffic Deaths Up 12% in 2021, but Deeper Dive Into Miles Traveled Shows Fuller Picture") stops for typical drivers in each state covered by the university's study.
