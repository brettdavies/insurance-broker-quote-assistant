  **Why Nationwide made our list:** Nationwide offers a wide range of coverage options to homeowners and won the 2025 [Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-home-insurance-companies/) for Best Home Insurance Company for Bundling Home Insurance and Auto. While it isn’t the cheapest provider on our list, the company’s average premium is still well below the state’s average. Nationwide also offers a long list of competitive discounts, including home renovation credits and gated community discounts. The company's Valuables Plus policies provide additional coverage to those with expensive belongings. Moreover, Nationwide received high marks in the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-property-claims-satisfaction-study).

  But if you prefer to get insurance quotes online, Nationwide might not be the right fit. The company received a below-average digital shopping rating in the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study).

  **Who Nationwide may be good for:** Nationwide offers good general coverage across the board, but it also has perks that may be useful to those with homes that are worth $500K and up, or individuals who have personal property that has a high value.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

  + High property claims satisfaction per J.D. Power
  + Unique coverage options available, such as Better Roof Replacement

* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  Nationwide’s standard home insurance policies come included with a few added perks, like ordinance/law coverage and coverage for your credit card. Here’s what else you can protect with Nationwide:

  + **Brand New Belongings:** Pays the [actual cash value](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/actual-cash-value/) for your covered items and helps with the additional cost of repairs or replacements
  + **Better Roof Replacement:** Pays for your roof to be repaired or replaced with higher-quality materials if your roof is damaged during a covered loss
  + **Dwelling replacement cost:** Doubles your dwelling limit for a rebuild if your home is rendered a total loss
  + **Water backup:** Covers the cleanup and repair costs associated with sump pump failure and sewer backup damage
  + **Service line coverage:**Added coverage for underground service lines, like water, gas and electric lines
  + **Equipment breakdown:**Repairs or replaces items like refrigerators, HVAC systems, televisions, dishwashers and more items if they are damaged by power surges and other covered losses

  **Why Allstate made our list:** With a potential multi-policy discount of up to 25 percent, Allstate could be an excellent choice for New Yorkers looking for both home and auto insurance. In addition to an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best, Allstate offers a range of discounts and won the 2025 Bankrate Award for Best for First-Time Homeowners. With local offices, contact centers, a website and a mobile app, there are many ways to get in touch with your agent, regardless of how you prefer to do business. However, Allstate scored below average in the 2024 J.D. Power Home Insurance Study, showing dissatisfaction from some policyholders. Allstate’s average New York homeowners insurance premiums are also higher than the state average.

  **Who Allstate may be good for:** If you would just as soon have all your insurance business through a single company, you might want to consider Allstate. The company's excellent digital tools and high-value bundling discount might make it a good choice for those who don't want to make multiple premium payments each month.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

  + Hefty potential savings for carrying both home and auto

  Allstate’s home insurance policies are highly customizable to the policyholder’s needs. New York customers can add the following optional coverages for additional protection:

  **Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm, the [largest U.S. home insurer](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/), scored above the segment average in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Home Insurance Study, thanks to high customer satisfaction. The company’s A++ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best could give you peace of mind that this carrier has historically been able to handle the financial burden of claims. It also boasts [hundreds of local agents](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/us/ny) across New York State. Additionally, State Farm offers plentiful online tools, like a highly-rated mobile app and full-service online portal. However, the company doesn’t have nearly as many discounts or optional endorsements as some of its competitors.

  **Who State Farm may be good for:** Although State Farm's digital tools are state of the art, the company hasn't forgotten that the human connection matters to many policyholders. It might be a good option for you if you wish to do business with one of its many local agents rather than using its online services.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  Checkmark IconPros

* #### Additional coverage

  Caret Down Icon

  Compared to other national insurers, State Farm does not list as many home insurance endorsements on its website. Speaking with a local State Farm agent may give you better insight into all available coverage offerings, but here is what the insurer mentions for its New York home insurance policies:

  + **Personal articles coverage:**Raises coverage limits for expensive items you keep in your home, including jewelry, antiques, cameras, computers and more
  + **Boat insurance:** If you own one of the around [431,000 recreational boats](https://parks.ny.gov/documents/recreation/boating/RecreationalBoatingReport2023.pdf) registered in New York, you can add State Farm boat insurance to your home policy. Coverage includes physical damage and liability coverage for qualifying watercraft.
  + **Farm and ranch insurance:**New York has nearly [7 million acres](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=NEW%20YORK) of registered farmland, which you can insure with State Farm. This endorsement includes physical damage, liability and personal injury protection.
  + **Identity restoration coverage:** Covers up to $50,000 for costs related to restoring a stolen identity

  **Why NYCM made our list:** As the name suggests, New York Central Mutual (NYCM) is a mutual insurance company, which means policyholders own the company versus it being publicly traded. In addition to a wide range of coverage options, this regional carrier offers numerous potential discounts, including savings opportunities for at-home workers and senior citizens. Unfortunately, online home insurance quotes are not available through the company’s website, so you will need to work with a local independent agent to obtain a quote.

  **Who NYCM may be good for:** If you're pinching pennies after the purchase of your new home, NYCM may offer a way to save money going forward. Its average rates are low and discounts could bring them even lower.
* #### Pros and cons

  Caret Down Icon

  + Low average rates compared to most carriers

  Caret Down Icon

  NYCM’s average premiums may be cheap, but adding home insurance endorsements will likely increase your rate. Here’s what NYCM has to offer in terms of extra coverage:

  + **Valued possession coverage:** Specialized all-risk coverage for a breadth of valuables like furs, jewelry, cameras, sports equipment, musical instruments and even boats and snowmobiles
  + **Equipment breakdown coverage:** Helps with the costs of repairing or replacing household appliances and equipment such as an HVAC and hot water system
  + **Utility line expense coverage:** Includes coverage for utility line repairs and property damage that results from those repairs, like damage to your driveway or lawn

## Additional New York home insurance companies to consider

### Encompass

[Encompass review](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/encompass/)

Homeowners looking for budget-friendly coverage packages

Overview
Caret Down Icon

Shopping for homeowners insurance and structuring your perfect policy can feel overwhelming. New York homeowners who prefer to choose a pre-selected coverage package at a lower price may consider a policy from Encompass. Home insurance is available in three tiers — Special, Deluxe and Elite — each with its own discounts and policy options. Bankrate found that, on average, Encompass charges New York homeowners $2,655 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage.

### The Hanover

[The Hanover review](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/the-hanover/)

Homeowners looking for tiered coverage packages

Overview
Caret Down Icon

If you have more wiggle room in your budget but are still set on a pre-packaged insurance policy, consider The Hanover. It has three prebuilt coverage packages — Connections, Prestige and Platinum — which include different policy limits and coverage levels. The Prestige plan is the most comprehensive of the bunch. This policy level comes with water backup, ordinance/law coverage, service line coverage and a deductible waiver for losses over $50,000.

### PURE

![PURE](https://www.bankrate.com/f/102997/x/5a9ec358f4/pure-insurance.svg?optimize=medium&width=160&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

[PURE review](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/pure/)

Homeowners with high-value homes

Overview
Caret Down Icon

Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange, or PURE, writes policies exclusively for homes valued at $1 million or more. In fact, the entire company tailors its insurance coverage to individuals with high net worth. PURE home insurance policies are robust and come with loads of added perks already included, like guaranteed replacement cost, up to $50,000 in jewelry coverage and water backup coverage. Surprisingly, its rates were not astronomically expensive; Bankrate found that $300,000 in dwelling coverage costs an average of $2,605 per year. However, a PURE customer would likely need a much higher dwelling coverage limit, which would drive up the cost of the policy.

### How Bankrate chose the best home insurance companies in New York

To identify the [best home insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) in New York, we considered average premiums, policy options, claims handling, customer service scores, financial strength ratings and digital options. To make comparisons easy, we compiled this information into a Bankrate Score.

## How to get cheap New York home insurance

As a homeowner, you likely want to get the coverage you need at a price that fits your budget. While accomplishing this may be challenging, it’s possible. To find the most affordable home insurance that meets your coverage needs, consider the following.

* **Assess your property:** How old is your house? What is it made of? How close are you to the local fire station? Knowing the answers to these and other questions when you are ready to gather quotes can help you get the most accurate estimates.
* **Review possible insurers:** Look at a handful of insurance companies — you may want to start with the ones we've listed above — and check out their websites. Are you able to find answers to common questions there? Does the website or app make it easy to pay your bill or file a claim? Spending some time on the site can give you a sense of how the company values customer service.
* **Gather quotes:** Many companies make requesting quotes easy by offering an online quoting system; others require you to call or visit an agent. Make sure you're asking for the same level of coverage from each company, so you can compare the results accurately.
* **Review the results:** See which company gave you the lowest price, but also consider other factors, like how easy it was to get the quote and how financially strong the company is. Make sure the quote includes all applicable discounts. You may have other factors that matter to you as well, such as how close you are to the company's local office.
* **Fill out an application:** Once you choose the company you wish to purchase insurance from, fill out their application. You may get a response in as little as several hours or as long as several weeks, depending on your circumstances.

## Best home insurance discounts in New York

Discounts offer a tangible way to reduce your home insurance premium. Almost all insurers offer at least a few, and many of them are easy to earn. When you [ask for quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) from potential insurers, make sure they include any discounts you are eligible for. Here are a few that you may see from New York homeowners insurance companies.

Bundling
Caret Down Icon

Some insurance companies may offer you a lower rate if you purchase multiple policies from them — for example, car insurance and home insurance.

Protective devices
Caret Down Icon

Your insurer wants to keep your claims to a minimum, so installing devices such as burglar alarms, smoke detectors or sprinkler systems can often save you money.

Non-smoker
Caret Down Icon

Since smoking may increase the risk of fire damage to your home, some insurers may offer you a discounted rate if no one in your household smokes.

Claims-free
Caret Down Icon

If you haven’t filed any claims recently — say, in three years — you may qualify for a discounted home insurance premium.

Retiree credit
Caret Down Icon

Older individuals who work less than 25 hours a week might be able to save a percentage off their premiums.

### How to save on home insurance policy renewals in New York

If you are unhappy with your home insurance rate, you won’t be stuck with it forever. Most home insurance policies have a one-year term. And while you’re waiting for your policy renewal date, there are several strategies you can employ to help lower your premium that don’t include switching companies altogether:

* **Maintain or improve your credit score:** It’s easier said than done, but boosting your credit score could help you secure a lower rate. Why? Because in New York, insurers are allowed to factor your credit-based insurance score into your rate calculation. Homeowners with good or excellent credit scores are generally seen as less likely to file a claim than someone with poor credit and therefore may receive more favorable rates.
* **Raise your deductible:** This can be a risky strategy for some homeowners, but it is an effective method for lowering your premium. When you raise your deductible, you agree to take on more financial responsibility following a covered loss, which in turn typically earns you a lower rate. Just be sure that you do not raise your deductible too high or to a level you cannot realistically afford to pay out.
* **Only file claims when necessary:** Home insurance comes in handy for major repairs, like if your home succumbs to a fire or if you’re hit with a major burglary. However, for smaller losses, you might think twice before you file a claim. Insurers generally increase rates following a claim, which could cost you more money in the long run. If the damage amount is close to or less than your deductible, you may actually save money by skipping the claims process altogether and paying for repairs out-of-pocket.

## How much is home insurance in New York?

The [average annual cost for homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) in NY is $1,860 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. In comparison, this is just slightly lower than the national average home insurance premium of $2,408 for the same amount of coverage.

## What does home insurance cover in New York?

There are a few different standard home insurance contracts, the most common one being an [HO-3](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/ho3/). An HO-3 form provides financial protection for your home’s physical structure, other structures on your property (like a fence or garden shed) and your personal property. This policy type also includes liability coverage, medical payments coverage and coverage for additional living expenses incurred after a covered loss makes your home unlivable.

Although HO-3 home insurance forms are standard-issue, that does not mean they are all identical. Depending on where you live, your home insurance provider may exclude certain coverages from your policy. But, before you scramble to purchase every extra coverage your provider offers, it’s helpful first to grasp what your New York homeowners insurance policy already covers. Here are some common losses that are covered by your policy:

* Theft
* Windstorm damage
* Vandalism
* Smoke
* Fire and lightning
* Weight of snow and ice

## Additional home insurance coverage types in New York

New Yorkers may sometimes experience severe winter storms, from Manhattan to the Adirondacks. The state's plentiful urban areas also see a fairly substantial rate of crime. New York City received an [F grade for property crime](https://crimegrade.org/property-crime-new-york-ny/), meaning that its rate of property is significantly higher than the U.S. average (although the state property crime average is [12% below the national average](https://www.safehome.org/safest-cities/)). Because of this and other events that might result in claims, you may feel more comfortable tailoring your policy to your unique needs.

The cost of homeowners insurance is an important factor, but New York homeowners might also want to consider these optional coverage types:

* **Flood insurance:** Flood damage is excluded from standard home insurance policies. New Yorkers might want to consider buying a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program or a private flood insurer, although some companies may offer flood insurance as an endorsement. Homeowners with a mortgage who live in flood zones will likely be required to purchase a flood insurance policy.
* **Identity theft coverage**: Commonly offered as an endorsement, this coverage option could help pay for the costs associated with restoring your identity if it is stolen. As we live in an increasingly digital world, identity theft is a threat to all consumers.
* [**Personal property replacement cost**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance/)**:** Most standard home insurance policies automatically cover your belongings for their actual cash value (ACV), which means depreciation is factored in. Many companies offer a replacement cost value (RCV) option though, meaning coverage to replace your items with similar new items. It typically does not cost much more to purchase RCV rather than ACV, but you may want to check with your insurance agent to see what your cost will be.

Not all companies offer the same endorsements, so figuring out what coverage types you are looking for could help you choose the company that best fits your needs.

### Common New York home insurance problems

It is difficult to speak generally about the insurance problems that plague New York homeowners. Weather patterns vary widely across the state, as does population density. As such, a homeowner in the Catskills will likely have wildly different insurance needs than a homeowner in Brooklyn, Long Island, Albany or Rochester. However, here are some common insurance hiccups homeowners across the Empire State may encounter:

* **Trouble finding coverage:** New York homeowners unable to secure coverage in the private insurance market may need to purchase a policy through the [New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association (NYPIUA)](https://www.nypiua.com/). Policies are supported by New York’s private insurers, and coverage options are fairly limited.
* **Coastal home insurance:** For homeowners who live within one mile of New York’s coastline and struggle to purchase coverage, there is the [Coastal Market Assistance Program (C-MAP)](https://www.nypiua.com/insurance/c-map-program), which is administered by the NYPIUA. In order to apply for this coverage, you must first provide evidence of a [policy nonrenewal](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/get-home-insurance-after-non-renewal/), cancellation or conditional nonrenewal notice.

Recent news in New York homeowners insurance market

As the home insurance market faces challenges from increased claims and costs due to climate change, more home insurance insurance companies are withdrawing from risky regions, including New York. In 2024, Adirondack Insurance Exchange and Mountain Valley Indemnity [announced plans to withdraw](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-property-insurance-companies-leaving/) from the state, citing the increased number of weather events, especially along the coast.

In January 2025, Governor Hochul [signed two pieces of legislation](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/new-york-governor-signs-2-insurancerelated-laws-518669.aspx) aimed at improving access to insurance coverage in the state. One defines rules for parametric insurance policies, a type of non-traditional insurance coverage, to be filed against weather events. The other expands eligibility for the C-MAP program, making homeowners close to the shoreline now eligible for coverage.

### Bankrate Scores

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
