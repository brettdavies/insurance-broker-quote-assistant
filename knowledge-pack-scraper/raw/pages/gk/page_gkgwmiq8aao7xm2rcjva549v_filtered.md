The main AAA NAIC number is 11983. AAA’s NAIC number is the five-digit code given by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which assigns numbers to authorized insurance providers in order to track customer complaints and ethics violations across state lines.

With AAA’s NAIC number, anyone can learn more about the company’s financial data, the kinds of complaints that have been filed by customers, and any enforcement actions taken against the company. Customers will need AAA’s NAIC number to report fraud or file an insurance claim, as well.

Although the main AAA NAIC number is 11983, the NAIC has assigned a separate code for each of AAA’s affiliate companies, which are listed below. You can find the number that applies to your particular policy on your AAA insurance card.

Keep in mind that AAA's NAIC insurance codes are not the same as the three-digit numbers assigned to AAA by the department of motor vehicles in each state. These numbers are codes issued by a state’s insurance commissioner to companies that are authorized to sell policies in that state. They aren’t standardized nationwide like NAIC codes.
