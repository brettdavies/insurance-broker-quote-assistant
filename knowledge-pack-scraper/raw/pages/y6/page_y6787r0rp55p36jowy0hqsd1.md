## What Coverage Includes
Because Geico provides products through a network of insurance providers, the level of coverage will vary depending on your agent. However, Geico’s website lists the following as common features offered by its providers:
  * **Property damage**


Covers your home and any permanent structures against fire, wind, hail, and water damage.
  * **Personal property**


Insures you against damage and loss to property, this includes items such as furniture, appliances, and clothing. 
  * **Personal liability**


Designed to help with the cost of medical bills or property damage caused by you or other members of your household. This may also cover legal expenses in the event of a lawsuit.
  * **Additional expenses**


This covers extra expenses you may incur if you need to make a claim, such as hotel fees if your home becomes uninhabitable in the event of a fire.
  * **Jewelry coverage**


Limited coverage for jewelry stolen from your home, typically with a claim limit up to $2,000.
## Additional Coverage
The add-ons available on your policy will vary according to your agent. When we requested a quote via the online system, we had the option to add the following:
  * **Identity theft expense protection**


Covers against expenses incurred if you fall victim to identity type of fraud.
  * **Equipment breakdown**


Covers against loss or damage to household items caused by electrical and pressure system breakdown.
  * **Service line protection**


Covers the repair or replacement of underground pipes or wiring.
As well as homeowners insurance coverage, Geico also provides property insurance for renters, condo and co-op residents, mobile home owners, and landlords. 
## Application Process
If you’d like to apply for a policy online, the first step is to enter your zip code and address into the company’s website. You’ll then need to answer a range of questions related to the property, such as the length of time you’ve been a resident. You’ll also need to input your personal details in order to receive your quote, which you can choose to have sent to your email address. 
The entire online application process takes 10 minutes to complete.If you would rather not complete the application process online, you can contact one of the company’s agents by phone. You can find the nearest agent by entering your address details on Geico’s website.
## Discounts
If you also have an auto insurance policy with Geico, you may qualify for discounted rates on your homeowners policy. Once you have purchased your homeowners policy, the company will apply this discount to your auto policy. It’s important to note these discounts are not available in all states. 
Depending on the insurance agent, you may be able to lower the cost of your coverage if your home has smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, or a home security system.
## How Safe is it?
Credit ratings agency AB Best gave Geico an A ++ (Superior) rating in October 2020 based on its strong operating performance, favorable business profile, and appropriate enterprise risk management.
## Claims & Customer Support
The quickest way to contact Geico is through its 24/7 virtual assistant, which is available on its website and mobile app. 
Customers can also get in touch with the company via email or phone. The availability of its sales agents may differ according to the state you live in. In the majority of locations, Geico agents are available between 7:00 am and 1:00 am ET on Mondays to Fridays and between 8:00 am and 10.30pm ET on Saturdays and Sundays. In addition, Geico’s website contains contact numbers for all the agents in its network, so you can easily get in touch with the agent who sold you your policy.
There is also a Geico mobile app, which is available to download from the App Store or Google Play and includes digital insurance ID cards, Apple business chat, and a 24/7 virtual assistant.
## Summary
Geico’s online quote tool is fast and easy-to-use, and a definite plus for those looking to find a policy online. If you’re in the early stages of shopping around for a new homeowners policy, it’s certainly worthwhile to input your data into Geico to compare policies and see if you might be able to save money or improve your level of coverage.

Very helpful customer service
I did my online quote, but then I was looking for the option to pay for the 6 months in full and I didn't see it so I called them and they were able to find my quote and help me through it. This is honestly the cheapest car insurance I could find and I've never been at fault for an accident. I also don't have any tickets.

I've Been a Geico Customer for Several Years, I Like it
I've been a Geico customer for their Auto insurance for several years, and I like it so far, no problem. I've made several claims, and so far they are painless to deal with. I just added homeowner insurance with them (Homesite). The things here I would advise you is to read and dig a little more details of what coverages you have, because if not, when it comes to claiming, then you will come back to say Geico doesn't cover this or that.

Easy and Efficient 
I've had Geico for car insurance for 4 years and have 0% complaints. Efficient paperwork, easy-to-navigate sign-up process, easy claims process with one fender bender. Plus, I can pay 6 months at once for an additional discount. This is one of the lower cost options for quality coverage. I have recommended Geico to family and friends.
