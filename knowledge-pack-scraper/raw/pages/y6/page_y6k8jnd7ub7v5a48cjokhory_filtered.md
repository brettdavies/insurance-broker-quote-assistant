## Uninsured motorist coverage in New York

Insurance can be confusing, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s important to understand your insurance coverages so you’re able to best protect you and your family on the road. Here’s everything you need to know about uninsured motorist coverage in New York.

## What is an uninsured motorist?

An uninsured motorist is one that does not carry auto insurance. [Insurance is a requirement](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-is-the-minimum-auto-insurance-coverage-in-new-york) for drivers in most states, but this does not mean every driver on the road is following the law. A driver without insurance will likely be unable to pay for injuries they cause in an accident.   
  
 That’s where uninsured motorist (UM) coverage comes in. This protects you, your passengers and your family members who live in the same household as you when hit by a driver who is operating their vehicle without insurance. It may also pay for injuries from hit-and-run accidents.

## Accidents with an uninsured driver

If you’ve been involved in any accident, you should exchange information with the other driver. Record their insurance policy number if available, and take down their phone number and license plate number. Call the police and file a police report. Then, contact your auto insurance carrier and open a claim.   
  
 If you were the victim of a hit-and-run, you probably won’t have much information. Call the police and tell the officer everything you can remember about the accident. Contact your insurance carrier and open a claim.   
  
 This process can sound intimidating, but we’re here to help. Plymouth Rock makes it easy to file a claim, and we’ll guide you through every step. Our skilled adjusters will review the accident and make sure your claim is settled quickly.

## What is SUM coverage?

Supplementary Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist coverage, or SUM coverage, is an [optional coverage you can purchase](https://www.plymouthrock.com/insurance/auto/NY/coverage-policy-options) that provides protection beyond your required uninsured motorist coverage. Not only does SUM cover everything UM covers, it also covers injuries from an underinsured motorist.   
  
 An underinsured motorist is one whose liability limits are too low to cover the injuries they cause. In NY, the minimum bodily injury liability is only $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.   
  
 The base UM coverage you’re required to have by law only covers you within the state of New York. SUM protects you and your family anywhere in the United States, its territories and Canada.

## How can you protect yourself and your family?

The best way to protect yourself and your family from uninsured or underinsured motorists and hit-and-run accidents is to carry SUM coverage.   
  
 In New York, the minimum limit for the required uninsured motorist coverage is $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. Having SUM coverage at higher limits means more protection for you. You can purchase SUM coverage up to your bodily injury liability coverage.   
  
 However, remember that uninsured motorist coverage does not cover physical damage to your car. If you want to protect your vehicle, collision coverage helps pay for damages sustained from hitting another vehicle or object. It also covers cases like if you return to find that your car had been hit while it was parked.
