## State Farm vs. Farmers: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're saddled with an at-fault crash, speeding violation, reckless driving citation, or DUI offense on your driving résumé, Farmers could be a better choice than State Farm. Every auto insurance company prices its policies differently, so it's worth comparing quotes to find out which insurer is best for you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: FARMERS VS. STATE FARM

| **Citation** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,849 | $2,334 |

| Speeding ticket | $1,983 | $2,045 |

## State Farm vs. Farmers: rates by age

Insurance companies rely on age to estimate risk, pricing policies accordingly. A car insurance policy is usually expensive for teen drivers — because of their inexperience — and relatively affordable for middle-aged drivers. Since every insurance company evaluates age tiers differently, it's smart to shop around and find a great rate.

As a general rule, teen drivers should choose State Farm over Farmers: State Farm offers average yearly savings of $698, compared to Farmers.

##### RATES BY AGE: FARMERS VS. STATE FARM

| **Age tier** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **20s** | $2,379 | $2,020 |
| **30s** | $1,585 | $2,020 |
| **40s** | $1,587 | $1,511 |
| **50s** | $1,558 | $1,507 |
| **60s** | $1,485 | $1,402 |
