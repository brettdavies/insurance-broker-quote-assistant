Our Expert Take
We picked State Farm as best overall for bundling because it has the best average bundling discount (23%) among the companies we analyzed, a low level of complaints for auto insurance and competitive prices. This combination makes it a good choice if you’re looking to bundle your home and auto policies.
**More:**[State Farm Car Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state-farm-car-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Great auto insurance renewal discount (14%) after being with State Farm for at least three consecutive years.
  * Home insurance costs are cheaper than a majority of the companies we evaluated.
  * Low-cost auto rates for drivers with a DUI.
  * Offers extended replacement cost coverage for houses, which stretches your limit when rebuilding costs exceed your dwelling coverage amount.


  * Doesn’t offer accident forgiveness, new car replacement or vanishing deductible for auto insurance.
  * Doesn’t offer guaranteed replacement coverage for home.


States Available In 
  * State Farm sells home and auto insurance in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

## How Does a Home and Auto Insurance Bundle Work?
When you bundle car and [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/), you get a discount. Many insurers provide a percentage discount on both your home and auto rates. For example, you may get 10% off your car insurance cost and 5% off your home insurance.
However, not all companies calculate and apply bundle discounts in the same way. When shopping for coverage, be sure to ask how bundle discounts are calculated so you understand how they arrived at your final cost.
## Is Bundling Your Home and Auto Insurance a Good Idea?
Bundling home and auto insurance policies with one company has advantages but isn’t always the best option. Review these pros and cons to see if bundling your home and auto is good for your particular needs.
### Pros of Bundling  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/money@2x-1-1.svg) | 
### Save Money
The average discount is 14%, which is a savings of around $466 a year, according to our analysis.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Clock-1.svg) | 
### Save Time
Having only one insurance company to deal with for payments and customer service is convenient and can save you time.   
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Compare@2x-1-1.svg) | 
### Multiple Policies, One Account 
Many insurers let you manage your bundled home and auto policies under one online account or mobile app.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Document-1.svg) | 
### Have a Single Deductible
Some companies, such as [Progressive](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-car-insurance-review/), apply one deductible to bundled home and auto policies if your house and car are damaged in one event. For instance, if a storm causes a tree to fall, damaging both your car and home you’d pay one single deductible for the claim.  
### Cons of Bundling  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Compare-price@2x-2.svg) | 
### Not Always the Best Buy
You may be able to find cheaper prices for auto and home insurance policies by buying them separately from different companies. It pays off to compare home and [car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) from multiple insurance companies to find the best overall price.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Documents@2x.svg) | 
### Not Always More Convenient
If your car insurance company doesn’t sell home insurance and instead partners with a different company, you may still be able to get a bundle discount but you won’t get perks like having one account. Instead, you still deal with two companies for payments, services and claims. For example, Geico home insurance comes from partner companies.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/paperless@2x.svg) | 
### Might Not Fit Your Needs
If you want certain coverage types that aren’t available from a company that bundles, it’s better to stick with a company that gives you the coverage you want. For example, not all home insurance companies offer an [extended replacement cost](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/extended-and-guaranteed-replacement-cost/) option, which provides a higher reimbursement if you need to [rebuild your house](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/renovations/).  
## Who Offers the Biggest Home and Auto Bundling Discount?
State Farm offers the biggest home and insurance bundling discount with an average savings of 23% per year.
The average auto and home insurance bundling discount is 14%, according to Forbes Advisor’s analysis of ten large insurance companies. That comes out to an average savings of $466 a year.

## How To Find the Right Home and Auto Insurance Bundle
Here’s what to look at to find the right home and auto insurance bundle as you shop around.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Review-policy@2x-1.svg) | 
### Determine Your Coverage
Evaluate the coverage and limits you want for both your auto and home insurance policies. Bundling home and auto insurance can be convenient but it must also fulfill your needs to be worthwhile.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Deductible.svg) | 
### See About a Single Deductible
A deductible is the amount deducted from an insurance claims check. Some insurers offer a single deductible as a perk of bundling. That means paying only one deductible if both your home and car are damaged in the same event.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Home-and-car-together@2x.svg) | 
### Ask About a Bundling Discount
Most insurers are happy if you buy both your auto and home insurance policies with them and offer a decent discount. However, not all insurers sell both types of insurance, but instead partner with other companies. That may get you a discount but leave you dealing with two companies.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Expenses@2x.svg) | 
### Compare Overall Cost
Look at the final bundled cost (and any other insurance you also want to buy, such as [umbrella insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/umbrella-insurance/)). Bundling with one company isn’t always the cheapest option. Decide if the benefits and convenience of bundling outweigh the price difference if it costs more than separate policies.

### Compare Quotes
Comparing car and home insurance quotes from at least three different companies is one of the best ways to save money. I check the costs for both bundled and individual policies to see which gives me the best deal.
Remember to get car and [home insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/compare-home-insurance-quotes/) for the same coverage and deductible limits so you’re comparing apples to apples.

### Get All the Discounts You’re Eligible For
Look over your quotes to see what discounts you received. I suggest contacting the insurers to see if there are other discounts you’re eligible for or can get if you make changes. For instance, going paperless may get you a small discount to lower [car insurance costs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/average-cost-of-car-insurance/).

### Shop Regularly 
Rates for home and auto insurance fluctuate. I recommend shopping around for quotes regularly so you can be confident that you’re getting a great price.
Before comparison shopping, I advise reviewing your coverage choices to verify they still fit your needs. For instance, if your car is older, it may be [time to drop collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/drop-collision-comprehensive/).

## Complaints Against Auto and Home Insurance Companies
Complaints collected nationwide against auto and home insurance companies expose problem areas for some insurers. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners calculates a complaint ratio for each company that reflects the number of complaints in relation to each insurer’s size of business.
For auto insurance, the best companies for bundling in our analysis have the complaint levels that are below the industry average.
![Auto-Owners has the lowest complaint level for auto insurance, and USAA the highest but is still below the industry average for complaints.](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1HWxa/full.png)
For home insurance, Auto-Owners, Erie and USAA are well below the national average. Nationwide is just below the industry average and State Farm is slightly above.
![USAA has the lowest home insurance complaint levels, while State Farm has the highest which is a tad over the industry average.](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/joLv8/full.png)
## Methodology
To identify the best home and auto insurance bundles we evaluated each company based on these factors:
**Bundling discount (40% of score)** : We used data from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/) to find the average bundling discount for each company.

  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


**Home insurance rates (20% of score)** : We used data from Quadrant Information Services to find average rates for each insurance company for homes with dwelling coverage of $350,000.
**Complaints about auto insurance (10% of score)** : We used complaint data from the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm). Each state’s department of insurance logs and monitors complaints against companies. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and denials.

  * Auto
  * Boat
  * Condo
  * Home
  * Life
  * Motorcycle
  * Renters
  * RV
  * Small business
