IQ ScoreThe [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) uses more than 15 criteria to objectively rate insurance companies on a one-to-ten scale. The Insurify editorial team researches insurer data to determine the final scores. |  9.2 /10
Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $91/mo
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $139/mo

* **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
Remember that you’ll also have access to discounts beyond the multi-car discount. You should try to get all the discounts you qualify for — the more discounts you get, the less you’ll pay for coverage.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/two-or-more-cars/#cite-1) Here are a few to look for:
Car theft deterrents include automatically locking doors, steering wheel locks, brake locks, and after-market kill switches. These types of devices for your car can reduce your insurance premiums.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/two-or-more-cars/#cite-2)
* **Insurance stacking:** Some states allow drivers to stack uninsured and [**underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) limits in the event of a claim. If you have uninsured motorist limits of $50,000 per person and $150,000 per accident on two vehicles, you can stack those limits to double the amounts to $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.
* **Significant discount:** Multi-car discounts are one of the [**best car insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) available, with some companies providing up to 39% off your total policy cost. Some companies might call this discount a loyalty discount.

Some states require this coverage, and it kicks in when someone without insurance — or without enough insurance to pay for damages and injuries — causes an accident. [**UM/UIM coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) can also pay in case of a hit-and-run or pedestrian accident.
Another insurance requirement in some states, [**MedPay is similar to PIP**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/) in that it provides coverage for your and your passengers’ injuries after an accident, even if you caused it.
The national average cost for a two-car policy is $177 per month for liability coverage and $362 for full coverage, according to Insurify’s proprietary data. But the exact rate you’ll pay depends on a number of factors, including:[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/two-or-more-cars/#cite-3)
* **The**[**cars you drive**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/vehicle-type/)**:** Newer or more expensive cars usually cost more to insure.
* **The types of coverage you carry:**[**Liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) (bodily injury and property damage), [**collision coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/), comprehensive coverage, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) (PIP) are among the most common types.
* **Your**[**coverage limits**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/)**:** The higher your coverage limits, the more you’ll pay.
* **Driving history:** Drivers with [**clean driving records**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) typically pay less than people with at-fault accidents, speeding tickets, or DUIs.
* **Your credit history:** Drivers with good credit usually pay less than drivers with [**bad credit**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/).
* ### How many cars can you cover on one auto insurance policy?
* ### What’s the best car insurance company for insuring multiple vehicles?
* ### Is it cheaper to insure multiple cars?
In most cases, yes. It’s often cheaper to insure multiple vehicles under one policy since many insurance companies offer a multi-car discount. For example, the [**average cost of liability-only insurance in the U.S.**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/) is $170 per month, so insuring two cars with separate policies at this rate would be $340 per month. But with a 25% multi-car discount, the rate for insuring two cars drops to $255 per month, saving drivers around $1,020 annually.
