If you live in California and your driver’s license or registration has been suspended you’ll need to file an SR-22 with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get it reinstated. An SR-22 is proof that you have the state’s minimum liability insurance required.
An SR-22 indicates that you’re a high-risk driver. Unfortunately, this means you’ll pay higher insurance premiums for the same coverage, and it may be harder to find coverage. This guide reviews what you need to know about getting car insurance with an SR-22 in California.
## SR-22 Insurance in California
If you’re getting SR-22 insurance in California, expect to pay about 96 percent more than you would as a low-risk driver, although this increase ranges from 24 to 208 percent depending on the insurance provider and violation. On average, SR-22 car insurance in California costs $4,561 annually. See below for specific companies’ averages.
Average annual cost of car insurance by company | Clean record | SR-22 | Percentage difference
---|---|---|---
AAA | $2,033 | $5,188 | 155%
Allstate | $2,366 | $4,381 | 80%
Bristol West | $3,996 | $5,520 | 38%
Farmers | $3,730 | $4,750 | 27%
GEICO | $1,823 | $4,392 | 140%
Infinity | $2,215 | $2,756 | 24%
Mercury | $1,955 | $3,589 | 84%
National General | $1,703 | $5,248 | 208%
State Farm | $2,450 | $5,225 | 113%
Your insurance provider will file an SR-22 for you and send it to the DMV once your license or registration is reinstated. The SR-22 proves you have the minimum required insurance, allowing you to drive legally again.
### Non-Owner SR-22 Insurance
Even if you don’t own a car, you still have to file an SR-22 if required. A non-owner insurance policy is less expensive than a traditional policy and fulfills the requirement, proving you have the [minimum car insurance in California](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/minimum-car-insurance/).
[Non-owner car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-non-owner-car-insurance/) is coverage for someone who drives another person’s vehicle. It includes only liability coverage, which is what the state requires, making it much cheaper than regular, full-coverage policies. On average, non-owner car insurance with an SR-22 in California costs $876.
## California SR-22s
In California, an [SR-22](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-sr22/) is also known as a California Proof of Insurance Certificate — which is proof of financial responsibility.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-1) While it’s not insurance itself, it’s a certificate that says you have the state’s required coverage.
### When You’ll Need One
You’ll need an SR-22 if your license or registration was suspended, which could have happened due to any of the following convictions.
* Unpaid judgment for a car accident
* [Driving under the influence (DUI)](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/dui/)
* Unreported accident that resulted in death, property damage of over $1,000, or bodily injury
* Too many points on your driving record
* [Driving without insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/driving-without-insurance/) or being involved in an accident without insurance
* Reckless driving
* Not paying child support[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-2)
### How to Get an SR-22
Here’s how to get an SR-22 filed, according to Los Angeles County’s Department of Consumer & Business Affairs.
1. Ask your insurance company to file an SR-22 for you.
2. Your agent will send the SR-22 to the DMV.
3. You’ll pay a fee to the DMV via the following mailing address:
* Office of the Director
* Department of Motor Vehicles
* 2415 1st Ave., Mail Station F101
* Sacramento, CA 95818-2606
4. Once the DMV receives your fee and the SR-22, it will reissue your license and reinstate your driving privileges.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-3)
### Cost
You’ll have to pay your insurance company about $25 to file your SR-22, although it can range from $15 to $40. This is a one-time fee, however, and is separate from the DMV charge.
### How Long Do You Need An SR-22?
Typically you’ll need to maintain an SR-22 for three years. However, with more serious violations, such as reckless driving, you may need to uphold your SR-22 for 10 years.
In California, a reckless driving conviction can result in five to 90 days in county jail, a fine between $145 and $1,000, or both, along with a license or registration suspension.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-4)
### Does It Cover Any Car You Drive?
Car insurance follows the car, not the driver, so your SR-22 policy won’t cover any car you drive; just your own (unless it’s non-owner insurance).
## How to Get Cheap Car Insurance With an SR-22
Here are some tips for finding cheap car insurance in California with an SR-22:
1. **Shop around:** Compare quotes from at least three auto insurance providers. Each company determines its rates slightly differently, so one may offer you a cheaper rate than another.
2. **Get pay-per-mile insurance:** If you drive minimally, save money by using [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/pay-per-mile/). You’ll pay a base rate and then a small per-mile fee for the miles you drive.
3. **Buy minimum coverage:** Getting liability-only coverage will result in lower premiums, but keep in mind that it only applies to the injuries and property damages of people outside your car, not you or your passengers. Additionally, if you leased or financed your vehicle, your lender likely requires you to carry comprehensive and collision coverages.
4. **Drive safely:** Maintaining a safe driving record will prevent your insurance rates from rising even higher, drive safely. (Note: due to state regulations, most insurance companies do not offer telematics discounts in California).
5. **Choose a provider that caters to high-risk drivers:** If standard insurers quote you exorbitant rates, or refuse to cover you outrights, get quotes from companies that specialize in insurance for [high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/). Depending on your circumstances, you may pay less with a high-risk insurer than with a standard insurer.
6. **Join the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan (CAARP):** If you’re unable to find insurance you can afford, you can use CAARP as a last resort. This is a state program that will connect you with a provider that will cover you despite your high-risk level.[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-5) You can apply online, through the mail, via email, or over the phone.[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-6)
7. **Apply for California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance:** California’s low cost auto insurance plan (CLCA) is created specifically to make sure drivers are able to meet the state’s auto insurance laws. If you meet the income eligibility requirements and your vehicle is worth less than $25,000, you may qualify.[7](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california-sr-22/#citation-7) In most cases, you will need a good driving record; however, if you need an SR-22 due to nonpayment of child support, you may be eligible. Learn more at mylowcostauto.com.
## Minimum Required Coverage in California
California is increasing its minimum coverage requirements effective January 1, 2025.
Policy effective dates | Bodily injury liability per person | Bodily injury liability per accident | Property damage liability
---|---|---|---
Until Dec. 31, 2024 | $15,000 | $30,000 | $5,000
On or after Jan. 1, 2025 | $30,000 | $60,000 | $15,000
Together, bodily injury and property damage coverage comprise liability coverage. However, to pay for your and your passengers’ injuries and property damages, you’ll need [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/), plus medical payments coverage.
## Conclusion
[Car insurance in California is expensive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/why-car-insurance-expensive/), especially with an SR-22. But with research, you can likely find a provider you can afford. In the event that you can’t, the state offers a high-risk program as a last resort. Low income drivers may also be eligible for California’s CLCA program to make auto insurance more affordable.
Just remember that although [minimum coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/) is the cheapest option, it could cost you more out of pocket if you cause an accident or have losses above the at-fault party’s limits. In this case, we recommend [full coverage car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/full/).
