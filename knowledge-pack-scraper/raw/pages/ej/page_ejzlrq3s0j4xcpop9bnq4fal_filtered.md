The website is not so easy to navigate. There isn’t a way to contact the customer service team directly, and it looks like they are deliberately trying to make it difficult for the customer to get in touch with a real human who can assist them. However, if you miss one day in paying the bill, they are quick to send out a letter to cancel your policy. Their response to that is rapid fire!

## How multi-vehicle car insurance policies work

Multi-car policies work just like single-car policies: You decide on coverage types and coverage limits for the cars you want to insure. Then, your insurance company will cover damages and injuries for claims for all cars you insure with the policy, up to the policy limits.

To get a quote, you just need to provide:

* The makes and models of each car on your policy and possibly their vehicle identification numbers (VINs)
* The types of coverage and coverage limits you need
* How you intend to use the vehicles, including annual mileage
* Information for each driver on your policy, including driver’s license numbers and dates of birth

To qualify for a multi-car policy, you need to have your cars registered at the same address. Depending on the insurer, the cars may also need to belong to the same person. Insurers may limit the maximum number of vehicles allowed on a single policy — usually five or fewer. You can insure each of these vehicles at different comprehensive and collision coverage levels, too, but liability limits are usually the same across all vehicles.

### Can vehicles have different insurance coverage options?

If multiple vehicles are on the same policy, they can’t have different coverage options. Generally, liability and other state-mandated coverages have to be the same across all vehicles on one policy. But you can have different comprehensive and collision coverage options for the different vehicles on your policy.

### Can multi-car insurance policies cover multiple drivers?

While it varies by company, you can typically have multiple people insured under a multi-car policy. Similar to having multiple drivers on a car insurance policy, you can add your partner, driving-eligible children, or another family member to your coverage.

For example, if your teenager uses multiple family cars, you can add them as a named driver on the policies. This may increase your premium, but it would be cheaper than buying your teen their own policy.

An example of when this wouldn’t be necessary is if someone already has their own insurance. If your parents are visiting and want to drive your cars, they don’t need to be named on your policy if they already have insurance.

Some insurers limit the amount of named drivers on your policy or have stipulations like sharing a primary address, so it’s important to talk to an agent before adding another person.

### Other discounts to take advantage of

Remember that you’ll also have access to discounts beyond the multi-car discount. You should try to get all the discounts you qualify for — the more discounts you get, the less you’ll pay for coverage.[[1]](#cite-1) Here are a few to look for:

* ![car in carage](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4f58412d31/garage.svg)

  #### Multi-policy (bundling)

  If you purchase another policy — like homeowners, renters, umbrella, or life insurance — with your auto insurance, your insurer will likely apply a discount for both.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/834da573df/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_023-driving-test.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/834da573df/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_023-driving-test.svg)

  #### Good driver

  Drivers with no at-fault accidents or moving violations in the past three to five years typically get a good driver discount to lower their premiums.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/c323e327d0/expired-lisence.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/c323e327d0/expired-lisence.svg)

  #### Defensive driving course

  Some insurers apply discounts for drivers who complete an approved driver education course.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/24f1697280/car-key.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/24f1697280/car-key.svg)

  #### New car

  Not many insurers offer discounts for people who drive new cars, but you may be eligible for a new-car discount if you’re the vehicle’s first owner and it’s a newer model year. The requirements vary by insurer, so it’s a good idea to call an agent and ask about the details.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg)

  #### Car safety features

  If your vehicle has standard safety features, like anti-lock brakes, airbags, and daytime running lights, you could qualify for a discount.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/6629dc84bb/remote-work-desk.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/6629dc84bb/remote-work-desk.svg)

  #### Students

  Many insurers offer students and young drivers a discount on their car insurance policy if they earn good grades and submit their transcripts to the company. College students may also be eligible for a student-away-at-school discount if they attend a college that’s a certain number of miles away from home.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/fc58ba8be2/robber.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/fc58ba8be2/robber.svg)

  #### Anti-theft devices

  Car theft deterrents include automatically locking doors, steering wheel locks, brake locks, and after-market kill switches. These types of devices for your car can reduce your insurance premiums.[[2]](#cite-2)
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/d980bd9cc4/membership.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/d980bd9cc4/membership.svg)

  #### Military, employer, or affiliation

  If you’re in the military, work as a teacher, or are an alumnus of eligible universities, you may be able to get car insurance discounts with certain insurers.

## Benefits of insuring multiple vehicles on one policy

When you have several cars to insure, it’s almost always worth buying a multi-car policy. They usually offer the lowest cost while also making it easier for you to manage your policy.

* **One payment:** Multi-car insurance allows you to manage all your different policies in just one place, simplifying the process.
* **Shared deductible:** If a single accident damages more than one of your cars, you’ll only have to pay one deductible, saving you time and money.
* **Insurance stacking:** Some states allow drivers to stack uninsured and [**underinsured motorist coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) limits in the event of a claim. If you have uninsured motorist limits of $50,000 per person and $150,000 per accident on two vehicles, you can stack those limits to double the amounts to $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.
* **Significant discount:** Multi-car discounts are one of the [**best car insurance discounts**](/car-insurance/discounts/) available, with some companies providing up to 39% off your total policy cost. Some companies might call this discount a loyalty discount.

### When you shouldn’t insure multiple vehicles on one policy

While taking advantage of a multi-car policy almost always saves you money over time, it may not make sense for every household to insure multiple vehicles on one policy. Here’s when you may consider insuring your vehicles under different policies:

* **You have a classic or vintage car.** Classic cars require special coverage that may have different requirements, such as where to store it, how often you can drive it, and an agreed-upon value, that your current insurance company can’t meet. You may want to buy an auto policy from a company that specializes in insuring classic cars in this case.
* **Someone in your household has a poor driving record.** Insurance companies consider the vehicle’s primary driver’s record when setting premiums. If another driver in your household has a poor driving record, their past mistakes on the road can increase your rates.
* **Your child doesn’t live with you anymore.** When your child is at school, they can stay on your auto policy as long as their primary address is the same as yours. But after graduation and moving into their own place, your child needs their own auto insurance policy.

## How coverage works for a multi-car insurance policy

When you buy multi-car insurance, you can customize coverages for each car on the policy. Here are the coverage options auto insurers typically offer:

* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/169fdfde11/liability-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/169fdfde11/liability-coverage.svg)

  #### Liability

  This covers damages and injuries you cause to other parties in an accident, up to the policy limits. Most states require every driver to purchase liability insurance to legally drive.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg)

  #### Comprehensive

  Usually part of a full-coverage policy, comprehensive insurance provides coverage for vehicle damages in non-collision events. This coverage includes damages from severe weather, falling objects, theft, and vandalism.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/db598219e3/damage-from-aircraft.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/db598219e3/damage-from-aircraft.svg)

  #### Collision

  While liability insurance covers damages and injuries to other parties in an accident you cause, collision insurance covers your vehicle’s damages from an accident, no matter who caused it. This also includes single-car accidents and hitting stationary objects, such as a tree, fence, or light pole. Collision insurance also covers rollover accidents.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/95fa30ac35/insurify-icons-auto-orange-96x96_005-insurance.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/95fa30ac35/insurify-icons-auto-orange-96x96_005-insurance.svg)

  #### Uninsured/underinsured motorist

  Some states require this coverage, and it kicks in when someone without insurance — or without enough insurance to pay for damages and injuries — causes an accident. [**UM/UIM coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) can also pay in case of a hit-and-run or pedestrian accident.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/e30eeeebc5/personal-injury-protection.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/e30eeeebc5/personal-injury-protection.svg)

  #### Personal injury protection (PIP)

  Also a requirement in no-fault states, PIP provides coverage for your passengers’ injuries and lost wages after an accident, regardless of who caused it.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/4c9753bdbe/medical-payments.svg)

  #### Medical payments (MedPay)

  Another insurance requirement in some states, [**MedPay is similar to PIP**](/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/) in that it provides coverage for your and your passengers’ injuries after an accident, even if you caused it.

## Factors that affect the cost of multi-car insurance

The national average cost for a two-car policy is $177 per month for liability coverage and $362 for full coverage, according to Insurify’s proprietary data. But the exact rate you’ll pay depends on a number of factors, including:[[3]](#cite-3)

* **Where you live:** Areas with heavy traffic and high vehicle crime statistics typically have higher insurance rates.
* **The** [**cars you drive**](/car-insurance/vehicle/vehicle-type/)**:** Newer or more expensive cars usually cost more to insure.
* **The types of coverage you carry:** [**Liability coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) (bodily injury and property damage), [**collision coverage**](/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/), comprehensive coverage, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and [**personal injury protection**](/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) (PIP) are among the most common types.
* **Your** [**coverage limits**](/car-insurance/coverage/)**:** The higher your coverage limits, the more you’ll pay.
* **The number of drivers on your policy:** The more people you insure, the more expensive your policy.
* **Driving history:** Drivers with [**clean driving records**](/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) typically pay less than people with at-fault accidents, speeding tickets, or DUIs.
* **Your credit history:** Drivers with good credit usually pay less than drivers with [**bad credit**](/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/).

## Car insurance for multiple vehicles FAQs

If you’re shopping for a multi-vehicle insurance policy, this additional information may help as you’re researching different companies.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Our editorial team analyzed auto insurance companies that sell multi-car policies to assess which offer the best rates, coverage options, customer service, and savings. We prioritized competitive rates, 24/7 customer service, low-mileage discounts or programs, safe driving discounts, homeownership discounts or bundling options, and specialty or supplemental coverages.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Most auto insurance companies have a limit of five cars per policy, meaning you can insure up to five vehicles on a single multi-car policy. But every insurance company has its own rules and policies. Some allow more vehicles per policy, and some allow fewer.

Based on the specific discount, Elephant is the best car insurance company for insuring multiple vehicles. You can save up to 39% on coverage with Elephant. But companies with higher IQ Scores that have good multi-car discounts include GEICO and State Farm. Drivers can save up to 25% with GEICO and up to 20% with State Farm.

In most cases, yes. It’s often cheaper to insure multiple vehicles under one policy since many insurance companies offer a multi-car discount. For example, the [**average cost of liability-only insurance in the U.S.**](/car-insurance/average-car-insurance-cost/) is $170 per month, so insuring two cars with separate policies at this rate would be $340 per month. But with a 25% multi-car discount, the rate for insuring two cars drops to $255 per month, saving drivers around $1,020 annually.

Stacked insurance limits refer to combining the limits from multiple policies. Typically, this applies only to uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage. For example, if you have two cars in your multi-car policy, and each car has $20,000 in UM/UIM coverage, you could stack the two policies to get a total of $40,000 in coverage.

The ability to stack limits varies by state and insurer, so check your local laws or ask an agent to learn more. Only some states allow this practice.
