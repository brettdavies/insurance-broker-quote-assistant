## Why should a renter purchase flood insurance?
[Renters insurance](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/) generally doesn’t cover the repair or replacement of your personal property due to a flood. Replacing all your belongings if they were destroyed from flooding would likely be quite costly. If your rental apartment or home is near a body of water or in an area prone to storms, [flood insurance](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) may help pay for various personal items lost to flooding, such as clothing, digital equipment, mobile phones, furniture, and home décor, in accordance with your policy's limits.
_You don't need to live in a flood-prone area to be at risk. Many flood insurance claims come from low or medium-risk areas._
##  Who's eligible for flood insurance?
A renter's flood insurance policy can be purchased if you live in one of the more than 23,000 communities that participate in the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) (NFIP). Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the NFIP is a program that provides flood insurance in areas that agree to manage their flood risks by implementing regulations designed to reduce the potential for damage to insurable property resulting from a flood. Renters also have the option to buy flood insurance through a private insurer.
## What's not covered by flood insurance for renters?
A renter's flood insurance policy won't cover any damage to the property itself — the property owner's insurance policy typically provides that protection. For those living in below-ground units, their belongings may not be protected — or not covered for their full replacement value — because the location puts the unit at a higher risk of flooding. Learn more about [what flood insurance covers](https://www.progressive.com/answers/flood-101/).
Paper valuables, such as money and stock or bond certificates, are typically not covered by flood insurance. If you're temporarily displaced due to a flood, the costs of a hotel or other temporary housing aren't typically included as part of a flood insurance policy.
## How much does flood insurance for renters cost?
The cost for flood insurance for apartment renters and those who rent other types of properties depends on a number of factors, including your [renters insurance coverage](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/coverages/) limits and whether the unit is located in a floodplain or other high-risk area. If you live in an area that floods often, based on its proximity to a body of water or elevation, you can expect to pay more.
