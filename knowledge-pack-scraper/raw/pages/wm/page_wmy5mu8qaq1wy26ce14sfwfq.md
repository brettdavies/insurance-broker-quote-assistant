## Methodology
Insurance.com commissioned car insurance rates from Quadrant Data Systems in late 2023 for all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Base rates were fielded based on a 40-year-old driver with a clean record and good credit, driving a 2023 Honda Accord LX. Additional rates were fielded for multiple driver profiles including tickets, accidents and various credit tiers. Coverage levels include state minimum, 50/100/50 liability only, and full coverage at 100/300/100 liability limits with $500 deductibles. Rates were fielded from 34,588 ZIP codes and 170 insurance companies.
