**Bankrate’s take:** If you have been deemed a high-risk driver, you may have been required to file an [SR-22 certificate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) with the state. This may also be the case if your license has been suspended in the past. An SR-22 is simply a certificate that is filed by your car insurance company with the DMV on your behalf stating that you carry at least the minimum required insurance to allow you to drive legally in the state. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies offer SR-22s, so if you are required to file one after an accident or other mishap, you may need to change to another insurance company that is willing to process your SR-22.

**Bankrate’s take:** Our rates for teen drivers were determined by looking at averages for a 16-year-old teen who is covered on their parents' policy. Drivers under the age of 18 generally need to be insured on a parent or guardian's policy until they are considered adults, when they reach the age of 18. Even after age 18, young drivers may want to consider staying on their parents' insurance as long as they can because they usually pay less than they would on their own policy. However, depending on the carrier, they may need to live with their parents to qualify for coverage on their policy.

**Bankrate’s take:** A household with a teen driver may want to consider adding an accident forgiveness endorsement to their policy. [Accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/), which is available from many carriers as an add-on to a basic policy, means that you will not see a rate increase following your first at-fault accident. This endorsement is not available with all carriers and some require drivers to earn it with demonstrated safe driving.
