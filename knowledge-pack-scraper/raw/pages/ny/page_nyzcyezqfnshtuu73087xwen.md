##  Cheapest car insurance in Utah for minimum coverage 
When shopping for cheap insurance, Utah drivers may first want to consider how much coverage they need. [Minimum coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/), which refers to the lowest limits you can buy and still drive legally, is often the cheapest option but provides much less financial protection compared to higher limits. Below you can see the cheapest car insurance companies in Utah for minimum coverage and how their average rates compare to the state average cost of $831 per year.

### Minimum coverage requirements for Utah drivers
Drivers in Utah must carry at least a minimum amount of car insurance to legally operate a vehicle. According to [Utah’s auto insurance laws](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title31A/Chapter22/31A-22-S304.html), drivers need to have the following coverage to register their vehicle and legally get behind the wheel:
  * $25,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person
  * $65,000 bodily injury liability coverage per accident
  * $25,000 property damage liability coverage per accident
  * $3,000 personal injury protection (PIP)


A minimum coverage policy is often the cheapest option for Utah drivers. However, insurance experts often recommend that drivers buy higher liability limits for more financial protection. If you have a loan or lease on your vehicle you’ll likely be required to carry full coverage. You may also want to consider full coverage if you don’t have the funds to repair or replace your vehicle out of pocket.
In 2023, the Utah State Legislature voted to raise liability coverage amounts for policies issued or renewed after January 1, 2025. Be aware that starting in 2025, drivers must have the following coverage to meet state insurance requirements:
  * $30,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person
  * $65,000 bodily injury liability coverage per accident
  * $35,000 property damage liability coverage per accident
  * $3,000 personal injury protection (PIP)


##  Cheapest car insurance in Utah for full coverage 
[Full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) generally refers to a policy that has both comprehensive and collision coverage added, which helps pay for damage to your own vehicle after an accident or another covered incident. Full coverage costs an average of $2,188 per year in Utah. Although it is more expensive than minimum coverage, full coverage provides more robust coverage that might save you a significant amount of money in the event of a serious accident or other covered incident that damages your vehicle.

##  Cheapest car insurance in Utah for drivers with prior incidents 
One of the factors that insurers look at seriously when determining your rate is your driving history. Drivers with accidents and tickets on their record are seen as more likely to get into another accident and file claims, so they typically pay higher car insurance rates. Fortunately, some carriers offer lower rates than others to drivers with incidents on their driving records.

### Cheapest insurance company for drivers in Utah with a speeding ticket: **USAA**
A [speeding ticket in Utah](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) is a relatively minor offense compared to other traffic violations, but speeding is still an unsafe driving behavior that can lead to accidents. Consequently, having a speeding ticket conviction on your record will likely cause your car insurance rate to increase, usually for three to five years.

### Cheapest insurance company for drivers in Utah with an at-fault accident: USAA
At-fault collisions can have a big impact on your car insurance premium. Generally, a collision you are responsible for will impact your car insurance premium for five years, but that can vary depending on the location and the severity of the crash. If you have accident forgiveness on your policy prior to the incident, however, you may avoid a [rate hike for your first at-fault crash](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-after-an-accident/). You could consider switching to one of these companies once your claim is closed. These five carriers have the lowest rates for drivers with at-fault accidents in Utah, based on our research.

### Cheapest rates in Utah for high-risk drivers: Progressive
High-risk drivers typically pay the highest car insurance rates due to the potential for a costly claim payout. You might be considered high risk if you have been [convicted of a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/), have a [very low credit score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) or have been caught driving uninsured. Some high-risk drivers need to purchase coverage from a non-standard carrier that has more relaxed underwriting standards. Drivers who are considered high risk may also need to obtain an SR-22 certificate, which is not available from all insurers.
If you’re looking for cheap car insurance in Utah as a high-risk driver, remember that “cheap” is relative. You may be able to find Utah car insurance savings by shopping around, but your premiums will still likely be relatively high. If you have a DUI conviction on your record, you might want to check out the following five carriers:

**Bankrate’s take:** If you have been deemed a high-risk driver, you may have been required to file an [SR-22 certificate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) with the state. This may also be the case if your license has been suspended in the past. An SR-22 is simply a certificate that is filed by your car insurance company with the DMV on your behalf stating that you carry at least the minimum required insurance to allow you to drive legally in the state. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies offer SR-22s, so if you are required to file one after an accident or other mishap, you may need to change to another insurance company that is willing to process your SR-22.
##  Cheapest car insurance for young drivers in Utah 
Your age is a primary factor in most states, including Utah, and young drivers will generally pay higher rates than older drivers. However, shopping around and comparing young driver discounts may help you find [cheap auto coverage for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-adults/) in Utah.

### Cheapest Utah car insurance for insuring a teen driver: Nationwide
When you add a [teen driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) to your policy, your car insurance premium will very likely increase. This is because young drivers lack experience and are more likely to get into accidents than older drivers. However, the premium should start to drop as the driver gets older and gains experience on the road, assuming they keep a clean driving record.
In the meantime, you may want to look for discounts aimed at young drivers, like savings for [getting good grades in school](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/student-discounts/), to save on car insurance in Utah. You can also shop around to find lower rates; the companies below are the cheapest in the state, on average, for married couples adding a 16-year-old to their car insurance policy.

**Bankrate’s take:** Our rates for teen drivers were determined by looking at averages for a 16-year-old teen who is covered on their parents' policy. Drivers under the age of 18 generally need to be insured on a parent or guardian's policy until they are considered adults, when they reach the age of 18. Even after age 18, young drivers may want to consider staying on their parents' insurance as long as they can because they usually pay less than they would on their own policy. However, depending on the carrier, they may need to live with their parents to qualify for coverage on their policy.
### Cheapest car insurance for young drivers with a ticket: Progressive

### Cheapest car insurance for young drivers with an at-fault accident: Progressive

**Bankrate’s take:** A household with a teen driver may want to consider adding an accident forgiveness endorsement to their policy. [Accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/), which is available from many carriers as an add-on to a basic policy, means that you will not see a rate increase following your first at-fault accident. This endorsement is not available with all carriers and some require drivers to earn it with demonstrated safe driving.
### Cheapest car insurance for young drivers with a DUI: Progressive
Young drivers with DUIs will almost certainly need to seek out high-risk auto coverage. You will likely need to shop around a lot to find a carrier that will offer you coverage at a reasonable price.

##  Car insurance discounts in Utah 
If you want to save on your Utah car insurance, seeking out discounts for which you may be eligible can be extremely helpful. Speaking with an agent is one of the best ways to find out what’s on offer that you qualify for. Some common [car insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) include:
  * **Young driver discounts:** Insurers know that car insurance can be expensive for young drivers, and most carriers offer at least one discount to help offset the cost. Common savings for teens and young drivers include good student discounts, student-at-school discounts and driver training discounts.
  * **Safe driver discounts:** If you haven’t had an accident or ticket in three to five years (although this varies by insurer), you may qualify for a safe driver or good driver discount. Some companies also offer claims-free discounts, which apply when you haven’t filed an insurance claim in a specified time frame.
  * **Other discounts:**[Bundling your auto and home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) (or renters or condo insurance, if you aren’t a homeowner) is usually one of the most substantial discounts available. You might also save if you sign up for a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/), elect to get paperless bills and statements, or pay in full for your entire policy term.


##  Frequently asked questions 
  * ######  Why is my Utah car insurance so expensive?
Caret Down Icon
Although average rates in Utah are generally low, you may pay more than the averages based on several factors. One element that insurers take seriously when they are determining rates is your driving history. As you can see from the average rates we've listed above, drivers with speeding tickets, at-fault accidents or a DUI on their record are likely to pay a higher rate for their policy. Where you live also impacts your rate. Drivers who live in urban areas, where congested traffic means a higher rate of accidents, are likely to pay more than those who live in rural areas, all other factors being equal. Other elements that may make your policy expensive include age, credit rating and whether you house your vehicle in a garage or on the street.
