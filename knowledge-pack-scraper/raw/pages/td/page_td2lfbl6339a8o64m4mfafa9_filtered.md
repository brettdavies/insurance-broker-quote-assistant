When you sign up for a Progressive car insurance policy, you receive an ID card that functions as [proof of insurance](/car-insurance/proof-of-insurance/). You can access that card 24/7 through the website and mobile app.

While [Progressive](/reviews/car-insurance/progressive/) sells several types of insurance, from homeowners to renters insurance and life insurance, you won’t regularly need to provide proof of insurance for those types of coverage. Progressive [car insurance](/car-insurance/), however, comes with an insurance card that you should keep on hand at all times. Here’s how to get your Progressive insurance card.

## How to get your Progressive insurance cards

You can download a copy of your Progressive insurance card from your online account or request a copy by mail.

Progressive policyholders can also access a digital insurance card through the company’s mobile app.

* **Online:** Log in to your Progressive account and select “Get your ID card.” You’ll be directed to a page where you can view, save, print or email your ID card.
* **Mail:** You can request a physical copy of your card by logging into your Progressive account or calling an agent. If you have a paperless [discount](/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) on your policy, you could lose it by requesting documents via mail.

As soon as you buy a Progressive insurance policy, you should receive an email with a link to your insurance identification card. Download and print it, then keep a copy in your vehicle as proof of coverage in case you’re pulled over or get in an [accident](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/).

## What’s included on your Progressive insurance card

Your Progressive ID card acts as proof of financial responsibility, showing that you’ve purchased at least the minimum amount of insurance coverage [required](/car-insurance/car-insurance/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) in your state. It usually won’t show your specific coverage selections, limits or rates. Instead, it shows:

* The name and address of your insurance company.
* The company’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number.
* Your policy number.
* Your first and last name.
* Your car’s make, model and [vehicle identification number](/car-help/vehicle-identification-number-vin/) (VIN).
* The policy’s effective date and expiration date.

For more detailed insurance information, such as the exact coverage limits or [deductibles](/car-insurance/car-insurance-deductible/) on your policy, you’ll need to view your [declarations page](/car-insurance/car-insurance-declaration-page/).

## Can you show proof of insurance on your phone?

Every state except for [New Mexico](/car-insurance/new-mexico/) allows drivers to show electronic proof of insurance on their phone during a traffic stop. In other words, if you’re pulled over and asked to show your driver’s license, registration and proof of insurance, you can pull up your insurance ID card on the Progressive app — unless you’re in New Mexico.

Most major car insurance companies — including [GEICO](/reviews/car-insurance/geico/), [Allstate](/reviews/car-insurance/allstate/) and [State Farm](/reviews/car-insurance/state-farm/) — use digital ID cards in addition to traditional physical cards.

## Why do you need your insurance ID card?

Here are three instances when you would need your insurance ID card.

* **If you’re pulled over:** In a traffic stop, a police officer typically requests your driver’s license, registration and proof of insurance.
* **In an accident:** If you’re involved in an accident, you’ll likely need to exchange insurance information with the other driver.
* **Registering and renewing:** Many states require proof of insurance when registering a vehicle or renewing your driver’s license.
