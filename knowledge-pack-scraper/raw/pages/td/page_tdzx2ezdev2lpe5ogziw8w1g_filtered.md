## Providing independence to those who protect it

Since 2013, our annual event has focused on honoring veterans and their families. The program is a strong source of pride for everyone involved.

With more than a decade of giveaways, our Keys to Progress program has supported more than 1,100 veteran recipients from 5 branches of the military.

## Unlocking *potential* with the Keys to Progress® program

From a six-time Iraq war veteran who breaks down in tears at the sight at his new vehicle, to a single mom who sees her kids' faces light up as she's honored for her service, or a veteran non-profit who can finally expand their reach, the Keys to Progress program helps real veterans with real struggles get vehicles they deserve.

SPEAKER

I don't even know what to say.

JOHN MURPHY

We could certainly donate vehicles to any number of causes. Our military does so much for us. By donating these vehicles, we thank them and we honor them.

TRICIA GRIFFITH

Seeing the look on a veteran recipient's face when their new vehicle is revealed is such a special moment because the gratitude we feel becomes tangible to them.

MARY MAHONEY

We'll never come close to giving back to those men and women what they truly deserve. But we are so honored to present a small token of our gratitude for the services and sacrifices made to keep our country safe.

## Program Information

### Event locations

Vehicle giveaways primarily take place at various Progressive offices and Enterprise Rent-A-Car locations across the United States. The Keys to Progress veteran vehicle giveaway program distributes vehicles once a year, typically in November (with the exception of the fall truck giveaway).

### Program affiliates

We work with military and charity organizations to find veterans in need of a vehicle and purchase recent-model used vehicles from Enterprise Rent-A-Car to give away. We also work closely with these organizations to administer this program every year:

* [1-800-Charity Cars](https://800charitycars.org/)
* [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](https://www.enterprise.com/en/about.html?icid=footer.company-_-about-_-ENUS.NULL)
* [Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc.](https://www.iaai.com/)
* [Veracity Research Co. Investigations (VRC)](https://vrcinvestigations.com/)

### Application information

The Keys to Progress veteran vehicle giveaway program provides support to those in need in the following areas:

1. **Personal transportation support:** Our hope is to offer a little relief and improve the lives of military men and women facing tough personal circumstances for which a vehicle may help—from finding employment or transporting children to and from school to getting to medical appointments or visiting loved ones.

   **The application window has closed for 2025.**

1. **Commercial vehicle needs:** Through this program we have also gifted vehicles to help veteran-focused organizations and non-profits, as well as veteran-owned small businesses.

   **The application window has closed for 2025.**

1. **Class 8 truck operator giveaway:** Since 2018, we have periodically gifted a Class 8 semi-truck through this program, as well. Three deserving veterans so far have received Class 8 vehicles to help them start their own trucking operations.

   **We will not be hosting a Class 8 truck giveaway in 2025.**

For additional information on eligibility, please see [FAQs](https://www.progressive.com/about/purpose/keys-to-progress-get-involved/).
