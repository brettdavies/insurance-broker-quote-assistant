*USAA is only available to military members, veterans and their families.
**Just because a company has cheap rates overall, that doesn't mean it'll be the cheapest or best company for you.** It's always a good idea to [shop around How to find the best insurance for 50-year-olds ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/50-year-old-car-insurance#shop "How to find the best insurance for 50-year-olds") and compare quotes from different companies. That lets you find the cheapest rate for you.
## Does car insurance go down at 50?
On average, 50-year-olds are charged $20 less each month for full coverage than 30-year-olds.
Because most 50-year-olds have much more driving experience, their rates tend to be lower than rates for younger drivers. Rates are usually fairly steady for most people after age 45.

### Car insurance rates for drivers over 50
Car insurance rates go down as you age and get more driving experience. For most people, rates stay fairly steady between 45 and 65.
**However, car insurance rates start to go up again when you reach your 70s.** That's because senior drivers statistically have a higher risk for getting into accidents.

## How do car insurance prices differ for 50-year-old men and women?
At age 50, men and women usually pay the same amount for car insurance.
When they're younger, men often pay more than women, but by age 30 that gap has closed. Past age 30, men and women usually pay about the same amount for car insurance until age 75 and beyond. At that point, men start to pay a bit more for car insurance again.

## Car insurance costs for 50-year-olds by state
Car insurance rates change depending on where you live.
Your rate might be higher if you live in an area with a high cost of living, for example, because it's more expensive to repair or replace cars. Rates are also often higher if you live in an area where accidents are more common.
For example, in New York, full coverage costs $205 per month, on average, for a 50-year-old. But in Pennsylvania, the same coverage costs an average of $156 per month.
State | Average rate  
---|---  
[Illinois](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-illinois "/best-cheap-car-insurance-illinois") | $163

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/compare-2)
### Shop around
Car insurance companies set their rates differently, which means rates can differ by hundreds of dollars per month, depending on the company you choose. Shopping around and [comparing car insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Rates") can help you find the lowest price for the coverage you need.
While you're comparing quotes, it's a good idea to compare customer service, too. Choosing a company with good service can make a big difference, especially if you have to [file a car insurance claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim").
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/piggy-bank)
### Review your discounts
While you're shopping for a new car insurance policy, it's a good idea to look at the discounts a company offers. Even if you already have a policy that you're happy with, reviewing the discounts you're getting and the discounts your company offers can help you find additional savings.
The biggest discount is usually for [bundling your car and home](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"), condo or renters insurance together. You might also save by paying your full six-month or annual rate in full, going paperless and not having claims on your record.
