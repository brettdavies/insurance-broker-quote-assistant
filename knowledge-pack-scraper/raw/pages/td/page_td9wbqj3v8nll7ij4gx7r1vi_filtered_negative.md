Car insurance companies set their rates differently, which means rates can differ by hundreds of dollars per month, depending on the company you choose. Shopping around and [comparing car insurance rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Rates") can help you find the lowest price for the coverage you need.
While you're comparing quotes, it's a good idea to compare customer service, too. Choosing a company with good service can make a big difference, especially if you have to [file a car insurance claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "A Guide To Filing An Auto Insurance Claim").
The biggest discount is usually for [bundling your car and home](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"), condo or renters insurance together. You might also save by paying your full six-month or annual rate in full, going paperless and not having claims on your record.
To find the average cost of car insurance and the cheapest rates for 50-year-olds, ValuePenguin got quotes from  four of the most populated states in the U.S. The rates are for 50-year-old men and women with a 2015 Honda Civic EX, good credit and no history of accidents or tickets.
