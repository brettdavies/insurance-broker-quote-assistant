Best Overall
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Its new car replacement coverage lasts five years instead of the standard two to three years that others offer.
  * Discount for hybrid or electric vehicles.
  * Rideshare insurance endorsement available for Lyft and Uber drivers.
  * Very low level of car insurance complaints logged against Travelers with state insurance departments.


Cons
  * Doesn’t offer SR-22 insurance.
  * Received only a C grade from repair specialists for its claim repair processes.
  * Available in only 42 states.


We’re impressed by Travelers’ low rates, wide variety of coverage options and decent digital experience. These elements combined to push Travelers to the top of our rankings. Travelers’ rates are well below the nationwide average for every driver profile we analyzed, making it a terrific company to shop rates with. Upgrade coverage packages allow you to customize your policy, such as Travelers’ Responsible Driver Plan that includes accident forgiveness and minor violation forgiveness.

Best for Claims Handling
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Superb rates for good drivers and drivers with issues, like a speeding ticket or accident on their record.
  * Low rates for teens, young adults and seniors.
  * Erie’s Rate Lock freezes your premium so it stays the same year after year.
  * Great average discount of 10% for paying in full.
  * Low level of auto insurance complaints made against Erie to state insurance departments.


Cons
  * Only available in 12 states.
  * Its digital experience is just OK. Its app received low marks from users and its website lacks a live chat feature.
  * You can obtain a quote online, but you must connect with an agent to buy a policy.
  * Its usage-based insurance program, YourTurn, doesn’t offer a discount for safe driving but rewards through gift cards to various retailers.


Erie stands out for excelling in handling claims. It received the highest grade (A-) among the insurers we evaluated, based on grades from auto body specialists for its collision repair claims process. And 90% of Erie customers we surveyed who have filed a claim were satisfied with the claims process, that’s the highest satisfaction rate in our survey. Erie also offers great rates for many driver types and provides a wide range of coverage options, with some automatically included at no extra cost.

Best Rates for the General Public
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Has good rates for teens added to parents’ policies and senior drivers ages 65 to 80.
  * Its usage-based insurance program, SmartRide, offers a potential discount of up to 40% at renewal if your driving scores well.
  * Its pay-per-mile program, SmartMiles, can save you up to 10% if you have low mileage.
  * Low level of car insurance complaints made against Nationwide to state insurance regulators.
  * Has a Spanish version of its website.


Cons
  * Doesn’t offer rideshare insurance.
  * Poor digital experience, in part because we were unable to obtain online quotes.
  * Rates for state minimum car insurance are slightly higher than the national average.
  * Received a mediocre C grade from collision repair specialists for its claim procedures.


We like Nationwide because it offers the lowest rates available to the general public for good drivers, those with poor credit or a speeding ticket and those who have caused an accident with injury. (USAA is slightly cheaper for a few of the driver profiles, but it sells exclusively to the military community.) Nationwide also has a terrific lineup of coverage options to tailor a policy to your specific needs, such as accident and minor violation forgiveness, new car replacement and a vanishing deductible if you don’t make claims.

Best for Military Members and Veterans
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Offers accident forgiveness, new car replacement and rideshare insurance coverage.
  * Excellent rates for teens and young adult drivers.
  * Great rates for senior drivers ages 65 to 80.
  * Offers pay-per-mile insurance through Noblr, a USAA company.
  * Available Nationwide.


Cons
  * Eligibility is limited to veterans, active members of the military and their immediate families.
  * Complaint level about USAA auto insurance is only about average.
  * Does not offer gap insurance unless your car loan is through USAA.
  * Has a low grade (D+) from collision repair specialists for its claims processes.


USAA stands out for its wide range of coverage options and discounts designed specifically for military members. For example, there’s a 15% discount if you garage your car on a military base. And if you store your vehicle during deployment, you can save as much as 60%.

Great for Drivers With Poor Credit
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Rates for good drivers are lower than the national average.
  * Low level of complaints made against Geico car insurance to state insurance departments.
  * Low insurance costs for senior drivers ages 65 to 80.
  * Has a very good digital experience, with a helpful live chat and Spanish version of its website.


Cons
  * Rates for drivers with a DUI are higher than average.
  * Received an unexceptional grade of C- from collision repair experts for its claims procedures.


Geico’s competitive rates make it a strong contender for many types of drivers, especially those with poor credit. Geico makes it easy to get quotes online and is available nationwide. But its coverage options are somewhat limited: It doesn’t offer new car replacement, gap insurance, rideshare insurance or a vanishing deductible.

Best for Accident Forgiveness
Pros & Cons
Our Expert Take
Consumer Sentiment Index
Pros
  * Offers vanishing deductible.
  * Provides rideshare insurance, nonowner car insurance and SR-22 filings.
  * Low level of complaints made to state insurance departments.
  * Available nationwide and you can get a quote and buy a policy online.


Cons
  * No new car replacement coverage.
  * Received only a C grade for the last four years from auto repair experts for its collision claim process.
  * Progressive’s usage-based program (Snapshot) may get you a decent discount, but your rates could increase instead if your driving score is low. Progressive says rates go up for 20% of drivers who use Snapshot.


We like that Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness to help keep your rates from increasing if you’ve caused an accident. Many companies offer one type of accident forgiveness, if that. Also, Progressive offers competitive rates for a variety of drivers, including having the cheapest rates for drivers with a DUI conviction among the companies we analyzed. Its attractive rates span across age groups, too, with lower-than-average rates for teens, young adults and seniors. Low-cost rates, combined with a good variety of coverage options, make it worth checking out.

Progressive car insurance customers praise it for providing competitive rates at first. It’s a popular choice for drivers switching from other insurers like Geico and USAA. However, many customers complain about issues with Progressive’s claims handling and significant rate hikes upon renewal, undermining the initial savings.

### Best for Accident Forgiveness: Progressive
[Progressive](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-car-insurance-review/) offers three types of accident forgiveness to help prevent rate hikes after an accident. That’s beneficial because our analysis found that rates go up 50% on average after an accident with injury and 48% after a property damage accident. 
Some competitors don’t offer accident forgiveness while others have just one option. Progressive offers three that don’t cost you extra. Here’s what Progressive offers for accident forgiveness: 
  * **Small accident forgiveness.** Makes it so your rates won’t go up for claims of $500 or less. Automatically included at the start of your policy (in most states). 


  * **Large accident forgiveness.** Keeps your rates from rising for accident claims of over $500. Earned after being with Progressive for five years and having no accidents or violations on your record during that time. Part of their Loyalty rewards program. 


  * **Purchased accident forgiveness.** Can be used on a large accident before you qualify for the earned accident forgiveness coverage or can be used if you have another eligible claim after already using your loyalty accident forgiveness coverage during your current policy period. 


### Best for Family Discounts: Westfield
Compared to other top-rated companies, [Westfield](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/review/westfield-car-insurance-review/) has an excellent assortment of discounts so family members can save on auto insurance. It offers a family discount, next generation discount and companion car insurance discount.

#### Shop Around Frequently
When it comes to auto insurance shopping advice, early, often and regularly are the three watchwords to remember. I recommend making insurance shopping a regular exercise and not once a decade, when you trade in a vehicle or only when rates go up. Take advantage of all your resources—call your company to ask for discounts, use the internet to get multiple quotes, ask a local agent to describe options and don’t forget to ask your family and neighbors.

#### Don’t Overlook Small Insurers
I recommend looking at companies of all sizes when searching for the best insurance company. If you count out small insurers, you may miss out on a company that offers good coverage perks and superb rates.

#### Confirm There’s a Mobile App
If digital experience is important to you, make sure the insurer you’re considering has a mobile app. Believe it or not, not all insurers do! I like to have the ability to show my insurance ID card from my phone, for example.

#### Don’t Skimp on Liability Insurance
With an increasingly litigious society, I think it’s very important to make sure you have generous liability insurance. If you haven’t paid much attention to this line item on your declarations page, I recommend taking a look. You want enough liability insurance to equal your net worth, which is essentially what you can be sued for. Buy [umbrella insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-umbrella-insurance-companies/) for extra liability insurance at a good price.

#### Be Careful With Usage-Based Insurance
Auto insurance companies may recommend that you join their [usage-based auto insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usage-based-insurance/) program to get discounts. I’d say this isn’t a good choice if you like your privacy. Your data could be shared with others and may affect future car insurance quotes and rates. Also, most people in these telematic programs don’t drive well enough in the eyes of insurers to get a significant discount.

#### Consider Rental Reimbursement Insurance
I think [rental reimbursement insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement/) is an underappreciated coverage. Car repair times have been going up. Your vehicle could easily be in the shop for a collision repair for three weeks or more, waiting to get worked on and waiting for parts. This coverage can help pay for a rental, so you’re not footing the whole bill yourself.

## How To Buy Car Insurance
Here are six steps to help you navigate the car insurance buying process.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Review-policy@2x-1.svg) |  **Determine Your Car Insurance Needs** You must decide [how much car insurance you need](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-need/). This includes determining your liability limits and whether you need full coverage, which covers your car.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rideshare@2x.svg) |  **Gather Driver and Vehicle Information** You’ll need to share personal information with insurers to get quotes and buy car insurance. That includes the names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers and driving histories for every household driver. You’ll also share the make, model and VIN for every vehicle you want to insure.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Compare@2x-2.svg) |  **Comparison Shop for Car Insurance** Auto insurance costs vary greatly from one company to the next for the same coverage, so shopping around lets you find the best car insurance company for your specific needs. You can shop online or call agents to get a quote. Getting quotes can be fairly easy if you’re ready with driver and car information and know what coverage you want.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Car-insurance-policy-1.svg) |  **Buy Your Auto Insurance Policy** You can buy online with many auto insurers, but some require contacting an agent. If you’ve already received a quote, finishing up the process and buying typically doesn’t take much longer. Having your information handy speeds up the process, so that it can take less than half an hour to get a quote and buy with some insurers.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Calender-money-1.png) |  **Know Your Policy’s Start Date** Ensure you know the date and time your car insurance policy will become active. Your policy will be effective immediately upon payment with some auto insurers. With others, it can take a few days to start.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/paperless@2x.svg) |  **Cancel Your Previous Policy** If you’re [switching car insurance companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-to-switch-car-insurance/), you can cancel your previous policy after your new policy is active. Don’t cancel your old policy until the new policy is in place, or you face penalties for a gap in coverage.  
## How Much Does Car Insurance Cost?
[Car insurance costs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) an average of $179 a month, based on our analysis of full coverage rates. That comes to $2,149 a year on average for an auto policy that pays if you harm others in an auto accident and covers your car if damaged in an accident or by severe weather, fire or theft.
Pro Tip
State minimum car insurance costs an average of $53 a month. A minimum car insurance policy costs much less—only $631 a year on average—because it doesn’t provide coverage for your car.
## Methodology
To identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, collision repair grades from auto body professionals and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit and drivers caught without insurance.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Car insurance coverage options (20% of score):** Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer:
  * Accident forgiveness
  * Gap insurance
  * New car replacement
  * Nonowners policies
  * Usage-based insurance
  * Pay-per-mile insurance
  * Rideshare insurance
  * SR-22s
  * Vanishing deductibles


Source: Forbes Advisor research.
**Complaints (15% of score):** We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.
Source: [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
**Collision repair (5% of score):** We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
Source: CRASH Network’s [Insurer Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.

**Digital experience (5% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated car insurers on:
  * Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple.
  * If there’s a useful website search function.
  * If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
  * If there’s a Spanish version of the website.
  * If you can get a quote online.

**Likelihood to recommend car insurers to others (5% of score) and satisfaction with customer service and price (5% of score):** We surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company.
