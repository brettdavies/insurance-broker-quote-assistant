Before driving the mountainous highways and long, scenic roads of Colorado, make sure you have the right auto insurance coverage. When you're getting car insurance quotes in Colorado, check out all Progressive has to offer. Learn more about coverage options, minimum requirements in the Centennial State, and available discounts for reliable, affordable auto insurance in Colorado.
## What are Colorado's minimum auto insurance requirements? 
Drivers in Colorado are required to have [auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) — [bodily injury (BI) liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage (PD) liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/) — at the following minimum car insurance limits:
### Coverage
Coverage |  What it covers |  Minimum amount  
---|---|---  
Bodily injury liability  |  What it covers Injuries you cause to others in an accident |  Minimum amount $25,000 in bodily injury per person   
$50,000 per accident  
Property damage liability  |  What it covers Damage you cause to other people's property in an accident |  Minimum amount $15,000 per accident  
Colorado also requires insurers to offer [uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) bodily injury coverage with the following limits, though you may reject or lower these coverages if you do not want them. You'll need to reject UM/UIM BI with a signed form.
### Coverage
Coverage |  What it covers |  Minimum amount  
---|---|---  
UM/UIM bodily injury  |  What it covers Your medical expenses an uninsured or underinsured driver causes |  Minimum amount $25,000 in bodily injury per person   
$50,000 per accident  
UM/UIM property damage  |  What it covers Damage to your property an uninsured or underinsured driver causes |  Minimum amount $15,000 per accident  
While these are Colorado's minimum required car [insurance limits](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-limits/), more coverages and higher limits may better protect your family's financial well-being. Learn [how much car insurance you may need](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) based on your circumstances and preferences.  

### Is Colorado a no-fault state? 
No. Colorado is an at-fault state, which means the party responsible for an accident must cover the other party's injuries. Learn more about [what happens if you're at fault in an accident](https://www.progressive.com/answers/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/).
## How much is car insurance in Colorado? 
Car insurance costs an average of $97.30 per month in Colorado, for a liability-only policy from Progressive.[*Read the associated disclosure for this claim.](https://www.progressive.com/auto/state/colorado-car-insurance/#ToolTipDialog)
That said, your premium will depend on many [car insurance cost factors](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-car-insurance-cost/) unique to you like where you live, your driving history, the limits and coverages you choose, and the discounts you qualify for.

Pro tip:
Save when you bundle! One way to get cheap car insurance in Colorado is to combine your auto and home policies with Progressive — new customers who save [bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.progressive.com/insurance/bundling/) save over 25% on average nationwide.[†Read the associated disclosure for this savings claim.](https://www.progressive.com/auto/state/colorado-car-insurance/#ToolTipDialog)
## Additional car insurance coverages to consider
In additional to Colorado's required coverages, most car leases and loans require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/). Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, gets stolen, or is otherwise damaged in a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after an accident you're responsible for.
Explore all our [car insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/) and our [car insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/calculator/) to find which coverages are recommended for you.
