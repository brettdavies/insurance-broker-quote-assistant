Transcript or report card. It's verified once every two years (at least at my old company).
You can give it to your agent if applicable, or you should be able to upload online. Obviously the student needs to be on the insurance and it will be set to no longer be applicable around age 24.
No, you can't say "lol they're a good student I promise 🤞🤞"

Most companies accept the most recent grade card. Some will accept documentation from the guidance or registrar's office as to the student's GPA or deans list status. Check with your agent or insurer as to what your carrier's acceptable documentation is as it varies by company.

USAA requires your student to be full-time, 25yo or younger and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, with online transcript as proof. It is checked upon policy renewal every 6 months.
