Pros and Cons of Disclosing Policy Limits in California | Fund Capital America

 

 

[Skip to content](#content)

One common question policyholders face is whether they are required to disclose their policy limits. Usually, this happens when dealing with personal injury claims or insurance negotiations in California.

[Policy limits](https://fundcapitalamerica.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-policy-limits-settlement/) refer to the maximum amount an insurance company will pay for a claim under a specific policy. Understanding your rights and obligations regarding disclosure can help you facilitate settlements and protect your financial interests.

## Are Policyholders Required to Disclose Their Policy Limits in California?

In California, policyholders are not generally required to disclose their insurance policy limits. Unless, they are legally compelled to do so. However, there are specific circumstances where disclosure may be necessary or beneficial:

* **If a Written Request is Made** – Under [California Insurance Code Section 791.13](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/insurance-code/ins-sect-791-13/), insurance companies must disclose policy limits in third-party claims if requested in writing.
* **During Litigation** – If a lawsuit has been filed, policy limits may need to be disclosed through the legal discovery process.
* **When Required by Contract** – Some insurance policies or agreements may include terms that necessitate disclosure.
* **To Facilitate Settlement Negotiations** – In certain cases, revealing policy limits can help expedite negotiations and prevent unnecessary litigation.

## Pros of Disclosing Policy Limits

### Encourages Fair and Efficient Settlements

Providing policy limits can lead to quicker resolutions by setting realistic expectations. If the claimant understands the maximum amount available, they may be more willing to settle within those limits instead of pursuing lengthy litigation.

### Avoids Unnecessary Legal Battles

If claimants are unaware of the coverage limits, they may demand an amount far exceeding what the policy covers. This could result in unnecessary lawsuits and increased legal costs. Therefore, disclosing limits can help both parties focus on a fair settlement.

### Builds Trust and Prevents Bad Faith Claims

California insurance laws emphasize good faith practices. Transparency in sharing policy limits can demonstrate cooperation and prevent accusations of acting in bad faith. Also, this prevents insurers or policyholders from further liability.

## Cons of Disclosing Policy Limits

### May Lead to Higher Settlement Demands

Once the claimant knows the policy limit, they may automatically demand the full amount. Even if the case does not warrant it. Hence, this could create additional pressure on the policyholder and the insurance company.

### Could Encourage More Aggressive Legal Action

Plaintiffs’ attorneys may use the disclosed policy limits as leverage to push for a higher settlement. If they believe the policy provides significant coverage, they may be less willing to negotiate and more likely to take the case to court.

### Strategic Advantage in Withholding Limits

Since California does not require automatic disclosure of policy limits, keeping this information private can serve as a negotiation strategy. If a claimant does not know the limits, they may be more open to accepting a reasonable settlement.

## When Should You Disclose Your Policy Limits?

The decision to disclose policy limits should be made carefully, considering the specific circumstances of your case.

**You may want to disclose limits when:**

* The damages clearly exceed the policy limits, making an early settlement more likely.
* There is a potential risk of a bad faith claim if limits are withheld.
* The claimant is likely to negotiate in good faith when transparency is provided.

**However, you may choose to withhold policy limits if:**

* The claim amount is uncertain, and revealing limits could lead to inflated demands.
* You want to maintain a strategic advantage in settlement discussions.
* Your insurer advises against disclosure for legal or financial reasons.

## What You Should Know

As a policyholder in California, you are not automatically required to disclose your policy limits, but there are situations where it may be beneficial or necessary. Weighing the pros and cons of disclosure can help you navigate the claims process effectively. Consulting with an experienced insurance attorney can provide clarity on whether disclosure is in your best interest and how to approach negotiations strategically.
