the Midwest is rapidly trying to join in that fun.
I'm in MO/KS, and roughly 2/3 of my homeowners carriers aren't taking any new business right now (and haven't been for 12+ months now, with no change likely in 2025)
Its ridiculous

I work for an insurance broker, I met with one of the major carriers we work with about 6 months ago. According to them the Midwest has actually already overtaken the east or west coast in terms of the annual dollar amount of damage caused by major disasters. It’s not just tornados in the Midwest, hail is a huge problem that people don’t think about

I am a retired Corporate Risk Manager for a major utility and I clearly recall a breakout session on the future Climate Crisis at a RIMS conference around the 2004-2006 time frame and it was discussed that in 20 years this very crisis was going to happen. And look, here we are.

Generally, businesses make more money by _OBTAINING_ customers rather than _GETTING RID_ of customers.
Is the simple story here that there's a mismatch between what State Farm expects to pay and what it's allowed to charge?
For example:
* State Farm estimates the annual expected cost for insuring property X is $15,000.
* For whatever reason (state government or market conditions), State Farm can only charge $14,000 for property X.
* => State Farm decides it won't underwrite insurance on X.

> Is the simple story here that there's a mismatch between what State Farm expects to pay and what it's allowed to charge?
That's probably part of it...but I suspect the real story is more complicated.
I wouldn't be surprised if part of the story is also capacity and [reinsurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Florida+insurance+reinsurance&cId=06a72429-90b7-421f-9992-e2821f995b50&iId=5ff5713c-2e1e-4e61-8d07-d9f28335f8eb).
(Disclaimer: I do not work from State Farm. I don't know what's going on in their decision-making. What I'm about to write is based on what I do at a different insurer, one that doesn't write personal lines in the US.)
Insurers have to keep a pile of money on hand, over and above the money they collect in premium and the money they set aside for claims that have occurred, just in case something really bad happens. There are regulatory standards regarding this, and some companies choose to be even more conservative. But, for the sake of argument, let's say that an insurer wants to keep enough extra cash on hand such that there's only a 0.somethingsmall% chance that they won't have the cash on hand to continue as a business in any given year.
Reinsurance can make a big dent in the size of the pile of money needed to satisfy that 0.something% constraint. In the past few years, after some nasty global losses, an increased awareness of the implications of climate change, and some investors pulling out now that bonds are paying more in interest, reinsurers have increased the amount they charge and decreased the amount of exposure they're willing to take on.
Some insurers are probably finding that with the reduced amount of reinsurance they're able to get/afford, they're now bumping into that 0.something% limit...in which case, they either need to find more money to add to their war chest, or they need to get off some of the risks that are causing that constraint to be violated.
In addition to that...because of why insurers keep that much money on hand...there are some pretty severe constraints on how it can be invested. There's usually an expectation that such a pile of money will make a bit more income than can be earned within those constraints (although I think this is less of a concern for State Farm, considering it's a mutual company). The difference in "what can be earned given restrictions on investments" and "what should be earned" has to be loaded into the profit loads factored into the rates being charged. And sometimes, especially in Florida, regulators and insurers don't see eye-to-eye on that mechanic.
If an insurer can't pay for the capital being tied up, it needs to get off the risks that are causing it to require that much capital.

I have some education in actuarial science and I’ve worked for an insurance company but I’m by no means an expert on the topic. When insuring people or property an insurance company really has to balance the types of those it insurers. If higher risk properties are too large a % of their exposure, it may be impossible to insure enough lower risk properties to be able to hold enough premium to pay when disasters happen. You simple cannot price some of these areas to ever break even, and the number of low risk homes to insure to make up for it are harder and harder for insurers to win the business of.
I think over the next 10-20 years, the world is going to have to deal with the fact that the losses are too great in some areas of the country to continue building and living in.

Sorry to hear this, but you can thank your DOI commissioner. Carriers decided they can’t keep sustaining underwriting losses in certain areas states because the commissioners wouldn’t allow rates to increase to match the risk. Florida, California are two states that need to work with carriers better. California seems to be getting wiser, but unfortunately many homeowners were left stranded.
