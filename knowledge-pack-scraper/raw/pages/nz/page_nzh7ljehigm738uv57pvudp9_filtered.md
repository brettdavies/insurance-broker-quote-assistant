## What are Colorado's minimum auto insurance requirements?

### Coverage

| Coverage | What it covers | Minimum amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bodily injury liability | What it covers Injuries you cause to others in an accident | Minimum amount $25,000 in bodily injury per person   $50,000 per accident |
| Property damage liability | What it covers Damage you cause to other people's property in an accident | Minimum amount $15,000 per accident |

Colorado also requires insurers to offer [uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) bodily injury coverage with the following limits, though you may reject or lower these coverages if you do not want them. You'll need to reject UM/UIM BI with a signed form.

### Coverage

| Coverage | What it covers | Minimum amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UM/UIM bodily injury | What it covers Your medical expenses an uninsured or underinsured driver causes | Minimum amount $25,000 in bodily injury per person   $50,000 per accident |
| UM/UIM property damage | What it covers Damage to your property an uninsured or underinsured driver causes | Minimum amount $15,000 per accident |

While these are Colorado's minimum required car [insurance limits](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-limits/), more coverages and higher limits may better protect your family's financial well-being.

## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

In additional to Colorado's required coverages, most car leases and loans require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/). Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, gets stolen, or is otherwise damaged in a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after an accident you're responsible for.
