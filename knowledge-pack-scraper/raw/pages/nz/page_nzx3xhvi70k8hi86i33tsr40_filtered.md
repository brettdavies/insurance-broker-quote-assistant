# State Farm basically pulled out of FL

Purchasing a new home and reached out to agent to get new quote. They said State Farm has a new policy they will not insure any home in Florida built before 2021. Been with them for 10 years and I will have to go somewhere else now….its crazy too I live 10 minutes from Alabama.

Edit: Thank you for all the responses. Lots of great insight here. For those looking at the post wanting to blame hurricanes and Florida weather I encourage you to look through all the responses. It seems the insurance problem is nationwide and Florida and the rest of the gulf and east coast are not the largest hazard area surprisingly. Furthermore there seems to be a huge issue with fraud, roofing grifters in Florida particularly.
