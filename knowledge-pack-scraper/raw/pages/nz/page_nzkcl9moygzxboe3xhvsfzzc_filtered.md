# Good Student Discount Question

Hi Everyone, I have a few questions about Good Student Discounts for those who are insured with larger companies such as State Farm, Progressive, Allstate, Geico, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, Farmers, AAA, Chubb, USAA, and Travelers.

-What do you have to provide for a Good Student Discount? (Physical grades, transcripts, Dean's list letter, etc...)

-Do you have to physically send in the documentation (mail or email), or can you upload it to a portal on their site?

-Does anybody have the ability with their company to sign an attestation or a "promise" that they are telling the truth, and their student gets the grades to qualify WITHOUT sending in documentation?

-As a bonus question, do everyone's qualifications include things like a "B" average, top 20% of the class, active student, signature from school professional, and a full-time student status?

Thank you for the help! Very appreciated! :)
