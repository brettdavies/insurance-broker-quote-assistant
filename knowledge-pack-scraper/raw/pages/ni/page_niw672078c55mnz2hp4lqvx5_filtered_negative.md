For example, State Farm [endorsement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-endorsements-scheduling "/homeowners-insurance-endorsements-scheduling") covers $15,000 in combined cyber extortion and cyber attack damages for $25 per year. This endorsement, named Cyber Event, Identity Restoration and Fraud Loss Coverage, also covers policyholders for up to $50,000 for identity restoration expenses and fraud losses. This provides individuals with more than enough protection for the average cyber crime cost at an affordable price.
Coverage for financial loss as a result of identity theft, stolen bank funds or fraudulent use of credit cards or checks can either come from aa standalone identity theft coverage policy or an [identity theft endorsement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "/homeowners-insurance-coverage") for a homeowners insurance policy. Not allidentity theft coverage protects against the wider range of risks posed by cyber security threats.
One of the most prominent insurers to offer comprehensive cyber protection is State Farm, with its Cyber Event, Identity Restoration and Fraud Loss coverage. This coverage can be purchased as an add-on to State Farm home or [cheapest renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies").
Otherwise, personal cyber insurance is available as a stand-alone policy or as add-on coverage from a set of smaller insurers, or from a select group of major insurers who sell [high-value home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-value-home-insurance "/high-value-home-insurance"). This is insurance only for those who have homes approaching $1 million in value or more.

In addition to many of the standard coverages, [Arbella](https://www.valuepenguin.com/arbella-auto-insurance-review "Arbella insurance review") also offers data breach protection.
