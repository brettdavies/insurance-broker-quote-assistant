* [Chubb](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/local/florida#chubb) has the cheapest sample rate for Florida at about $1,699 per year, according to our cost analysis. However, state premium data was not available for every company.
* Florida is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes and other extreme weather, but standard home insurance does not cover flood damage.
* For houses that are too high-risk for coverage from the regular market, the state’s insurer of last resort is Citizens Property Insurance Corporation.
Florida’s hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, hitting its peak from mid-August to mid-October. Make sure you have sufficient wind and flood coverage to protect your home from [hurricane damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-hurricane-damage).

Amica ranks at [No. 1 nationally](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance) for its coverage and cheap average rates. We did not have enough rate data to calculate a sample Florida premium due to the company’s low market share in the state. In our national rating, Amica’s average base cost is $97 per month for a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage and $100,000 liability.
You can upgrade to the Platinum Choice policy for premium home insurance with more inclusions. Flood insurance requires a separate policy written by the federally backed [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.floodsmart.gov/).

USAA has more comprehensive home insurance than most competitors, but it’s exclusive to members, who must have an eligible connection to the military or a qualifying federal agency.
Because of its low market share in Florida, we could not calculate a sample rate at the state level, but its national monthly premium is about $130, making it one of the cheapest providers in our overall ratings.

If you live in a low or moderate flood zone, you may be able to get Auto-Owners’ inland flood endorsement added to your homeowners policy instead of purchasing a separate flood insurance policy.

## Florida FAIR Plan for Homeowners Who Are Denied Coverage
If you have difficulty securing insurance coverage because your home is considered high-risk, the Florida FAIR Plan offers state-backed homeowners insurance through [Citizens Property Insurance Corporation](https://www.citizensfla.com/). This last-resort option requires you to show that you were unable to get standard coverage and is typically more expensive.
**U.S. News Tip:** Adding certain safety features to your home may help you become eligible for insurance from the regular market.

## Coverage Options for Natural Disasters in Florida
#### Windstorms
Standard home insurance in Florida typically includes coverage for [windstorm damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/windstorm-insurance). However, your policy may have a separate deductible for windstorm or hurricane damage.
#### Floods
Flooding from excessive rainfall or coastal storm surges is common in Florida but not covered by home insurance. You must purchase a separate flood insurance policy written by the NFIP or a private company.
#### Sinkholes
Sinkholes are more common in Florida than in any other state. Florida requires home insurance providers to include coverage for “catastrophic ground cover collapse,” which only applies under specific conditions; insurers also must offer add-on [sinkhole coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-sinkhole-insurance), subject to an inspection.
#### Earthquakes
Although fairly rare, earthquakes can happen, especially near the Florida panhandle. Home insurance policies typically don’t cover earthquake damage, but you may be able to add on coverage.

## FAQ
No, you are not legally required to have home insurance in Florida. However, if you have a mortgage, your lender will typically require a home insurance policy and may have specific requirements for wind or flood coverage if you live in a high-risk area.
Even if it’s not required for you, home insurance is one of the best ways to protect your assets from financial losses.
Typical homeowners insurance covers your dwelling, other structures on your property, your personal belongings, personal liability issues, medical payments for injured guests, and additional living expenses if you have to temporarily relocate due to a covered peril. Read our guide on [what homeowners insurance covers](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover) for more information.
What qualifies as a covered peril will vary by policy. Florida requires insurers to cover certain risks specific to the state, such as catastrophic ground cover collapse.
One of the main reasons that Florida insurers are dropping customers by declining to renew their policies is that the rising threat of natural disasters is making some homes too risky to insure, especially in coastal areas. Because of climate change, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and floods are becoming more frequent and more costly for both homeowners and insurance providers. As a result, insurance companies may stop offering coverage in areas deemed to be high risk.
Florida’s vulnerability to natural disasters – especially hurricanes – is one of the primary reasons that it’s the most expensive state to buy homeowners insurance, according to a [2025 report](https://consumerfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OverburdenedReport.pdf) by the Consumer Federation of America. Between 2021 and 2024, Florida saw the greatest average premium hike in absolute dollars of any state, with an increase of $2,118. Home insurance providers continue to raise rates in an attempt to offset their losses from paying out more money in claims.
In Florida, you can become eligible for discounts or credits on your homeowners insurance by making your house more resistant to windstorms, as the state requires that companies reward customers for having specific wind mitigation features. Other common discounts for homeowners insurance include staying claim-free, bundling multiple insurance policies with one provider, and installing protective devices like fire alarms.

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Local Homeowners Insurance
To build our ratings, we researched 16 homeowners insurance companies and insurance agencies and analyzed data from a consumer survey with 1,125 responses, product features collected from company websites, and data on insurance costs provided by Quadrant Information Services. U.S. News worked with Quadrant to analyze a report of publicly available insurance rates using 34,595 ZIP codes across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the companies in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies that operate in that state. The insurance rates in our study are based on averages of sample rates for a 38-year-old and 56-year-old married applicant household with a 720 FICO credit score. The rates were obtained for an HO3 policy covering a wood-frame house with 10% Other Structures Coverage, 20% Loss of Use Coverage, 50% Personal Property Coverage, and a guest medical limit of $5,000.
