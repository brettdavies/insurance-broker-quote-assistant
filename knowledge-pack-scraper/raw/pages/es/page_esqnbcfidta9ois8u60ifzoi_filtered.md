You can get Bankers through Todd.  
  
And MM is part of MM Ohio. You can go direct with them.  
  
Both show up 1 & 2 on CSG in Texas.

I am appointed direct with them . . . no FMO. It's that way with all my carriers.  
  
UW apps are usually processed in a few days. They pull Rx history & Milliman medical report before sending it to underwriting. Sometimes they do phone interviews.

Do you get a higher commission by going direct?

Few Individual agents outside a few one off carriers make 25% on supps . I'm at 25% on Aetna and aflac only because i have very high fe contracts . Most carriers 22% street in most states. Fmo's at 27-28%
