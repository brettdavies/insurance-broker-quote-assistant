Homeowners with a lot of jewelry will find Liberty Mutual's blanket jewelry coverage useful. This coverage is unusual because you don't have to get an appraisal for each piece of jewelry you want to protect. Instead, it [covers all of your jewelry](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-jewelry "Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Damaged or Lost Jewelry?") if it's damaged, lost or stolen. Plus, there isn't a deductible.
