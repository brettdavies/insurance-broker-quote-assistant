Car insurance estimates are a good starting point. But your rates will vary because [quotes are based on factors](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Free Car Insurance Quotes Online") like your age, your driving record, where you live and the coverage you choose. And each company has its own way of calculating your rate.

The best car insurance coverage for you depends on your budget, your car's value and your [state's requirements](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#state "State Minimum Requirements for Auto Insurance").
[Bodily injury liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?") coverage pays for other drivers' medical costs and lost wages if you cause an accident.
---|---|---
[Property damage liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "Property Damage Liability Car Insurance: What Is It? How Does It Work?") pays for damage to other people's property if you cause an accident. This includes crashing into another car or object.
---|---
[Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") pays your medical bills if you're in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver.
Fourteen states require uninsured motorist coverage.  Seven states and Washington, D.C. require both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.
---|---|---
Full coverage insurance includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").
**Collision coverage** pays for your car repairs after an accident, no matter who's at fault. **Comprehensive coverage** pays for damage to your car caused by things outside of your control, like a fallen branch or vandalism.
---|---|---
[Younger drivers tend to pay more for car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs"), and this is especially true for teens. This is because young drivers have less experience behind the wheel and are more likely to cause a crash.
Your rates will go down as you get older. But young drivers can save money by signing up for [usage-based driving programs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") and practicing safe habits.
You'll usually pay more for insurance after a ticket, DUI or [accident](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "How Does an Accident Affect My Car Insurance Rates?").
The best way to find cheap rates after a ticket or accident is to [compare quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record "Best Cheap Car Insurance For Those With a Bad Driving Record"). Every company calculates rates differently, and some may raise your rates less after a ticket or accident.
It's cheaper to insure [cars that are older, slower or safer](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/car-make-model "Car Make and Model: What Does It Mean?").
People who drive less tend to pay lower rates. If you drive fewer than 12,000 miles per year, you may be able to save money with [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/should-you-switch-pay-mile-car-insurance "Should You Switch to Pay-Per-Mile Car Insurance?").
[Married people](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-for-couples "Best Cheap Car Insurance for Married & Unmarried Couples") often pay slightly less for car insurance than unmarried drivers.
In addition, you'll pay much more if you have a teenager on your policy. You can find the [cheapest family car insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/family-car-insurance "Cheapest Family Car Insurance") by shopping around for quotes from multiple companies.
For example, [comprehensive and collision](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") insurance can be costly. If you don't have a car loan or lease, consider removing these coverages if your car is over 8 years old or worth less than $5,000.
Insurance costs more if you choose a [lower deductible for collision and comprehensive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?"). That's because the insurance company must pay you more after an accident.
Some states have [higher insurance costs than others](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#carbystate "Average Cost of Car Insurance"). This can be because of more road traffic, uninsured drivers or severe weather events. You'll also typically pay more if you live in a city because of higher accident and crime rates.
The best companies nationally may not have the [cheapest car insurance near you](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance#state "Cheapest Car Insurance by State"). You should compare quotes from small and midsize companies in your area along with major car insurance companies to find the best rates.
[Drivers with poor credit](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") pay more for car insurance in most states.
The best way to get cheaper rates is to [improve your credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/whats-a-good-credit-score#how-to-improve-credit-score "How to Get a Good Credit Score"). But that can take some time.
In the short term, try to find a company that offers lots of discounts you can easily qualify for. You can also consider a [usage-based car insurance program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") if you typically practice safe driving habits.
**[Compare quotes from multiple companies.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online")** Car insurance rates can differ by an average of $245 per month for full coverage from one company to the next. Get quote estimates from large insurance companies like State Farm and Geico and smaller ones like Erie and Farm Bureau.
* * *
**[Look for discounts.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts")** Most companies, especially large ones like Geico or State Farm, have a lot of discounts available. These discounts can add up to savings of 40% or more. And you may already qualify for many of them.
* * *
**[If you live with other drivers, consider a multicar policy.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/multi-car-insurance-discounts-quotes "How Much You Can Save With Multicar Auto Insurance")** Adding another person to your insurance plan is cheaper than having two separate policies. You can share a multicar policy with anyone you live with.
* * *
**[Bundle with other insurance.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle")** Most major insurance companies offer the option to bundle your home or [cheapest renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies "Cheapest Renters Insurance Companies") with your auto insurance. Choosing a bundle deal can get you a discount on your total insurance cost for both policies.
* * *
* * *
[How much car insurance you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "Car Insurance - How Much Is It? How Much Do I Need?") depends first on your state's minimum required coverage and how much protection you want.
Some states also require uninsured motorist coverage or [personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Car Insurance and Should You Have It?") (PIP).
* **What is it?** [Liability insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheap Liability Car Insurance") pays for damage and injuries to other drivers after you cause an accident.
* **Do you need it?** [Every state except New Hampshire](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") requires liability insurance.
* **What is it?** [Collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") pays to fix your car after an accident with another vehicle or object, regardless of who's responsible. Comprehensive coverage pays to repair your car from a cause besides a crash, like hail.
* **What is it?** [Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Car Insurance and Should You Have It?") covers drivers' and passengers' medical costs and lost wages after an accident, regardless of who's at fault.
* **Do you need it?** There are [16 states that require PIP](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). PIP is a good idea if your health insurance has high copays or deductibles. It's also smart to have PIP if you don't have an emergency fund to cover lost wages.
* **What is it?** [Uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") pays for your injuries or repairs after an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance or doesn't have limits high enough to pay your bills.
---|---
The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance "Average Cost of Car Insurance") in the United States is $175 per month for a full coverage policy. Minimum liability coverage typically costs around $69 per month. However, your rates will vary based on where you live, your insurance company, what kind of car you have and your driving history.
The best way to estimate the cost of auto insurance is to use our [online car insurance calculator](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/estimate-car-insurance "Car Insurance Calculator: Estimate your Car Insurance Cost"). By answering three easy questions, you can estimate your car insurance rates based on your location, your car and how much coverage you need.
At the very least, you need enough car insurance to meet the [minimum legal requirements in your state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). However, you should buy more coverage if you drive a lot, have a newer car or are paying off a car loan or lease.
Nearly every state requires you to have liability insurance, which pays for injuries to other people and property damage. But it's worth it to pay more for [full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") if your car is worth more than $5,000 or less than 8 years old. Higher limits and extra coverage can also help you avoid unexpected bills after a crash.
