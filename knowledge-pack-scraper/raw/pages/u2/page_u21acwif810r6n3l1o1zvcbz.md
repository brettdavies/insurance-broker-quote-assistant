Car insurance estimates are a good starting point. But your rates will vary because [quotes are based on factors](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Free Car Insurance Quotes Online") like your age, your driving record, where you live and the coverage you choose. And each company has its own way of calculating your rate.
## Estimates for car insurance by state
Where you live is a big factor in how much you pay for car insurance. For example, in Nevada, the most expensive state for car insurance, full coverage insurance costs $183 more per month than in the cheapest state, Maine.

## How to estimate car insurance costs
To estimate the cost of car insurance, first you have to decide what kinds of coverage you need.
The best car insurance coverage for you depends on your budget, your car's value and your [state's requirements](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#state "State Minimum Requirements for Auto Insurance").
**The most basic car insurance coverages pay for damage you cause in an accident.** These are called bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage. You may also need to protect your own car with collision and comprehensive coverage if you have a car loan or lease.
**Before deciding which insurance coverages to add, compare cost estimates for each coverage type.** Then, review your auto insurance estimates yearly to find the cheapest rates and decide if you need different coverage.
### Bodily injury liability
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/stethoscope)
[Bodily injury liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?") coverage pays for other drivers' medical costs and lost wages if you cause an accident.
Most states require bodily injury liability coverage.
Limit per person | Limit per accident | Monthly rate  
---|---|---  
$25,000 | $50,000 | $43  
$50,000 | $100,000 | $50  
$100,000 | $300,000 | $56  
$250,000 | $500,000 | $72  
### Property damage liability
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//static/icons/accident2)
[Property damage liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "Property Damage Liability Car Insurance: What Is It? How Does It Work?") pays for damage to other people's property if you cause an accident. This includes crashing into another car or object.
Each state has its own requirement for property damage liability. The requirement typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000.
Limit per accident | Monthly cost  
---|---  
$25,000 | $34  
$50,000 | $35  
$100,000 | $35  
**You should usually choose higher property damage limits, if you can afford it.** If you cause a serious accident, $25,000 probably won't be enough money to fully replace the other driver's car. For just $15 per year more, you could get $100,000 of coverage, which should be enough to cover the cost of most brand-new cars. 
### Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/no-sign)
[Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") pays your medical bills if you're in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver.
It can also cover lost wages and pay for someone to do household tasks you can no longer perform yourself. This can include cleaning your house or babysitting.
Fourteen states require uninsured motorist coverage.  Seven states and Washington, D.C. require both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.
Limit per person | Limit per accident | Monthly cost  
---|---|---  
$25,000 | $50,000 | $5  
$50,000 | $100,000 | $6  
$100,000 | $300,000 | $9  
$250,000 | $500,000 | $15  
### Comprehensive and collision coverage
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/static/icons/car-cta)
Full coverage insurance includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").
**Collision coverage** pays for your car repairs after an accident, no matter who's at fault. **Comprehensive coverage** pays for damage to your car caused by things outside of your control, like a fallen branch or vandalism.
Comprehensive and collision coverages have no limit, other than the value of your car.
You'll need this coverage if you have a loan or lease. But it's expensive, often doubling the cost of insurance.
Coverage type | Deductible | Monthly rate  
---|---|---  
Collision | $500 | $71  
Collision | $1,000 | $55  
Comprehensive | $500 | $30  
Comprehensive | $1,000 | $25  
## What factors do insurance companies use to calculate your car insurance cost?
Insurance companies calculate your car insurance rate based on several factors. For instance, companies use your age and accident history to determine your "riskiness" as a driver. Young drivers and people with a ticket or accident typically pay more for insurance than someone older or with a clean driving record.
### Factors that affect car insurance estimates
Age
[Younger drivers tend to pay more for car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs"), and this is especially true for teens. This is because young drivers have less experience behind the wheel and are more likely to cause a crash.
Your rates will go down as you get older. But young drivers can save money by signing up for [usage-based driving programs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") and practicing safe habits. 
Driving history
You'll usually pay more for insurance after a ticket, DUI or [accident](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "How Does an Accident Affect My Car Insurance Rates?").
The best way to find cheap rates after a ticket or accident is to [compare quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record "Best Cheap Car Insurance For Those With a Bad Driving Record"). Every company calculates rates differently, and some may raise your rates less after a ticket or accident. 
Your car
It's cheaper to insure [cars that are older, slower or safer](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/car-make-model "Car Make and Model: What Does It Mean?").
If your car insurance rates are unaffordable, consider trading in your car for a vehicle that's cheaper to cover. 
Mileage
People who drive less tend to pay lower rates. If you drive fewer than 12,000 miles per year, you may be able to save money with [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/should-you-switch-pay-mile-car-insurance "Should You Switch to Pay-Per-Mile Car Insurance?"). 
Relationship status and dependents
[Married people](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-for-couples "Best Cheap Car Insurance for Married & Unmarried Couples") often pay slightly less for car insurance than unmarried drivers.
In addition, you'll pay much more if you have a teenager on your policy. You can find the [cheapest family car insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/family-car-insurance "Cheapest Family Car Insurance") by shopping around for quotes from multiple companies. 
Coverage types and limits
Higher coverage limits and extra add-ons will raise your car insurance rates. To lower your rates, eliminate coverage you don't need.
For example, [comprehensive and collision](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") insurance can be costly. If you don't have a car loan or lease, consider removing these coverages if your car is over 8 years old or worth less than $5,000. 
Deductible
Insurance costs more if you choose a [lower deductible for collision and comprehensive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?"). That's because the insurance company must pay you more after an accident.
Raising your deductible can save you money. But make sure to choose a deductible you can easily afford to pay after an emergency. 
Location
Some states have [higher insurance costs than others](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance#carbystate "Average Cost of Car Insurance"). This can be because of more road traffic, uninsured drivers or severe weather events. You'll also typically pay more if you live in a city because of higher accident and crime rates.
The best companies nationally may not have the [cheapest car insurance near you](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance#state "Cheapest Car Insurance by State"). You should compare quotes from small and midsize companies in your area along with major car insurance companies to find the best rates. 
Credit score
[Drivers with poor credit](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") pay more for car insurance in most states.
The best way to get cheaper rates is to [improve your credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/whats-a-good-credit-score#how-to-improve-credit-score "How to Get a Good Credit Score"). But that can take some time.
In the short term, try to find a company that offers lots of discounts you can easily qualify for. You can also consider a [usage-based car insurance program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") if you typically practice safe driving habits. 
## How can you get cheaper auto insurance estimates?
To find the most affordable insurance, get quotes from several companies. Also, look for discounts for bundling or automatic payments.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/icons/auto-step1)
**[Compare quotes from multiple companies.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online")** Car insurance rates can differ by an average of $245 per month for full coverage from one company to the next. Get quote estimates from large insurance companies like State Farm and Geico and smaller ones like Erie and Farm Bureau.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60/icons/auto-step2)
**[Look for discounts.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts")** Most companies, especially large ones like Geico or State Farm, have a lot of discounts available. These discounts can add up to savings of 40% or more. And you may already qualify for many of them.

## Calculate how much auto insurance you need
[How much car insurance you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "Car Insurance - How Much Is It? How Much Do I Need?") depends first on your state's minimum required coverage and how much protection you want.
Most states require:
  * $20,000–$25,000 of bodily injury liability insurance per person 
  * $40,000–$50,000 of bodily injury liability insurance per accident 
  * $10,000–$25,000 of property damage liability insurance 


Some states also require uninsured motorist coverage or [personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Car Insurance and Should You Have It?") (PIP).
**Start with your state's minimum required insurance, then add higher coverage amounts and extra coverage options based on what you can afford.** It doesn't cost much to add more liability coverage to your policy. It can also help you avoid a big bill if you cause a major crash.
### How much insurance should you get?
The right amount of auto insurance coverage depends on your budget and driving background.
For example, you can typically double your liability coverage limits for $10 to $15 per month. This can help you avoid expensive bills after a crash, like if you hit an electric vehicle.
On the other hand, if you drive an older car that's not worth much, you won't need collision and comprehensive coverage.
Liability insurance
  * **What is it?** [Liability insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheap Liability Car Insurance") pays for damage and injuries to other drivers after you cause an accident. 
  * **Do you need it?** [Every state except New Hampshire](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") requires liability insurance. 
  * **How much should you have?** State minimums usually aren't high enough to pay for the average accident. However, more coverage will raise your rates. You should get as much liability insurance as you can afford. 


Comprehensive and collision
  * **What is it?** [Collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") pays to fix your car after an accident with another vehicle or object, regardless of who's responsible. Comprehensive coverage pays to repair your car from a cause besides a crash, like hail. 
  * **Do you need it?** Yes, if you have a loan or lease. Also, consider this coverage if your car is worth more than $5,000 or you couldn't afford to replace it after a major crash. 
  * **Which deductible should you choose?** Pick a deductible based on the amount you could easily pay in an emergency. 


Personal injury protection
  * **What is it?** [Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Car Insurance and Should You Have It?") covers drivers' and passengers' medical costs and lost wages after an accident, regardless of who's at fault. 
  * **Do you need it?** There are [16 states that require PIP](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). PIP is a good idea if your health insurance has high copays or deductibles. It's also smart to have PIP if you don't have an emergency fund to cover lost wages. 
  * **How much should you have?** Your state may require a minimum amount of PIP. Choose an amount you think would cover your out-of-pocket costs for medical care after a major accident. 


Uninsured or underinsured motorist
  * **What is it?** [Uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") pays for your injuries or repairs after an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance or doesn't have limits high enough to pay your bills. 
  * **Do you need it?** In 20 states and Washington, D.C., drivers must have uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. Even if your state doesn't require it, you should still consider getting it. It's affordable, and 1 in 8 drivers do not have car insurance. 
  * **How much coverage should you have?** The same limits as your liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage. 


The minimum liability requirement may be enough to cover the costs of a minor accident. **However, it won't be enough for repairs after a major accident.** Consider getting more coverage if you can afford it.

## Methodology
ValuePenguin's car insurance calculator is based on millions of car insurance quotes from every ZIP code in the U.S., using multiple coverage limits. Rates are for a 30-year-old man with good credit and a good driving history who owns a 2015 Honda Civic EX.
Insurance analysts and agents recommended matching a driver's net worth to their coverage. Estimates from our calculator default to higher coverage limits for higher-net-worth drivers.
Our editors gathered quotes from ZIP codes across Georgia using the same driver profile above to calculate costs for each coverage type. Claim payouts are based on a 2020 study from the Insurance Services Office.
Rate data was compiled using Quadrant Information Services. Your quotes may differ, as these rates are averages and are best used only for comparative purposes.
