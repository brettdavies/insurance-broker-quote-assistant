# Progressive Halts Home Insurance in Texas: What You Need to Know
•[Colin Njemanze](https://cwilsonlaw.com/author/cnjemanzecwilsonlaw-com/ "Posts by Colin Njemanze")
•[News](https://cwilsonlaw.com/news/)
•[home insurance](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/home-insurance/), [homeowner's insurance](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/homeowners-insurance/), [insurance](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/insurance/), [insurance claim](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/insurance-claim/), [progressive insurance](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/progressive-insurance/), [property damage](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/property-damage/), [property insurance](https://cwilsonlaw.com/tag/property-insurance/)
•[no comments](https://cwilsonlaw.com/progressive-insurance-halts-new-home-insurance-policies-in-texas-what-homeowners-need-to-know/#respond)
In a significant move affecting Texas homeowners, Progressive Insurance has [announced a temporary suspension of offering new homeowners insurance policies](https://www.tpr.org/news/2024-09-09/progressive-is-the-latest-insurance-company-to-stop-offering-homeowner-coverage-in-texas) in the state. This decision comes on the heels of Hurricane Beryl’s devastation across Houston and raises concerns about the stability of the homeowners insurance market in Texas.
At Chad T. Wilson Law Firm, we understand the challenges that homeowners face when navigating insurance claims, especially during times of crisis. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation and offer guidance to those affected.
## **Progressive’s Decision and Its Implications**
### **Temporary Restriction on New Policies**
In a recent letter to shareholders, Progressive Insurance CEO Tricia Griffith stated that the company is “[temporarily restricting new homeowners’ business](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/progressive-homeowner-insurance-pullback-19744898.php)” in Texas. The move is part of a strategic effort to reduce the impact of weather-related volatility on the company’s portfolio.
### **Focus on Weather-Related Risks**
Griffith emphasized the importance of shifting the company’s geographic mix, focusing on growing in states with lower weather risks while reducing exposure in areas more susceptible to catastrophic events like hurricanes and hailstorms.
### **Impact on Existing Policyholders**
While the suspension currently affects new policies, there is concern among existing policyholders about potential non-renewals or premium increases. In Florida, Progressive previously dropped 115,000 policyholders due to similar concerns over natural disasters.
![Wind Damage Claims Lawyer](https://cwilsonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wind-Damage-Claims-Lawyer-in-Lakewood-CO-1024x768.jpg)
## **Rising Insurance Costs for Texas Homeowners**
Homeowners across Texas are experiencing significant [hikes in insurance premiums](https://www.chron.com/business/technology/article/progressives-texas-home-insurance-19747472.php). Some residents have reported increases from $2,600 to $8,800 within a year, making it increasingly difficult to maintain adequate coverage.
### **Comparison with National Averages**
According to Bankrate, Texas homeowners pay an average of $3,898 for $300,000 in dwelling coverage—72% more than the national average of $2,270. These escalating costs highlight the growing financial strain on Texas residents.
![What Is an Insurance Appraiser and What Do They Do?](https://cwilsonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/17-1024x577.png)
## **Other Insurers Following Suit**
Progressive is not alone in this trend. Foremost Insurance, a subsidiary of Farmers Insurance, ceased writing and renewing new policies shortly before Hurricane Beryl struck. In communications to customers, the company cited a reassessment of risks related to natural and catastrophic losses.
### **Potential for a Widening Crisis**
The [withdrawal of major insurers from the Texas](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-home-insurance-worsens-insurer-halts-new-policies-1949731) market could exacerbate the homeowners insurance crisis, limiting options for residents and potentially leading to higher rates due to decreased competition.
![tornado damaged house with a blue tarpaulin on the roof](https://cwilsonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/North-Texas-Couple-Sues-for-Roof-Relief.jpeg)
## **Options for Texas Homeowners**
### **Texas Fair Plan Association**
For those struggling to obtain coverage, the Texas Fair Plan Association (TFPA) offers a lifeline. Established by the Texas Legislature in 1995, TFPA provides basic property insurance for eligible Texas homeowners who are unable to secure coverage through the voluntary market.
### **Considerations**
While TFPA can be a valuable resource, policies may come with limitations and higher premiums. Homeowners should carefully assess their coverage needs and explore all available options.
![Insurance Adjusters](https://cwilsonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-design-6-1024x577.png)
## **Legal Recourse and Support**
### **Understanding Your Rights**
If your insurance policy has been non-renewed or you are facing exorbitant premium increases, it’s crucial to understand your legal rights. Insurance companies are obligated to follow state regulations when making such decisions.
### **How Chad T. Wilson Law Firm Can Help**
Our firm specializes in representing policyholders in disputes with insurance companies. We offer:
  * **Free Consultation:** Assess your situation with no obligation.
  * **Expert Representation:** Navigate the complexities of [insurance law](https://cwilsonlaw.com/glossary/insurance-law/) with seasoned professionals.
  * **Contingency Basis:** No fees unless we secure a recovery on your behalf.


### **Steps to Take if Affected**
  1. **Review Your Current Policy:** Understand the terms, coverage limits, and any notices of changes or non-renewal.
  2. **Explore Alternative Insurance Options:** Seek quotes from other reputable insurers still operating in Texas.
  3. **Consult with an Attorney:** If you believe your rights are being infringed upon, legal advice can provide clarity and direction.
  4. **Stay Informed:** Monitor communications from your insurer and stay updated on industry developments.


## **Conclusion**
The decision by Progressive Insurance to halt new homeowners policies in Texas underscores the challenges facing the state’s insurance market. As natural disasters become more frequent and severe, homeowners must be proactive in securing adequate coverage and advocating for their rights.
At Chad T. Wilson Law Firm, we are committed to assisting Texas homeowners during these uncertain times. If you have concerns about your insurance coverage or need legal assistance, please reach out to us.
