## Why comparing car insurance matters

Car insurance costs are on the rise: 8.3% higher during the first half of 2025 than the same period the year before, and 31% more than two years ago, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics[1]. But that doesn't mean you can't find savings out there.

Taking a little time to shop around and compare could save you several hundreds of dollars. In our October 2025 analysis, NerdWallet found that average rates varied by $2,160 or more per year between companies.

Insurance companies change their rates regularly, so the policy that was the best deal a while back — or even just last year — may no longer be your best option. And because car insurance companies set their prices differently for every driver, the cheapest carrier for your friend or family member may not be the cheapest option for you.

*"Shopping around for car insurance goes slowly if you visit each insurer's website or call them one by one, and you could miss out on the lowest rate. It’s smarter to work with a broker or independent agent, or to consult a comparison site that can show you several rates at once."*

—Andrew Hurst, licensed insurance professional and lead writer at NerdWallet

## How to compare car insurance quotes

As you shop around, follow these steps to make sure you’re getting a good deal.

### 1. Check coverage limits, deductibles and features

Check that all the offers have the same coverage limits and deductibles. Note any optional features, such as roadside assistance or accident forgiveness.

If the policy limits don’t match exactly, do those other features make up for it?

Imagine three auto insurance quotes, all with the same coverage limits and deductible.

* **Company A**: $2,000/year for standard coverage.
* **Company B**: $2,025/year for standard coverage, plus declining deductibles.
* **Company C**: $2,250/year for standard coverage, plus declining deductibles and accident forgiveness.

Company A offers the lowest price, but Company B reduces your collision deductible by $50 every six months. Is that worth an extra $25 a year to you? How much do you value accident forgiveness?

### 2. Research the companies

Pay particular attention to complaint records and customer satisfaction to make sure the company will be easy to work with if you have a claim. [Auto insurance reviews](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto-insurance-reviews) are a good place to find that information.

### 3. Consider the whole package

If you’re shopping for another policy along with your auto insurance, such as a home or renters policy, make sure you’re happy with the price and coverage there, too. Although [bundling](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/homeowners/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles) can offer discounts and convenience, in some cases you may find better prices or coverage by buying your policies from two separate companies.

## Where to get car insurance quotes

There are three main ways to shop for car insurance, each with pros and cons. You can get car insurance quotes from:

CarriersComparison sitesAgents or Brokers

You can call insurance companies one by one, or visit each of their websites to get individual quotes. Not sure which insurers to check? Start with our lists of the [best car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-car-insurance-companies) and the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance).

## Pros

* You can reach out to as many companies as you’d like, including big-name insurers like State Farm that typically don’t sell their policies through independent agents.
* You can often quickly customize your coverage options online to see how they impact your quote.

## Cons

* Requires making multiple phone calls or entering your information over and over again.
* No access to smaller insurers, like Safety or Auto-Owners, that don’t sell directly to consumers.

Comparison sites let you shop with multiple companies at once. (NerdWallet offers its own [comparison tool](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/match?pricingCode=664412) you can try.)

After you enter some basic information about yourself and your vehicle, the site will match you with one or more car insurance companies. Keep in mind that you may not see a list of personalized rates at this stage — you’ll often need to visit each company’s website individually to provide more information and get your final price.

## Pros

* Saves you time by shopping with several companies at once.
* Ideal for users who want to buy online instead of making phone calls.
* Comparison sites generally pass some of your information on to the insurer, so you don’t have to type it all in again.

## Cons

* Depending on your circumstances, you may not see as many options as you want.
* Expect follow-up phone calls or emails, as comparison sites often share your personal information with other insurers and brokers.
* May partner with a limited number of carriers.

A final option is to work with an independent insurance agent or insurance broker. This is often a local professional who will take your information by phone or in person, then shop around for insurance on your behalf. An agent or broker may be a good fit for people with complicated insurance needs — if you have a spotty driving history, for example, or you’re trying to get quotes for multiple cars, a house and an umbrella policy for extra liability coverage.

## Pros

* Often has access to smaller regional insurers that may not offer online quotes.
* Saves you time by comparing rates for you.
* Can answer questions and give personalized guidance.

## Cons

* Generally requires at least one initial phone call.
* Your options are limited to insurance companies the agent or broker works with.
* Brokers may charge a fee.

## What you need to get car insurance quotes

For smooth shopping, you’ll want to gather some key info first. You’ll need these details for all the drivers and vehicles in your household:

### Drivers

* Date of birth.
* Occupation and marital status.
* Driver's license number.
* Accidents or traffic violations in the past five years.

### Vehicles

* Year, make and model.
* Vehicle identification number (VIN).
* Mileage.
* Year purchased.
* Current insurer (if applicable).

If you’re shopping for other policies along with car insurance, like homeowners or renters insurance, make sure you also have information about your home on hand.

### Coverage amounts

The default limits you’ll see in an online car insurance quote may not match the coverage you want to buy, so before you shop, decide [how much car insurance you need](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-car-insurance-you-need).

Auto policy limits are split into three categories, often listed like “25/50/15”. In that example, here’s what each number refers to:

**25**

A $25,000 **bodily injury** **limit** for each person’s injuries.

**50**

A $50,000 **bodily injury limit** per accident.

**15**

A $15,000 **property damage limit** per accident.

You can typically customize your quote by adjusting the liability limits and adding options such as comprehensive and collision coverage.

If you’re happy with your current policy, grab your most recent [car insurance declaration page](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-declaration-page) and refer to it when choosing your policy limits.

## How personal factors impact car insurance rates

Insurers set prices based on many factors and driver characteristics. Some can make finding affordable car insurance harder — and make comparing rates that much more important.

  Having a DUI, at-fault accident or speeding ticket on your record can cause your rates to go up — or even double. But each car insurer prices these incidents a little differently, so it’s worth shopping around for the best rates.

  The rates below are for full coverage policies for 35-year-old drivers in the U.S.

* ### Credit

  Your credit history is one of the largest factors affecting your car insurance rate. In states where it's allowed, carriers use credit history to determine how likely you are to file a claim.

  California, Hawaii and Massachusetts don't allow insurers to use credit when determining car insurance rates. In Washington, the legal code around this issue is being debated.

  The rates below are for full coverage car insurance in the U.S. for a 35-year-old driver with a clean driving record.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where can I compare car insurance?

You’re more likely to pay higher rates for car insurance if you’ve had a recent at-fault accident or DUI, you live in an urban area or you have poor credit, among other factors. However, even the best drivers often see rates go up as insurers try to keep pace with rising costs.

### Why will my car insurance quote be different from the rates I see?

A *car insurance rate* is a projection of how certain characteristics might affect what a driver pays, based on publicly available data about how insurers set their prices.

A *car insurance quote* is an estimate of what you might pay for an auto policy, based on the vehicle and driver information you provide to an insurance company.

A *car insurance premium* is determined once the insurer gathers even more information about you. It's the actual price you'll pay when the policy is issued.

The prices on this page are the medians of thousands of rates provided by Quadrant Information Services and analyzed by NerdWallet's editorial team.

### **Ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Our editorial team determines the ratings, based on weighted averages of scores for categories we believe highlight the best auto insurers.

* **Financial strength (30%):** Insurers should be secure enough to reliably pay out claims, whether there is a recession or a series of natural disasters.
* **Consumer complaints (30%):** Insurers should have a good track record with current customers, particularly compared to insurance companies of a similar size.
* **Ease of use (20%):** Insurers should provide the information drivers need to get the right coverage and manage their policy whether they’re using a desktop or mobile device.
* **Affordability (20%):** Insurers should offer coverage at a fair price for drivers of different ages, in different locations and with different driving histories.

We also consider J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction surveys, which include responses from thousands of consumers about their experience with insurance companies.

These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews or ratings.

In our analysis, “good drivers” had no moving violations on record; a “good driving” discount was included for this profile. Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

* ### See characteristics for other driver profiles

  We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

  + For driver ages, we analyzed rates for drivers aged 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 in addition to our base driver profile of a 35-year-old.
  + For drivers with minimum coverage, we adjusted the numbers above to reflect only the minimum coverage required by law in the state.
  + We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good credit.”
  + For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash costing $10,000 in property damage.
  + For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken-driving violation.
  + For drivers with a ticket, we added a single speeding violation for driving 16 mph over the speed limit.

In states where required, minimum additional coverages were added. Some policies include additional coverage at the insurer’s discretion.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE in all cases and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven.

### **Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet's editorial team examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry.

To evaluate a company’s complaint history, our editorial team calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
