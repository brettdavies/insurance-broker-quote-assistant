# Auto Insurance Definitions

**Agent**  
A representative who sells insurance for one or more companies.

**Application**  
A request for insurance, giving information about the prospective policyholder.

**Arbitration**  
The process in which a third-party arbiter examines facts presented by both you and the insurance company when you disagree about a settlement offer. Arbitration can be binding (the arbiter's decision is final) or non-binding (you can still take the insurer to court if you are unsatisfied).

**Auto Replacement Coverage**  
A supplemental auto insurance coverage that guarantees your car will be completely repaired or replaced, even if the costs exceed its depreciated value.

**Binder**  
A temporary or preliminary agreement, in effect for less than 60 days, that provides coverage until a policy can be written or delivered.

**Bodily Injury Liability Coverage**  
Pays for another person's bodily injury or death in an accident that you may be found legally liable to pay.

**Broker**  
A licensed person or organization you can pay to shop for insurance on your behalf.

**Cancellation**  
Termination of a policy before its normal expiration date.

**Claim**  
Your request for the insurance company to pay you an amount under the terms of your policy.

**Claims Adjuster**  
A person an insurance company hires to settle claims. The adjuster can be a company employee or an independent party under contract with the company.

**Collision Coverage**  
Pays for damage to your vehicle when it collides with another vehicle or object or if it overturns. Your lender may require this coverage if you have a loan on your vehicle.

**Comparative Negligence Law**  
An Illinois law that sets forth how negligence for an accident is determined. Under these rules, you can collect from an at-fault driver only if you are less than 50% at-fault for the accident. In addition, you can only collect for damages in proportion to the amount of fault attributable. For example, if you are involved in an accident and the judge determines you are 20% at-fault for the accident, you can collect from the other driver (since you are less than 50% at-fault) but you cannot collect any more than 80% of your damages from the other driver (since the other driver is only 80% at-fault).

**Comprehensive Coverage**  
Coverage that pays for damage to or the loss of your vehicle from causes other than collision (example: hail, vandalism, flood, fire and theft, etc.) Your lender may require this coverage if you have a loan on your vehicle.

**Covered Expenses**  
The losses or conditions that the policy will pay for.

**Custom/Non-factory Equipment Coverage**  
Covers customized features such as those found on conversion vans, as well as non-factory items such as compact disc players, cellular phones or CB radios.

**Declarations Page ("Dec Page")**  
A page your company sends you to show your premium and coverage. Some insurance companies only send a new declarations page at renewal unless there’s a change to your policy. You should get a revised declarations page whenever there’s a change to your policy.

**Deductible**  
The dollar amount you must pay out-of-pocket for each claim before the insurance company begins paying.

**Gap Insurance**  
Insurance coverage that pays the difference between what you owe on your auto loan and your totaled car’s actual cash value.

**Endorsement**  
Amendment to the policy used to add, change, or delete coverage. Also referred to as a “rider.”

**Exclusions**  
Specific situations or circumstances listed in your policy describing when benefits will not be paid.

**Good Driver Plan**  
A rating program offered by some insurance companies that reduces your premium if you have had no accidents or traffic violations within a specified time period.

**Grace Period**  
A time period after the due date that you may pay a premium without penalty. The policy remains in force during this time. Not all insurance companies allow grace periods and no Illinois insurance law requires companies to give you a grace period.

A plan for people who can't obtain insurance through the voluntary market.

**Illinois Insurance Guaranty Fund**

**Rental Reimbursement/Transportation Expenses**

**Towing and Labor Coverage**

**Umbrella Liability Insurance**  
A policy that "floats" above your other coverage. You must carry a certain amount of underlying liability coverage before you may buy an umbrella policy. This coverage kicks in if you are sued for an amount greater than the limits of your auto policy.

**Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UIM) Coverage**
