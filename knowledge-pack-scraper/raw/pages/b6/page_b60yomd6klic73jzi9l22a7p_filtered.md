**Most people who buy coverage from HealthCare.gov or a state marketplace don't pay the full monthly cost for health insurance.** More than 90% of health insurance plans from HealthCare.gov or state marketplaces get discounts, called [rate subsidies](/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / Affordable Care Act Subsidy Calculator"). These lower the amount you pay for health insurance each month. **About four in five people can get health insurance for $10 or less per month.**

### Why is the cost of health insurance going up?

**[Health insurance is getting more expensive](/rising-health-insurance-costs-survey "74% of Americans Stressed About High Health Insurance Costs"), mostly because health care is getting more expensive.**

The cost of medical care has more than doubled since 2000.

More expensive medical care means health insurance companies have to pay more when you see a doctor. Companies charge higher rates to cover the cost of your care.

## How much does health insurance cost by age?

**Health insurance costs more as you get older**, with the most significant increases starting when you reach your late 40s. For example, the cost of health insurance nearly doubles between ages 40 and 55.

As you grow older, the likelihood of having health problems increases. This means you'll have to pay more for the same coverage.

[Silver plans](/what-is-silver-plan-health-insurance "What is Silver Plan Health Insurance?") cost $621 per month on average.

**Silver** plans are the middle tier, with average 
deductibles,
[copays and coinsurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/copay-vs-coinsurance "Coinsurance vs. Copays: What Are the Differences").

### Bronze vs Silver health insurance

Silver plans are the best choice for many people because of their middle-of-the-road costs. If you have a Silver plan and earn a low income, you may be able to get subsidies called [cost-sharing reductions (CSRs)](/obamacare/cost-sharing-reductions "Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR): What It Means and Who's Eligible?"). **You can only get CSRs with Silver plans.**

If you can't get cost-sharing reductions, a Bronze plan might make more sense for affordable medical insurance if you're in good health, and you can easily cover your plan's [deductible](/health-insurance-deductibles "What Is a Health Insurance Deductible and How Does It Work?") from your savings.

**Catastrophic** and **Bronze** plans are the best options for cheap health insurance, but you'll have to pay more when you visit the doctor. These plans are best if you're young and healthy. Keep in mind, you can't get discounts, called subsidies, with a Catastrophic plan.

You're almost always better off with a Bronze or Silver plan if you qualify for subsidies.

**Gold** and **Platinum** plans are on the high end of coverage and price. These plans have high monthly rates, but you won't pay as much for medical care. Gold and Platinum plans may make sense if you have an ongoing condition that requires frequent trips to the hospital.

### Monthly health insurance costs (2025) by tier

| Tier | 2024 rate | 2025 rate | % change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Catastrophic](/catastrophic-health-insurance "Benefits and Costs of Catastrophic Health Insurance") | $335 | $361 | 8% |
| Bronze | $462 | $488 | 6% |
| [Silver](/what-is-silver-plan-health-insurance "What Is Silver Plan Health Insurance?") | $583 | $621 | 6% |
| [Gold](/gold-plans-cost-and-coverage "Gold Plans: Cost and Coverage") | $641 | $676 | 5% |
| [Platinum](/platinum-health-insurance-guide "What Is Platinum Health Insurance?") | $811 | $913 | 13% |

Monthly rates are for 40-year-olds. The average for Bronze plans includes Expanded Bronze.

## Average health insurance rates by plan type

Your monthly rate also depends on the plan type you choose. For example, [PPOs (preferred provider organizations)](/ppo-health-insurance-plans "What Is PPO Health Insurance?")tend to cost more than [HMOs (health maintenance organizations)](/hmo-health-plans "HMO Plan Basics: About Health Maintenance Organizations"). For a higher monthly rate, PPOs give you more flexibility when it comes to the doctors you see.

HMO health insurance plans tend to have cheap rates. But, you can't see doctors outside your network, and you need a referral to visit a specialist.

## Cost of private health insurance

Private health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace costs $621 per month for a 40-year-old with a Silver health plan, on average. What you pay for a private health insurance plan will depend on factors such as your age, plan tier, the type of insurance you choose and where you live.

Private health insurance includes plans you buy on your own, often called individual health plans, and plans through your workplace, sometimes called [group health plans](/group-health-insurance-guide "Guide to Group Health Insurance").

If you're not enrolling in a government-backed plan like [Medicare or Medicaid](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-vs-medicaid "Medicare vs. Medicaid: The Important Differences to Know"), you're buying private health insurance.

Private health plans bought through a state or federal exchange are eligible for [government subsidies](/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / ACA Subsidy Calculator")(except Catastrophic plans). These subsidies can lower your monthly rate and, in some cases, help you pay for other insurance costs.

Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., run their own health insurance marketplaces. If you don't have access to a state-run health exchange, you can buy a private health insurance plan through [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/ "HealthCare.gov: ACA Health Insurance Marketplace").

### States with health marketplaces

* California
* Colorado
* Connecticut
* Georgia
* Idaho
* Kentucky
* Maine

* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* Minnesota
* Nevada
* New Jersey
* New Mexico
* New York

* Pennsylvania
* Rhode Island
* Vermont
* Virginia
* Washington
* Washington, D.C.

You can also buy private health insurance directly from an insurance company, through an agent or from a broker. These plans are sometimes called "off-exchange" policies and might include ACA plans.

Off-exchange plans don't qualify for cost-saving subsidies. Before you buy, it's a good idea to compare on- and off-exchange plans to see which can save you more money.

## Factors that impact health insurance rates

* **Age:** Generally speaking, your health insurance rates will increase as you get older until you reach [age 65 and become eligible for Medicare](/medicare-eligibility "Medicare Eligibility: Age 65 and Other Ways to Qualify").
* **Where you live:** Your rate also depends on the state and county you live in. For example, health insurance costs more than twice as much in Alaska compared to Indiana, on average.
* **Smoking/tobacco use:** Smokers may pay up to 50% more than nonsmokers in some states.
* **Number of people covered:** Health insurance costs increase as you add more people to your plan. For example, a family of three will pay more for coverage than a single person.

Your insurance company, your plan tier and whether you have an [HMO or a PPO](/hmo-vs-ppo-health-insurance "HMO vs. PPO Insurance: What's the Difference?")also impact your monthly rate.

## Methodology

Health insurance rates and plans are taken from public use files (PUFs) on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) government website. Separately, data came from the websites of state-run marketplaces that don't use the federal marketplace.

Using the rates for each plan, ValuePenguin determined averages for different variables. Average costs per state are for Silver plans for 40-year-olds. Rates for Catastrophic plans and different plan types are based on the data that's available and don't include all states.

Info about health and aging is from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health "Aging and health"). ValuePenguin determined the rates for various ages based on the [rating guidelines from CMS](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Market-Reforms/Downloads/StateSpecAgeCrv053117.pdf "State Specific Age Curve Variations").

Research on rising health insurance costs comes from the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker [report on medical inflation](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-does-medical-inflation-compare-to-inflation-in-the-rest-of-the-economy/ "How does medical inflation compare to inflation in the rest of the economy?").

The cost of health insurance for employees is from [KFF's employer benefits survey](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2024-employer-health-benefits-survey/ "2024 Employer Health Benefits Survey").
