**Most people who buy coverage from HealthCare.gov or a state marketplace don't pay the full monthly cost for health insurance.** More than 90% of health insurance plans from HealthCare.gov or state marketplaces get discounts, called [rate subsidies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / Affordable Care Act Subsidy Calculator"). These lower the amount you pay for health insurance each month. **About four in five people can get health insurance for $10 or less per month.**

From 2024 to 2025, the average health insurance [premium](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-premium "What Is a Health Insurance Premium?"), or monthly rate, went up by 7% nationwide. Vermont saw the largest jump, at 27%.
**[Health insurance is getting more expensive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/rising-health-insurance-costs-survey "74% of Americans Stressed About High Health Insurance Costs"), mostly because health care is getting more expensive.**

Most [large companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/largest-health-insurance-companies "Largest Health Insurance Companies") offer some kind of low-cost medical insurance. **Kaiser Permanente has the cheapest health insurance, while UnitedHealthcare (UHC) has the most expensive rates.** But the average health insurance cost by state can differ to a wide degree, so UHC may be a good deal depending on where you live.

The best way to find affordable health insurance plans is to [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance "Compare Health Insurance Quotes and Prices") on your state's health exchange from different companies.

Health insurance rates range from $361 per month for a Catastrophic plan to $913 per month for a [Platinum plan](https://www.valuepenguin.com/platinum-health-insurance-guide "What Is Platinum Health Insurance?"). Bronze plans, the best cheap health insurance for most people, cost $488 per month, on average.
[Silver plans](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-is-silver-plan-health-insurance "What is Silver Plan Health Insurance?") cost $621 per month on average. Over half of people who have ACA coverage choose Silver plans since they offer a good combination of moderate rates and middle-of-the-road costs that you're responsible for. Gold plans cost $676 per month, on average.

**Silver** plans are the middle tier, with average  deductibles, [copays and coinsurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/copay-vs-coinsurance "Coinsurance vs. Copays: What Are the Differences").
Silver plans are the best choice for many people because of their middle-of-the-road costs. If you have a Silver plan and earn a low income, you may be able to get subsidies called [cost-sharing reductions (CSRs)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/obamacare/cost-sharing-reductions "Cost Sharing Reduction \(CSR\): What It Means and Who's Eligible?"). **You can only get CSRs with Silver plans.**
If you can't get cost-sharing reductions, a Bronze plan might make more sense for affordable medical insurance if you're in good health, and you can easily cover your plan's [deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-deductibles "What Is a Health Insurance Deductible and How Does It Work?") from your savings.
---|---|---|---
[Catastrophic](https://www.valuepenguin.com/catastrophic-health-insurance "Benefits and Costs of Catastrophic Health Insurance") | $335 | $361 | 8%
[Silver](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-is-silver-plan-health-insurance "What Is Silver Plan Health Insurance?") | $583 | $621 | 6%
[Gold](https://www.valuepenguin.com/gold-plans-cost-and-coverage "Gold Plans: Cost and Coverage") | $641 | $676 | 5%
[Platinum](https://www.valuepenguin.com/platinum-health-insurance-guide "What Is Platinum Health Insurance?") | $811 | $913 | 13%
Your monthly rate also depends on the plan type you choose. For example, [PPOs (preferred provider organizations)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/ppo-health-insurance-plans "What Is PPO Health Insurance?")tend to cost more than [HMOs (health maintenance organizations)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/hmo-health-plans "HMO Plan Basics: About Health Maintenance Organizations"). For a higher monthly rate, PPOs give you more flexibility when it comes to the doctors you see.

Private health insurance includes plans you buy on your own, often called individual health plans, and plans through your workplace, sometimes called [group health plans](https://www.valuepenguin.com/group-health-insurance-guide "Guide to Group Health Insurance").
Private health plans bought through a state or federal exchange are eligible for [government subsidies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/aca-subsidy-calculator "Obamacare / ACA Subsidy Calculator")(except Catastrophic plans). These subsidies can lower your monthly rate and, in some cases, help you pay for other insurance costs.
* **Age:** Generally speaking, your health insurance rates will increase as you get older until you reach [age 65 and become eligible for Medicare](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medicare-eligibility "Medicare Eligibility: Age 65 and Other Ways to Qualify").
Your insurance company, your plan tier and whether you have an [HMO or a PPO](https://www.valuepenguin.com/hmo-vs-ppo-health-insurance "HMO vs. PPO Insurance: What's the Difference?")also impact your monthly rate.
Private health insurance is any type of medical insurance sold by a company. This includes workplace coverage — often called group health insurance — and [individual coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/individual-and-family-health-insurance "Private Health Insurance for Individuals and Families").
Government health insurance plans like Medicare and [Medicaid](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance/medicaid-eligibility-requirements "Find Out if You're Eligible for Medicaid") aren't considered private health insurance.
A Silver health insurance plan costs an average of $621 per month on the [health insurance marketplace](https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-exchanges "Health Insurance Exchanges Explained"). People making a low income may qualify for subsidies, which can drastically lower your monthly costs. If you earn $30,000 a year, a Silver plan could cost $49 per month. If you earn $45,000, you could pay $223 per month for coverage, on average.
