Who owns State Farm Insurance?

Who owns State Farm Insurance? State Farm is a mutual company, which means that it is owned by its policyholders. Unlike publicly traded companies, State Farm does not have shareholders to whom it needs to provide dividends. Instead, the company’s profits are distributed back to its policyholders in the form of lower premiums, better coverage, or policy improvements. The primary purpose of a mutual insurance company is to serve the best interests of its policyholders rather than focusing on [generating profits](https://www.under30ceo.com/increase-profits-by-engaging-the-next-generation-of-top-talent/) for stockholders.

## Company History

State Farm is a large insurance and financial services company based in the United States. It was founded in 1922 by George J. Mecherle, who was a retired farmer and insurance agent. The company initially focused on providing auto insurance for farmers and, later, expanded its offerings to include a wide range of insurance products and financial services.

Ownership of State Farm has evolved as the company has grown. Since its inception, State Farm has been a mutual company, meaning that it is owned by policyholders rather than shareholders. This structure is intended to prioritize the needs and interests of [customers rather than the pursuit of profits for external](https://www.under30ceo.com/what-is-an-external-customer/) investors. As the company has expanded and diversified, the ownership has remained in the hands of its policyholders, even as the overall structure of the organization has changed.

Over time, State Farm has grown into a group of companies comprising different subsidiaries and affiliate organizations, each specializing in various aspects of the [insurance and financial services industries](https://www.under30ceo.com/how-5-insurance-startups-are-disrupting-a-stale-industry/). State Farm currently operates through its parent company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and several subsidiaries, such as State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm [Life Insurance](https://www.under30ceo.com/life-insurance-a-financial-tool-not-a-magic-solution/) Company, and State Farm Bank, among others. In summary, State Farm originated as a mutual company in 1922 and has remained so throughout its history. The policyholders, rather than shareholders, are the owners of State Farm, which has allowed the company to focus on its [customers’ needs](https://www.under30ceo.com/creating-better-customer-service-using-an-lms/) and interests.

## Who was the original founder?

George J. Mecherle founded State Farm in 1922, bringing his farming background and experience as an insurance salesman to create a company that served farmers’ unique needs. Born on June 7, 1877, in Merna, Illinois, Mecherle recognized that farmers often paid higher auto insurance premiums than city drivers, even though they had fewer accidents. He launched a mutual automobile insurance company to provide fair, affordable coverage for farmers.

Mecherle aimed to build a customer-focused, service-driven company with the motto, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.” The company started with auto insurance but quickly grew to include homeowners, life, and health insurance. Under Mecherle’s leadership, State Farm expanded rapidly, becoming the largest auto insurer in the U.S. by 1946.

Today, State Farm ranks among the Fortune 500 companies and remains a leader in insurance and financial services. Although Mecherle passed away in 1951, his vision continues to guide the company’s commitment to fairness, efficiency, and [customer service](https://www.under30ceo.com/customer-service-tools/).

State Farm builds success by understanding and meeting customer needs. The company focuses on fairness and community, earning the trust of millions of people. This trust comes from more than selling insurance, it comes from being a reliable partner during life’s critical moments.
