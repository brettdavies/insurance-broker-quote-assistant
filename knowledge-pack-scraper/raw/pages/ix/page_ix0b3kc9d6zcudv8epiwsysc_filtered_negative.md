State Farm has been the subject of many questions and comments during my presentations over the past several years. So, I became intrigued by the company’s tooth-and-nail fight against a customer over an alleged hail-damaged roof that was replaced for only $18,740. This recent federal court decision from Alabama highlights the growing importance of causation expert testimony in property insurance cases involving hail damage to roofs. [1](https://www.propertyinsurancecoveragelaw.com/blog/state-farm-wins-alabama-worn-out-roof-damage-case-lesson-about-hail-damage-cases-expert-testimony-and-investigation-standards/#_ftn1)
The case reminds policyholders and public adjusters of the importance of early causation experts in property damage claims, particularly those involving hailstorm damage to roofs. When insurers attribute damage to wear and tear, policyholders need qualified experts who can scientifically distinguish storm damage from normal deterioration. The court’s emphasis on expert testimony over contractor observations suggests that simply having multiple contractors identify possible hail damage isn’t enough to overcome an insurer’s expert causation evidence.
The quality of legal representation for the policyholder and the insurance company was excellent. The Butler Snow firm did a magical job for State Farm convincing the court that the independent adjuster was an “expert witness,” with the court finding:
In this case, the State Farm insurance agent told the policyholder which roofing contractor should be called out for help. That is what the policyholder did. The claims department hired an independent insurance adjuster who is not an employee of State Farm and who had a different opinion than the roofer (and a couple more roofers) about the hail damage. And that is how a dispute for something slightly less than $20,000 ended up in a federal court, with State Farm certainly paying much more money to its outstanding attorneys in fees than what it could have paid to its customer to repair the roof.
