User Reviews |  3.2 268 reviews

Our RatingCompare.com's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The objective formula used in these reviews weighs several important factors to consider when choosing financial products and services, including customer satisfaction ratings, ease of use, and a number of other components. |  4.3 /5
Liability OnlyLiability-only insurance, sometimes called minimum-coverage insurance, pays for bodily injury and property damage to others in an accident the policyholder causes. It does not pay for the insured’s own damages. | $102/mo
Full CoverageFull-coverage car insurance generally includes liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, and may include other optional coverages such as uninsured motorist coverage. Collision covers a policyholder’s repair or replacement costs in case of an accident. Comprehensive covers damages caused by non-accident events. The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $171/mo

Though the company doesn’t offer the [cheapest rates](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance), it doesn’t charge high rates, on average. Plus, Progressive offers many discounts to help you save, and its number of customer complaints is lower than average for companies of similar size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive#cite-2)
