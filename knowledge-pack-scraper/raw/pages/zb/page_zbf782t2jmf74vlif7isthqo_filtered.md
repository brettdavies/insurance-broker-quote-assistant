Hurricane insurance is somewhat of a misnomer: No one policy can cover all the damage caused by a hurricane. To be fully protected, you need a combination of [homeowners insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) and [flood insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/).

Your homeowners policy may cover windstorm coverage with a separate deductible or, in some hurricane-prone states, you may have to get a separate windstorm insurance policy.

Below, we’ve named the best insurance companies for this kind of protection. (See [our methodology](#KSwSdGPa7_) for more information.)

## Does homeowners insurance cover hurricane damage?

In a hurricane, homeowners mainly face damage from wind and flooding, which require two different policies.

[Homeowners insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) can cover wind damage, though it varies by state. If you can’t get windstorm coverage on the private market, some state insurance associations offer coverage for wind and hail damage.

Since homeowners insurance [doesn’t cover flooding](https://www.cnbc.com/select/4-things-homeowners-insurance-doesnt-cover-/), however, you’ll need [flood insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/flood-insurance-cost/) to be fully covered in the event of a hurricane. Policies are available from [private insurers](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/) and through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

## States where hurricane deductibles apply

A deductible is the amount that you have to pay out of pocket before your insurer pays on your claim. Generally, it’s deducted from the check you receive from your insurer for repairs or replacement items.

Flood insurance and homeowners insurance policies have separate deductibles: Deductibles for home policies are usually a flat dollar amount. If your home is damaged due to wind, a named storm or a hurricane, however, you may have to pay an additional percentage-based deductible.

These 19 states have hurricane or named storm deductibles:

* Alabama
* Connecticut
* Delaware
* Florida
* Georgia
* Hawaii
* Louisiana
* Maine
* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* Mississippi
* New Jersey
* New York
* North Carolina
* Pennsylvania
* Rhode Island
* South Carolina
* Texas
* Virginia

## What is windstorm insurance?

Homeowners insurance can cover some damage caused by windstorms. But, it may not cover it entirely, especially if you live in an area where hurricanes are common.

This type of policy can be a rider or endorsement on a standard homeowners insurance policy, or as a standalone policy. There may be a separate deductible, however, especially if you live in a coastal state or other high-risk area.

Many insurance companies prohibit homeowners from purchasing windstorm coverage 24 to 48 hours before a major hurricane or named storm.

## FAQs

### What does hurricane insurance cover?

Hurricane insurance can cover damage to your home, other structures and personal belongings caused by hurricanes, hailstorms, tornadoes and other severe weather. To be fully protected, you’ll need a homeowners policy with windstorm coverage and a flood insurance policy.

### What is the deductible for hurricane insurance?

Windstorm deductibles are typically between 1% and 10% of a home’s insured value. A homeowner with a home insured for $500,000, for example, would pay a deductible of between $5,000 and $50,000.

### Will hurricane insurance cover damage to my car?

Hurricane insurance won’t cover damage to your car. [Comprehensive car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/types-of-car-insurance/) can cover damage to your vehicle caused by flooding, falling tree limbs and other hurricane-related incidents.

### How can I lower the cost of hurricane insurance?

You can often lower the cost of any kind of insurance by shopping around, bundling policies, choosing a higher deductible and improving your credit score. For hurricane insurance, making home improvements that mitigate wind and flood damage — like storm-resistant windows or new roofing — can help you save
