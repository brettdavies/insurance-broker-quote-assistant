Pros
  * Quotes available online
  * Simple claims process with guaranteed repairs
  * Many coverage options and discounts


Cons
  * Low claims satisfaction

### **Where Progressive stands out**
Progressive’s car insurance offerings include a lot of bells and whistles. From accident forgiveness to loyalty rewards to deductible savings banks — all geared to widen the safety net of your policy.
Though the company doesn’t offer the [cheapest rates](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance), it doesn’t charge high rates, on average. Plus, Progressive offers many discounts to help you save, and its number of customer complaints is lower than average for companies of similar size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive#cite-2)
### **Where Progressive falls short**
While Progressive offers the attractive features and benefits above, customer feedback suggests that customer service is just average. Progressive’s overall satisfaction and claims handling scores are both below the industry average. 
## **Progressive Reviews: What Real Customers Are Saying**
Reading what real customers say about a company is one of the most important steps anyone can take when researching a new car insurance company. Current and past customers can shed light on how a company handles billing issues, claims, cancellations, and refunds.
Customers also highlight common problems and share tips on how to get more from your relationship with the insurer. Here are Progressive reviews from Compare.com customers who have or have had Progressive insurance in the past.
