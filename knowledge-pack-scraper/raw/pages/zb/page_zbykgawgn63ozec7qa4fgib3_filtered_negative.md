California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has called for a public rate hearing on April 8 to review State Farm’s proposal. The hearing will allow the company to present updated data to justify the increase and address concerns raised by consumer advocacy groups like Consumer Watchdog. These groups have welcomed the hearing as a step toward transparency and accountability.![Public Hearing](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Public-Hearing.jpg)
