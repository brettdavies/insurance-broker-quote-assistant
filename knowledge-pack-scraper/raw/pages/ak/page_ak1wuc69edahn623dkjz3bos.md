#  Anyone install Fire Sprinkler systems and got insurance rebates? 
Wondering if this would be worth installing in a home. Anyone here have experience with fire sprinkler systems and had any insurance rebates? I heard from someone that their insurance was going to charge way more unless they installed sprinklers. But my insurance broker is telling me it's a total waste of time and money. Thoughts?

You will get between 10-20% discount on the policy, depending on the insurance company

Could wind up being a push as regular inspections and repairs to the system may be required. Also consider water damage from sprinkler activation can cause damage too

Residential sprinkler suppression system doesn't* require any annual inspection nor maintenance . Yes if the system goes off there will be water damage but that's better compared to total or significant structure loss 
*The outside pressure gauge needs to be changed every 5 years.

Neighborhoods for young professionals in LA 
Finding the best neighborhood in LA for young professionals can be challenging due to the city's vastness and diversity. Here are some top recommendations based on Redditor experiences and opinions: 
### Popular Neighborhoods for Young Professionals
  * **Santa Monica** : Known for its vibrant nightlife, beach access, and a good mix of young professionals. ["Santa Monica, Venice or Culver."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/16a89kz/comment/jz78c8q/)
  * **Venice** : Offers a lively bar and restaurant scene, although it can be expensive and has a notable homeless population. ["Live by work... tons of young people, nightlife and great restaurants in Venice and SM."](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/lx5lbw/comment/gpl3awi/)
  * **Culver City** : A central location with good amenities and a growing professional crowd. ["Culver City. Good restaurants, including some of the best Indian food in the area. Fewer homeless."](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/n6rp16/comment/gx9y1m7/)
  * **Silver Lake** : Known for its hipster vibe, eclectic shops, and charming cafes. ["Silverlake or Los Feliz if you want a calmer hipster vibe near Griffith Park."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1gko9y8/comment/lvmw8jw/)
  * **Los Feliz** : Offers a mix of young professionals and families, with a variety of dining and entertainment options. ["Los Feliz, close to the 5 so you can jet down to Costa Mesa."](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/n6rp16/comment/gx8t3m6/)
  * **West Hollywood (WeHo)** : A hub for nightlife and entertainment, popular among young singles. ["West Hollywood, Silver Lake (and surrounding areas), and downtown Long Beach are also good."](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/lx5lbw/comment/gpl8yv5/)
  * **Echo Park** : A walkable neighborhood with a strong sense of community and plenty of local spots. ["I would choose Echo Park or Koreatown over expensive cities in the valley."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1l19p2d/comment/mvjjfv6/)
  * **Palms** : A more affordable option with good commute access and a mix of young professionals. ["Palms. Commute to DTLA is a breeze in comparison to other cross town commutes."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/hferzy/comment/fvxhql8/)


### Considerations When Moving to LA
  * **Rent Before You Buy** : It's advisable to rent for a year to get a feel for the city before committing to a purchase. ["Don't buy before you come. Rent for a year while you get to know the city."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/16a89kz/comment/jz60g34/)
  * **Commute** : Minimize your commute by living close to work, as LA traffic can be severe. ["Live as close to work as possible. Traffic makes the rules here."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/hferzy/comment/fvxxpxk/)
  * **Vibe and Lifestyle** : Consider what kind of atmosphere you prefer, whether it's a bustling urban environment or a more relaxed, suburban feel. ["Depends where you live, what you're into, where you will be working."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/16a89kz/comment/jz63jiu/)
