Progressive is a popular car insurance choice that offers a wide range of coverage for all types of vehicles, as well as other insurance options. We recommend Progressive car insurance because of its high AM Best rating of A+ (superior) and because they are less likely to drop you from their policy after an accident. Additionally, Progressive insures other vehicles that might be hard to cover with other companies, including ATVs, snowmobiles, boats, and classic cars.

Progressive is also a good choice for those wanting to take advantage of discounts. When compared to other popular car insurance companies, Progressive had more discount options. Every driver should qualify for at least one discount.

We also recommend Progressive if you have had issues getting insured after a DUI or other careless driving incidents. From our research, we found that Progressive is more likely to insure drivers with less than stellar driving records. The optional accident forgiveness add-on will cost more, but keep your rates steady if something happens.

## How much does Progressive cost?

Progressive's policies are, generally, cheaper than the national average according to insurance data aggregator, Insurify.

The insurer offers several discounts that may help you bring down your insurance premium and is known for its Name Your Price Tool, an online service that lets you choose the amount of money you'd like to pay for insurance to quickly see the level of coverage you'd be able to secure for that amount.

Your specific premium will vary based on a [range of factors](https://financebuzz.com/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates), but you can expect to find lower prices with Progressive than you'd find elsewhere.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **Progressive liability-only monthly premium** | **Progressive full coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $104 | $182 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $125 | $204 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $136 | $223 |
| DUI on driving record | $164 | $268 |
| Teen driver | $187 | $306 |
| Senior driver (60s) | $62 | $101 |
| Senior driver (70s) | $52 | $86 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | |  |

Compare these sample rates against the national averages for each driver type shown below to get an idea of how much you might save with Progressive:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver type** | **National average liability-only monthly premium** | **National average full coverage monthly premium** |
| Clean driving record | $105 | $192 |
| Speeding ticket on driving record | $141 | $265 |
| At-fault accident on driving record | $146 | $274 |
| DUI on driving record | $166 | $313 |

## Is Progressive a good insurance company?

**Company ratings:**

* AM Best: A+
* J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 672/1,000 (study average of 697)
* BBB: A+
* NAIC complaints: 0.97 (Private Passenger)

Progressive performs well across most industry customer service metrics, with the slight exception of its J.D. Power claims satisfaction score. The insurer ranks toward the bottom of the pack in J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, scoring 672 against the study's 697 average out of 1,000. For comparison, the top ranking company, NJM, scored 782 out of 1,000.

This score indicates a general dissatisfaction with the claims process, which is an important factor to keep in mind when looking for an insurer. Even so, with a score of 0.97, Progressive's NAIC complaint index shows that the insurer receives slightly fewer complaints than expected based on marketwide data (expressed as an index score of 1.00).

Progressive gets a strong A+ financial health rating from AM Best, indicating that the company won't have any issues covering claims from a financial perspective, and its A+ grade from the Better Business Bureau likewise indicates that Progressive, overall, has a positive relationship with its customers.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Company name** | **Average monthly full coverage** | **Average monthly liability-only coverage** |
| USAA | $99 | $46 |
| GEICO | $118 | $55 |
| State Farm | $119 | $55 |
| Allstate | $132 | $62 |
| Progressive | $148 | $101 |
| American Family | $157 | $72 |
| Nationwide | $181 | $85 |
| Travelers | $191 | $90 |
| **National average** | **$199** | **$105** |
| Farmers | $236 | $110 |
| Liberty Mutual | $250 | $169 |
| Data sourced from [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) | | |

### Progressive vs. Liberty Mutual

Though Progressive isn't the cheapest insurance out there, it's certainly cheaper than Liberty Mutual. While Progressive's average liability-only quote runs $104 monthly, Liberty Mutual charges an average of $172 per month, according to data from Insurify.

Insurify reports that the national average monthly cost of liability-only car insurance is $104 per month, so Progressive is right around average, while Liberty mutual pretty significantly exceeds that number.

### Progressive vs. GEICO

To provide a counter example, GEICO averages $97 per month for liability-only coverage, according to Insurify. GECIO offers cheaper rates on average for full coverage insurance, coming in at $143 a month on average compared to Progressive's $182 average monthly premium.

Even so, [Progressive and GEICO](https://financebuzz.com/geico-vs-progressive) both rank among the top five most affordable insurers by average monthly premium for both full coverage and liability-only coverage, according to Insurify.

## Additional Progressive insurance products

Progressive offers several types of insurance in four main categories:

* **Vehicle**: Progressive offers insurance policies for vehicles from your car, truck, or motorcycle to snowmobiles, golf carts, and even Segways and E-bikes.
* **Property**: Progressive provides homeowners insurance, condo insurance, and renters insurance policies.
* **Personal**: Progressive partners with other insurance carriers to offer life, health, pet, dental, travel, and vision insurance.
* **Business**: Progressive is the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S. It also partners with other companies to offer other business-related insurance coverages, including business owners, general liability, professional liability, and workers' compensation policies.

The company also partners with several companies and financial institutions to offer financial services such as online banking, personal loans, and a car-shopping service.

## FAQs

### Is Progressive good at paying insurance claims?

According to the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), Progressive ranked highest in the service segment, surpassing American Family and [Nationwide](https://financebuzz.com/nationwide-vs-progressive).

Progressive states that it tries to resolve claims quickly. However, car accidents that involve multiple cars and drivers and result in extensive injuries may require lengthy investigations, which can delay claim payouts. Insurers are usually required to complete their accident investigations within 30 days.

### Who is cheaper, GEICO or Progressive?

Many drivers compare GEICO vs. Progressive, and while GEICO tends to be cheaper, it depends on your age, driving history, and location. Drivers utilizing Progressive's usage-based insurance program might be able to get their rate down lower than with GEICO DriveEasy program since it can use a telematics plug-in rather than relying on an app running in the background.

### Will Progressive cover you if you have a DUI?

Many car insurance companies will drop you if you have a DUI, but Progressive is one of the few that will most likely keep you on. You will see an increase in your rate until the DUI is off your record, and you can expect accident coverage if you experience an accident while drunk.

  

## Bottom line

Progressive — an insurance industry staple since 1937 — offers competitive rates and a range of discounts, though its roster of discounts is slightly limited in scope compared to some competitors.

If you live in an area that doesn't allow a lot of discounts, such as California, it might be worth shopping for other quotes, given that you'll be disqualified from a handful of the discounts Progressive does offer.

The Name Your Price tool might come in handy if you are on a tight budget because it gives you control over setting an insurance rate that fits your budget.

Overall, though, Progressive earns its spot on our list of the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies), falling around or below national averages for cost and ranking well by most customer satisfaction metrics.
