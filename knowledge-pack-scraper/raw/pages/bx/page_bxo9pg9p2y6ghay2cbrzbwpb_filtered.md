To help you compare how auto insurance costs can vary by company, we included our sample quotes for a 2014 financed vehicle in Alabama below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Company | Annual Premium | Monthly Premium | Deductible |
| State Farm | $2,084 | $173 | $1,000 |

### Available discounts

State Farm offers a few discounts to help you save money on your auto insurance.

* Drive Safe & Save ™: Drive Safe & Save lets you take control of your auto insurance. Simply enrolling gives you an upfront discount, and then you have the potential to save up to 30% based on your driving habits.
* Steer Clear: If you’re a new driver or under 25, you may be eligible for their Sterr Clear program. This offers you the opportunity to save money while honing your skills to become a safer, more confident driver.
* Bundling discount: Additional savings are offered if you have other State Farm insurance products, such as homeowners, renters, or life insurance, in addition to auto insurance. The website states that you can save up to $1,073 if you bundle auto & home insurance.
* Multiple auto savings: If State Farm insures two or more vehicles in your household, their discounts can help lower your insurance premiums.

It’s worth noting that these discounts are not available in every state. For more information, contact a local State Farm agent.

State Farm offers fewer discounts compared to other top insurers. If you’re looking for a more robust assortment of discounts, look into Liberty Mutual or American Family.

## What Auto Insurance Coverage Options Are Available?

State Farm offers plenty of coverage options when it comes to car insurance. This includes:

### Collision insurance

Collision insurance steps in to cover the costs of repairing or replacing your vehicle if it’s been in a collision with another vehicle or object, no matter who’s at fault. This coverage is pivotal for accidents, ensuring your car gets the attention it needs to get back on the road.

### Comprehensive insurance

Comprehensive insurance offers protection against a range of incidents that aren’t collisions, like theft, vandalism, natural disasters, or run-ins with animals. It’s the safety net for unexpected events, guaranteeing you’re covered for a wide array of unforeseen circumstances.

### Rental insurance

Rental car reimbursement, or rental insurance, kicks in if your car is undergoing covered repairs after a collision or comprehensive claim. It handles the expenses of a rental car up to a specific daily limit, making sure you have reliable transportation while your vehicle is in the shop.

Rideshare insurance is tailored for folks who drive for services like Uber or Lyft. It provides coverage that effectively bridges the gap between your personal auto policy and the insurance offered by the rideshare company. This ensures you’re appropriately covered while using your car for business.

### Emergency roadside service

Emergency roadside service offers aid in common road-related emergencies. This can include services like towing, jump-starts for dead batteries, tire changes, lockout assistance, and fuel delivery. It’s your lifeline when you’re stuck on the road, assuring you that help is just a call away.

### Additional coverage options

State Farms offers extensive additional coverages that can be used to customize a policy to your needs.

A few noteworthy add-ons include:

#### Uninsured motorist coverage

Around one in eight drivers nationwide lacks car insurance, as per a 2017 report by the Insurance Research Council. Rates vary by state, ranging from about 5 percent (1 in 20 drivers) in Maine to over 26 percent (1 in 4 drivers) in Florida. In an accident with such drivers, they might not have the funds to cover damages. State Farm may cover medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages in such scenarios.

#### Underinsured motorist coverage

Underinsured motorist coverage assists in covering accident expenses when you’re not at fault. This applies even if the other driver has liability insurance but lacks sufficient coverage to pay for all the damages resulting from the accident.

#### Medical payments

Medical payments coverage (Med Pay) assists in covering medical and funeral expenses for the policyholders, passengers, or their family members injured in an auto accident, regardless of fault. This includes situations like being injured while in someone else’s vehicle, using public transportation, or even while walking across the street.

#### Liability coverage

Liability car insurance covers costs for the other driver’s property damage and injuries if you’re deemed “at fault” in an accident. Your insurer covers expenses up to the specified limit for property damages and injuries.

Contact a local agent for more information on the add-ons available to you.

## Methodology

Expertise’s auto insurance rating methodology takes into account the following details about each company:

* Financial strength: This category examines a company’s ability to pay future claims based on assessments from independent agencies like AM Best and Demotech. Companies with a higher score from these third-party companies ranked higher in this category.
* Customer satisfaction: Our team examined <https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study>, which provides an analysis of customers’ perceptions and expectations of their insurer’s performance throughout the entire claims experience. Companies that ranked higher on J.D. Power’s list scored higher in this category.
* Coverage availability: Our team examined state availability for each company and rated companies with higher availability than competitors.
* Consumer experience: For this category, our team reviewed each company’s website, mobile app, quote tool, and customer service availability.
* Consumer complaints: Our team reviewed complaints to state regulators as reported by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size or share of total premiums in the industry. The NAIC assigns a median complaint ratio of 1.0. Companies with an NAIC complaint score of less than 1 scored higher in this category.
* Premium cost: This category assesses auto insurance costs based on the quotes we gathered from each company for a sample 2014 financed vehicle in Alabama. Companies that provided lower quotes scored higher in this category.

To score companies in these categories, we collected data points from the companies' websites, company representatives, state regulator data, and third-party analyses.

These data points were then compared against each other and given a star rating score, where one star represents a poor rating and a five-star score represents an excellent rating. To calculate the star rating, we looked at each company’s total weighted score, divided by the maximum score, and multiplied by five.

Our ratings are weighted based on our editorial opinions. We use the following weightings for our auto insurance company ratings:

* Financial strength (20%)
* Customer satisfaction (15%)
* Coverage availability (10%)
* Consumer experience (20%)
* Consumer complaints (15%)
* Premium cost (20%)
