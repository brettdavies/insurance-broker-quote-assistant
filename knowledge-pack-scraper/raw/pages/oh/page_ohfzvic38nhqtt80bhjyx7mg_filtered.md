## The best car insurance companies in Sacramento

Finding the cheapest [average car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/) in Sacramento is important to many drivers. But the cost of coverage doesn’t tell the whole story, so Bankrate developed a five-point scoring system to help shoppers identify which [California car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california/) may be best for them. Our proprietary Bankrate Scores go beyond average rates to incorporate financial strength ratings from AM Best, customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power, coverage availability, digital tools and more.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Mercury has an A (Excellent) rating with AM Best and a network of local agents throughout Sacramento. While most of the coverage options with Mercury are relatively basic, it usually offers low average rates for both full and minimum coverage. Those who don’t drive often may benefit from Mercury’s RealDrive low-mileage insurance program, too.

**Why Mercury may be the best for rideshare coverage:** Sacramento drivers with [side hustles](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/best-side-hustles/) may have a hard time finding car insurance if they participate in ridesharing. Mercury is one of the few insurance companies to offer ridesharing coverage that applies during offline/personal use and when the ride-hailing app is on but the driver hasn't connected with a rider yet.  According to Mercury's website, the cost of rideshare insurance can start as low as $0.90 per day.

## The cheapest car insurance companies in Sacramento

Drivers in big cities like Sacramento tend to face an increased chance of car accidents due to population density, as well as a higher risk of theft and vandalism. This contributes to the higher cost of insurance drivers may encounter here. Extreme weather-related risks like wildfires, flooding and earthquakes can influence rates to tick up further. To find the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/), experts recommend gathering quotes from several insurers. It may be beneficial to start your search with the following companies based on Bankrate’s analysis of average annual premiums.

## How much is car insurance in Sacramento, California?

Auto insurance can be expensive, especially in the Golden State where average rates are higher than [what is typical nationwide](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). The average cost of car insurance in Sacramento is $3,256 per year for full coverage. Minimum coverage costs an average of $967 per year. For comparison, the national average cost of full coverage is $2,671 a year — 17 percent less than in Sacramento.

### Sacramento rates for teens

[Teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) in Sacramento pay some of the highest car insurance premiums. That's because [driving statistics](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in car accidents than more experienced drivers. Insurance companies charge teen drivers higher premiums to offset their financial losses in case of an accident or other serious claim.

Most teenagers need to be insured on a parent's policy. In California, drivers can only purchase their own car insurance policy once they turn 18. It's typically much cheaper for teens to stay insured on a parent's policy than to get their own policy while they continue to gain road experience.

In the table below, you can see the average car insurance rates in Sacramento for teen drivers insured on their married parents' auto insurance policy.

### Sacramento rates for young drivers

While young drivers can save money by remaining on their parents' policies for as long as possible, they may need to get their own policy once they move out of their parents’ home. Car insurance rates for young Sacramento drivers start to decline as they gain more driving experience but usually remain elevated until they turn 25. To keep [car insurance rates for young adults](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) in check, drivers should focus on maintaining a clean driving record and asking about discounts (like good student or student-away-at-school savings) that may apply to them.

### Sacramento rates for senior drivers

It's typical for senior drivers to see their car insurance rates tick up with age. This is due to observed trends such as a decline in sight, reaction time and other changes that might affect a driver’s capacity to avert accidents and unexpected road situations. However, rising [car insurance rates for seniors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-seniors/) can be curbed by drivers by utilizing senior discounts and asking about a reduced mileage auto insurance policy.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Sacramento

Drunk driving is considered a high-risk driving behavior. [Car insurance for drivers with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) can be costly and is not always easy to obtain. If you are convicted of a DUI, you will need to make sure your insurance company can file a [California SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-california/) on your behalf if the courts require it. If they cannot, you may need to switch to a nonstandard carrier. Sacramento drivers pay an average of $8,245 per year for full coverage car insurance after a DUI, or 153 percent more than the city average for drivers with a clean record.

Minimum coverage requirements in Sacramento

In almost every state, drivers are legally required to carry car insurance. Mandatory coverage types and policy limits vary by state. [California law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/) requires all drivers to have at least the following:

* $15,000 in [bodily injury liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) per person
* $30,000 in bodily injury liability per accident
* $5,000 in [property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) per accident

Alternatively, drivers may elect to make a $35,000 cash deposit with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or obtain an equivalent DMV-issued self-insurance certificate from a licensed company.

Keep in mind that state-mandated minimum insurance does not provide coverage for damage your vehicle incurs in an accident you cause. It is designed to help pay for property damage or driver/passenger injuries others sustain if you’re deemed at fault. For this reason, insurance experts recommend that drivers purchase additional types of insurance (like collision and comprehensive coverage) and higher policy limits if they can afford to do so.

For Sacramento drivers, [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) may be particularly beneficial. This coverage pays out in the event of a covered theft or vandalism loss, which is more common in a bigger city. It also covers losses from wildfires, high winds, earthquakes and flooding.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
