Here’s the thing accident forgiveness will not affect your premium for this one incident, but it doesn’t take away any surcharges you’d incur for this incident. So if your merit rating were to change because of this, that will be seeable / follow you anywhere. It’s great to have accident forgiveness so the policy doesn’t spike (of course, if you don’t get in any more - because usually it only covers one)
I don’t work in claims so I never knew if surcharges were incurred if there was a police report (ie speeding, hit/run, etc) or from claims —
Honestly considering the cost of repairs, I’d honestly sell / buy something else. Don’t file a claim. But that’s just me. I’ve seen plenty of people not get the total amount of repair covered in claims. And /if/ it would only potentially affect your record if you file - you’d be better off not.. as the rate that remains on record can have a longer lasting effect if you decide to leave Geico at any point

On the other hand, the purpose of paying for accident forgiveness is precisely so that you can use it in this type of scenario. Yet you still feel like it's not worth it to use your one pass to get your car fixed. If this is the case, then what is your goal with paying for accident forgiveness in the first place?
How committed are you to this car? If you are indifferent to the car and the thought of using your one accident forgiveness pass hurts that much, then maybe selling it does make sense. But the resale value would likely reflect the damage, so you would just be getting deduction comparable to the cost of repairs. Is it really worth $8500 to you not to use your accident forgiveness claim?

The service department is now charging close to $12,000 for repairs. I don't believe the car to be worth more than $16k-$18k not needing repair.
I am going to try to get the vehicle appraised and see if I can sell it as is. If I am not able to I will have to get it repaired using the accident forgiveness to even sell because technically now it is not in drivable condition.
Thanks for your input
