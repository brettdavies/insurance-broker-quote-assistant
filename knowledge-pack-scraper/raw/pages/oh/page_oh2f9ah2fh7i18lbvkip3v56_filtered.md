# Geico Insurance Accident Forgiveness Question

Hi,

I recently hit a large pothole on the highway that was unavoidable in my 2018 bmw 330xi. The service department of my dealership said the suspension strut is badly damaged and needs to be replaced and because the suspension strut needs to be replaced the steering column will also need to be replaced. They have quoted me around $2500 for the engine strut and close to $6000 for the steering column.

My car has around 62,000 miles on it and I believe it to be worth around $18,000 on KBB. My question is this: My geico collision policy has given me accident forgiveness for being a safe driver with a clean driving record. One agent that I spoke with at Geico told me that because I have accident forgiveness filing this claim for the repair will not affect my monthly premium.

I am still skeptical as this is a large claim and know that since hitting a pot hole is considered an at fault accident it will stick to my record. I am very much considering selling my damaged car for what I am able to get for it (I believe I still owe around ($9,000) on the loan and hope to just break even.

Would you suggest going through with the claim having the repair done since Geico is claiming it will not affect my premium because of the accident forgiveness. Or would you suggest just selling the car damaged and not having it potentially affect my monthly premium in perpetuity and just try to break even on the car.

Thank you for the help
