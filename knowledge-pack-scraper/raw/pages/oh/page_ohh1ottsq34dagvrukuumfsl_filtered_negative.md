**Why****Allstate****made our list:** Allstate stands out for its impressive selection of car insurance discounts. The company offers savings for new vehicles, paying in full, responsible payers, smart students, policy bundling and many others. Allstate also offers a usage-based insurance (UBI) program, called Drivewise, which can help you earn a lower premium if you demonstrate safe driving habits. It was rated one of the top insurers for UBI by J.D. Power, and received a great score for digital service in J.D. Power's [U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). Additionally, accident-free drivers can participate in Deductible Rewards to get up to $500 off their collision insurance deductible.
**Why****Allstate****may be the best for bundled policies:** For drivers who are interested in pooling all their insurance needs with a single company for ease of use, Allstate may be a strong contender. In addition to its other discounts, Allstate offers savings for those who purchase both their auto and their home, condo or renters insurance with the company. According to Allstate's website, customers who bundle auto insurance with home insurance can [save up to 25%](https://www.allstate.com/insurance-bundling) on their premium. Working with a single agent and one company can reduce both the amount of paperwork and management that your policies require.
