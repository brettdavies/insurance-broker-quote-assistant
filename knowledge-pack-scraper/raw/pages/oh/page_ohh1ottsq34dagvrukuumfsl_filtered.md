State Farm provides 24/7 phone claims support, or you can file online or using the carrier’s mobile app. However, State Farm does not offer gap insurance, which may deter drivers who want coverage for newer vehicles.

**Why USAA made our list:** USAA consistently earns one of J.D. Power’s highest scores for customer satisfaction and [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), but is ineligible for official ranking because the insurer only offers car insurance to military members, veterans and their eligible family members. With USAA’s usage-based auto insurance program, [SafePilot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usaa-safepilot/), you could earn up to a 10 percent discount just for enrolling, plus up to 30 percent savings by maintaining safe driving habits. USAA members also enjoy numerous perks, such as discounts at select rental car agencies, ADT Home security monitoring discounts, shopping rewards and travel deals.

**Why USAA may be the best for military-focused coverage:** As an insurer with a primary focus on military professionals and their family, it's not unexpected that USAA would offer perks especially suited to these customers. The company is known for low average rates and superior customer service, but it also has discounts for cars stored on base and for those who are deployed.

**Why** **Allstate** **made our list:** Allstate stands out for its impressive selection of car insurance discounts. The company offers savings for new vehicles, paying in full, responsible payers, smart students, policy bundling and many others. Allstate also offers a usage-based insurance (UBI) program, called Drivewise, which can help you earn a lower premium if you demonstrate safe driving habits. It was rated one of the top insurers for UBI by J.D. Power, and received a great score for digital service in J.D. Power's [U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). Additionally, accident-free drivers can participate in Deductible Rewards to get up to $500 off their collision insurance deductible.

**Why** **Allstate** **may be the best for bundled policies:** For drivers who are interested in pooling all their insurance needs with a single company for ease of use, Allstate may be a strong contender. In addition to its other discounts, Allstate offers savings for those who purchase both their auto and their home, condo or renters insurance with the company. According to Allstate's website, customers who bundle auto insurance with home insurance can [save up to 25%](https://www.allstate.com/insurance-bundling) on their premium. Working with a single agent and one company can reduce both the amount of paperwork and management that your policies require.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Drivers who are looking for robust coverage options might want to consider Mercury Insurance. Although the company does not have local agents in Brownsville, drivers can find agents throughout the state. Drivers aged 16 to 25 could earn a discount for safe driving habits, and students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher could also earn savings. Mercury offers several optional coverage types, including mechanical protection, which provides nationwide 24-hour roadside assistance, rental vehicle assistance, road hazard tire protection and trip interruption coverage.

**Why Mercury may be the best for rideshare drivers:** If you drive for Uber, Lyft or another rideshare company, [Mercury offers coverage](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/insurance/auto/coverage/rideshare-insurance.html) that can augment the minimal coverage that rideshare providers have for their drivers. This coverage is available for an affordable rate—the company advertises that their rideshare insurance is available for as little as $0.90 a day.

If saving money is your top priority, our data indicates that there are several cheap Brownsville car insurance companies you may want to consider.

One way to find the [best cheap Texas car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-texas/) is to shop around and ask for quotes from a range of insurers to see which can give you the best rate.

## How much is car insurance in Brownsville, Texas?

The [average annual cost of car insurance in Texas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-texas/) is $786 for minimum coverage and $2,751 for full coverage. For comparison, the Brownsville averages are $789 for minimum and $2,762 for full coverage.

### Brownsville rates for teens

Teens typically pay above-average rates for their insurance. They may have less experience behind the wheel, and [statistically](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/), they are more likely than any other age group to engage in risky behaviors such as texting while driving or speeding. Because this means an increased risk for insurers, they usually compensate by charging more for teen drivers. The rates below are for teens who are included on their parents' policy—which tends to be cheaper than if they purchase a policy on their own. In the case of 16- and 17-year-olds, they may not be allowed legally to purchase their own policy.

## The cheapest car insurance in Brownsville by driving record

One of the factors that insurers pay attention to when assigning premiums is your driving record. If you have a clean driving record, it's likely that you will pay less for your policy than someone with multiple violations, all other factors being equal. Even a single speeding ticket or other moving violation may bump up the rate you pay for your policy, depending on your insurer.

### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Brownsville

The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) for Brownsville drivers with a single speeding ticket is higher than for those with no infractions on their record.

### Car insurance after an accident in Brownsville

Minimum coverage requirements in Brownsville

As is true in almost all states, Texas requires drivers to carry a minimum amount of [liability coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-car-insurance/) in order to drive legally on public roads. Texas law mandates that all drivers have at least:

* $30,000 bodily injury liability per person per accident
* $60,000 bodily injury liability total per accident
* $25,000 property damage liability per accident

Although these are minimum limits of your insurance, many insurance experts would recommend that you purchase higher levels of coverage. For example, considering that the average cost of a new car is [nearly $50,000](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/average-new-car-price-flirting-with-record/), minimum coverage may not be enough to cover your costs in the event of an accident where you total a newer model.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
