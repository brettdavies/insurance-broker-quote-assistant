**Why Geico may be the best for discounts:** The company offers standard discounts, such as savings for air bags, good students and multi-policy. In addition, it has generous discounts for military members who are deployed as well as members of more than 500 groups and associations.

**Why USAA made our list:** USAA consistently earns one of J.D. Power’s highest scores for customer satisfaction and [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), but is ineligible for official ranking because the insurer only offers car insurance to military members, veterans and their eligible family members. With USAA’s usage-based auto insurance program, [SafePilot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usaa-safepilot/), you could earn up to a 10 percent discount just for enrolling, plus up to 30 percent savings by maintaining safe driving habits. USAA members also enjoy numerous perks, such as discounts at select rental car agencies, ADT Home security monitoring discounts, shopping rewards and travel deals.
**Why USAA may be the best for military-focused coverage:** As an insurer with a primary focus on military professionals and their family, it's not unexpected that USAA would offer perks especially suited to these customers. The company is known for low average rates and superior customer service, but it also has discounts for cars stored on base and for those who are deployed.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Drivers who are looking for robust coverage options might want to consider Mercury Insurance. Although the company does not have local agents in Brownsville, drivers can find agents throughout the state. Drivers aged 16 to 25 could earn a discount for safe driving habits, and students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher could also earn savings. Mercury offers several optional coverage types, including mechanical protection, which provides nationwide 24-hour roadside assistance, rental vehicle assistance, road hazard tire protection and trip interruption coverage.
**Why Mercury may be the best for rideshare drivers:** If you drive for Uber, Lyft or another rideshare company, [Mercury offers coverage](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/insurance/auto/coverage/rideshare-insurance.html) that can augment the minimal coverage that rideshare providers have for their drivers. This coverage is available for an affordable rate—the company advertises that their rideshare insurance is available for as little as $0.90 a day.

## How much is car insurance in Brownsville, Texas?
The [average annual cost of car insurance in Texas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-texas/) is $786 for minimum coverage and $2,751 for full coverage. For comparison, the Brownsville averages are $789 for minimum and $2,762 for full coverage.
### Brownsville rates for teens
Teens typically pay above-average rates for their insurance. They may have less experience behind the wheel, and [statistically](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/), they are more likely than any other age group to engage in risky behaviors such as texting while driving or speeding. Because this means an increased risk for insurers, they usually compensate by charging more for teen drivers. The rates below are for teens who are included on their parents' policy—which tends to be cheaper than if they purchase a policy on their own. In the case of 16- and 17-year-olds, they may not be allowed legally to purchase their own policy.

## The cheapest car insurance in Brownsville by driving record
One of the factors that insurers pay attention to when assigning premiums is your driving record. If you have a clean driving record, it's likely that you will pay less for your policy than someone with multiple violations, all other factors being equal. Even a single speeding ticket or other moving violation may bump up the rate you pay for your policy, depending on your insurer.
### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Brownsville
The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) for Brownsville drivers with a single speeding ticket is higher than for those with no infractions on their record. Some insurers, however, may offer benefits including a discount if you take a [defensive driving course](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/defensive-driving-courses/) after your ticket, so this can be one way to mitigate the effects of an increase.

### Car insurance after an accident in Brownsville
An at-fault accident signals to insurers that you may engage in unsafe driving practices, and they are likely to respond by raising your rate. One exception may be for drivers who have purchased [accident forgiveness](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/accident-forgiveness/) coverage as part of their policy — this endorsement may, in some cases, mean you won't face an increase after a single accident.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Brownsville
A DUI is one of the most serious infractions you can have on your license in Brownsville, and you are likely to face civic fees and other penalties if you are convicted of one.

Minimum coverage requirements in Brownsville
As is true in almost all states, Texas requires drivers to carry a minimum amount of [liability coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-car-insurance/) in order to drive legally on public roads. Texas law mandates that all drivers have at least:
  * $30,000 bodily injury liability per person per accident
  * $60,000 bodily injury liability total per accident
  * $25,000 property damage liability per accident


Although these are minimum limits of your insurance, many insurance experts would recommend that you purchase higher levels of coverage. For example, considering that the average cost of a new car is [nearly $50,000](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/average-new-car-price-flirting-with-record/), minimum coverage may not be enough to cover your costs in the event of an accident where you total a newer model.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company?
Caret Down Icon
Choosing the [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) is based on your particular needs. For instance, you might need an insurer that offers car and home insurance so you can [bundle your insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) policies, or you may prefer a company that offers top notch service. When shopping for a policy at an affordable price, also take time to look for a carrier with good financial strength ratings and one that can provide all the coverage types you need.
  * ###  Is Texas a no-fault state?
Caret Down Icon
No, Texas is not a [no-fault state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/no-fault-coverage/). However, all Texas car insurance companies must offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage as well as personal injury protection (PIP) coverage as part of the [state’s minimum coverage car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/texas-car-insurance-laws/). You can choose not to carry these coverage types by sending a request in writing to your insurance company.
  * ###  Will my U.S. auto policy cover my vehicle if I drive into Mexico?
Caret Down Icon
No, your U.S. car insurance policy will likely not cover you in Mexico. However, your insurer might offer an endorsement to cover your automobile while in Mexico. You'll likely want to speak with your insurance agent before your trip to ensure you have the necessary coverage in place.
  * ######  Which company has the cheapest car insurance in Texas?
Caret Down Icon
The [cheapest car insurance company in Texas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-texas/), like any state, is different for everyone. Car insurance companies use multiple factors to determine your car insurance premium, and each company rates these factors differently. To find the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) for you, experts recommend that you request quotes from multiple companies for the same coverage types and limits.

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
