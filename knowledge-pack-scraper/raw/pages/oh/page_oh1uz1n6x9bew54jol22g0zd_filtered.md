New drivers are riskier to insure because they have less driving experience and are more likely to make dangerous mistakes behind the wheel.[[1]](#cite-1) Taking advantage of discounts is one of the easiest ways to lower your car insurance premium, especially for young drivers who often face higher rates.

Allstate’s [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount) rewards high-achieving students with savings on their auto insurance costs. It’s a great fit for high school and college drivers who maintain good grades and meet other requirements.

Below, we’ll break down how the discount works, how much you could save, how to qualify, and other ways students can [save money](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) with Allstate.

## **What Is the Allstate Student Discount?**

Many [insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) offer student discounts to help offset high premiums for [young drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers).

## **How Much Can You Save With the Allstate Student Discount?**

Allstate doesn’t disclose exact savings for its student discounts, and average savings can be hard to pin down due to limited customer reporting. How much you save will depend on factors like your [state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state), policy details, and any other discounts you qualify for. The best way to find out your potential savings is to speak directly with your Allstate agent.

That said, one Reddit user says they saved $897 on their Allstate policy after applying 10 discounts, including the smart student discount. Commenters stress the importance of speaking with an agent instead of buying online to understand how the insurer applies discounts.[[2]](#cite-2)

Yes. Allstate offers a discount for students who have good grades, attend college at least 100 miles from home, or complete a driver’s education course.

[COUNTRY Financial](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/country-financial) advertises savings of up to 35%, the largest student discount we found. Discount savings and availability vary by insurer, state, coverage options, and other discounts on your policy.

You can qualify for the Allstate student discount with a 2.7 GPA or better if you go to college 100 miles or more away from home or complete an online ADEPT Driver education course.

Students pay higher premiums because they lack driving experience, but they can get better car insurance rates if they’re safe drivers, have a clean driving record, or have good grades. Cost savings and availability vary, so it’s worth getting a [quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) from multiple companies to comparison shop for the best rates.
