* ### How we review auto insurance companies

  In our thorough Allstate auto insurance review, our editorial team considers the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength:** We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints:** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use:** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts:** We look at the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Where Allstate auto insurance stands out

**Coverage.** Allstate offers coverage types that some companies don’t, including rideshare insurance, gap insurance, and new car replacement coverage.

**Safe driving perks.** You’ll receive a credit to your policy for every six months you drive accident free if you enroll in Allstate’s Safe Driving Program. And for every year you go without an accident, you’ll get $100 off your collision deductible, up to $500.

## Where Allstate auto insurance falls short

**Customer satisfaction.** According to J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction studies, Allstate was rated below average for auto insurance shopping [1].

## Allstate auto insurance coverage

When you're shopping for car insurance coverage, it's important to understand what coverage you want and what you’re required to buy. For instance, most states require a minimum amount of car insurance to drive a vehicle. Alternatively, if you want extra protection, you may be interested in full coverage insurance. Read about the most common types of car insurance coverage to see how they work.

Allstate offers the usual auto coverage choices plus some optional features you can add (depending on your state) for an extra cost. These include:

* **Accident forgiveness.** Your rates won’t increase because of an accident, even if it’s your fault.
* **Safe driving bonus.** For every six months of accident-free driving with Allstate, you can receive money back.
* **Deductible rewards.** For each year with no driving violations, you earn $100 off your collision deductible, up to $500. Allstate takes the first $100 off when you sign up.
* **New car replacement.** If you total a new car within the first two model years, Allstate won’t just pay your car’s depreciated value, they’ll replace it with a new one.
* **Roadside assistance.** Customers can buy roadside assistance as a one-off cost during their time of need, add it to their auto policy or get an Allstate Roadside membership, a subscription service similar to AAA.
* **Rideshare insurance.** Known as Ride for Hire, this coverage is for people who drive for a ridesharing service such as Uber or Lyft. Usually, rideshare companies’ full coverage applies only while you’re carrying passengers, with limited coverage in between rides. But with Ride for Hire, you’re covered the whole time your app is on.
* **Gap insurance.** This coverage pays out when the amount you owe on your car loan or lease is greater than the value of your vehicle at the time it’s declared a total loss.

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) and full [ratings methodology for auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

**Average rates methodology**

NerdWallet averaged rates based on public filings obtained by pricing analytics company Quadrant Information Services. We examined rates for men and women for all ZIP codes in any of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.

In our analysis, “good drivers” had no moving violations on record; a “good driving” discount was included for this profile. Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are average rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider.

Sample drivers had the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability coverage per crash.
* $50,000 property damage liability coverage per crash.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per crash.
* Collision coverage with $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with $1,000 deductible.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good credit.”
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash costing $10,000 in property damage.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken-driving violation.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE in all cases and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven. We analyzed rates for drivers of the following ages: 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 and 70.

**Auto insurance survey methodology**

The opt-in survey of 7,503 U.S. adults ages 18 and older was conducted online by Russell Research on behalf of NerdWallet in June and July 2024. Respondents were asked to rate one auto insurance brand they obtained or renewed a policy within the past 12 months, with at least some changes to the original policy. These brands were rated on overall satisfaction, overall value, online experience, trustworthiness, mobile app experience, claims experience and customer support on a scale of 1-100.

Only brands with 100 or more qualifying respondents are reported. Of those respondents: 300 were State Farm customers, 300 were Progressive customers, 300 were Allstate customers, 300 were GEICO customers, 100 were USAA customers, 157 were AAA customers, 100 were Liberty Mutual customers, 100 were American Family customers, 100 were Farmers customers, 100 were Travelers customers and 101 were Nationwide customers.
