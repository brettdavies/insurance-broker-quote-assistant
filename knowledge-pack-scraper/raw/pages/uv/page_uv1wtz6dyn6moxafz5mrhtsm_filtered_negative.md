* Things To Consider When Replacing a Roof
![Roofing contractor fitting flashing on a roof.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/questions-to-consider-when-replacing-a-roof.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
A roof replacement can be an intimidating and costly [home repair](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/homeowners-insurance-maintenance-repairs) or improvement. There are many things to consider when getting a new roof, such as which material is right for your home, what questions to ask a roofing [contractor](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/protect-yourself-from-contractor-fraud) and what goes into a roofing agreement.
Evaluate roofing material options to help find the best match for your home's style. Asphalt, metal, wood or synthetic roofing materials tend to be adaptable to a variety of home styles. [Impact-resistant](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/impact-resistant-roofing-materials) roofing shingles and other roofing materials are designed to help resist hail, fire or flying debris damage and are usually available in a variety of styles. Shingles resembling wood or slate (made of plastic, cement, molded polymer, recycled resin or rubber) are generally available in multiple colors.
* **Metal** — typically last from 40 to 75 years and can be an attractive option because of the [minimal maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/roof-maintenance-for-your-home). Material choices include steel (galvanized, galvalume or weathering), aluminum, copper, zinc and tin. Color selections usually include basic green, blue, red and neutral.
**Material cost* per square****
_*Does not include price of installation
**A roofing square equals 100 square feet_
Depending on your household goals, you might consider using solar panels or solar shingles to help supplement some roofing materials. According to [homeguide.com](https://homeguide.com/costs/solar-roof-cost), the cost of solar materials ranges from about $1,000 to $2,500 per square. Solar panels or shingles have a lifespan of about 10-25 years depending on your weather conditions, panel type and maintenance capability. [Utilizing sustainable energy](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-be-environmentally-friendly-at-home-and-save-on-energy-bills) in your home may help [reduce your home’s carbon footprint](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/reduce-your-homes-carbon-footprint).
When you're shopping around for new shingles, remember to check how well they rate for fire, wind and [impact resistance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/impact-resistant-roofing-materials). Many roofing products are tested with standards created by [Underwriters Laboratories (UL)](https://www.ul.com/services/roofing-testing-and-certification-services) and [FM Global](https://www.fmglobal.com/research-and-resources/standards-and-certification) to evaluate how well they stand up to extreme conditions.
* **Wind** — if your area is prone to high winds or hurricanes, you may want to consider [shingles that are more likely to stay put during a storm](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/metal-roof-pros-and-cons). Shingles that have been evaluated according to ASTM D 7158 standard may be given a Class D (90 mph), G (120 mph) or H (150 mph) rating.
* **Gutter protection** — this should indicate that any damage to the [existing gutters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/stepbystep-guide-to-gutter-cleaning) during the roofing project will be repaired or replaced.
* **Weather precautions** — home protection measures during construction in case of weather conditions such as [rain and wind](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-stay-safe-during-a-severe-wind-event).
[Based on roofing materials used](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-stay-safe-during-a-severe-wind-event), homeowners may be able to obtain a discount on their home insurance premiums. To learn more, contact a [State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) today.
