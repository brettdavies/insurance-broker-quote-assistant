In Illinois, all drivers must carry an auto insurance policy that acts as financial protection in the event of a car accident. All policies must come with at least the state-mandated coverage limits, though some insurers allow you to raise those limits for further protection. The amount of [liability coverage you should get](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "Car Insurance - How Much Is It? How Much Do I Need?") depends on your assets and your own risk tolerance.
**[Bodily injury (BI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?"):** This coverage pays for the other party's medical bills, car repairs and lost wages following an accident you cause — up to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.
**[Property damage (PD)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "Property Damage Liability Car Insurance: What Is It? How Does It Work?"):** This coverage pays for any property damage you cause, up to $20,000 per accident.
**[Uninsured motorist bodily injury (UMBI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance"):** This coverage offers financial protection after you're hit by a driver who either doesn't have enough insurance or lacks coverage altogether. Your insurer will pay for your own medical bills and repair expenses, which the other driver should have covered, up to the same limits as your BI coverage.

**Collision and comprehensive coverage:** [Collision](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance") covers the repair costs for your car if it's damaged in a car accident. Comprehensive coverage pays for incidents that are not the result of a collision, such as vandalism, theft or damage from a natural disaster. Some insurers won't let you buy collision without also having comprehensive insurance. There is usually a [deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?"), or out-of-pocket amount you'd need to pay before these coverages kick in.
**[Medical payments](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medical-payments-car-insurance-coverage "What is Medical Payments Coverage? How Does it Work?"):** Also known as first-party benefits, this coverage will reimburse you for your own medical expenses from an accident, even if you are responsible for the crash. In other states, this coverage is also known as personal injury protection.
There is one other situation when you can use an alternative to auto insurance. If you're an uninsured driver and more than 50% responsible for an accident, then you'd need to get auto insurance and ask your insurer to [file an SR-22 form](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "/sr-22-auto-insurance") on your behalf. But, if you can't provide an SR-22 certificate from a licensed insurance provider, you may use one of these alternatives:
