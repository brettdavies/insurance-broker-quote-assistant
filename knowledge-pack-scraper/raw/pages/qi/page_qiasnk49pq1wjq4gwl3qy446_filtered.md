>  *(b) No policy or bond shall be effective under Section 16054 with respect to any vehicle which was not **registered in this state** or was a vehicle which was registered elsewhere than in this state at the effective date of the policy or bond or the most recent renewal thereof, unless the insurance company or surety company issuing the policy or bond is **admitted to do business in this state**, or if the company is not admitted to do business in this state, unless it executes a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action upon the policy or bond arising out of an accident mentioned in subdivision (a).*  
>  *(c) Any nonresident driver whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked based upon an action that requires proof of financial responsibility may, in lieu of providing a certificate of insurance from a company admitted to do business in California, provide a written certificate of proof of financial responsibility that is satisfactory to the department, covers the operation of a vehicle in this state, meets the liability requirements of this section, and is from a company that is admitted to do business in that person’s state of residence.*  
>  *(d) This section shall remain in effect only until **January 1, 2025**, and as of that date is repealed.*

## Legal Analysis

**California Vehicle Code 16056 VC** sets the minimum required car insurance coverage at:

* **$30,000** for bodily injury or death of one person in an accident;
* **$60,000** for bodily injury or death of two or more people in an accident; and
* **$15,000** for injury of or destruction to other people’s property in an accident.1

If your vehicle is registered in another state, you may still drive in **California** as long as it is insured by a company admitted to do business in California (which most reputable insurance companies are).

> ***Example**: Ned’s car is registered and insured in Nevada through State Farm. He is allowed to drive in California since State Farm can do business there as well.*

[Driving without insurance in California](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/vehicle-code/16028a/) is an [infraction](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/infractions/) carrying a **$900 fine**. A subsequent violation in three years carries about **$1,200** in fines.

The court will usually **dismiss** the case and impose only a $25 fee if you can show you had insurance at the time you were pulled over. Alternatively, prosecutors may be willing to **lower the fine** if you get insurance shortly after the incident.2
