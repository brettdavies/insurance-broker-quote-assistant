Expect higher rates since you may only have a year or two of driving experience. But it’s possible to [**find auto insurance coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) that will work for you.
Whether staying on your parents’ policy is the best choice depends on a few factors. Adding a [**young driver**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/under-25/) to the family policy will raise the premium — but whether you or your parents pay for your coverage — that increase will be cheaper than paying for a separate policy.

If you’re leaving the car at home and only driving it during school breaks, you’ll stay on your parents’ insurance. And you might qualify for a student-away-at-school discount.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-1) If you’re taking a car with you to campus, confirm with your insurer whether you can stay on your parents’ policy or need your own, as it can vary by state.
Though states have different liability limits, your policy’s coverage will adjust to meet any [**state-required limits**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/) higher than those of your home state.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-2) But if you move off campus and officially change your primary residence, you’ll need to get your own car insurance policy in that state.
Car insurance requirements for international students studying in the U.S. can vary significantly by state.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-3) Looking up the state’s department of motor vehicles and asking your school for resources could help you get answers fast.
In some states, your [**foreign driver’s license**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/international-drivers/) may be enough to secure auto insurance and drive a vehicle legally. In others, you’ll need to apply for an international driving permit (IDP) in your home country before you arrive in the U.S.
Some states also have time limits. In Texas, drivers with foreign licenses or IDPs can operate vehicles only for 90 days and must then apply for a Texas-issued license.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-4) In Indiana, international drivers need an IDP and can use it for up to one year.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-5)
If you plan to remain in the U.S., obtaining a U.S. driver’s license may be the best choice. You’ll need certain documents, which vary by state, to get a driver’s license. Many [**auto insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/) sell policies to international drivers, though you may see higher rates since you don’t have a U.S.-based driving history for insurers to review.

* **How we chose the best car insurance companies for college students**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Insurance companies set rates based on risk, and if you’re a brand-new driver, you’re more risky than an experienced driver. Crash rates are highest for [**16-year-olds**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/16-year-olds/) and teenagers in general but drop significantly once drivers hit their 20s, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Insurance rates reflect that risk, and teen drivers face the highest rates among age groups, according to Insurify data. If you maintain a [**good driving record**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/good-drivers/), your rates will go down as you gain more driving experience.

* **Drive a safe vehicle.** Insuring a safer vehicle is cheaper than insuring a more specialized, luxury, or classic car.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/college-students/#cite-6) The IIHS rates vehicle safety and publishes a list every year that you can reference.
* **Reduce your coverage.** If you’re driving an older car and paying more for insurance than it would cost to replace the car, buying just liability-only insurance instead of [**full coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) will help you save on premiums.
* **Bodily injury liability coverage:** [**Bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) pays for injuries to someone else in an accident you cause.
* **Collision coverage:** [**Collision insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) pays for damage to your car from a crash with another car or object, like a tree or telephone pole.
* **Comprehensive coverage:**[**Comprehensive insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) reimburses you for damage from vehicle theft, vandalism, fire, falling objects, earthquakes, floods, riots, and more.
* [**Personal injury protection (PIP)**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/)**:** This pays for injuries to you and your passengers, including medical and funeral expenses, rehabilitative therapies, and lost wages.
* [**Medical payments (MedPay)**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/medical-payments-coverage/)**:** This also pays for injuries to you and your passengers but just covers medical and funeral expenses.
* [**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/)**:** This reimburses you if a driver without enough liability coverage causes injuries or damage to you or your vehicle.
This usually includes 24/7 customer support to get you help when you have car trouble. [**Roadside assistance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/best-and-worst-roadside-assistance/) can help change a tire, jump a battery, or tow your vehicle to a mechanic.
If you finance or lease your car, and an accident totals it, [**gap insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/) pays the difference between what that vehicle is currently worth and what you owe on it.
This isn’t the same as [**pet insurance**](https://insurify.com/pet-insurance/) but will cover up to a certain amount of your pet’s vet bills if it’s injured in a car accident with you. Your insurer may include this in collision coverage.
