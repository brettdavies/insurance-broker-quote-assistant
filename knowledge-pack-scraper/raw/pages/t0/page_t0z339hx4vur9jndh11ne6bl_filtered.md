# California Raises Minimum Car Insurance Coverage: What This Means for Your Personal Injury Case

### New Minimums Take Effect January 1, 2025

On January 1, 2025, California’s minimum car insurance requirements doubled, marking the first significant change in decades. The Protect California Drivers Act increases the mandatory coverage from $15,000 per person / $30,000 per accident to $30,000 per person / $60,000 per accident.

This legislative update reflects the growing need to provide better compensation for car accident victims in a state where the cost of medical treatment and vehicle repairs has steadily increased.

The Law Offices of Ali Taheripour can help you understand how this change could impact your ability to pursue compensation—and we are here to help.

## Why Did California Raise the Minimum Insurance Requirements?

California joined many other states in updating its minimum insurance coverage to align with **modern economic realities**. The Protect California Drivers Act was designed to ensure that accident victims are better positioned to obtain adequate compensation for injuries caused by negligent drivers.

**Some Benefits of the Protect California Drivers Act**

* Helps victims recover fair compensation for pain and suffering
* Reflects current medical and repair costs
* Offers better legal protection for pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers

**Possible Downsides**

* **Higher premiums** for drivers across the board
* **Affordability concerns** for low-income individuals
* Risk of **more uninsured or underinsured drivers** on the road

**Are There Affordable Insurance Options?**

Yes. For those who cannot afford the higher coverage minimums, the **California Low-Cost Auto Insurance Plan (CLCA)** may help. This program is designed to provide access to essential coverage for qualifying low-income drivers.

Even if you are injured by a driver without adequate insurance, you may still have options. Visit our blogs below to learn more:
