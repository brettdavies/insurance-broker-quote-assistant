**Why Geico made our list:** For drivers in Memphis, Geico offers some of the lowest average prices for both full and minimum coverage, with a strong lineup of [discounts](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/) that could add extra savings for some drivers. In 2025, the company was given a [Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers, making it worth considering if you have marks on your license.

**Why Geico may be best for digital policy management:** For drivers who prefer to manage their car insurance from their phone, Geico’s suite of digital tools could be the ideal option. The company makes shopping for your policy online easy, earning it an above-average ranking in J.D. Power's [2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study) in the shopping category.

**Why Nationwide made our list:** Nationwide has an above-average score in both J.D. Power's 2024 [Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), as well as its [Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study) for the Southeast region. This suggests a company that pays attention to its policyholders and works to provide a good customer experience for them. The company has a robust list of coverage options, including some, such as accident forgiveness, that are not available at all carriers. Available perks include a vanishing deductible, that takes $100 off your deductible amount for every year of safe driving, up to $500.

**Why Nationwide may be best for discounts:** Nationwide's discounts can save you money on your premium. Along with common discounts such as multi-policy and accident-free, there are some that are less common. The [SmartMiles program](https://www.nationwide.com/personal/insurance/auto/discounts/smartmiles/), for example, is a pay-per-mile option that may be appealing to retirees and those who work from home and spend less time on the road.

**Why USAA made our list:** Affordable rates, reliable customer service and excellent financial strength ratings helped to earn USAA its high Bankrate Score and its place on the list of Memphis’s best auto insurers. USAA ranked higher for customer satisfaction than any other carrier in the Southeast region in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study and scored well above average in the 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study. However, only military drivers, veterans and their families are eligible for coverage.

**Why USAA may be best for military-focused coverage:** Not many auto insurers offer unique perks and discounts for military members, but a policy from USAA is designed specifically to meet the needs of service members and veterans. Storage discounts during deployment, along with additional rate reductions for vehicles garaged on a military installation, could add unique value for active service members.

**Why Travelers made our list:** In our analysis of average premium data, Travelers had some of the cheapest full coverage car insurance rates for Memphis drivers with clean records. A solid slate of discounts and a wide network of [Memphis-area agents](https://agent.travelers.com/tn/memphis) could make Travelers an ideal choice for many local drivers. However, it’s worth noting that Travelers received below-average customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power.

**Why Travelers may be best for customized coverage:** In addition to standard coverage options like liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, Travelers gives drivers the option to add various endorsements to their policies, including gap insurance and new car replacement. Adjusting coverage limits, deductibles and add-ons may be easier with Travelers than other carriers, making it a good option for drivers who know exactly what they want in a policy.

**Why Erie made our list:** Erie offers below-average rates for both full and state minimum coverage in Memphis. Erie also consistently scores well above the industry average for customer service and claims satisfaction, coming in third nationwide in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and fifth in the Southeast in the 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Why Erie may be best for bundled policies:** In addition to its strong Bankrate Score for auto insurance, Erie earned a 2025 Bankrate Score of 4.3 for its home insurance offerings, making it a potentially strong option for Memphis drivers who own a home and want to manage their auto and home policies in one place. Erie advertises discounts of 16 to 25 percent for customers who bundle home and auto insurance.

According to our average premium research, Geico, Travelers and USAA are the three [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-tennessee/) for drivers in Memphis seeking state minimum coverage.

## How much is car insurance in Memphis, Tennessee?

The average cost of car insurance in Memphis, Tennessee is $2,571 per year for full coverage and $677 per year for minimum coverage. For drivers who need full coverage, that’s roughly 28 percent more than the [Tennessee state average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-tennessee/) and 5 percent less than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). However, individual risk factors — including age and driving record — can impact what you pay for auto insurance coverage in Memphis.

### Memphis rates for teens

[Teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) in Memphis pay well above the citywide average. On average, an 18-year-old driver on their own policy pays $8,250 per year for full coverage and $2,441 per year for state minimum coverage. Teens who stay on their parents' policy after they turn 18 pay considerably less for insurance — as seen in the tables below — but their high risk of accidents and violations still makes coverage more expensive.

### Memphis rates for adults

Car insurance rates tend to stabilize in adulthood, making it easier to find affordable coverage in Memphis for drivers aged 30 to 50.

### Memphis rates for senior drivers

[Car insurance for seniors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-for-seniors/) typically comes at a lower cost, thanks to a lifetime of experience behind the wheel. However, rates may climb as you enter your mid-70s, since increased vulnerability to injury, vision problems and slower reaction times could raise your risk factors in the eyes of insurance companies.

## The cheapest car insurance in Memphis by driving record

Memphis’s high crime rates and treacherous traffic can result in high auto insurance premiums for [drivers with tickets](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-tickets/) or accidents on their driving record. Your driving history is one of the most significant [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) that insurers consider when setting your premium, but not every carrier treats each mark on your record the same — making rate comparison an essential step in shopping.

Minimum coverage requirements in Memphis

By law, all drivers in Memphis must carry at least the following limits on their auto insurance policy:

* $25,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $25,000 property damage liability per accident

In most cases, insurance professionals recommend carrying more than the minimum coverage required by [Tennessee insurance laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/tennessee-car-insurance-laws/). Higher liability limits typically only cost a few dollars more each month in exchange for greater protection against out-of-pocket expenses and potential lawsuits in the event of an accident that causes injuries or property damage. In addition, if you lease or finance your car, your lender likely requires you to maintain comprehensive and collision coverage on your policy.

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Scores

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
