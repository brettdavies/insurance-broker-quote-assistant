Progressive is so expensive because car insurance is expensive in general, due to rising costs for insurers. The price of a Progressive policy may also reflect the cost of staffing, marketing campaigns, and maintaining sales centers. But at $549 per year, the average Progressive car insurance policy is actually less expensive than coverage from most competitors. In fact, Progressive is one of the 10 cheapest insurers nationally, according to [WalletHub's analysis](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance).

Even though Progressive offers cheaper-than-average rates, its premiums can get expensive for drivers with certain characteristics. For example, teenagers pay an average of $1,780 per year for Progressive insurance, compared to $580 per year for older drivers. Additionally, drivers who recently had an at-fault accident pay an average of $1,103 per year for Progressive coverage, which is 101% more than drivers with a clean record.

## Factors That Can Make Progressive Insurance More Expensive

* Being a young or inexperienced driver
* Purchasing a [full coverage](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/full-coverage-car-insurance/10505) policy versus minimum coverage
* Causing an accident or being convicted of a moving violation
* Living in a high-risk ZIP code
* Driving an expensive vehicle
* Having a poor [credit-based insurance score](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/auto-insurance-score/39224)

If you're struggling to afford your Progressive insurance, there are ways for you to [lower your rate](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-to-lower-progressive-car-insurance-2140743460/). For example, you can take advantage of [Progressive discounts](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/progressive-discounts/90974) or reduce your coverage.

In some cases, it might be better to [switch insurers](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/how-to-switch-car-insurance-companies/13553) altogether. It's usually a good idea to compare quotes from at least three different insurers to see if you can find a better deal elsewhere. Each insurer uses its own algorithm to calculate premiums, so even if Progressive is charging you a high premium, you may be able to find a cheaper policy with another insurer.
