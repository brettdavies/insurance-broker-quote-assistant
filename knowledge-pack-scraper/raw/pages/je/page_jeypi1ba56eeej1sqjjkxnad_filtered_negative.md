Homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage, so you may need a separate flood insurance policy to protect your home or business from this costly natural disaster. This guide explains how flood insurance works, who needs it, how much it costs, and what you can do to mitigate your flood risk.

## **Key Takeaways**
* Flooding is one of the most severe natural disasters in the U.S., but home insurance doesn’t cover it, so you may want to buy a separate flood insurance policy to protect the [structure and contents](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance#types) of your home or small business.
* Flood insurance is offered by the federally backed National Flood Insurance Program in most communities, but you can get more flexible and comprehensive coverage from a private insurer.
* Even if you don’t live in a [high-risk flood zone](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance#who-needs-insurance) and are not required to get flood coverage, flood insurance is still a good idea, since destructive floods still occur in low- or moderate-risk areas.
## Flood Insurance Defined
A flood insurance policy covers repair and replacement costs for your home, small business, or personal belongings if they get damaged by a flood. Standard [homeowners insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance) typically does not cover flooding at all, but floods are the most frequent and expensive natural disaster in the United States, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). A mere inch of water in your house can cause as much as $25,000 or more in damage, [FEMA says](https://agents.floodsmart.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/2025-07/fema-nfip-just-one-inch-of-floodwater-flyer-06-2023.pdf).
To get coverage, you can buy a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is run by FEMA. Most flood insurance in the U.S. is provided through that federal program, but you can buy a policy from a private insurer for more robust coverage.
If you live in an area designated as a high-risk flood zone, your mortgage lender may require you to buy flood insurance as a condition of your home loan. However, flooding can cause unexpected and severe damage even outside of these high-risk areas, and with [climate change](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/climate-change-and-rates) worsening the risks across the U.S., you may want to buy flood insurance even if you’re not required to.
### **What types of flooding does flood insurance cover?**
The NFIP’s definition of a flood is an overflow of water onto normally dry land, which can be caused in many different ways. Here are some causes of flooding that flood insurance usually covers:
* Overflowing rivers or lakes
* Storm surge from the ocean
* Heavy or extensive rainfall
* Melting snow or ice
* Changes to the land, such as new construction or burned grass after a wildfire
* Water seeping through a dam, a levee, or a broken water main
To be eligible for coverage, the flooding must cover at least 2 acres or affect two adjacent properties at a minimum.
## Types of Flood Insurance
You can get flood insurance for the physical structure of your property or the personal belongings contained inside. These coverages are typically purchased separately from the NFIP and require separate deductibles. Here’s an overview of what each type of flood insurance covers, per the NFIP:
#### Building coverage
Building coverage applies to the physical structure of your house. It can cover:
* Foundation, walls, roof, and floors
* Plumbing and electrical systems
* Permanent features like cabinets
* Built-in appliances such as an oven or fridge
* Attached structures like a garage
#### Contents coverage
Contents coverage protects the belongings inside your home or business, such as:
* Clothing and furniture
* Electronics and sporting equipment
* Portable appliances like an AC unit
* Washer and dryer
* Some valuables (up to a specified limit)
## How Flood Insurance Works
You can get flood insurance for a residential or commercial property, either through the federally backed NFIP or a private flood insurer. However, be aware that not all communities are eligible for the NFIP; you can click on your state on the [FEMA Community Status Book webpage](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/work-with-nfip/community-status-book) to see if your town or city is listed as a community participating in the NFIP.
When a community is in the initial phase of joining the NFIP, that means FEMA has not identified and mapped flood hazard areas or has only preliminary mapping. Homes in that area are initially only eligible for the NFIP’s Emergency Program, which has more limited coverage than its Regular Program.
### **NFIP coverage limits**
For single-family homes, manufactured or mobile homes, residential condos, and two- to four-family buildings, the NFIP’s Regular Program offers a maximum of $250,000 for building coverage and $100,000 for contents coverage. For other types of residential buildings, the building coverage limit is increased to $500,000. Nonresidential buildings get up to $500,000 in both building and contents coverage.
In the Emergency Program, the limits are much lower. For one- to four-family homes, building coverage is capped at $35,000 and contents coverage at $10,000. For nonresidential properties, the limits are $100,000 for building and contents coverage.
### **Private flood insurance coverage limits**
Private flood insurance can vary widely by company, but you’ll have greater flexibility and more coverage – typically for a higher price – if you go with private insurance. Neptune Flood, for example, offers up to $7 million in building coverage and $500,000 in contents coverage for residential homes. Beyond Floods provides up to $1.5 million for your dwelling and up to 50% of the dwelling coverage limit to insure your personal belongings.
### **Filing a flood insurance claim**
Filing a flood insurance claim for damages to your home or belongings is similar to filing a property insurance claim. You should document all the damage with photos and an inventory of damaged items, and do your best to mitigate any further damage. A claims adjuster will assess the damage and issue a claim payment once your deductible has been applied. Read our [guide on homeowners insurance claims](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-to-file-a-homeowners-insurance-claim) to learn more about the general claims process.
## What Flood Insurance Does Not Cover
Not every cause of flooding is covered by flood insurance. While it generally covers flooding from natural sources, flood insurance likely won’t cover water damage caused by plumbing issues like clogged pipes. For that type of water damage to be covered, you typically need to add a water backup endorsement to your home insurance policy.
Storm-related water damage may fall under your homeowners insurance policy rather than flood insurance in some cases. If rainfall causes your roof to leak, flood insurance probably won’t cover that, but it will cover flash flooding caused by heavy rain. Earthquake damage is not covered, even if the earthquake was caused by a flood. Insurance also tends to exclude damage that could have been prevented, such as mold that grows because of your own negligence.
Regardless of the cause of flooding, some losses will never be protected by an NFIP flood insurance policy. These include:
* Most personal property in your basement
* Your car or most other self-propelled vehicles
* Any currency, precious metals, stock certificates, and other valuable papers
* Property outside of the insured building (e.g., landscaping, septic systems, and pools)
* Additional living costs if you have to temporarily relocate after a loss
* Financial losses caused by business interruption or loss of use
If you get flood insurance from a private company rather than the NFIP, your coverage may be more comprehensive and have fewer exclusions. Private flood insurers may provide more coverage for your basement and its contents, for example.
## Who Needs Flood Insurance?
To determine whether you need flood insurance, consider your house’s risk level. FEMA designates areas as low-, moderate-, and high-risk flood zones depending on the probability and potential impact of flooding. In certain cases, homes may be labeled coastal high-risk or undetermined risk.
If your house is located in a high-risk flood zone, you should get flood insurance to protect yourself. However, even homeowners with houses in low- or moderate-risk flood zones may want to consider buying flood insurance. After all, nearly one-third of NFIP flood insurance claims from 2014 to 2024 came from areas that were not deemed high-risk, and the average claim payment is $68,000, [per the NFIP](https://www.floodsmart.gov/get-flood-insurance).
### **What affects your risk of flooding?**
Whether your house is located in a flood zone is an important factor in determining whether you need flood insurance, but there are other considerations. Recent construction, fires, a breached dam, or oversaturated land can put your house at risk of flooding even outside of a designated flood area.
When the NFIP evaluates the flood risk level of your property, the location and building characteristics are taken into consideration. Here are some of those factors that can affect your risk of flooding and the cost of your insurance:
* Frequency and types of flooding in your area
* Proximity to bodies of water like the ocean, rivers, or lakes
* Local weather
* The elevation of your building and its foundation
* The number of floors
* The material of your walls
* Whether the structure has flood vents
**How to determine your flood risk**
You can check your ZIP code with the [NFIP’s flood risk tool](https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-zones-and-maps/what-is-my-flood-risk) to see the general risk level of your community. There are also tools available to assess the risk level of your specific address, such as [First Street](https://firststreet.org/) and [ClimateCheck](https://climatecheck.com/).
## How To Buy Flood Insurance
If you already have homeowners insurance, contact your provider to find out if they offer flood insurance through the NFIP or a private flood insurance company. The NFIP has a Write Your Own program that allows home insurers to issue federal flood insurance policies under their own names. However, not all home insurance companies participate in this program, and the participants vary by state. If your current home insurance provider does not write NFIP policies, you can use the [program’s search tool](https://www.floodsmart.gov/get-insured/flood-insurance-provider) to find the participating insurers in your area.
You’ll get the same quoted rate for an NFIP policy regardless of the company issuing it. If your community does not participate in the NFIP or you want more comprehensive coverage than the NFIP offers, shop around for private flood insurance to find the best coverage and cost for your needs.
Keep in mind that there is usually a waiting period before your policy kicks in, so don’t delay until the last minute to try to secure flood coverage.

## The Cost of Flood Insurance
The cost of a flood insurance policy depends on many factors, starting with the type of coverage. If you only have contents coverage, your policy will be much less expensive than a policy with building coverage or both coverage types. Annual rates for flood insurance cost around $895 on average, according to [Neptune Flood](https://neptuneflood.com/blog/how-much-does-flood-insurance-cost/), a private flood insurance provider.
NFIP flood insurance premiums are on the rise, as a new pricing structure is gradually being rolled out to more accurately reflect risk level. This is because many policyholders pay lower rates that don’t account for their true risk. Based on what single-family homes were paying in August 2023, the median cost of an NFIP flood insurance policy across all states and territories was $786 per year, according to [data from FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/work-with-nfip/risk-rating/single-family-home). If those same homes were paying the full cost based on their true risk, however, the median cost would be $1,290 per year.
### **Rising flood insurance premiums**
Charley Todd, founder of the independent agency [Charley Insurance](https://www.heycharley.com/) in Florida, points to two main reasons for flood insurance rate hikes: the changing climate and FEMA’s risk classification method.
“First, weather patterns have shifted, leading FEMA to reclassify more areas as higher-risk,” he says. “Second, FEMA’s new Risk Rating 2.0 system now prices policies based on each home’s actual flood risk, factors like elevation, proximity to water, and replacement cost, rather than just the broad flood-zone map. In addition, the federal government is gradually phasing out subsidies that once kept rates artificially low.”
Those factors are contributing to the rising costs of flood insurance. “Many homeowners are seeing rate increases as flood models and pricing catch up to the true cost of risk,” Todd says. “While the changes can be frustrating, they’re intended to make the National Flood Insurance Program more accurate and financially sustainable in the long term.”
### **Discounts for flood insurance**
You may qualify for flood insurance discounts from the NFIP if your house has certain features or you live in a community with approved floodplain management practices that participates in the [Community Rating System](https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management/community-rating-system). The NFIP also offers [flood mitigation discounts](https://www.floodsmart.gov/get-insured/discounts) to encourage homeowners to take steps to reduce their flood risk. In some cases, getting a [FEMA flood elevation certificate](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-a-fema-flood-elevation-certificate) may help you qualify for a discount.
## Mitigating Your Flood Risk
To make your home less susceptible to flooding – and potentially get discounts on your flood insurance – you can take certain measures to mitigate your risk:
* Install flood openings or vents in a crawl space or basement to relieve the pressure on your house’s foundation.
* Elevate building systems, such as your heating, air conditioning, and other utilities, either by building platforms or moving them to a higher floor.
* Consider green infrastructure and landscaping techniques such as rain gardens or permeable pavements, which can help water absorb into the ground instead of getting into your home.
* Invest in a sump pump and a water alarm in your basement.
* Keep gutters, downspouts, and storm drains clean and free of debris.
* Fix cracks and gaps in your home’s foundation.
## FAQ
If you buy flood insurance from the NFIP, there is usually a 30-day waiting period before your policy activates. However, that waiting period may be eliminated if you get flood insurance while making, extending, or renewing your mortgage, or if you change your flood coverage while renewing your policy, according to the [NFIP](https://agents.floodsmart.gov/topics/flood-insurance-101). In certain cases, the waiting period may only be one day, such as if your home is in a newly designated high-risk flood zone or if a wildfire on federal land causes a flood that affects your home.
If you get coverage from a private insurer, the waiting period may differ. Beyond Floods has a waiting period of seven days in most states, while Neptune Flood’s is typically 10 days.
If you want to be covered for flood damage, you need to have flood insurance. Home insurance has limited coverage for some types of sudden, accidental [water damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage), but it usually does not cover flooding at all. Some homeowners insurance companies offer optional flood coverage that you can add to your home insurance policy, in which case you would not need to buy a separate flood insurance policy.
Like home insurance, renters insurance does not cover flooding. As a renter, you may want flood insurance to protect your personal belongings in case they’re damaged or lost if your rental unit floods.
That depends on whether you are getting federal coverage through the NFIP or are interested in flood insurance unwritten by a private insurer. Private flood insurance rates can vary, so it’s a good idea to shop around. However, if you’re getting an NFIP policy, you don’t need to shop around for quotes. The rates for NFIP insurance will be the same regardless of whether you get a quote directly from the NFIP or from a private company that writes NFIP policies, assuming you give the same information to each provider.
FEMA may provide some federal disaster assistance – such as funds and other services – after a presidential disaster declaration. However, not all floods receive that designation. And even if a flood that affects your house is declared a presidential disaster, your house may not be included in the designated area for assistance. Additionally, if you receive FEMA assistance once, you may be required to purchase flood insurance to be eligible for future assistance.
Disaster assistance can help you get started with the recovery process after a flood destroys your home, but it is intended to meet your basic needs, not necessarily to replace what you lost. Flood insurance is designed to give you the ability to fully rebuild.
