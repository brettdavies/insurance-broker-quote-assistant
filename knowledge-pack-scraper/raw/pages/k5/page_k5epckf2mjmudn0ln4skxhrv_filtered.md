Founded in 1907, [Amica Insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/amica/) is the oldest mutual auto insurer in the United States. It underwrites its own auto insurance products under Amica Mutual Insurance Company. Amica offers all the standard car insurance coverage types and a selection of optional coverage types. This combination of company longevity and solid product offerings is supported by Amica’s top-notch customer service, as proven by its high scores across several rating systems.

[Progressive Insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/progressive/), founded in 1937, is the second-largest auto insurance company. The national carrier has several underwriting companies for auto insurance, depending on where you live and what rating class you fall into. On top of generally affordable rates, one feature that Progressive stands out for is its Name Your Price Tool, which allows potential customers to set a budget to determine the type of coverage options available within their price range.

Our verdict

Amica generally offers higher average rates than Progressive but is recognized for its superior customer and claims satisfaction ratings from J.D. Power, setting a high standard in service quality. Progressive, on the other hand, might be a good pick for those who prioritize advanced digital tools for policy management. Amica tied for the [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall and won Best for Customer Experience. Progressive did not earn a Bankrate Award this year.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
