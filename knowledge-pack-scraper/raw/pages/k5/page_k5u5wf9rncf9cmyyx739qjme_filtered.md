Choosing the right car insurance company for your coverage needs can feel overwhelming, especially when you’ve narrowed down your choice to two well-known insurers.

Unlike [**State Farm**](/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/) car insurance, [**American Family**](/car-insurance/companies/american-family/) isn’t available nationwide.

State Farm offers nationwide coverage and has a long history of trusted services but may fare lower in customer satisfaction rankings.

To make an informed decision about which car insurance company is the better choice for you, you should compare rates, customer service, claims satisfaction, discounts, and coverage options.

## American Family vs. State Farm: The verdict

State Farm Insurance is the better pick overall based on its high Insurify Quality (IQ) Score of 9.3 out of 5, but American Family also has a high IQ Score of 9.3.

American Family’s KnowYourDrive program allows drivers to pay auto insurance rates that correspond with their safe driving habits and driving frequency.

State Farm’s [**Drive Safe & Save**](/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) program allows safe drivers to save up to 30% on their car insurance policy based on driving behaviors and activity. The Drive Safe & Save program uses an app, but State Farm also sends a beacon to install in the car that helps provide more accurate readings.[[3]](#cite-3)

Both programs consider braking, turning, acceleration, distracted driving, and speeding when setting discounts.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

No. American Family and State Farm are separate auto insurance companies. Both insurers offer quality auto coverage, though American Family only sells coverage in 20 states and State Farm has nationwide coverage. State Farm has a higher IQ Score (9.3) than American Family (9.3), making it the better choice for car insurance.

Based on market share, State Farm is the largest insurer in the United States. State Farm private passenger customers make up 16.84% of the market. American Family is the ninth-largest insurer, with customers making up 2.11% of the market.

No. The company sets car insurance rates based on your driving record, age, credit history, gender, marital status, ZIP code, and chosen auto insurance products. State Farm agents can’t change rates, although some customers may qualify for discounts or lower rates based on their driving record.

State Farm has cheaper coverage and a higher IQ Score than Progressive. State Farm also has a higher average customer satisfaction rating from J.D. Power and a better financial strength rating from AM Best.

The national average cost of State Farm car insurance is $56 per month for liability coverage and $109 for full coverage. On average, Progressive charges $101 per month for liability coverage and $173 for full-coverage insurance.
