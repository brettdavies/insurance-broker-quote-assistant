**Why Geico made our list:** Geico might be a reliable option for North Carolina drivers who want a national insurer that offers several discounts and has a low number of customer complaints. What Geico lacks in coverage options, it makes up for with its generous discounts. Drivers with infractions on their records may qualify for discounts like paperless billing, vehicle equipment discounts or membership discounts. Geico also has a highly rated mobile app, which can make it easy to manage your account from anywhere.

**Why Geico may be best for high-risk drivers:** As the [2025 Bankrate Awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) winner for Best Auto Insurance Company for High-Risk Drivers, Geico consistently offers some of the lowest rates to drivers with less-than-perfect driving records. Unlike some auto insurance companies that don’t offer SR-22 services, Geico will file the certificates on your behalf and can work with high-risk drivers to find affordable coverage.

**Why State Farm made our list**: State Farm might appeal to drivers in Durham because its premiums are extremely affordable and the company offers excellent discount opportunities, including two safe driver discount programs. In Bankrate’s 2025 analysis of auto insurance carriers, State Farm received a high Bankrate Score of 4.3 out of 5.0 for its robust coverage offerings and myriad discount opportunities, plus its solid financial strength and customer satisfaction per third-party ratings and rankings.

**Why State Farm may be best for discounts:** Young drivers, in particular, may benefit from discounts from State Farm. Drivers under 25 could save by enrolling in the [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) program. Given that drivers typically pay higher rates under the age of 25, this could translate to meaningful savings. Drivers over 25 could also save up to 30 percent by enrolling in the [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) program.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
