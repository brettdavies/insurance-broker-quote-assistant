Specimen forms are available upon request. If the customer wishes to see the actual forms that will be part of the policy, those forms will be provided.

Higher liability limits may be available. Please let us know if you would like a quote for increased limits. The limits noted on the proposal are not the only limits available.

**Exclusions and Limitations**

Virtually every insurance policy has exclusions, and many have limitations of some type.  This disclaimer notified the customer that not everything is covered. If you wish to discuss any exclusions (gaps) in coverages, we can talk about those concerns prior to binding coverage.

The rates quoted for these benefits may be subject to change based on final enrollment and/or final underwriting requirements.

Any policy written by a surplus lines insurer are not subject to the filing approval requirements of the State Department of Banking and Insurance, in the state in which the customer desires coverage. Such a policy my contain conditions, limitations, exclusions and different terms than a policy issued by an insurer granted a Certificate of Authority by the State Department of Banking and Insurance in the state in which the customer desires coverage. The insurer has been approved as an eligible surplus lines insurer, but the policy is not covered by the specific state Insurance Guaranty Fund.
