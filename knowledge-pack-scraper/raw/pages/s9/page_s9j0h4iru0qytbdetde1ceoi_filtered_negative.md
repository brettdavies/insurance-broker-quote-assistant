![A young couple sitting on a burgundy couch review their auto insurance policy on their laptop.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/how-to-read-auto-insurance-quotes.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Getting an [auto insurance quote](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) is an important first step toward exploring protection options for yourself and your vehicle. Think of an insurance quote as a detailed price estimate tailored to your needs using information you provide, including your selected coverage types, limits and deductibles. While it’s not the final bill, it’s a snapshot of your potential coverage and costs.

Or learn more about [car insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) from State Farm
Car insurance quotes generally consist of [several types of coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options). Each serves a specific purpose, and some are required by law, while others are optional. Here’s a breakdown of the most common coverage types:
[Liability](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage)
[Comprehensive](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage)
Helps protect your car from non-collision damage, such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters or [hitting an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car). A deductible may apply.
[Collision](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage)
Personal Injury Protection (PIP)/[Medical Payments Coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/medical-payments-coverage) (MPC)
Underinsured Motorist](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/uninsured-and-underinsured-coverage)
Examples include [roadside assistance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage), [car rental and travel expenses](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage) and [gap coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-gap-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) (usually offered through your auto loan provider and not your insurance company), which covers the difference between your [car loan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-loan-basics-you-need-to-know) and your [car’s actual value](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/replacement-cost-vs-market-value) if totaled.
Higher deductibles typically lower your premium but require you to pay more when you file a claim. Lower deductibles raise the premium but reduce your out-of-pocket costs in case of an accident. [Choose your deductible](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) based on what you can afford as an unexpected expense.
The [price of car insurance quotes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-affects-car-insurance-premiums) can vary significantly based on several factors. Some of these factors are within your control, while others are not. Insurance companies evaluate quotes based on personal, vehicle-specific, policy-related and external factors.
* **Personal factors** — age, gender, location, driving history and [credit-based insurance score](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/what-is-a-good-credit-score).
* **Vehicle-specific factors** — [make, model, age of vehicle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/vehicle-insurance-ratings), safety features and cost to repair.
* **Policy choices** — coverage levels, deductibles and discounts — such as [bundling home and auto policies](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/bundle-insurance), [safe driving discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) or [student discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/steer-clear) — can help lower your quote.
You can get an [auto insurance quote](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto "Auto Insurance Quote") now, or [give us a few details](https://www.statefarm.com/lead/contact?event=SimpleInsights-auto "Contact Agent for a Quote") and a State Farm® agent will reach out to you.
