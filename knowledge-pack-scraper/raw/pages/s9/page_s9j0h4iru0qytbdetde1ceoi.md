# How to read auto insurance quotes
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Explore how liability, comprehensive coverage, deductibles and other coverage choices can affect your auto insurance quote and overall costs. 
Getting an [auto insurance quote](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) is an important first step toward exploring protection options for yourself and your vehicle. Think of an insurance quote as a detailed price estimate tailored to your needs using information you provide, including your selected coverage types, limits and deductibles. While it’s not the final bill, it’s a snapshot of your potential coverage and costs.
Understanding your auto insurance quote thoroughly before making a purchase may help you make more informed decisions. By learning how this estimate is structured, you’ll be more equipped to compare options and choose coverage that aligns with your needs and budget.

## Understanding coverage types
Car insurance quotes generally consist of [several types of coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options). Each serves a specific purpose, and some are required by law, while others are optional. Here’s a breakdown of the most common coverage types:
Coverage type
What it covers
Requirement
[Liability](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage)
Consists of two parts — bodily injury liability and property damage liability. Pays for injuries or property damage you cause others.
Most states require both types of coverage, but some states may only require property damage liability.
[Comprehensive](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage)
Helps protect your car from non-collision damage, such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters or [hitting an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car). A deductible may apply.
Optional, unless financing your vehicle (required by lender).
[Collision](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage)
Pays for covered damage to your vehicle resulting from a collision or overturning, regardless of who is at fault. A deductible may apply.
Optional, unless financing your vehicle (required by lender).
Personal Injury Protection (PIP)/[Medical Payments Coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/medical-payments-coverage) (MPC)
Covers medical bills resulting from accident-related injuries for you and your passengers after an accident, regardless of fault.
PIP is mandatory in some states; MPC is typically optional.
[Uninsured/  
Underinsured Motorist](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/uninsured-and-underinsured-coverage)  

May help protect you if you’re in an accident caused by a driver with insufficient or no insurance.
May be required in some states.
Optional Coverages
Examples include [roadside assistance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage), [car rental and travel expenses](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/car-rental-and-travel-expenses-coverage) and [gap coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-is-gap-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) (usually offered through your auto loan provider and not your insurance company), which covers the difference between your [car loan](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-loan-basics-you-need-to-know) and your [car’s actual value](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/replacement-cost-vs-market-value) if totaled.
Optional.
## How to understand auto insurance quotes
Understanding coverage types is the foundation for reading and comparing auto insurance quotes. Knowing what each one covers may help you make informed decisions about your policy.
### Liability coverage
If your policy includes liability coverage, the limit specifies the maximum amount your insurer may pay for damages in a covered accident. You’ll often see this written as three numbers, such as $25,000/$50,000/$25,000. These numbers mean:
  * $25,000 for injury to one person in an accident
  * $50,000 for total injuries in one accident
  * $25,000 for property damage per accident


Each state has a minimum required liability limit you must carry, but opting for higher limits could offer more financial protection.
### Coverage limits
Beyond liability, some coverage types (like Medical Payments Coverage or Car Rental and Travel Expenses) may have their own limits, which represents the maximum your insurer may pay. Selecting higher coverage limits can help increase your financial safety but also raises your premium. However, coverages like Comprehensive and Collision typically do not have policy limits. Instead, they reimburse you up to the actual cash value (ACV) of your vehicle, minus your deductible.
### Deductibles
Deductibles apply to collision, comprehensive and other coverages. They represent the amount you agree to pay out-of-pocket before your insurance kicks in. For example, if your deductible is $500 and you have a repair bill for $2,000, you’ll pay the first $500 and your insurer pays the remaining $1,500.
Higher deductibles typically lower your premium but require you to pay more when you file a claim. Lower deductibles raise the premium but reduce your out-of-pocket costs in case of an accident. [Choose your deductible](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) based on what you can afford as an unexpected expense.
### Estimated premium
This is likely the number you’re most interested in. The premium is the cost of your insurance policy. Auto insurance premiums are typically offered as a monthly, six-month or annual price in a quote. This figure will vary widely depending on your insurance choices and risk factors.
## Factors that affect your auto insurance quote
The [price of car insurance quotes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-affects-car-insurance-premiums) can vary significantly based on several factors. Some of these factors are within your control, while others are not. Insurance companies evaluate quotes based on personal, vehicle-specific, policy-related and external factors.
  * **Personal factors** — age, gender, location, driving history and [credit-based insurance score](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/what-is-a-good-credit-score).
  * **Vehicle-specific factors** — [make, model, age of vehicle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/vehicle-insurance-ratings), safety features and cost to repair.
  * **Policy choices** — coverage levels, deductibles and discounts — such as [bundling home and auto policies](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/bundle-insurance), [safe driving discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/drive-safe-save) or [student discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts/steer-clear) — can help lower your quote.
  * **External factors** — state regulations and industry trends.


By understanding what affects your premium, you can make decisions to help optimize your cost without sacrificing coverage.
## Tips when reviewing an auto insurance quote
Navigating car insurance quotes doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Here are some tips to help make the process easier:
  * **Know your minimum requirements.** Check your state’s minimum requirements so you know what coverage is mandatory.
  * **Evaluate your personal needs.** Do you drive a newer car? Consider collision and comprehensive coverage. Do you transport passengers? Maybe PIP or MPC should be a priority.
  * **Examine policy terms carefully.** Pay attention to liability limits, coverage limits and deductibles to ensure you’re comfortable with the policy’s details.
  * **Ask about discounts.** Check with your agent about potential discounts you may qualify for to help reduce your premium.


## Comparing car insurance quotes
The key to making a smart insurance decision is comparing quotes from multiple providers. Ensure each quote you review reflects the same coverage levels, deductibles and limits so you can compare costs fairly.
Ensure your quote is easy to understand and fits what’s important to you — whether that’s premium cost, higher coverage limits or strong protection options.
Your car insurance quote is more than just a number. It provides a snapshot of the coverage, limits and costs that can help protect you on the road. By taking the time to understand auto insurance terms and evaluate your needs, you can confidently choose a policy that fits both your budget and your lifestyle.
