Introduced by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, California’s [Sustainable Insurance Strategy](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/180-climate-change/Sustainable-Insurance-Strategy.cfm) has the potential to be the most significant insurance reform since Proposition 103 was passed in 1988. Each element of this strategy has the potential, over time, to play a vital role in reviving the insurance marketplace. We will continue to work constructively with the CDI, the Governor's Office and policymakers.
In the meantime, we’re still here for you, serving almost 7.9 million policies and accounts every day.

**The California insurance market is facing a coverage crisis, leaving many residents without the protection they need for their homes and businesses. It’s crucial to address this situation so residents are properly covered and prepared for any risks they may face.**

The FAIR Plan’s growth is unsustainable. (See [California FAIR Plan’s Key Statistics and Data](https://www.cfpnet.com/key-statistics-data/).) Reforms are needed to help guide the FAIR Plan back toward its intended mission as the insurer of last resort.
