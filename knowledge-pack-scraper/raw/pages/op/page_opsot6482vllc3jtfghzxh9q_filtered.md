## About Progressive renters insurance

Progressive renters insurance policies come either from an affiliate called Progressive Home or from Homesite, a third-party company. If you need a renters policy for your home or apartment and you already have car insurance with Progressive, it’s worth checking renters rates to see if Progressive’s multipolicy discount can save you money.

* ### Why doesn’t this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  We make every effort to rate each company we review. However, we’re sometimes unable to provide a NerdWallet star rating for insurers that work with multiple third parties to underwrite their policies. That’s because the quality of the policy you get may vary depending on the coverage options, financial strength and other factors of each separate underwriting company.
* ### Why you can trust NerdWallet

  Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) that ensure fairness and accuracy in order to help you choose the financial products that work best for you. Here is a list of [our partners](https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/our-partners) and [here’s how we make money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/advertiser-disclosure).

## Where Progressive stands out

**Single deductible.** Having to pay only one deductible for a claim affecting both your belongings and your car is a nice perk, available to some policyholders.

**Discount for bundling.** Getting a discount for bundling renters and auto insurance could save you money and make for convenient payments, too.

## Where Progressive falls short

**Third-party policies.** Having some policies that don’t come directly from Progressive could cause confusion over where to file a claim or how to manage your policy.

## Progressive renters insurance coverage

Progressive has an in-house insurance agency known as Progressive Advantage Agency. It sells policies from its own affiliated carrier, known as Progressive Home, and from a third-party company called Homesite.

Regardless of which company you’re insured with, your Progressive renters insurance policy will typically include the following standard types of coverage:

* [Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance) for your belongings.
* [Liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/renters-liability-insurance) for lawsuits and legal expenses.
* [Medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners) in case someone gets injured on your property.
* Coverage for [temporary living expenses](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage) if you have to move out while your home is repaired after a covered loss.

You can also add these two types of optional coverage to your policy:

* Coverage for [water damage from the backup of sewer or sump pump systems](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage).
* Personal injury coverage in case someone sues you for slander or libel.

## Discounts

Discounts vary depending on where you live and which company insures you. You may be able to save by:

* Bundling multiple policies with Progressive.
* Getting a quote at least three days before your policy takes effect.
* Paying your premium in full, upfront.
* Receiving policy documents by email.
* Living in a gated community or having a security guard in your complex.

If you get your renters policy through Progressive Home, you could also be eligible for a single [deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/insurance-deductible) for both auto and renters insurance. (A deductible is the amount of a claim you’re responsible for.) You’ll pay only one deductible if you need to file claims for the same incident on both your auto and renters policies. Say someone breaks your car window and steals a few personal items. If you had a $500 deductible on both your auto and renters policies, you’d pay it only once.

## Consumer experience

**Website:** At Progressive.com, you can get an online quote for renters insurance or for a [renters/auto insurance bundle](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-auto-renters-insurance-bundles). You can also find answers to common renters insurance questions and get information about your policy. However, if you’re looking to file a renters claim, you must work directly with your insurer.

**App:** Although Progressive has a mobile app for auto and other types of insurance, you can’t use it to manage your renters policy.

**Claims:** If you call Progressive to file a renters claim, it will direct you to the company that administers your policy for processing. Alternatively, you can simply call the insurer listed in your policy documents to file a claim.

**Customer service:** Progressive offers 24/7 customer service by phone at 888-671-4405. You can also use the company’s “contact us” page to send an email or use the Flo chatbot.
