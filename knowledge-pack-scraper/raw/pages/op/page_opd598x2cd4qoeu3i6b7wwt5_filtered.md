**Bankrate’s take:**
Broadly, car insurance rates are a calculation of risk: if you pose a higher risk of filing a claim with your insurance provider, it is likely your insurer will charge you more for your policy. That is why men typically pay more for car insurance than women: [statistics](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females) show that men are more likely to drive dangerously and engage in risky practices, which in turn could lead to an expensive claim.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in Oregon

Car insurance rates vary for young drivers on their own policy compared to drivers on their parents’ policy. The average cost of car insurance in Oregon will likely be cheaper for younger drivers if they choose to remain on their parents’ policy instead of purchasing their own.

Safe drivers typically pay lower car insurance rates due to their lower likelihood of filing claims. Any violations on your record, like an at-fault accident or a speeding ticket conviction, may cause a rate increase. In the table below, you can see how much insurance premiums increase on average after a single speeding ticket conviction, at-fault accident or DUI.

## How to save on car insurance in Oregon

Car insurance rates in Oregon are not overly expensive, on average, but there are ways you may be able to save even more money and earn a lower premium. Here are some suggestions for getting [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/):

* **Get several quotes:** To find the best rate for your coverage preferences, you may want to request multiple car insurance quotes from different carriers. This way, you can evaluate coverage options and pricing to find the right carrier.
* **Improve your credit score:** If you have a [poor credit score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/), you may pay a higher car insurance premium. Raising your credit score, even by a few points, can help you get a lower rate.
* **Pay your premium in ful**l: Paying your premium upfront and in full may help you get a cheaper rate, if you can afford the out-of-pocket cost.
* **Take a defensive driver course:** Many insurance companies offer a discount to drivers who complete an approved defensive driver or driver safety course.
* **Raise your deductibles:** Increasing your [comprehensive and collision deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) can lower your premium. Just make sure you can afford a higher deductible if you need to file a claim.
* **Switch carriers:** If you find a different insurance company that can offer you a better deal, you can usually [switch carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/switching-carriers/) during your policy period. You’ll want to check if your current insurer has any fees associated with policy cancellation.
