**State Farm also offers an excellent discount for bundling policies, along with some of the[cheapest home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheapest-homeowners-insurance-companies "Cheap Home Insurance") in the country.** That makes it a great choice for drivers looking to bundle their home and auto insurance policies.
In addition to a large [bundling discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"), State Farm offers lots of ways for drivers with an SR-22 to save on insurance. You can get a discount for completing a defensive driving course or installing an anti-theft device in your car.
**State Farm also has a safe driving program called[Drive Safe & Save](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save-insurance-review "State Farm Drive Safe & Save Review").** This program tracks your driving behaviors and rewards good habits with a discount of up to 30%.

Country Financial offers enough coverage for most drivers. **But it has fewer add-ons than other companies.** For example, you can't get [gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance: How Does it Work and Do I Need it?") if you have a loan or lease on your car.
In addition, Country Financial is only available in  19 states, so not everyone can get a policy.

Nonstandard insurance companies like [The General](https://www.valuepenguin.com/the-general-insurance-review "Review of The General Car Insurance") and SafeAuto specialize in offering coverage to high-risk drivers. This includes people who need an SR-22. If you can't get a policy from a typical insurance company, nonstandard companies are one option to consider.
**[Compare quotes from multiple companies:](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online")** There's a  difference of $151 per month between the most and least expensive SR-22 insurance companies for full coverage.
* * *
**[Qualify for discounts:](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts")** The largest discount you can typically get is a [multi-policy discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#policy "Policy car insurance discounts"), which can lower your car insurance bill by 5% to 25%. Some discounts are easy to get and can add up if you can take advantage of more than one. These include paperless billing, early shopping and automatic payment discounts.
If you're committed to improving your driving habits, you could consider signing up for a [usage-based safe driving program.](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") These programs use your phone or a plug-in device to track your driving behavior. If you get a good score, you could save up to 40%, depending on your chosen company.
* * *
**[Get rid of coverage you don't need:](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?")** For example, if you own your car outright and it's over eight years old or worth less than $5,000, it may not be worth it to have comprehensive and collision coverage. Together, these coverages can cost around  $75 per month
* * *
* * *
**An SR-22 will have less of an effect on your insurance if[the cause was minor](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-risk-auto-insurance "Best Cheap Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers").** For example, drivers with a speeding ticket pay around $279 per month for full coverage SR-22 insurance. People with a DUI conviction pay $373 per month for the same coverage.

While it's rare, you might not be able to find coverage at all after certain violations. [Most states offer high-risk plans](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-risk-auto-insurance#assigned "How to get car insurance if you've been denied coverage") if you need help finding SR-22 car insurance. You can typically get these plans through a local insurance agent.
* You have a [DUI](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-dui-affect-your-auto-insurance-rates "How Does a DUI Affect Your Auto Insurance Rates?") or DWI conviction
If you don't own a vehicle, you can buy non-owner SR-22 insurance. [Non-owner car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-car-insurance-who-should-have-it "Non Owner Car Insurance: What Is It and Who Should Have It?") covers drivers who don't own a vehicle, so you have insurance coverage even when renting or borrowing a car.

Florida and Virginia have the FR-44, also known as the SR-44, for drivers with a DUI conviction. It's essentially the same as the SR-22. But you must have twice as much coverage as the [state minimum requirement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?").
The average cost of SR-22 insurance is $172 per month for a full-coverage policy. However, drivers with [traffic tickets on their record can expect to pay more](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance#cost "#cost").
Yes, just like standard auto insurance, SR-22 insurance will cover you in any car you drive. However, if you don't own a car, you have to get [non-owner SR-22 insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-sr22-car-insurance "Cost of Non-owner SR-22 Insurance"). This covers you in any car you drive. But it gets more complicated regarding whose insurance pays for what if you need to make a claim.
Yes, [Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive Insurance Review") offers SR-22 insurance. The average cost of SR-22 insurance from Progressive is $192 per month for a full coverage policy. That's $20 per month higher than the average cost of SR-22 insurance.
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance#state-farm "#state-farm") typically offers SR-22 insurance. It's often a great choice because It's the cheapest national company for SR-22 insurance and also offers excellent customer service.
