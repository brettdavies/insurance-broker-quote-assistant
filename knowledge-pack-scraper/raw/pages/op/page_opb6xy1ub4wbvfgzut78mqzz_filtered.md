What is SR-22 insurance?

An SR-22 form proves you have the minimum amount of auto insurance your state requires. You only need an SR-22 if your state or a court orders you to get one. This typically happens after a serious driving violation like a DUI or driving without insurance.

Depending on why you need an SR-22, your state may also suspend your driver's license. In that case, you'll need an insurance company to file an SR-22 before you can get your license back.

Why these top picks?

To find the best cheap SR-22 car insurance, ValuePenguin collected quotes from 13 auto insurance companies across 
10 states.
Quotes are for a full-coverage policy with higher liability limits than required in each state and comprehensive and collision coverage.

Our editors chose the best companies based on cost, customer service reviews, coverage options and availability.

Find Insurers

When setting your insurance rates, companies consider how likely you are to cause an accident or make a claim. Because you typically need to get an SR-22 after a major driving offense, companies believe you're more likely to cause an accident in the future. For that reason, you'll likely see higher rates after an SR-22.

\*USAA is only available to military members, veterans and their families.

Not every car insurance company offers SR-22 insurance. Having to get SR-22 shows you're a risky driver. So, your company may cancel your coverage or increase your rates if you need an SR-22.

If your company drops you, you'll need to find a new company to file the SR-22.

### Nonstandard SR-22 insurance companies

Nonstandard insurance companies like [The General](/the-general-insurance-review "Review of The General Car Insurance") and SafeAuto specialize in offering coverage to high-risk drivers. This includes people who need an SR-22. If you can't get a policy from a typical insurance company, nonstandard companies are one option to consider.

**It's worth trying to get a quote from a standard company, even if it takes extra effort to find one that will cover you.**

Nonstandard insurance companies typically have fewer coverage options or discounts than major companies. And their customer service is often poor, so getting your car fixed after a crash may be difficult.

## How to find cheap SR-22 insurance

To find cheap SR-22 car insurance quotes, you should shop for rates from multiple companies, look for discounts and drop unnecessary coverage.

![compare icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90//icons/compare)

**[Compare quotes from multiple companies:](/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online")** There's a 
difference of $151 per month
between the most and least expensive SR-22 insurance companies for full coverage.

In addition, every insurance company considers different factors when determining your car insurance rate. So, the cheapest company for you may differ from your family, friends or neighbors.

![wallet icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_90/static//icons/wallet)

**[Qualify for discounts:](/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts")** The largest discount you can typically get is a [multi-policy discount](/car-insurance-discounts#policy "Policy car insurance discounts"), which can lower your car insurance bill by 5% to 25%. Some discounts are easy to get and can add up if you can take advantage of more than one. These include paperless billing, early shopping and automatic payment discounts.

If you're committed to improving your driving habits, you could consider signing up for a [usage-based safe driving program.](/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies") These programs use your phone or a plug-in device to track your driving behavior. If you get a good score, you could save up to 40%, depending on your chosen company.

Together, these coverages can cost around 
$75 per month

Another option is to get rid of medical payment coverage if you have a low-deductible healthcare plan. Or you could remove rental car reimbursement if you have another vehicle you could use after an accident.

### How to get SR-22 insurance

It's essential to request an SR-22 from your insurance company quickly once you find out you need one. That's because the court or state usually sets a deadline for filing the form. The state may suspend your license if you don't meet the deadline.

1. **Contact your company or switch insurance companies.** Drivers typically find out they need an SR-22 form during a court hearing. If the judge orders you to file an SR-22 form, you must contact your insurance company or find a new one that offers SR-22 insurance.
2. **Pay the filing fee.** Your insurance company usually charges you a fee for filing the SR-22. This typically ranges between $15 and $50.
3. **Your insurance company files the SR-22.** Your company will need to file this document for you with your state's Department of Motor Vehicles.
4. **Get confirmation.** Once your insurance company files the SR-22, the DMV may take up to two weeks to process the request. The department may process electronic forms more quickly than ones sent through the mail.

## How much does an SR-22 cost?

If you need an SR-22 certificate, you must pay your insurance company a fee of around $15 to $50 to file a document with the state.

This fee differs by company and state. Your rates will usually go up as well.

**An SR-22 will have less of an effect on your insurance if [the cause was minor](/high-risk-auto-insurance "Best Cheap Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers").** For example, drivers with a speeding ticket pay around $279 per month for full coverage SR-22 insurance. People with a DUI conviction pay $373 per month for the same coverage.

**Some states require proof of future coverage. That means you'll need to pay your bill in full instead of making monthly payments.**

While it's rare, you might not be able to find coverage at all after certain violations. [Most states offer high-risk plans](/high-risk-auto-insurance#assigned "How to get car insurance if you've been denied coverage") if you need help finding SR-22 car insurance. You can typically get these plans through a local insurance agent.

### SR-22 insurance filing fee

The cost of filing an SR-22 depends on the state where you live. It often costs about $25 but can range from $15 to $50. Your auto insurance company files the SR-22 for you and then includes the cost in your bill.

You may need an SR-22 for several years, but the filing cost is a one-time fee.

You won't have to pay each time you renew your car insurance. However, if your auto insurance policy lapses, you'll have to pay the fee again when you get new coverage. Your new insurance company must send proof of coverage to your state.

## What is SR-22 insurance?

An SR-22 is a document your car insurance company files that shows you have enough car insurance.

SR-22 insurance isn't an actual policy. However, the policy you get after the insurance company files your SR-22 is sometimes called "SR-22 insurance."

States require proof that you have liability insurance. This is because liability coverage pays for any injuries or property damage you cause while driving. Minimum SR-22 insurance typically won't pay for your injuries or damage to your car.

**You only need SR-22 insurance if the state believes you're a high-risk driver.**

This can happen if:

* You have a [DUI](/how-does-dui-affect-your-auto-insurance-rates "How Does a DUI Affect Your Auto Insurance Rates?") or DWI conviction
* You cause an accident while driving without auto insurance
* You have multiple traffic offenses, or you have too many traffic offenses in a short period
* You drive with a revoked or restricted license

Your state may suspend your driver's license if it believes you're a high-risk driver. Either your state DMV or a court will require you to get an SR-22. Once the insurance company files the document, you can get your license back and start driving again.

### Nonowner SR-22 insurance

If you don't own a vehicle, you can buy non-owner SR-22 insurance. [Non-owner car insurance](/non-owner-car-insurance-who-should-have-it "Non Owner Car Insurance: What Is It and Who Should Have It?") covers drivers who don't own a vehicle, so you have insurance coverage even when renting or borrowing a car.

If you already have non-owner car insurance, contact your insurance company and ask it to file an SR-22 on your behalf. This will let you reinstate your license.

Non-owner car insurance is only available through some insurance companies. You may need help finding coverage, particularly with tickets or accidents on your driving record.

---

## How long do you need SR-22 insurance?

You typically must have an SR-22 certificate of financial responsibility for three years.

However, the time frame can range from two to five years, depending on your state and why you need an SR-22. The SR-22 is valid as long as your car insurance policy is active.

**If you cancel the policy or it lapses, your insurance company must notify the state.** The state will suspend your license, and this time frame won't count toward the required filing period.

For example, if you must have the SR-22 for three years but cancel your insurance after one year, the state will suspend your license. Once you reinstate your insurance and license, the clock starts again, and you'll need to have the SR-22 on file for another two years.

You usually need to have SR-22 insurance for a set period. But the court or state may extend your filing period if you get another ticket. Your insurance company may raise your rates again because it sees you as a riskier driver.

Once you no longer need an SR-22 form, your auto insurance company files an SR-26 form. It can do this automatically through an electronic filing.

---

## Other types of SR-22 insurance

Depending on your state and traffic violation, you may have to file a different document showing financial responsibility.

SR-21 insurance

An SR-21 is similar to an SR-22 in that it's a document your insurance company files that shows you have enough coverage. The state may require an SR-21 after you cause an accident that results in injuries or damage costing more than $1,000, or death.

SR-22A insurance

Missouri, Georgia and Texas require an SR-22A when drivers repeatedly violate financial responsibility laws. This form requires drivers to have a policy paid in full for at least six months.

FR-44 insurance

Florida and Virginia have the FR-44, also known as the SR-44, for drivers with a DUI conviction. It's essentially the same as the SR-22. But you must have twice as much coverage as the [state minimum requirement](/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?").

SR-50 insurance

Only Indiana uses the SR-50 filing. It provides proof of coverage and allows you to reinstate your license if it's suspended.
