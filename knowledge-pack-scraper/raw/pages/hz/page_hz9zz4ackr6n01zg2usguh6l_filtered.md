## USAA vs. State Farm: rates for high-risk drivers

If your driving record an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA is likely a better choice than State Farm. Every car insurance company will handle driving offenses differently, so don't be afraid to shop around and [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) to find out which insurance company suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: USAA VS. STATE FARM

| **Citation** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,304 | $2,849 |

| Speeding ticket | $1,124 | $1,983 |

## USAA vs. State Farm: rates by age

Insurance companies use age to help estimate the level of risk that a driver poses. Policies are then priced accordingly. Auto insurance policies are typically most expensive for teen drivers — because of their inexperience — and are often much more affordable for drivers aged 25 or older. Because every insurance company rates ages differently, it's best to shop around and find the right policy for your needs.

In general, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA over State Farm: USAA offers average yearly savings of nearly $3,000 when compared to State Farm.

##### RATES BY AGE: STATE FARM VS. USAA

| **Age bracket** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $2,864 | $5,820 |
| **20s** | $1,261 | $2,379 |
| **30s** | $963 | $1,585 |
| **40s** | $957 | $1,587 |
| **50s** | $889 | $1,558 |
| **60s** | $845 | $1,485 |

Affordability aside, USAA and State Farm each carry pros and cons, including their discount programs, add-ons, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and compare rates before purchasing a policy.

## Telematics options: USAA vs. State Farm

USAA and State Farm offer policyholders [telematics options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/). These apps can measure your driving habits to calculate the level of risk and provide a more accurate rate. We compiled a rundown of available options from both carriers below to help you find which company might have a telematics option that's right for you.

![USAA logo]()

USAA SafePilot

SafePilot offers customers the chance to have their driving habits monitored in exchange for cheaper car insurance rates. A discount of 10% is offered just for signing up, with up to 30% savings possible for safe drivers at policy renewal.

![State Farm logo]()

State Farm Drive Safe & Save

Drive Safe & Save is the telematics option available from State Farm. This can be a great option for drivers with safe driving habits. [Low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/) also stand to benefit from the program. The company claims that it can save customers up to 50% on premiums, though lower-mileage drivers are most likely to see these types of savings. The program is available in most states.

### Zebra Tip: Explore telematics if you're a safe driver

---

Both USAA's SafePilot program and State Farm Drive Safe & Save get good reviews overall, including in the [best online experience](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-apps-websites/) section of The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey.

State Farm provides robust policy types and plenty of [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a solid option for both standard homeowners and those with unique coverage needs. That said, State Farm's average premiums are typically higher than average. Customers looking for a wide selection of homeowners discounts may also want to search elsewhere, as State Farm currently has only four discount options at present.

Still, State Farm's home insurance options receive good scores from most rating agencies and the company took fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Learn more about the company's home insurance in our review below.

The average rates for State Farm are slightly cheaper at $113 per month.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
