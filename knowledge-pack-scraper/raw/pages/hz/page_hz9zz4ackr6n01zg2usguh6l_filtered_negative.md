USAA and State Farm offer policyholders [telematics options](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/). These apps can measure your driving habits to calculate the level of risk and provide a more accurate rate. We compiled a rundown of available options from both carriers below to help you find which company might have a telematics option that's right for you.
Drive Safe & Save is the telematics option available from State Farm. This can be a great option for drivers with safe driving habits. [Low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/) also stand to benefit from the program. The company claims that it can save customers up to 50% on premiums, though lower-mileage drivers are most likely to see these types of savings. The program is available in most states.
* * *
Both USAA's SafePilot program and State Farm Drive Safe & Save get good reviews overall, including in the [best online experience](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-apps-websites/) section of The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. If you are a safe driver, either of these programs could potentially help you save money.
* * *
A [roadside assistance program](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) can help you get back on the road sooner and with less hassle. Have a look below to see how USAA and State Farm compare for roadside assistance options.
* * *
As with their auto insurance offerings, USAA and State Farm are both popular providers of [home insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/). Again, USAA homeowners insurance is limited to members of the armed forces and certain family members. To help you compare how the two companies stack up, we've compiled take information from a number of sources to aid in your decision.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-vs-state-farm/)
State Farm provides robust policy types and plenty of [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a solid option for both standard homeowners and those with unique coverage needs. That said, State Farm's average premiums are typically higher than average. Customers looking for a wide selection of homeowners discounts may also want to search elsewhere, as State Farm currently has only four discount options at present.
Still, State Farm's home insurance options receive good scores from most rating agencies and the company took fifth place overall in The Zebra Customer Satisfaction Survey. Learn more about the company's home insurance in our review below.

Furthermore, your individual rates could vary dramatically from the average depending on a number of factors. This can include your previous [claims history](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/guide/when-to-file-homeowners-insurance-claim/), crime in your area as well as how close you live to a [fire station](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-cover-fire-damage/). Because of this, we suggest that you shop around when looking for home insurance quotes.
State Farm is cheaper than USAA on average, with average rates of **$113 per month** compared to USAA's average of**$127 per month**.
