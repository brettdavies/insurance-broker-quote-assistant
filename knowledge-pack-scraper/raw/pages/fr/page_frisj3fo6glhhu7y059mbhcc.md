# How roof types affect homeowners insurance
The age, material, and shape of your home's roof may have a significant impact on your rate for homeowners insurance. If your roof is newer and made of durable materials, like metal or slate, your homeowners policy may cost less than if you have an older roof — which may be more susceptible to damage and a risk for homeowners insurance companies. In some cases, your insurer may inspect your roof before issuing a policy.

Key takeaways

## Roof factors that may impact your cost for homeowners insurance
Material, age, and shape are the key factors that may influence your homeowners insurance cost and insurability. Your insurer may closely inspect or ask questions about your roof's materials and condition before offering a policy to help determine your rate. 
### How does the material of your roof influence your policy's rate?
Insurance companies often factor your roof's type of material into their rebuild cost estimates, which, in turn, can impact your rate. While expensive to replace, roofs made of slate, tile, concrete shingles, or metal offer the best protection compared to wood. Here's how insurers may view these popular roofing materials:
  1. Metal roof
Metal roofs are most often made from zinc, copper, or steel alloy pieces or tiles and can last anywhere from 40 to 70 years. Their fire-resistant qualities, longevity, and durability make metal roofs appealing to insurance companies.
  2. Slate/tile roof
Insurance providers may consider slate to be reliable because it's resistant to fire, rot, and insects and requires little maintenance. Tile tends to crack more easily, but it provides quality insulation and won't rot or burn.
  3. Asphalt shingle roof
While this is the most common roof type because of affordability and life span, it decays more easily than metal or slate. However, impact-resistant shingles, specifically Class 4 asphalt shingles, are designed to withstand [hail](https://www.progressive.com/answers/hail-damage-home-insurance/) and high winds. With a reduced risk of weather-related claims, homeowners with impact-resistant shingles may help decrease their cost for homeowners insurance.
  4. Wood roof
Comprised of shingles or shakes, wood roofs aren't fire-resistant. Some insurance companies won't cover a wooden roof or may require you to apply a fire-retardant protectant in order to get coverage.


### How does roof age affect your cost for homeowners insurance?
An older roof may have unexpected issues such as [water damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-water-damage/) that can cause deterioration and increase the need for replacement. If your roof reaches a certain age, some insurance companies will deny coverage, [require an inspection](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-inspection/) before offering a policy, or only cover the actual cash value or a certain percentage of your older roof instead of the full replacement cost.
**Example:** The actual cash value of your seven-year-old roof is $4,000. A roof replacement costs $12,000 in your area. If your roof is damaged in a covered claim and needs to be replaced, your insurer may pay up to $12,000 for a new roof if your policy covers you at full replacement cost. If your policy covers you at actual cash value, your insurer may pay you up to $4,000.
### How does roof shape impact your homeowners insurance rate?
Your roof's shape may affect what you pay for your homeowners policy. These roof shapes may be the most favorable to insurers:
  * **Hip** : Usually has four sides and costs more to build, but its resistance to wind may help bring down your rate
  * **Saltbox** : This roof design can resist wind and offer effective water shedding, potentially lowering your rate
  * **Gable** : With two sloping sides creating a triangular shape, gable roofs can be cost-effective for homeowners in areas less affected by high winds


Insurers may decline to cover certain roof shapes while some are more vulnerable to damage, which could increase the likelihood of a claim and cause you to pay more for homeowners insurance, such as:
  * **Flat** : With less effective drainage compared to sloped roofs, as well as a shorter lifespan, flat roofs have an increased risk for [leaks](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-roof-leaks/) and water damage, which can negatively impact your rate
  * **Gambrel** : A two-sided roof design makes gambrel roofs a target for wind damage and higher homeowners insurance premiums
  * **Mansard** : A complex design may make repairs to mansard roofs costly, negatively impacting your policy's rate


## How does homeowners insurance cover your roof?
[Dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling-coverage/) under your homeowners policy may pay to repair or replace your home's roof, up to your coverage limit and minus any deductible, due to damage from a [covered peril](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/). If the roof of your unattached garage, shed, gazebo or other structure on your property is damaged in a covered incident, your policy's [other structures coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/other-structures-coverage/) may pay for repairs or a full replacement, up to the limits of your coverage and minus your deductible. Whether payment is made at [replacement cost or actual cash value](https://www.progressive.com/answers/replacement-cost-vs-actual-cash-value/) depends on your policy. Your insurer may also issue payment for a certain percentage amount, dictated by your policy.

### Does a new roof affect insurance?
