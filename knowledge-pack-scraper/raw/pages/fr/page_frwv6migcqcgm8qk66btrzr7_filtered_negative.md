**States require drivers to have certain[kinds of coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance") at different coverage amounts.** Most commonly, you'll need coverage that pays for the medical costs of the other driver and their passengers if you cause an accident, called bodily injury liability insurance. You'll also probably need coverage for damage to another person's car, home or other belongings if you cause an accident, called property damage liability.
State |  BI |  PD |  UIM
---|---|---|---
* * **Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah:** Require that you buy personal injury protection (PIP) coverage.
* ** **Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania:** Maine and New Hampshire require "[medical payments coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medical-payments-car-insurance-coverage "What Is Medical Payments Coverage?")," while Pennsylvania requires "medical benefits coverage." Both work like PIP.
* *** **Michigan:** State requires $1 million of property protection insurance (PPI), which acts like PIP but for property damage instead of bodily injury.
Insurance companies won't let you buy less insurance than the minimum coverage required in your state. So you don't need to worry about going below these limits when you're getting [car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free Car Insurance Quotes Online").
* **[Bodily injury liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?")** covers hospital bills and other injury-related costs for other people after an accident you caused. It may also pay for legal fees if you get sued.
* **[Property damage liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?")** pays to repair or replace the other driver's car or other  belongings if you cause an accident.
* **[Uninsured and underinsured motorist](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** covers injuries to yourself and your passengers plus damage to your car if you get into an accident and the other driver doesn't have insurance or their coverage limits don't cover the full cost of your bills.
* **[Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?")** covers injuries to yourself and your passengers after an accident.
In [New Hampshire](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-hampshire "Best Cheap Car Insurance New Hampshire"), you only need to show you can pay for damage after a car accident. The state doesn't list a specific amount you need in savings, but the minimum insurance you can buy in New Hampshire is $25,000 of bodily injury liability per person, $50,000 of bodily injury liability per accident and $25,000 of property damage liability, often written as 25/50/25 coverage.
You may have to get insurance if you have a [DUI](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-dui-affect-your-auto-insurance-rates "How Does a DUI Affect Car Insurance Rates?") or an [accident](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "How Does an Accident Affect My Car Insurance Rates?") on your record.
[Full coverage car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") adds extra types of coverage to a minimum car insurance policy, including protection for your own car, called [comprehensive and collision](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"), and sometimes extras like roadside assistance.
Plus, a full coverage policy may also include [personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?") and [underinsured and uninsured](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") coverage, which aren't required in every state.
**It makes sense to only have[minimum auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/cheap-liability-only-car-insurance "Cheap Liability-Only Car Insurance") if you can easily afford to pay to replace your car and pay for medical bills for yourself and any passengers in your car using your savings.** Otherwise, you may struggle to cover expensive repairs if you get into an accident and you can't rely on the other driver's insurance.
**You should also consider raising your insurance limits beyond your state's minimum requirements.** That's because you're responsible for any costs beyond your insurance limits, and most state minimums would fall short if you got into a serious accident. For example, most states only require that you have $25,000 of [property damage liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?"). If you got into an accident with a luxury car, you might have to pay $50,000 or more.
If you want more coverage than the maximum limits allowed by your car insurance policy, consider getting an [umbrella policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/should-you-get-personal-umbrella-policy-you-car-insurance-policy "Should You Get an Umbrella Policy With Car Insurance?"). Umbrella policies offer extra liability protection with coverage limits typically starting at $1 million and going up to $5 million.
Minimum coverage car insurance requirements differ [by state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#state "Coverage requirements by state"), but they typically cover injuries and property damage you cause to other people after a crash. Some states also require that you get other types of coverage like [personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?") (PIP) and [uninsured and underinsured motorist](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance") coverage.
It's better to get [full coverage car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") unless your car costs less than $5,000 or is more than 10 years old. A minimum coverage policy typically only pays for injuries and damage that you cause to other people, while a full coverage policy also may cover damage to yourself, your passengers and your car.
[New Hampshire](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/new-hampshire/requirements "Auto Insurance Requirements in New Hampshire") is the only state that doesn't require drivers to have car insurance. In some areas, you can self-insure, but you have to deposit a large sum of money with your state government to do so.
