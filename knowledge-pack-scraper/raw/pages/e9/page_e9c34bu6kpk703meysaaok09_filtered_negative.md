Both insurers offer [telematics](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/)-powered policies. The companies' offerings are similar, offering initial savings with the opportunity for a higher discount with good driving practices. Also worth noting is Allstate's pay-per-mile program, Milewise, which works in a similar fashion but is intended for [low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/). See more information about each company's [mobile app](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-apps-websites/) below.
Allstate's [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/) program, Milewise, could benefit low-mileage drivers. Mileage is tracked using a plug-in device. Allstate plans to expand Milewise to additional locations.
* * *
Allstate's combination of pay-per-mile and telematics-powered insurance policies — along with its wider availability — makes it a better option for most drivers. If you're a low-mileage driver, you'll definitely want to look into Allstate's options.
