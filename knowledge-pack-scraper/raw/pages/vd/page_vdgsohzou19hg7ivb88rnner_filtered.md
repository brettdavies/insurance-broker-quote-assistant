Political philosophy and reform movement

**Progressivism in the United States** is a [left-leaning](/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum "Left–right political spectrum") [political philosophy](/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy") and reform movement. Into the 21st century, it advocates policies that are generally considered [social democratic](/wiki/Social_democratic "Social democratic") and part of the [American Left](/wiki/American_Left "American Left"). It has also expressed itself within [center-right](/wiki/Centre-right_politics "Centre-right politics") politics, such as [New Nationalism](/wiki/New_Nationalism_(Theodore_Roosevelt) "New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)") and [progressive conservatism](/wiki/Progressive_conservatism "Progressive conservatism"). It reached its height early in the 20th century. [Middle](/wiki/American_middle_class "American middle class")/[working class](/wiki/American_working_class "American working class") and [reformist](/wiki/Reformist "Reformist") in nature, it arose as a response to the vast changes brought by [modernization](/wiki/Modernization "Modernization"), such as the growth of large corporations, [pollution](/wiki/Pollution_in_the_United_States "Pollution in the United States"), and [corruption](/wiki/Corruption_in_the_United_States "Corruption in the United States") in American politics. Historian [Alonzo Hamby](/wiki/Alonzo_Hamby "Alonzo Hamby") describes American progressivism as a "political movement that addresses ideas, impulses, and issues stemming from modernization of American society. Emerging at the end of the nineteenth century, it established much of the tone of American politics throughout the first half of the century."[[1]](#cite_note-1)

Progressive economic policies incorporate the socioeconomic principles and views of social democracy and [political progressivism](/wiki/Political_progressivism "Political progressivism"). These views are often rooted in the concept of [social justice](/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") and have the goal of improving the human condition through [government regulation](/wiki/Government_regulation "Government regulation"), [social protections](/wiki/Social_protection "Social protection"), and the maintenance of [public goods](/wiki/Public_good_(economics) "Public good (economics)").[[2]](#cite_note-2) It is based on the idea that [capitalist](/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") markets left to operate with limited government regulation are inherently unfair, favoring [big business](/wiki/Big_business "Big business"), large [corporations](/wiki/Corporations "Corporations"), and the [wealthy](/wiki/Wealthy "Wealthy"). Specific economic policies that are considered progressive include [progressive taxes](/wiki/Progressive_tax "Progressive tax"), [income redistribution](/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States "Income inequality in the United States") aimed at reducing [inequalities of wealth](/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States "Wealth inequality in the United States"), a comprehensive package of [public services](/wiki/Public_services "Public services"), [universal health care](/wiki/Healthcare_reform_debate_in_the_United_States "Healthcare reform debate in the United States"), resisting [involuntary unemployment](/wiki/Involuntary_unemployment "Involuntary unemployment"), [public education](/wiki/Public_education "Public education"), [social security](/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) "Social Security (United States)"), [minimum wage](/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States "Minimum wage in the United States") laws, [antitrust laws](/wiki/Antitrust_laws "Antitrust laws"), legislation protecting [labor rights](/wiki/Labor_rights "Labor rights"), and the rights of [labor unions](/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States "Labor unions in the United States"). While the modern progressive movement may be characterized as largely secular in nature, the historical progressive movement was by comparison to a significant extent rooted in and energized by religion.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

## Progressive Era

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Progressive Era")]

Main article: [Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era "Progressive Era")

Historians debate the exact contours, but they generally date the [Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era "Progressive Era") in response to the excesses of the [Gilded Age](/wiki/Gilded_Age "Gilded Age") from the 1890s to either [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") in 1917 or the onset of the [Great Depression in the United States](/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States "Great Depression in the United States") in 1929.[[4]](#cite_note-Nugent1-4) Many of the core principles of the progressive movement focused on the need for efficiency in all areas of society, and for greater democratic control over public policy. Purification to eliminate waste and corruption was a powerful element as well as the progressives' support of worker compensation, improved child labor laws, minimum wage legislation, a limited workweek, graduated income tax and allowing women the right to vote.[[4]](#cite_note-Nugent1-4) [Arthur S. Link](/wiki/Arthur_S._Link "Arthur S. Link") and Vincent P. De Santis argue that the majority of progressives wanted to purify politics.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) For some Progressives, purification meant taking the vote away from blacks in the South.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Large corporations and monopolies: trust busting vs. regulation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Large corporations and monopolies: trust busting vs. regulation")]

*[The Bosses of the Senate](/wiki/The_Bosses_of_the_Senate "The Bosses of the Senate")*, a cartoon by [Joseph Keppler](/wiki/Joseph_Ferdinand_Keppler "Joseph Ferdinand Keppler") depicting corporate interests—from [steel](/wiki/Iron_and_steel_industry_in_the_United_States "Iron and steel industry in the United States"), copper, [oil](/wiki/Petroleum_in_the_United_States "Petroleum in the United States"), iron, [sugar](/wiki/Sugar_industry_of_the_United_States "Sugar industry of the United States"), tin, and [coal](/wiki/Coal_mining_in_the_United_States "Coal mining in the United States") to paper bags, envelopes and salt—as giant money bags looming powerfully over the tiny, weak U.S. Senators[[8]](#cite_note-8)

Most progressives hoped that by regulating large corporations they could liberate human energies from the restrictions imposed by industrial [capitalism](/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"). Nonetheless, the progressive movement was split over which of the following solutions should be used to regulate corporations. Many progressives argued that industrial monopolies were unnatural economic institutions which suppressed the competition which was necessary for progress and improvement.[[9]](#cite_note-9) [United States antitrust law](/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law "United States antitrust law") prohibits anti-competitive behavior ([monopoly](/wiki/Monopoly "Monopoly")) and [unfair business practices](/wiki/Unfair_business_practices "Unfair business practices"). Presidents such as [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") and [William Howard Taft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft "William Howard Taft") supported [trust-busting](/wiki/Trust-busting "Trust-busting"). During their presidencies, the otherwise-conservative Taft brought down 90 trusts in four years while Roosevelt took down 44 in seven and a half years in office.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Progressives, such as Benjamin Parke De Witt, argued that, in a modern economy, large corporations and even monopolies were both inevitable and desirable. He argued that with their massive resources and economies of scale, large corporations offered the United States advantages which smaller companies could not offer. However, these large corporations might abuse their great power. The federal government should allow these companies to exist, but otherwise regulate them for the public interest. President Roosevelt generally supported this idea and incorporated it as part of his "[New Nationalism](/wiki/New_Nationalism_(Theodore_Roosevelt) "New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)")".[[11]](#cite_note-11)

## Efficiency

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Efficiency")]

Many progressives such as [Louis Brandeis](/wiki/Louis_Brandeis "Louis Brandeis") hoped to make American governments better able to serve the people's needs by making governmental operations and services more efficient and rational. Rather than making legal arguments against ten-hour workdays for women, he used "scientific principles" and data produced by social scientists documenting the high costs of long working hours for both individuals and society.[[12]](#cite_note-12) The progressives' quest for efficiency was sometimes at odds with the progressives' quest for democracy. Taking power out of the hands of elected officials and placing that power in the hands of professional administrators reduced the voice of the politicians and in turn reduced the voice of the people. Centralized decision-making by trained experts and reduced power for local wards made government less corrupt but more distant and isolated from the people it served. Progressives who emphasized the need for efficiency typically argued that trained independent experts could make better decisions than the local politicians. In his influential *Drift and Mastery* (1914) stressing the "scientific spirit" and "discipline of democracy", [Walter Lippmann](/wiki/Walter_Lippmann "Walter Lippmann") called for a strong central government guided by experts rather than public opinion.[[13]](#cite_note-13)

One example of progressive reform was the rise of the [city manager](/wiki/City_manager "City manager") system in which paid, professional engineers ran the day-to-day affairs of city governments under guidelines established by elected [city councils](/wiki/City_council "City council"). Many cities created municipal "reference bureaus" which did expert surveys of government departments looking for waste and inefficiency. After in-depth surveys, local and even state governments were reorganized to reduce the number of officials and to eliminate overlapping areas of authority between departments. City governments were reorganized to reduce the power of local ward bosses and to increase the powers of the city council. Governments at every level began developing budgets to help them plan their expenditures rather than spending money haphazardly as needs arose and revenue became available. Governor [Frank Lowden](/wiki/Frank_Lowden "Frank Lowden") of Illinois showed a "passion for efficiency" as he streamlined state government.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

### Governmental corruption

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Governmental corruption")]

Corruption represented a source of waste and inefficiency in the government. [William Simon U'Ren](/wiki/William_Simon_U%27Ren "William Simon U'Ren") in Oregon, [Robert M. La Follette](/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette "Robert M. La Follette") in Wisconsin and others worked to clean up state and local governments by passing laws to weaken the power of [machine politicians](/wiki/Political_machine "Political machine") and political bosses. In Wisconsin, La Follette pushed through an [open primary](/wiki/Open_primary "Open primary") system that stripped party bosses of the power to pick party candidates.[[15]](#cite_note-15) The Oregon System included a "Corrupt Practices Act", a public referendum and a state-funded voter's pamphlet, among other reforms which were exported to other states in the Northwest and Midwest. Its high point was in 1912, after which they detoured into a disastrous third party status.[[16]](#cite_note-16)

### Education

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Education")]

Main article: [History of education in the United States](/wiki/History_of_education_in_the_United_States "History of education in the United States")

Early progressive thinkers such as [John Dewey](/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey") and [Lester Ward](/wiki/Lester_Ward "Lester Ward") placed a universal and comprehensive system of education at the top of the progressive agenda, reasoning that if a democracy were to be successful, its leaders, the general public, needed a good education.[[17]](#cite_note-17) Progressives worked hard to expand and improve public and private education at all levels. They believed that modernization of society necessitated the compulsory education of all children, even if the parents objected. Progressives turned to educational researchers to evaluate the reform agenda by measuring numerous aspects of education, later leading to [standardized testing](/wiki/Standardized_testing "Standardized testing"). Many educational reforms and innovations generated during this period continued to influence debates and initiatives in American education for the remainder of the 20th century. One of the most apparent legacies of the Progressive Era left to American education was the perennial drive to reform schools and curricula, often as the product of energetic grass-roots movements in the city.[[18]](#cite_note-18)

Since progressivism was and continues to be "in the eyes of the beholder", progressive education encompasses very diverse and sometimes conflicting directions in educational policy. Such enduring legacies of the Progressive Era continue to interest historians. Progressive Era reformers stressed "object teaching", meeting the needs of particular constituencies within the school district, equal educational opportunity for boys and girls and avoiding corporal punishment.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

David Gamson examines the implementation of progressive reforms in three city school districts—[Denver, Colorado](/wiki/Denver,_Colorado "Denver, Colorado"); [Seattle, Washington](/wiki/Seattle,_Washington "Seattle, Washington") and [Oakland, California](/wiki/Oakland,_California "Oakland, California")—during 1900–1928. Historians of educational reform during the Progressive Era tend to highlight the fact that many progressive policies and reforms were very different and at times even contradictory. At the school district level, contradictory reform policies were often especially apparent, though there is little evidence of confusion among progressive school leaders in Denver, Seattle and Oakland. District leaders in these cities, including [Frank B. Cooper](/wiki/Frank_B._Cooper "Frank B. Cooper") in Seattle and Fred M. Hunter in Oakland, often employed a seemingly contradictory set of reforms. Local progressive educators consciously sought to operate independently of national progressive movements as they preferred reforms that were easy to implement and were encouraged to mix and blend diverse reforms that had been shown to work in other cities.[[20]](#cite_note-20)

The reformers emphasized professionalization and bureaucratization. The old system whereby ward politicians selected school employees was dropped in the case of teachers and replaced by a merit system requiring a college-level education in a [normal school](/wiki/Normal_school "Normal school") (teacher's college).[[21]](#cite_note-21) The rapid growth in size and complexity the large urban school systems facilitated stabilized employment for women teachers and provided senior teachers greater opportunities to mentor younger teachers. By 1900, most women in [Providence, Rhode Island](/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island "Providence, Rhode Island"), remained as teachers for at least 17.5 years, indicating teaching had become a significant and desirable career path for women.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

Progressives set up training programs to ensure that welfare and charity work would be undertaken by trained professionals rather than warm-hearted amateurs.[[23]](#cite_note-23) [Jane Addams](/wiki/Jane_Addams "Jane Addams") of Chicago's [Hull House](/wiki/Hull_House "Hull House") typified the leadership of residential, community centers operated by social workers and volunteers and located in inner city [slums](/wiki/Slum "Slum"). The purpose of the settlement houses was to raise the [standard of living](/wiki/Standard_of_living "Standard of living") of urbanites by providing adult education and cultural enrichment programs.[[24]](#cite_note-24)

### Anti-prostitution

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Anti-prostitution")]

During this era of massive reformation among all social aspects, elimination of prostitution was vital for the progressives, especially the women.[[25]](#cite_note-25) The anti-prostitution movement involved three main groups: Christians, Progressive Era feminists, and physicians. Many individuals active in the anti-prostitution movement shared some of the same perspectives from each of these groups. Jane Addams, one of the most notable of early American social workers, wrote a book addressing prostitution. According to her argument in *A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil*,[[26]](#cite_note-26) the reason why women resorted to prostitution was due to the inadequate salaries they received. However, she also mentions the absence of family oversight of female modesty, as young women migrated from rural to urban areas. Although most prostitutes were born in America, the public believed that women were being brought into the United States and later sold into prostitution. The opposition against prostitution could have been a reflection of concerns regarding the influx of immigrants, the growth of cities, the development of industries, and the erosion of established moral standards.[[27]](#cite_note-27)

A poster highlighting the situation of child labor in the United States in the early 20th century

Child labor laws were designed to prevent the overuse of children in the newly emerging industries. The goal of these laws was to give [working class](/wiki/Working_class "Working class") children the opportunity to go to school and mature more institutionally, thereby liberating the potential of humanity and encouraging the advancement of humanity. Factory owners generally did not want this progression because of lost workers. Parents relied on the income of children to keep the family solvent. Progressives enacted state and federal laws against child labor, but these were overturned by the US Supreme Court. A proposed constitutional amendment was opposed by business and Catholics; it passed Congress but was never ratified by enough states. Child labor was finally outlawed by the [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal") in the 1930s.[[28]](#cite_note-28)[[29]](#cite_note-29)

### Support for the goals of organized labor

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Support for the goals of organized labor")]

Labor unions grew steadily until 1916, then expanded fast during the war. In 1919, a wave of major strikes alienated the middle class and the strikes were lost which alienated the workers. In the 1920s, the unions were in the doldrums. In 1924, they supported [Robert M. La Follette](/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette "Robert M. La Follette")'s [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1924%E2%80%9334) "Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)"), but he only carried his base in Wisconsin. The [American Federation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") under [Samuel Gompers](/wiki/Samuel_Gompers "Samuel Gompers") after 1907 began supporting the [Democrats](/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)"), who promised more favorable judges as the [Republicans](/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") appointed pro-business judges. [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") and his third party also supported such goals as the [eight-hour work day](/wiki/Eight-hour_day "Eight-hour day"), improved safety and health conditions in factories, [workers' compensation](/wiki/Workers%27_compensation "Workers' compensation") laws and [minimum wage](/wiki/Minimum_wage "Minimum wage") laws for women.[[30]](#cite_note-30)

### Prohibition

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Prohibition")]

Main article: [Prohibition in the United States](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States "Prohibition in the United States")

Most progressives, especially in rural areas, adopted the cause of [prohibition](/wiki/Prohibitionism "Prohibitionism").[[31]](#cite_note-31) They saw the saloon as political corruption incarnate and bewailed the damage done to women and children. They believed the consumption of [alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol_(drug) "Alcohol (drug)") limited mankind's potential for advancement.[[32]](#cite_note-32) Progressives achieved success first with state laws then with the enactment of the [Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution](/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution") in 1919. The golden day did not dawn as enforcement was lax, especially in the cities where the law had very limited popular support and where notorious criminal gangs such as the Chicago gang of [Al Capone](/wiki/Al_Capone "Al Capone") made a crime spree based on illegal sales of liquor in speakeasies. The "experiment" (as President [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover "Herbert Hoover") called it) also cost the federal and local treasuries large sums of taxes. The 18th amendment was repealed by the [Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution](/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution") in 1933.[[33]](#cite_note-33)

### Eugenics

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Eugenics")]

Main article: [Eugenics in the United States](/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States "Eugenics in the United States")

Some progressives sponsored [eugenics](/wiki/Eugenics "Eugenics") as a solution to excessively large or under-performing families, hoping that [birth control](/wiki/Birth_control "Birth control") would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children while others, like [Margaret Sanger](/wiki/Margaret_Sanger "Margaret Sanger") advocated it.[[34]](#cite_note-retrospectives-34) Progressives also advocated for [compulsory sterilization](/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization "Compulsory sterilization") of those deemed "unfit".[[34]](#cite_note-retrospectives-34) Progressive leaders such as [Herbert Croly](/wiki/Herbert_Croly "Herbert Croly") and [Walter Lippmann](/wiki/Walter_Lippmann "Walter Lippmann") indicated their classical liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics.[[35]](#cite_note-35) Progressive politician [William Jennings Bryan](/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan "William Jennings Bryan") opposed eugenics on the grounds of his anti-evolution activism.[[36]](#cite_note-36) In a paper titled "The Progressives: Racism and Public Law", American legal scholar [Herbert Hovenkamp](/wiki/Herbert_Hovenkamp "Herbert Hovenkamp") (MA, PhD, JD) wrote:

> When examining the Progressives on race, it is critical to distinguish the views that they inherited from those that they developed. The rise of Progressivism coincided with the death of [scientific racism](/wiki/Scientific_racism "Scientific racism"), which had been taught in American universities since the early nineteenth century and featured prominently in the scientific debate over Darwin’s theory of evolution. Eugenics, which attempted to use genetics and mathematics to validate many racist claims, was its last gasp. The most notable thing about the Progressives is that they were responsible for bringing scientific racism to an end.[[37]](#cite_note-37)

## Purifying the electorate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Purifying the electorate")]

Progressives repeatedly warned that illegal voting was corrupting the political system. They especially identified big-city bosses, working with [saloon](/wiki/Bar_(establishment) "Bar (establishment)") keepers and precinct workers, as the culprits who stuffed the ballot boxes. The solution to purifying the vote included prohibition (designed to close down the saloons), voter registration requirements (designed to end multiple voting), and literacy tests (designed to minimize the number of ignorant voters).[[38]](#cite_note-38)

All of the [Southern states](/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States") used devices to [disenfranchise black voters](/wiki/Disenfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_Era "Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era") during the [Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era "Progressive Era").[[39]](#cite_note-39)[[40]](#cite_note-40) Typically, the progressive elements in those states pushed for disenfranchisement, often fighting against the conservatism of the Black Belt whites.[[41]](#cite_note-41) A major reason given was that whites routinely purchased black votes to control elections, and it was easier to disenfranchise blacks than to go after powerful white men.[[42]](#cite_note-42) In the [Northern states](/wiki/Northern_United_States "Northern United States"), progressives such as [Robert M. La Follette](/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette "Robert M. La Follette") and [William Simon U'Ren](/wiki/William_Simon_U%27Ren "William Simon U'Ren") argued that the average citizen should have more control over his government. The Oregon System of "[Initiative, Referendum, and Recall](/wiki/Initiatives_and_referendums_in_the_United_States "Initiatives and referendums in the United States")" was exported to many states, including Idaho, Washington and Wisconsin.[[43]](#cite_note-43) Many progressives such as George M. Forbes, president of [Rochester](/wiki/Rochester,_New_York "Rochester, New York")'s Board of Education, hoped to make government in the United States more responsive to the direct voice of the American people, arguing:

> [W]e are now intensely occupied in forging the tools of democracy, the direct primary, the initiative, the referendum, the recall, the short ballot, commission government. But in our enthusiasm we do not seem to be aware that these tools will be worthless unless they are used by those who are aflame with the sense of brotherhood. ... The idea [of the social centers movement is] to establish in each community an institution having a direct and vital relation to the welfare of the neighborhood, ward, or district, and also to the city as a whole.[[44]](#cite_note-44)

Philip J. Ethington seconds this high view of [direct democracy](/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), saying that "initiatives, referendums, and recalls, along with direct primaries and the direct election of US Senators, were the core achievements of 'direct democracy' by the Progressive generation during the first two decades of the twentieth century".[[45]](#cite_note-45)

Women marching for the right to vote, 1912

Progressives fought for [women's suffrage](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage "Women's suffrage") to purify the elections using supposedly purer female voters.[[46]](#cite_note-46) Progressives in the South supported the elimination of supposedly corrupt black voters from the election booth. Historian Michael Perman says that in both Texas and Georgia "disfranchisement was the weapon as well as the rallying cry in the fight for reform". In Virginia, "the drive for disfranchisement had been initiated by men who saw themselves as reformers, even progressives".[[47]](#cite_note-Michael_Perman_2001-47)

While the ultimate significance of the progressive movement on today's politics is still up for debate, Alonzo L. Hamby asks:

> What were the central themes that emerged from the cacophony [of progressivism]? Democracy or elitism? Social justice or social control? Small entrepreneurship or concentrated capitalism? And what was the impact of American foreign policy? Were the progressives isolationists or interventionists? Imperialists or advocates of national self-determination? And whatever they were, what was their motivation? Moralistic utopianism? Muddled relativistic pragmatism? Hegemonic capitalism? Not surprisingly many battered scholars began to shout 'no mas!' In 1970, Peter Filene declared that the term 'progressivism' had become meaningless.[[48]](#cite_note-48)

## Municipal administration

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Municipal administration")]

The progressives typically concentrated on city and state government, looking for waste and better ways to provide services as the cities grew rapidly. These changes led to a more structured system, power that had been centralized within the legislature would now be more locally focused. The changes were made to the system to effectively make legal processes, market transactions, bureaucratic administration and democracy easier to manage, putting them under the classification of "Municipal Administration". There was also a change in authority for this system as it was believed that the authority that was not properly organized had now given authority to professionals, experts and bureaucrats for these services. These changes led to a more solid type of municipal administration compared to the old system that was underdeveloped and poorly constructed.[[49]](#cite_note-49)[[50]](#cite_note-50)[[51]](#cite_note-51)[[52]](#cite_note-52)[[53]](#cite_note-53)

The progressives mobilized concerned middle class voters as well as newspapers and magazines to identify problems and concentrate reform sentiment on specific problems. Many Protestants focused on the saloon as the power base for corruption as well as violence and family disruption, so they tried to get rid of the entire saloon system through prohibition. Others such as [Jane Addams](/wiki/Jane_Addams "Jane Addams") in Chicago promoted [settlement houses](/wiki/Settlement_houses "Settlement houses").[[54]](#cite_note-54) Early municipal reformers included [Hazen S. Pingree](/wiki/Hazen_S._Pingree "Hazen S. Pingree") (mayor of Detroit in the 1890s)[[55]](#cite_note-55) and [Tom L. Johnson](/wiki/Tom_L._Johnson "Tom L. Johnson") in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1901, Johnson won election as mayor of Cleveland on a platform of just taxation, home rule for Ohio cities and a 3-cent streetcar fare.[[56]](#cite_note-56) Columbia University President [Seth Low](/wiki/Seth_Low "Seth Low") was elected mayor of New York City in 1901 on a reform ticket.[[57]](#cite_note-57)

During the term of the progressive Republican President [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") (1901–1909) and influenced by the ideas of philosopher-scientists such as [George Perkins Marsh](/wiki/George_Perkins_Marsh "George Perkins Marsh"), [William John McGee](/wiki/William_John_McGee "William John McGee"), [John Muir](/wiki/John_Muir "John Muir"), [John Wesley Powell](/wiki/John_Wesley_Powell "John Wesley Powell") and [Lester Frank Ward](/wiki/Lester_Frank_Ward "Lester Frank Ward"),[[58]](#cite_note-58) the largest government-funded conservation-related projects in United States history were undertaken.

### National parks and wildlife refuges

Further information: [Antiquities Act](/wiki/Antiquities_Act "Antiquities Act"), [National Park Service Organic Act](/wiki/National_Park_Service_Organic_Act "National Park Service Organic Act"), and [National Wildlife Refuge](/wiki/National_Wildlife_Refuge "National Wildlife Refuge")

On March 14, 1903, President Roosevelt created the first National Bird Preserve, the beginning of the Wildlife Refuge system, on Pelican Island, [Florida](/wiki/Florida "Florida"). In all, by 1909, the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres (170,000 km2) of [United States National Forests](/wiki/United_States_National_Forest "United States National Forest"), 53 [National Wildlife Refuges](/wiki/National_Wildlife_Refuge "National Wildlife Refuge") and 18 areas of "special interest" such as the [Grand Canyon](/wiki/Grand_Canyon "Grand Canyon").

### Reclamation

In addition, Roosevelt approved the [Newlands Reclamation Act](/wiki/Newlands_Reclamation_Act "Newlands Reclamation Act") of 1902 which gave subsidies for irrigation in 13 (eventually 20) Western states. Another conservation-oriented bill was the [Antiquities Act](/wiki/Antiquities_Act "Antiquities Act") of 1906 that protected large areas of land by allowing the president to declare areas meriting protection to be [national monuments](/wiki/National_monument_(United_States) "National monument (United States)"). The [Inland Waterways Commission](/wiki/Inland_Waterways_Commission "Inland Waterways Commission") was appointed by Roosevelt on March 14, 1907, to study the river systems of the United States, including the development of water power, flood control and land reclamation.[[59]](#cite_note-59)

## National politics

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: National politics")]

In the early 20th century, politicians of the [Democratic](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party "History of the United States Democratic Party") and [Republican](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party "History of the United States Republican Party") parties, [Lincoln–Roosevelt League](/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Roosevelt_League "Lincoln–Roosevelt League") Republicans (in California) and [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")'s [Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912%E2%80%931920) "Progressive Party (United States, 1912–1920)") all pursued environmental, political and economic reforms. Chief among these aims was the pursuit of trust busting, the breaking up very large monopolies and support for labor unions, public health programs, decreased corruption in politics and environmental conservation.[[60]](#cite_note-60)

The progressive movement enlisted support from both major parties and from minor parties as well. One leader, the Democratic [William Jennings Bryan](/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan "William Jennings Bryan"), had won both the Democratic Party and the [Populist Party](/wiki/Populist_Party_(United_States) "Populist Party (United States)") nominations in 1896. At the time, the great majority of other major leaders had been opposed to populism. When Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912, he took with him many of the intellectual leaders of progressivism, but very few political leaders.[[61]](#cite_note-61) The Republican Party then became notably more committed to business-oriented and efficiency-oriented progressivism, typified by [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover "Herbert Hoover") and [William Howard Taft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft "William Howard Taft").[[62]](#cite_note-62)

## Culture

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/TheJungleSinclair.jpg)](/wiki/File:TheJungleSinclair.jpg)

[Upton Sinclair](/wiki/Upton_Sinclair "Upton Sinclair")'s *[The Jungle](/wiki/The_Jungle "The Jungle")* exposed Americans to the horrors of the Chicago meatpacking plants.

The foundation of the progressive tendency was indirectly linked to the unique philosophy of [pragmatism](/wiki/Pragmatism "Pragmatism") which was primarily developed by [John Dewey](/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey") and [William James](/wiki/William_James "William James").[[63]](#cite_note-63)[[64]](#cite_note-The_American_Mind_1952-64) Equally significant to progressive-era reform were the crusading journalists known as [muckrakers](/wiki/Muckraker "Muckraker"). These journalists publicized to middle class readers economic privilege, political corruption and social injustice. Their articles appeared in *[McClure's Magazine](/wiki/McClure%27s_Magazine "McClure's Magazine")* and other reform periodicals. Some muckrakers focused on [corporate abuses](/wiki/Corporate_abuses "Corporate abuses"). [Ida Tarbell](/wiki/Ida_Tarbell "Ida Tarbell") exposed the activities of the [Standard Oil Company](/wiki/Standard_Oil_Company "Standard Oil Company"). In *[The Shame of the Cities](/wiki/The_Shame_of_the_Cities "The Shame of the Cities")* (1904), [Lincoln Steffens](/wiki/Lincoln_Steffens "Lincoln Steffens") dissected corruption in city government. In *Following the Color Line* (1908), [Ray Stannard Baker](/wiki/Ray_Stannard_Baker "Ray Stannard Baker") criticized race relations. Other muckrakers assailed the [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate"), railroad companies, insurance companies and fraud in [patent medicine](/wiki/Patent_medicine "Patent medicine").[[65]](#cite_note-65)

Novelists criticized corporate injustices. [Theodore Dreiser](/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser "Theodore Dreiser") drew harsh portraits of a type of ruthless businessman in *[The Financier](/wiki/The_Financier "The Financier")* (1912) and *[The Titan](/wiki/The_Titan_(novel) "The Titan (novel)")* (1914). In *[The Jungle](/wiki/The_Jungle "The Jungle")* (1906), socialist [Upton Sinclair](/wiki/Upton_Sinclair "Upton Sinclair") repelled readers with descriptions of Chicago's meatpacking plants and his work led to support for remedial food safety legislation. Leading intellectuals also shaped the progressive mentality. In *Dynamic Sociology* (1883), [Lester Frank Ward](/wiki/Lester_Frank_Ward "Lester Frank Ward") laid out the philosophical foundations of the progressive movement and attacked the *[laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire")* policies advocated by [Herbert Spencer](/wiki/Herbert_Spencer "Herbert Spencer") and [William Graham Sumner](/wiki/William_Graham_Sumner "William Graham Sumner").[[66]](#cite_note-66) In *[The Theory of the Leisure Class](/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class "The Theory of the Leisure Class")* (1899), [Thorstein Veblen](/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen "Thorstein Veblen") attacked the "conspicuous consumption" of the wealthy. Educator [John Dewey](/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey") emphasized a child-centered philosophy of pedagogy known as [progressive education](/wiki/Progressive_education "Progressive education") which affected schoolrooms for three generations.[[67]](#cite_note-67)

## In the 21st century

Modern progressivism can be seen as encompassing many notable differences from the historical progressivism of the 19th–20th centuries. Some viewpoints of modern progressivism highlight these perceived differences like those of Princeton economics professor [Thomas C. Leonard](/wiki/Thomas_C._Leonard "Thomas C. Leonard") who viewed historical progressivism in *[The American Conservative](/wiki/The_American_Conservative "The American Conservative")* as being "[a]t a glance, ... not much here for 21st-century progressives to claim kinship with. Today's progressives emphasize racial equality and minority rights, decry U.S. imperialism, shun biological ideas in social science, and have little use for piety or proselytizing." Ultimately, both historical progressivism and the modern movement share the notion that the free markets lead to economic inequalities that must be ameliorated in order to best protect the American working class.[[68]](#cite_note-68)

### Mitigating income inequality

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Mitigating income inequality")]

Politician [Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders") (pictured at podium) is widely recognized for contributing to a progressive shift within the [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") since the 2010s.

[Income inequality in the United States](/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States "Income inequality in the United States") has been on the rise since 1970.[[69]](#cite_note-69) Progressives argue that lower union rates, weak policy, [globalization](/wiki/Globalization "Globalization") and other drivers have caused the gap in income.[[70]](#cite_note-70)[[71]](#cite_note-71)[[72]](#cite_note-:2-72) The rise of income inequality has led progressives to draft legislation including, but not limited to, reforming [Wall Street](/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street"), reforming the tax code, reforming [campaign finance](/wiki/Campaign_finance "Campaign finance"), closing loopholes and keeping domestic work.[[73]](#cite_note-73)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Wall Street reform")]

Progressives began to demand stronger Wall Street regulation after they perceived deregulation and relaxed enforcement as leading to the [2008 financial crisis](/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis"). The [Occupy Wall Street](/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street "Occupy Wall Street") movement, launched in downtown Manhattan, was one high-profile reaction to the financial shenanigans. Passing the [Dodd-Frank](/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act "Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act") financial regulatory act in 2010 provided increased oversight on financial institutions and the creation of new regulatory agencies, but many progressives argue its broad framework allows for financial institutions to continue to take advantage of consumers and the government.[[74]](#cite_note-74) Among others, [Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders") has argued for reimplementing [Glass-Steagall](/wiki/Glass-Steagall "Glass-Steagall"), which regulated banking more strictly, and for breaking up financial institutions where market-share is concentrated in a select few 'too big to fail' corporations.[[75]](#cite_note-75)[[76]](#cite_note-76)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Health care reform")]

Main article: [Healthcare reform in the United States](/wiki/Healthcare_reform_in_the_United_States "Healthcare reform in the United States")

In 2009, the [Congressional Progressive Caucus](/wiki/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus "Congressional Progressive Caucus") (CPC) outlined five key healthcare principles they intended to pass into law. The CPC mandated a nationwide public option, affordable health insurance, insurance market regulations, an employer insurance provision mandate and comprehensive services for children.[[77]](#cite_note-77) In March 2010, Congress passed the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"), generally referred to as Obamacare, which was intended to increase the affordability and efficiency of the [United States healthcare](/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States "Health care in the United States") system. Although considered a partial success by some progressives, many argued that it did not go far enough in achieving healthcare reform as exemplified with the Democrats' failure in achieving a national public option.[[78]](#cite_note-:0-78) In recent decades, [single-payer healthcare](/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare "Single-payer healthcare") has become an important goal in [healthcare reform](/wiki/Healthcare_reform "Healthcare reform") for progressives. In the [2016 Democratic Party primaries](/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries "2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries"), progressive presidential candidate [Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders") raised the issue of a [single-payer healthcare](/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare "Single-payer healthcare") system, citing his belief that millions of Americans are still paying too much for health insurance and arguing that millions more do not receive the care they need.[[79]](#cite_note-:1-79) In November 2016, an effort was made to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state of Colorado, known as [ColoradoCare](/wiki/ColoradoCare "ColoradoCare") ([Amendment 69](/wiki/2016_Colorado_Amendment_69 "2016 Colorado Amendment 69")). Senator Sanders held rallies in Colorado in support of Amendment 69 leading up to the vote.[[80]](#cite_note-80) Despite high-profile support, Amendment 69 failed to pass, with just 21.23% of voting Colorado residents voting in favor and 78.77% against.[[81]](#cite_note-81)

### Minimum wage

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Progressivism_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Minimum wage")]

Adjusted for inflation, the [minimum wage](/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States "Minimum wage in the United States") peaked in 1968 at around $9.90 an hour in 2020 dollars.[[82]](#cite_note-82) Progressives believe that stagnating wages perpetuate income inequality and that raising the minimum wage is a necessary step to combat inequality.[[72]](#cite_note-:2-72) If the minimum wage grew at the rate of productivity growth in the United States, it would have reached $21.72 an hour in 2012, nearly three times as much as the current $7.25 an hour.[[83]](#cite_note-83) Popular progressives such as [Senator](/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") [Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders") and [Representative](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez") have endorsed a federally mandated wage increase to $15 an hour.[[84]](#cite_note-84) The movement has already seen success with its implementation in California with the passing of a bill to raise the minimum wage $1 every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021.[[85]](#cite_note-85) New York workers are lobbying for similar legislation as many continue to rally for a minimum wage increase as part of the [Fight for $15](/wiki/Fast_food_worker_strikes "Fast food worker strikes") movement.[[86]](#cite_note-86)

Modern progressives advocate strong environmental protections and measures to reduce or eliminate pollution. One reason for this is the strong link between economic injustice and adverse environmental conditions as groups that are economically marginalized tend to be disproportionately affected by the harms of pollution and [environmental degradation](/wiki/Environmental_degradation "Environmental degradation").[[87]](#cite_note-87)

In the 21st century progressives in the United States are advocating for the implementation of legislation that will promote a more equal society and help reduce the gaps between diverse populations in the American society, including the gaps between populations of different races, gender gaps and socio-economic gaps. Progressives support the promotion of criminal justice reform to rectify systemic injustices, and the eradication of discriminatory practices in areas such as employment and housing.

Following the first progressive movement of the early 20th century, three later short-lived parties have also identified as progressive.

### Progressive Party, 1912

Main article: [Bull Moose Party](/wiki/Bull_Moose_Party "Bull Moose Party")

The first political party named the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Bull_Moose_Party "Bull Moose Party") was formed for the [1912 presidential election](/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election "1912 United States presidential election") to elect [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt").[[91]](#cite_note-91) It was formed after Roosevelt lost his bid to become the [Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") candidate to [William Howard Taft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft "William Howard Taft"), and became defunct by 1920.
