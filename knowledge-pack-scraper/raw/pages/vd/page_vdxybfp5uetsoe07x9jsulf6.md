Rates are for a full coverage policy with higher liability limits than the state requirement, plus collision and comprehensive coverage.
In addition to your ZIP code, factors like your age and driving history also affect your car insurance rates. For example, if you have a speeding ticket or caused a car accident, you'll usually pay more than someone with a clean driving record.
## Car insurance rates by city
Car insurance rates also vary widely within states. Typically, cities with more people have higher insurance rates. Busier roads mean you're more likely to get into an accident, which means higher prices for car insurance.
For example, in Texas, full coverage car insurance costs about $42 more per month in a massive city like Houston than in a smaller and less traffic-heavy city such as Corpus Christi.

### Compare car insurance rates for cities in your state
When estimating car insurance rates, don't rely only on state averages. Find out how much car insurance costs in the city where you live.
Choose your state Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington, D.C. West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming
## Car insurance rates by ZIP code
Car insurance rates also differ between neighborhoods. The ZIP code where you live within a city can affect rates considerably.
For example, in [New York City](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-york#nyc "Car insurance quotes in New York City"), full coverage car insurance costs an average of $279 per month in the ZIP code 10021, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. But it costs twice as much — $562 per month — in ZIP code 11212, the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville.
Don't be worried if your auto insurance rates change when you move across town. Compare quotes for the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") to find the best deal in your new ZIP code.
## States with the cheapest car insurance
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont have the cheapest car insurance rates in the country.
These states don't have big populations or large cities, which typically have more traffic and higher accident and auto theft rates. In addition, all three states have lower [uninsured motorist rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/uninsured-motorist-statistics#state-rates "Uninsured motorist rates by state") than the U.S. average. Those are some of the reasons why full coverage car insurance in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont costs less than $110 per month, on average.

## States with the most expensive car insurance
Nevada, Florida and Michigan are the most expensive car insurance states.
Nevada has the highest rates in the country because of traffic congestion around cities such as Las Vegas and Reno, where much of the state's population lives.
Traffic congestion is also a problem in Florida. Floridians also have to worry about flood or hurricane damage and a [high rate of uninsured drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/uninsured-motorist-statistics#state-rates "Uninsured motorist rates by state").
Michigan has the [highest car insurance requirements in the country](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/michigan/requirements "Auto Insurance Laws in Michigan: 2020 Reforms and Current Requirements"), which has a big effect on its car insurance rates. It also has the second-highest rate of uninsured drivers in the country, after Mississippi.

## How do state coverage requirements affect car insurance costs?
Higher coverage requirements usually lead to higher car insurance rates.
Each state has different car insurance laws. [Most states usually require](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Coverage Is Required in Your State?") bodily injury and property damage liability insurance, which pay for damage you cause in an accident. Some states also require uninsured motorist coverage. Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is required primarily in no-fault states.
  * Bodily injury liability (BI)
  * Property damage liability (PD)
  * Uninsured or underinsured motorist (UIM) bodily injury


  * Uninsured or underinsured motorist (UIM) property damage
  * Personal injury protection (PIP)


[Most states require drivers to have auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#dont "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?").  All states except Florida require drivers to have bodily injury liability, and all 50 states and Washington, D.C., require property damage liability. About half of all states require uninsured or underinsured coverage, and [16 states require PIP](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?").
### Is full coverage required in my state?
[Full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") car insurance is not required by any state.
**However, your lender usually requires it if you have a car loan or lease.**
Full coverage gives you more protection than a minimum coverage policy. It includes [collision and comprehensive coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") to pay for nearly any  damage to your car, regardless of whose fault it is. Full coverage can also have higher liability limits beyond what your state requires.
Full coverage car insurance costs about $106 more per month than a minimum coverage policy. The smallest price difference is in Maine, where full coverage costs only $58 more per month than minimum coverage.
ValuePenguin editors recommend [dropping full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-cost-of-car-insurance-changes-with-age-of-car "When to Drop Full Coverage Insurance on Your Older Car") if your car is worth less than $5,000 or if it's more than 8 years old.
Of the major national companies, State Farm is the [cheapest company for full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest \(and Best\) Full Coverage Car Insurance"). But you may find a better deal with a local or regional company, so [get car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies before buying a policy.
### No-fault states vs. fault states
Car insurance can be expensive in states that require [no-fault car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/no-fault-auto-insurance "How No-Fault Insurance Works & Which States Are No-Fault"). This means drivers need to have personal injury protection, or PIP insurance, to cover their own medical bills after an accident. A driver's right to sue after an accident is also limited.
Of the 12 no-fault states, three are in the top 10 for the highest auto insurance rates.
#### The 12 no-fault states
  * Florida 
  * Hawaii 
  * Kansas 
  * Kentucky 


  * Massachusetts 
  * Michigan 
  * Minnesota 
  * New Jersey 


  * New York 
  * North Dakota 
  * Pennsylvania 
  * Utah 


In [at-fault states](https://www.valuepenguin.com/fault-or-no-fault-accident-decision-affects-auto-insurance-claims#fault "Fault vs. no-fault accidents and auto insurance claims"), the person who causes the car accident must use their liability insurance to pay for the other driver's injuries and property damage.
A few states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, let drivers pay more to opt out of the no-fault system. This option allows drivers to sue for pain and suffering.
Some states, such as [Delaware](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/how-pip-works-delaware "How Does Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Work in Delaware?") and Oregon, require PIP even though they are fault states.
## What other factors besides location affect auto insurance rates?
Your age, driving record and credit score typically have a big impact on your car insurance rate. That's in addition to where you live, as your ZIP code matters when it comes to factors such as crime rates, especially for theft.
  * [**Driving record.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-traffic-violation-affect-car-insurance-quotes "How a Traffic Violation Affects Car Insurance Premiums") If you have speeding tickets or accidents on your record, companies assume you are a high-risk driver and typically raise your rates. 
  * [**Age.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs#average "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs") Young drivers pay much more for car insurance. Rates drop quickly between ages 16 and 25. After leveling off in middle age, rates slowly start to rise again after age 60. 
  * [**Credit score.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") Insurance companies use your credit report to help calculate your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-score "Understanding Auto Insurance Scores"). Usually, a good or excellent credit score gets you a lower rate on car insurance. A poor or bad credit score means you'll probably pay more. However, several states, including Michigan, Hawaii and California, [don't allow insurance companies to use credit scores](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates#check "How does your credit score affect auto insurance rates?") to set rates. 
  * [**Car.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/luxury-car-insurance "Best Cheap Rates for Luxury & Exotic Car Insurance") The more expensive your car is to repair, the more you'll usually pay for insurance. Expect to pay more if you have a luxury car, sports car or electric car. 
  * [**Gender.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-women#states "Car insurance for women") Men typically spend more time on the road and get into more accidents than women, especially when they're young. With the exception of a few states, insurance companies generally charge men higher rates than women to reflect this increased risk. 
  * [**Lapse in coverage.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-lapse-car-insurance-coverage-affect-rates "How Does a Lapse in Car Insurance Coverage Affect Rates?") Any gap in insurance coverage means your insurance rates will likely be higher. A gap of more than a month could increase your rates by 8%. 


Every company has its own unique formula for setting rates, and some companies consider certain factors more than others. That's why it's so important to [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") so you can maximize your chance of getting the best rate.
## How moving states can impact your car insurance rates
Moving across state lines will likely impact your auto insurance rates.
As a general rule, average auto insurance rates are usually higher in [states that require more insurance to drive legally](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). States with lower requirements tend to have lower average insurance rates.
Comparing the requirements can help you start [estimating your car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/estimate-car-insurance "Car Insurance Estimator") to see how your bills might change after a move.
For example, drivers who move from Ohio to Florida will likely pay more for car insurance after the move.
Florida drivers pay $42 per month more for full coverage than Ohio drivers, on average. This is partly because Florida requires personal injury protection (PIP) insurance, which can be expensive.
The driving conditions of your new state may also affect your rates. Full coverage car insurance in Pennsylvania costs an average of $27 per month less than coverage in New Jersey. Both states have identical minimum coverage requirements and are no-fault states. But New Jersey is more densely populated and has more traffic.
You may also need to factor in the cost to [change your registration and license](https://www.valuepenguin.com/moving-new-state-heres-how-transfer-your-car-insurance-and-registration "How to Transfer Car Insurance and Registration After Moving") with your new state DMV.
