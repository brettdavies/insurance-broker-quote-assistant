For example, in [New York City](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-new-york#nyc "Car insurance quotes in New York City"), full coverage car insurance costs an average of $279 per month in the ZIP code 10021, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. But it costs twice as much — $562 per month — in ZIP code 11212, the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville.
Don't be worried if your auto insurance rates change when you move across town. Compare quotes for the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") to find the best deal in your new ZIP code.
These states don't have big populations or large cities, which typically have more traffic and higher accident and auto theft rates. In addition, all three states have lower [uninsured motorist rates](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/uninsured-motorist-statistics#state-rates "Uninsured motorist rates by state") than the U.S. average. Those are some of the reasons why full coverage car insurance in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont costs less than $110 per month, on average.

Traffic congestion is also a problem in Florida. Floridians also have to worry about flood or hurricane damage and a [high rate of uninsured drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/uninsured-motorist-statistics#state-rates "Uninsured motorist rates by state").
Michigan has the [highest car insurance requirements in the country](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/michigan/requirements "Auto Insurance Laws in Michigan: 2020 Reforms and Current Requirements"), which has a big effect on its car insurance rates. It also has the second-highest rate of uninsured drivers in the country, after Mississippi.

Each state has different car insurance laws. [Most states usually require](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Coverage Is Required in Your State?") bodily injury and property damage liability insurance, which pay for damage you cause in an accident. Some states also require uninsured motorist coverage. Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is required primarily in no-fault states.
[Most states require drivers to have auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#dont "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?").  All states except Florida require drivers to have bodily injury liability, and all 50 states and Washington, D.C., require property damage liability. About half of all states require uninsured or underinsured coverage, and [16 states require PIP](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?").
[Full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") car insurance is not required by any state.
Full coverage gives you more protection than a minimum coverage policy. It includes [collision and comprehensive coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") to pay for nearly any  damage to your car, regardless of whose fault it is. Full coverage can also have higher liability limits beyond what your state requires.
ValuePenguin editors recommend [dropping full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-cost-of-car-insurance-changes-with-age-of-car "When to Drop Full Coverage Insurance on Your Older Car") if your car is worth less than $5,000 or if it's more than 8 years old.
Of the major national companies, State Farm is the [cheapest company for full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest \(and Best\) Full Coverage Car Insurance"). But you may find a better deal with a local or regional company, so [get car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies before buying a policy.
Car insurance can be expensive in states that require [no-fault car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/no-fault-auto-insurance "How No-Fault Insurance Works & Which States Are No-Fault"). This means drivers need to have personal injury protection, or PIP insurance, to cover their own medical bills after an accident. A driver's right to sue after an accident is also limited.
In [at-fault states](https://www.valuepenguin.com/fault-or-no-fault-accident-decision-affects-auto-insurance-claims#fault "Fault vs. no-fault accidents and auto insurance claims"), the person who causes the car accident must use their liability insurance to pay for the other driver's injuries and property damage.
Some states, such as [Delaware](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/how-pip-works-delaware "How Does Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) Work in Delaware?") and Oregon, require PIP even though they are fault states.
* [**Driving record.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-traffic-violation-affect-car-insurance-quotes "How a Traffic Violation Affects Car Insurance Premiums") If you have speeding tickets or accidents on your record, companies assume you are a high-risk driver and typically raise your rates.
* [**Age.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs#average "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs") Young drivers pay much more for car insurance. Rates drop quickly between ages 16 and 25. After leveling off in middle age, rates slowly start to rise again after age 60.
* [**Credit score.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") Insurance companies use your credit report to help calculate your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-score "Understanding Auto Insurance Scores"). Usually, a good or excellent credit score gets you a lower rate on car insurance. A poor or bad credit score means you'll probably pay more. However, several states, including Michigan, Hawaii and California, [don't allow insurance companies to use credit scores](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates#check "How does your credit score affect auto insurance rates?") to set rates.
* [**Car.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/luxury-car-insurance "Best Cheap Rates for Luxury & Exotic Car Insurance") The more expensive your car is to repair, the more you'll usually pay for insurance. Expect to pay more if you have a luxury car, sports car or electric car.
* [**Gender.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-women#states "Car insurance for women") Men typically spend more time on the road and get into more accidents than women, especially when they're young. With the exception of a few states, insurance companies generally charge men higher rates than women to reflect this increased risk.
* [**Lapse in coverage.**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-lapse-car-insurance-coverage-affect-rates "How Does a Lapse in Car Insurance Coverage Affect Rates?") Any gap in insurance coverage means your insurance rates will likely be higher. A gap of more than a month could increase your rates by 8%.
Every company has its own unique formula for setting rates, and some companies consider certain factors more than others. That's why it's so important to [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") so you can maximize your chance of getting the best rate.
As a general rule, average auto insurance rates are usually higher in [states that require more insurance to drive legally](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). States with lower requirements tend to have lower average insurance rates.
Comparing the requirements can help you start [estimating your car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/estimate-car-insurance "Car Insurance Estimator") to see how your bills might change after a move.
You may also need to factor in the cost to [change your registration and license](https://www.valuepenguin.com/moving-new-state-heres-how-transfer-your-car-insurance-and-registration "How to Transfer Car Insurance and Registration After Moving") with your new state DMV.

Progressive is more expensive in Colorado than California. Full coverage from Progressive costs an average of $145 per month in [California](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-california#full-coverage "Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California"), while it's $214 per month in [Colorado](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-colorado#full-coverage "Cheapest car insurance quotes in Colorado"). This is likely in part because Colorado has much higher car theft rates than other states, according to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s "FBI: Crime in the U.S.").
[Massachusetts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-massachusetts#full-coverage "Cheapest car insurance in MA") has cheaper average car insurance rates than California, at $145 per month for full coverage. In comparison, full coverage in [California](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-california#full-coverage "Cheapest full coverage car insurance in California") costs around $168 per month. However, both states are cheaper than the average rate across the U.S., which is $175 per month.
[Texas](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-rates-texas-study#full-coverage "Best cheap auto insurance in Texas") typically has cheaper car insurance rates than Louisiana. Full coverage insurance in Texas costs an average of $182 per month, while drivers in [Louisiana](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-louisiana#full-coverage "Cheapest car insurance in Louisiana") pay around $249 per month. That makes Louisiana the fourth-most expensive state in the country for full coverage insurance.
[Maine](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-maine "Cheapest Car Insurance Quotes in Maine") has the cheapest full coverage car insurance rates in the country, at $103 per month, on average. That's $72 per month less than the national average.
