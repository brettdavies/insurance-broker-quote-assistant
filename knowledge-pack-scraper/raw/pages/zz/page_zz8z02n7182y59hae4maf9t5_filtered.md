### Key takeaways

* 18-year-old drivers on their own policy pay the highest car insurance premiums out of the age groups Bankrate analyzed.
* The most significant difference in premiums by gender occurs at age 18. On average, 18-year-old males cost 8 percent less to insure than their female counterparts.
* As drivers age, the difference in premium between genders narrows. At age 50, for instance, males only pay 1 percent more on average per year for full coverage than 50-year-old females.

## Average auto insurance rates by age and gender

When you get a [car insurance quote](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), your insurance company uses multiple criteria to assess your level of risk and calculate your rate. Age and gender are two key components. In general, [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) can expect to pay higher rates than middle-aged drivers, with rates typically increasing again for senior drivers. Additionally, according to accident trends and data, men are riskier to insure than women and often pay higher rates. Some other non-demographic factors that may impact your rate can include your driving record, credit history, ZIP code and the types of coverage you purchase.

Keep in mind that while the average car insurance cost per year by age and [state varies greatly](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) in most places, not all states permit age as a rating factor. Hawaii and Massachusetts ban the use of age as a rating factor (although Michigan does factor in years of driving experience, so younger drivers may still face higher premiums on average), and California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania prohibit the use of gender as a rating factor.

## How age affects your car insurance rates

When you analyze average car insurance costs by age, you may notice a trend. Coverage starts out relatively expensive for teens and young adults. Over the years, premiums generally decrease as drivers gain more experience behind the wheel. But as drivers reach their senior years, premiums can creep back up. Understanding which age group pays the most for car insurance is closely tied to their accident risk, as detailed below:

* **Teens:** Teens are among the riskiest drivers to insure due to their inexperience on the road. Per miles driven, drivers aged 16 to 19 get into [almost three times](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) as many fatal car accidents as any other age group. Insurers frequently charge more to insure teen drivers to offset the higher costs associated with teen driving claims.
* **Adults:** The cost of auto insurance coverage generally begins to drop by the time a driver reaches their early 20s. By 25, drivers are no longer considered youthful operators by their insurance carriers and might notice a [pretty significant reduction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/25-year-old/) in their premiums. Throughout adulthood — provided that drivers have a history of safe driving and no [insurance claims](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/filing-a-car-insurance-claim/) — rates related to age generally level out and remain fairly consistent.
* **Seniors:** While retirement brings plenty of perks, lower car insurance rates aren’t one of them. As drivers approach 70, age-related factors like slower reaction times and vision changes can increase the risk of accidents, leading to higher premiums. Additionally, as we age, slower recovery and complications from injuries can increase the cost of medical care for older drivers, which also increases the cost of medical payments and personal injury protection (PIP) coverages.

Most insurers understand that car insurance can be expensive for certain age groups and offer discounts to help [reduce those premiums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/). Common [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) for young drivers include good student discounts and driver training discounts. Senior drivers may earn discounts through a senior defensive driving course or affiliation with organizations such as AARP. You may also save money by enrolling in your provider’s telematics program, which tracks your real-time driving data to demonstrate that your driving habits are safer than those typically associated with your age demographic.

## How gender affects your car insurance rates

In most states, gender is used as a rating factor when determining car insurance premiums. In general, men are statistically more likely to engage in risky driving behavior, but this does not automatically mean that men pay more than women for coverage. While the general trend of premiums shows that men pay more than women, this depends on numerous factors.

* **State:** Your location can determine whether your gender will affect your car insurance premium. Currently, six states do not allow gender to be used as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In these states, rates for men and women should be roughly equal if all the other rating factors — like vehicle type, driving history, etc. — are the same.
* **Credit score:** In many states, your credit-based [insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) will impact your car insurance premium. So, for example, a male driver with poor credit will probably pay more for car insurance than a male with good credit. On the other hand, a female driver with poor credit could pay more for car insurance than a male driver with great credit. However, this also depends on location. Insurance companies in California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan limit or restrict the use of credit-based insurance scores as rating factors.
* **Driving record:** Driving record can be one of car insurance's most significant rating factors. Drivers with a history of accidents, speeding tickets or other traffic violations typically pay the highest rates. For example, a female driver with a DUI or other serious violation will likely pay a higher rate than a male with a clean driving record. Maintaining a good driving record is one of the best ways to get a low rate for both males and females.

Although your gender will impact your car insurance rate (in most states), it does not necessarily mean that your premium will be above the average cost of car insurance or extremely expensive. Gender is just one of the factors that contribute to your car insurance rate. If you practice safe driving habits, maintain good credit, take advantage of discounts and [shop around](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) annually, you can probably find a policy that easily fits within your budget.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### What other factors impact my insurance rate?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Age is only one [car insurance rating factor](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) that impacts your premium. While each carrier weighs various factors differently, most take vehicle type, driving record, annual mileage and location into account. However, keep in mind that your rates are generally impacted by factors that assess the likelihood of you submitting a claim, as well as the type of coverage you select.

* ### How can I find the best car insurance for my age and gender?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The first step to finding the [best car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for your circumstances is to figure out what factors matter most to you. For example, do you need specialty coverage for customizations, or are you looking for a bare-bones policy? Do you want access to a brick-and-motor agent or prefer a carrier with a highly-rated mobile app? Getting quotes from several different companies may help you compare coverage offerings, discounts, policy features and third-party ratings to find the best option.

* ### How do I get cheaper auto insurance if I am a young driver?

  Caret Down Icon 

  [Young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/) may be stuck with higher insurance rates, but there are ways to make the premium more affordable. Aside from maintaining a clean driving record, look for carriers that offer additional discounts geared towards young drivers, such as good student discounts and driver training discounts. Additionally, if you can't bring your car with you to college, your parents might be eligible for a student away-from-home credit. If you are looking into buying a car, consider going with an older used vehicle, where you can have liability-only coverage to save money.

* ###### At what age will my car insurance start to go down?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Your car insurance should start to go down throughout your early 20s at each policy renewal. By the time you turn 25, there’s a good chance that you’ll be paying roughly half as much as you were as a teenager for insurance premiums. Throughout adulthood, your car insurance rates will generally still go down but much more gradually. However, this trend can be interrupted or even reversed at any time if certain risk factors about your driving profile change, such as causing a car accident or purchasing a more expensive vehicle.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
