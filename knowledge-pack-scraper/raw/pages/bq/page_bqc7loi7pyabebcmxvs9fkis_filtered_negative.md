Mobile home insurance coverage is similar to a regular [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "Homeowners Insurance: Coverage and How It Works"). Many common events are covered, but not everything. For example, if a storm damages your roof and water leaks inside, both the roof and the water damage would be covered. But mobile home insurance doesn't cover flood or earthquake damage.

[Modular homes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/modular-home-insurance "How Does Insurance Work for Modular Homes?") are different. These homes are built in pieces, which are shipped to building sites. Because they aren't shipped whole, they can be any size or shape. They also usually have a permanent foundation, like a slab or a basement. Once a modular home is built, it's hard to tell the difference between it and a home that was built completely on the building site.
