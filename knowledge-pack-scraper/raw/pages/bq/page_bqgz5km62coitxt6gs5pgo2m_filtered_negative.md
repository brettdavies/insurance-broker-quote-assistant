Car insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company. Here's how it works: You pay the insurance company money every month (or every six months) and the insurance company agrees to pay certain bills, up to a maximum amount, if you have an accident. The money you pay is called your premium.
##  Why Do You Need Car Insurance?
You are required to have car insurance to drive. States require minimum level of car insurance coverage to drive legally. **If you don't have car insurance,** you will be responsible for damage that you cause and need to pay for accident expenses and medical bills.
There are different [types of car insurance coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/). You can have liability-only coverage or multiple types of coverage in your car insurance policy.
States require [liability car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage/) coverage to legally drive. [Comprehensive](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/comprehensive/) and [collision](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/collision/) (also called full coverage) protect your own vehicle from damage. You can also add optional protections like [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-uninsured-motorist-insurance-and-do-you-need-it/) and personal injury protection depending on your needs. Learn the basics of each coverage type below.
* **Bodily injury liability** pays medical costs for people you injure. This includes hospital stays, rehabilitation and legal fees if someone sues you.
* **Property damage liability** pays to fix or replace things you damage like other cars, buildings, fences or personal items in vehicles.
Here are the basic car insurance terms you need to know. We defined these with easy to understand language so you'll know what you are buying when you get your car insurance.

Liability, collision, and comprehensive are the primary coverage types in car insurance policies. The are other common coverage additions you can add to your policy. Most of these are optional except of coverage like PIP that is required by some states.
* **Your credit score:** Better credit score means lower rates because insurers claim credit helps predict who will file claims. Some states don't allow insurers to use credit scores.
Start with at least 50/100/50. MoneyGeek recommends 100/300/100 coverage ($100,000 per person injured, $300,000 total per accident, $100,000 for property damage) for most drivers. If you own a home or have savings over $50,000, get 250/500/250 or higher to protect your assets.
