# Fighting with State Farm renters insurance

I am currently in a fight with my State Farm over my personal property coverage. I live in South Carolina and my house was affected by the wildfires that were started in my neighborhood. My house has very bad smoke damage and has ruined most of my clothes , beds, couches and other soft goods. My agent informed me this morning that I need to get in contact with a mitigator of my choice. It seems that they went ahead and got in contact with one for me that has a contract with them. The mitigator they contacted has harassed me all day trying to call me and also showed up at my house. I have read bad reviews about them. The company is called Servicemaster. I went ahead and contacted a mitigator of my choice and they informed me that cleaning could be up to $20,000. The problem I have is that the fires are not out yet and my house keeps filling up with smoke. That means they would have to clean the house several times which would cost the insurance company tons of money. I would rather them pay me to get new stuff and to possibly even get into a new place. What should I do in this situation?
