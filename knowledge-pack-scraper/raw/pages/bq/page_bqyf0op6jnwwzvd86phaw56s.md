#  Fighting with State Farm renters insurance 
I am currently in a fight with my State Farm over my personal property coverage. I live in South Carolina and my house was affected by the wildfires that were started in my neighborhood. My house has very bad smoke damage and has ruined most of my clothes , beds, couches and other soft goods. My agent informed me this morning that I need to get in contact with a mitigator of my choice. It seems that they went ahead and got in contact with one for me that has a contract with them. The mitigator they contacted has harassed me all day trying to call me and also showed up at my house. I have read bad reviews about them. The company is called Servicemaster. I went ahead and contacted a mitigator of my choice and they informed me that cleaning could be up to $20,000. The problem I have is that the fires are not out yet and my house keeps filling up with smoke. That means they would have to clean the house several times which would cost the insurance company tons of money. I would rather them pay me to get new stuff and to possibly even get into a new place. What should I do in this situation?

Servicemaster is a national company and reputable. 
What have you done to prevent further damage? Have you taken any steps to seal your doors and windows to prevent smoke coming in? 
If the items were cleaned and damaged again, that would be another seperate claim with a separate deductible. 
Your insurance policy will dictate how coverages are applied but the insurer will generally clean anything that can be cleaned and replace anything that is damaged beyond repair. They will not simply pay to replace your things without reason.

Your insurance contract requires you to mitigate damages. If you don't they don't have to pay any part of the claim that's from after when you should have mitigated the damages.  
Unless you take the clothes somewhere away from the fire, shower several times and spend a few days to get the smoke out of your lungs stuff will smell smokey when you are still letting smoke into your house.

Is that $20k just for your personal property? I’m not seeing how it would take a professional company weeks and weeks to do that cleaning… it should take a day or so for the on-site cleaning and anything that needs to be cleaned off-site would have its own timeline. 
Since you’re renting the house, what is the homeowner doing about the remediation to the home? 
Is Service Master harassing you, or are they attempting to assess your claim after being engaged by your insurer?

Check your loss of use coverage! You have 2 years to file a claim so wait until everything has settled and all damage has been done. Try to do your best to protect what you can. 
State Farm likely did not send someone but rather someone who works at State Farm was given the business's information.State Farm usually will reach out to 3rd parties to appraise damages. 
Key point: prevent further damage as best you can and review loss of use coverages.

If your home is uninhabitable they should find you a place. It’s likely they will want to try and clean the items first.

I already have paid a week out of pocket to stay in a hotel. Currently we are staying at my grandparents but it is a tight stay. In order for them to clean this will take weeks upon weeks and that’s not a route that we want to go. The cleaning service stated that it would be over $20,000 to clean. Wouldn’t it make more sense for them to just pay out instead of prolonging the process?

You likely have coverage to pay for a place for you to live. It’s impossible to know what they will do. Think about depreciation. Perhaps they agree to replace it all but it’s not new so they would apply depreciation. Say you have a ten year old couch that would cost $1,000 to replace but all they owe you is the depreciated price likely only a few hundred dollars. You could end up with a small check and none of your belongings. You need to get a second itemized estimate and see if they are close. Mitigation companies are notorious for over estimating. Good luck

A home isn't uninhabitable because there was a wild fires near it.

What is your policy limit? What is your deductible? Do you have replacement cost coverage? Do you have loss of use coverage?

Service master is a national company.  
Each branch is a franchise I think. They generally do good work. Can you not shut your windows.  
They will only pay for mitigation once unless they're is a new fire close to you. Your clothes, etc are not ruined cause their was a fire close up you.  
You can wash your own clothes.

Common mistakes in filing insurance claims 
Filing insurance claims can be a complex and sometimes frustrating process. Here are some common mistakes to avoid based on the experiences and advice shared by Redditors: 
### Incorrect or Incomplete Information
  * **Providing Incorrect Dates or Details** : Ensure you have the correct dates and details of the incident. ["Take a look at your policy application that you signed. It will have the start date."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/gt0j2f/comment/fs8wdk6/)
  * **Miscommunication with Insurance Agents** : Sometimes, agents can make mistakes, such as entering the wrong policy start date. ["Ask for a supervisor and have them pull the call. If the agent messed up, they will make this right."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/gt0j2f/comment/fs8z78b/)


### Not Understanding Your Policy
  * **Failing to Understand Coverage** : Make sure you understand what your policy covers. ["Are you renting or do you live in a condo with an HOA? The type of policy is going to be relevant."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/17cnfrn/comment/k5r5vmr/)
  * **Ignoring Deductibles** : Be aware of your deductible and whether the cost of the repair exceeds it. ["If the damage is less than the deductible, what is the incentive to file a claim?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1bey562/comment/kuwqx2g/)


### Not Documenting Properly
  * **Lack of Evidence** : Providing sufficient evidence, such as photos or videos, can be crucial. ["Send them video of the light if it supports you had an arrow."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mc75kq/comment/n5rmja0/)
  * **Not Filing a Police Report** : For theft or significant damage, a police report is often necessary. ["I also suggest you file a police report for the theft, the carrier may require it."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/gt0j2f/comment/fs8owu8/)


### Making Claims for Minor Issues
  * **Filing Claims for Small Amounts** : Consider whether the claim is worth the potential increase in premiums. ["No, eat the cost if you can. While it is not a huge claim, if you have another claim later, your carrier will look at frequency."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1o3c97u/comment/niu43cb/)
  * **Claims for Wear and Tear** : Insurance typically covers sudden or accidental events, not wear and tear. ["Is the water intruding into the home due to wear/tear to the roof or flashing?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/17cnfrn/comment/k5ubpnx/)


### Not Seeking Help When Needed
  * **Not Consulting Professionals** : Sometimes, it's beneficial to consult with professionals, such as public adjusters or attorneys. ["I would recommend a public adjuster, they work for you and then negotiate with the insurance company for repairs."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1bey562/comment/kuxnl22/)
  * **Ignoring Communication Issues** : If you're having trouble communicating with your insurance company, escalate the issue. ["You're going to have to insist. Or maybe just ask your insurance company to run it using the correct tax ID."](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1bont25/comment/kwq8ivc/)


### Not Understanding Coordination of Benefits
  * **Multiple Insurance Policies** : If you have multiple insurance policies, it's important to understand how they coordinate benefits. ["I essentially had no clue that holding two insurance policies requires you to arrange coordination of benefits."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1l0dhf9/retroactive_denial_of_many_claims_following/)
