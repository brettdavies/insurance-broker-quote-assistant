## What Is Car Insurance? The Basic Definition

Car insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company. Here's how it works: You pay the insurance company money every month (or every six months) and the insurance company agrees to pay certain bills, up to a maximum amount, if you have an accident. The money you pay is called your premium.

A **car insurance policy** is a document that lists what the insurance company will pay for, how much they'll pay and what you have to pay yourself in the case of an accident or other damange to your car.

## Why Do You Need Car Insurance?

You are required to have car insurance to drive. States require minimum level of car insurance coverage to drive legally. **If you don't have car insurance,** you will be responsible for damage that you cause and need to pay for accident expenses and medical bills.

1. 1

   It's the Law

   State require you to have at least some car insurance before you can drive. If you get caught driving without it, you'll:

   * Pay fines (often $500 to $5,000)
   * Risk losing your license and having your car registration suspended
   * Pay more for insurance later
2. 2

   Accidents Are Expensive

   Even small accidents cost thousands of dollars. Serious accidents where multiple people get hurt can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Without insurance, you'd pay all of this yourself. With insurance, you might pay $150 per month to have coverage that pays up to $100,000 per person hurt and $300,000 total per accident.
3. 3

   It Protects What You Own

   If you cause a bad accident and don't have insurance (or don't have enough), the people you hurt can sue you and go after you house, your car, and part of your future paychecks.

## Car Insurance Coverage Definitions

There are different [types of car insurance coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/).  You can have liability-only coverage or multiple types of coverage in your car insurance policy.

States require [liability car insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage/) coverage to legally drive.  [Comprehensive](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/comprehensive/) and [collision](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/coverage/collision/) (also called full coverage) protect your own vehicle from damage. You can also add optional protections like [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-uninsured-motorist-insurance-and-do-you-need-it/) and personal injury protection depending on your needs. Learn the basics of each coverage type below.

Liability Coverage

**What it pays for:** Your bills when you cause an accident and hurt someone or damage their property

Liability coverage has two parts:

+ **Bodily injury liability** pays medical costs for people you injure. This includes hospital stays, rehabilitation and legal fees if someone sues you.
+ **Property damage liability** pays to fix or replace things you damage like other cars, buildings, fences or personal items in vehicles.

**What are the three numbers?** Coverage is shown as three numbers like 100/300/100. This means $100,000 per person injured, $300,000 total per accident and $100,000 for property damage. You don't pay a deductible for liability coverage.

**Why you need it:** States require this coverage because without it, you'd pay for damage out of pocket.

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

Collision Coverage

**What it pays for:** Fixes your car after you crash into something or someone crashes into you

**How it works:** You pay your deductible first (usually $500 or $1,000). Then insurance pays the rest up to what your car is worth. If repairs cost $3,000 and your deductible is $500, you pay $500 and insurance pays $2,500.

If your car is totaled (too damaged to fix), insurance pays you what your car was worth before the accident, minus your deductible.

**Who needs it:** Required if you have a car loan or lease. Collision is Important if your car is worth more than you can afford to replace, but you can skip it if your car is worth less than $3,000 and you can replace it yourself.

**What it doesn't cover:** Theft, weather damage, vandalism or hitting animals. Comprehensive coverage covers these.

![car icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car_idrljy.svg)

Comprehensive Coverage

**What it pays for:** Fixes or replaces your car from damage that isn't a crash

This includes theft, vandalism, and weather damage. It's called "other than collision" coverage because it covers what collision doesn't.

**How it works:** You pay your deductible first, then insurance pays the rest. If hail causes $4,000 in damage and your deductible is $500, you pay $500 and insurance pays $3,500.

**Who needs it:** Required if you have a car loan or lease. Also smart if you can't afford to replace your car, live where severe weather or car theft is common.

## Basic Car Insurance Questions & Answers

Here are basic answers to the most commonly asked questions about car insurance:

1. 1

   How much does car insurance cost?

   The national average is $80 per month for minimum coverage and $158 per month for full coverage. Your actual cost depends on your age, location, driving record, credit score and the car you drive.

   Read More: [How much does car insurance cost](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/what-is-the-average-cost-of-car-insurance-month-year/) and [cheapest car insurance companies.](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/)
2. 2

   What affects my car insurance rate?

   Several major factors determine your car insurance rate:

   * **Your driving record:** Tickets increase your rate for three to five years. At-fault accidents raise costs even more. A DUI can double or triple your premium.
   * **Your age and experience:** Drivers under 25 pay the most because statistics show they have more accidents. Rates typically drop at age 25 and remain lower through middle age.
   * **Where you live:** Cities cost more than rural areas due to more accidents, theft and vandalism. Some states cost more than others due to state mandated coverage.
   * **Your credit score:** Better credit score means lower rates because insurers claim credit helps predict who will file claims.  Some states don't allow insurers to use credit scores.
   * **Your vehicle type:** Expensive cars, sports cars and vehicles that get stolen often cost more to insure than practical sedans.
   * **How much you drive:** The fewer miles you drive yearly, the less you pay since you have less chance of having an accident.
3. 3

   How do I save money on car insurance?

   Compare quotes from multiple insurers and ask about discounts like bundling policies, good student rates, and safe driver discounts. You can also raise your deductible to lower premiums.

   Read More: [How to lower your car insurance rates](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-lower-your-car-insurance-rate/).
4. 4

   How much car insurance do I need?

   Start with at least 50/100/50.  MoneyGeek recommends 100/300/100 coverage ($100,000 per person injured, $300,000 total per accident, $100,000 for property damage) for most drivers. If you own a home or have savings over $50,000, get 250/500/250 or higher to protect your assets.

   State minimums are often just 25/50/25, which means only $25,000 per person injured. A serious accident where someone needs surgery and hospital care can easily cost $100,000 or more. If you only have $25,000 in coverage, you'd personally owe the remaining $75,000.

5. 5

   Where can I get car insurance?

   You can buy car insurance directly from insurance companies through their websites or by calling them. Major companies like GEICO, State Farm, Progressive and Allstate all sell directly to customers.

   You can also use online comparison sites, like MoneyGeek, to get quotes from multiple companies at once. These sites show you prices side by side, making it easier to find the best deal.

   Insurance agents are another option. Agents provide personal service and help with claims, but may cost slightly more than buying online.
6. 6

   What happens if someone without insurance hits me?

   If you have uninsured motorist coverage, your insurance pays your medical bills and fixes your car. About one in eight drivers has no insurance, so this coverage protects you when they cause an accident.  
   If you have collision coverage, it will fix your car no matter what. But it won't pay your medical bills unless you have uninsured motorist coverage.
