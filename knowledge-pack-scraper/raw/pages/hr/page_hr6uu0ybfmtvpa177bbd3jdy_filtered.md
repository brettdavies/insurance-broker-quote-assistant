Editor's Rating

Is Geico insurance good?

**Geico is a good option for car insurance.** It offers affordable rates and a convenient user experience. Geico sets itself apart with one of the best apps to get quotes and manage policies online.

**However, there's a lot of variety in Geico's home insurance pricing, coverage options and discounts.** That's because Geico works with around 45 companies to provide home insurance to its customers. This can make it hard to predict whether you'll get good customer service if you have to make a claim in the future.

### Geico auto insurance coverage

Geico has a few coverage options that you can add to your policy at an extra cost.

Emergency road service

Geico [roadside service](/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") covers jump starts, flat-tire changes and towing if your car breaks down on the side of the road. It will also pay up to $100 for locksmith services.

Mechanical breakdown

Mechanical breakdown insurance covers certain car repairs. This can include fixing your engine, transmission or air conditioner. You'll have to pay a $250 deductible, and Geico will cover the remaining cost. However, it doesn't pay for routine maintenance or wear and tear.

Mechanical breakdown insurance is available for cars under 15 months old with fewer than 15,000 miles. Once you have this coverage, you can renew it for up to seven years or 100,000 miles.

Rental reimbursement

[Rental reimbursement](/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") pays for a rental vehicle while your car is in the repair shop after an accident.

You'll choose limits per day and per claim when you buy rental reimbursement. For example, you might pick $45 per day and $1,350 per claim.

Rideshare insurance

Geico offers [rideshare coverage](/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "Uber and Lyft: Car Insurance for Ridesharing") if you work for a company like Uber, Lyft, Amazon Flex or Grubhub.

This coverage typically fills the gap between your car insurance and the protection offered by the rideshare company. However, you can't get Geico rideshare insurance online. **You must call Geico at 800-207-7847 to buy a rideshare policy.**

### Geico accident forgiveness

With [accident forgiveness](/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness-what-it-and-who-offers-it "How Does Accident Forgiveness Work?"), your auto insurance rates won't go up after your first at-fault accident. Geico offers two types of accident forgiveness:

1. **Free accident forgiveness** for drivers who have been accident-free for five years or more
2. **Upgraded accident forgiveness**, which some people with good driving records can get at an extra cost (not available in California, Connecticut or Massachusetts)

Geico also offers the [standard car insurance coverages](/how-car-insurance-works#insurancepays "What does car insurance cover?") you need to drive legally in your state and full coverage insurance, which includes comprehensive and collision coverage. These coverages pay for damage to your car after an accident.

**It's important to note that Geico doesn't offer [gap insurance](/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance").** Gap insurance covers the amount left to pay off your car loan or lease if your vehicle is totaled.

#### Other Geico car insurance perks

Geico also offers a few helpful perks, like its Prime Time contract for drivers over 50 years old.

Prime Time contract

The Geico Prime Time contract is a program for customers over 50. Drivers with the Prime Time contract will always have the option to renew their insurance policy.

Besides being over the age of 50, to qualify for Prime Time, you must not have:

* Drivers under 25 years old on the policy
* Any tickets or accidents in the last three years
* Business vehicles insured on the policy

This program protects drivers from situations where an insurance company might not offer to renew a policy. Although you must have a clean record when you sign up for Prime Time, if you get multiple tickets after you sign up, Geico won't cancel your policy. **The Prime Time contract does not guarantee that your rates will always be the same.**

Auto repair program

The Geico Auto Repair Xpress program guarantees any repairs done by a shop in the Geico network. Geico guarantees the repairs for as long as you own your car.

Car buying service

The Geico car buying service connects you to local dealerships. It lets you see what other people have paid for a specific vehicle. You can use this service to compare car prices without having a Geico insurance policy.

### Geico auto insurance reviews and ratings

Geico car insurance has mixed reviews from its customers.

* The company gets 25% fewer complaints than expected, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). That shows that customers are typically happy with their experience at Geico.
* However, J.D. Power gave Geico a below-average score on its claims satisfaction survey. That means it may take Geico longer to fix your car and get you back on the road than other major companies.

One benefit of choosing Geico is that it has an A++, or Superior, financial strength rating from AM Best. That means Geico should be able to pay claims even in tough economic times.

## Geico homeowners insurance review

You should only consider Geico homeowners insurance if you have another policy with Geico and can get its bundling discount.

* [Quotes](#home-cost "#home-cost")
* [Discounts](#home-discounts "#home-discounts")

* [Coverage](#home-coverage "#home-coverage")
* [Service](#home-service "#home-service")

That's because Geico doesn't sell its own homeowners insurance policies. Instead, it partners with around 45 other home insurance companies. After buying a policy through Geico, you'll work directly with one of these companies. **Your customer service experience could be very different depending on which company Geico pairs you with.**

You don't get to choose which company you'll work with when you get Geico home insurance. Each has its own rates, coverage options and discounts. In fact, it can be difficult to know which company is insuring you until after you've bought your policy.

**That's why we typically recommend Geico home insurance only if you're bundling it with an auto or motorcycle policy.**

### Geico home insurance quotes

Geico isn't typically the cheapest option for homeowners insurance.

And quotes vary widely depending on which affiliate the company pairs you with. For example, some of Geico's larger affiliates in New York are AIG, Chubb, PURE Insurance and Narragansett Bay. PURE is the cheapest of these options, at around $978 per year. However, home insurance from Chubb costs an average of $1,506 per year. That's a difference of $528 per year.

**Unfortunately, you can't choose which provider Geico pairs you with, so there's no way to shop around to find the best rate.**

**Even if you're getting a discount from Geico for bundling your home and auto insurance, you may be able to pay less by buying policies from two different companies.**

For example, the average cost of Farmers home insurance is $752 per year. Even if Geico matched you with PURE Insurance, it's still 30% more expensive than Farmers. That's typically more than you would save with a bundling discount.

### Geico homeowners insurance discounts

Geico only offers three [home insurance discounts](/homeowners-insurance-discounts-and-savings "Homeowners Insurance Discounts and Savings") on its policies. That's far fewer than most major companies offer.

* **Multipolicy discount** for bundling your home insurance with a car, motorcycle or other type of insurance policy
* **Home security systems discount** for protecting your home with a security system
* A discount for having **smoke alarms and fire extinguishers** in your home

### Geico homeowners insurance coverage options

Each of Geico's home insurance partners offers its own unique set of insurance coverages.

You can expect Geico's partners to offer the basic protection included in most home insurance policies. This includes:

* [Dwelling coverage](/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?")
* [Personal property insurance](/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?")
* [Personal liability coverage](/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?")

* Medical payments coverage
* [Loss or use or additional living expenses](/loss-of-use-homeowners-insurance "What Is Loss of Use Coverage for Homeowners and Renters?")

They may also offer common add-ons like protection for valuable jewelry or identity theft coverage. **But, unfortunately, you won't know which coverage options you have until you're toward the end of the quote process.**

### Geico home insurance reviews and ratings

It's hard to predict what type of customer service you'll get from Geico home insurance until you buy a policy.

That's because around 45 different partner companies underwrite Geico home insurance. Once you have a policy, you'll contact your underwriting company directly to file a claim. It will also help you make changes to your policy or answer billing questions.

**Some of Geico's partners have better customer service reviews than others.**

For example, J.D. Power's customer satisfaction survey ranked AIG 5th out of 22 of the largest home insurance companies. That means homeowners are typically happy with the service they get at AIG.

However, Homesite, another Geico partner, earned the lowest score of the group. That means Homesite customers may have difficulty getting the company to pay for repairs after an emergency.

## Geico motorcycle insurance

Geico motorcycle insurance is only worth considering if you're already a Geico auto insurance customer.

Geico's motorcycle insurance rates are a little more expensive than average, and the company doesn't offer many extra coverage options or discounts. The main reason to consider Geico motorcycle insurance is the convenience of having your motorcycle and auto insurance policies with the same company

However, Geico doesn't offer some popular coverage options you can find with other companies. For example, you can't get rental car coverage to help pay for a vehicle while your motorcycle is in the shop after a crash.

**For that reason, Geico motorcycle insurance is only a good choice if you're shopping for the most basic coverage available.**
