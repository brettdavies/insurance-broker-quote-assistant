The short answer is a frame construction home will typically be more expensive to insure when compared to a masonry construction home. There are three main reasons why this is the case:
It’s only natural for insurance companies to price for these additional layers of risk when determining the insurance premium. Another interesting fact is that frame construction homes have insurance premiums that increase at an increasing rate when compared to masonry construction homes.
**_Say what?_ **
**_So what happens when you have a home of mixed construction such as a masonry construction first floor and a frame construction second floor?_ **
Every insurance company looks at this situation differently. Some companies will consider the home masonry construction for rating purposes if the frame construction is less than 33% of the total construction. Other carriers will consider a home masonry construction if the home is less than 50% frame construction. While other carriers will give a masonry type of rating if the frame home is covered with masonry stucco.
