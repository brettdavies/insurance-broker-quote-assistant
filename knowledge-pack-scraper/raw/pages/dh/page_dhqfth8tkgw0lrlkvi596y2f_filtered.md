# Landlord wants these terms for renters insurance - is this possible?

[Home Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)

“Combined single limit of no less than $200,000 per occurrence, $500,000 in the aggregate for personal injury and property damage with $500,000 excess liability coverage”

All the policies I am seeing at the major carriers have much lower limits. State Farm does offer $1M personal liability. Personal property limits I am seeing are $20,000-$25,000. Damage to property of others is only $1,000 limit per occurrence. Am I not understanding what the landlord is asking for properly?
