They’re* asking that your liability limits meet those requirements. Get a policy with $500k liability and you’re good.

This. $500K liability covers all of the stuff he’s saying no need to be so granular on a renters policy.

First of all, many landlords/managing agents of both residential and commercial properties have limited knowledge of insurance. As a result, they often make unrealistic requirements, and sometimes just string together a bunch of insurance words that sound important, resulting in a mess. If SF will write $1 Million straight up, that's probably the way to go. This exceeds the requirements, and no excess is required.

Send the letter/website to your State Farm agent and they can get you what you need. Most renters with State Farm start with $100,000 liability. You probably need that to be increased to $500,000. Shouldn’t cost much to increase it.

You're looking at the wrong coverage. Personal property coverage at thr 25 or 5k or w.e is for YOUR personal stuff. Computer, tv, furniture.
What your landlord wants is 500k in general liability coverage. Most any insurance company goes up to 500k in liability, not all, but a lot of em do.

We went thru this trying to figure out when renting a single family home - just called our provider and told them we needed to ensure we had coverage because <read letter> they quickly helped figure out what was required and faxed (yeah, FAX) the proof of coverage to the property management company for us.
I also went higher on liability because when SHTF bills can get big fast, especially if someone gets hurt.

A renters policy protects your stuff inside the apartment (with some limited coverage for certain things like jewelry in the event of theft). The $20K is the immediately prepopulated number. You can have more coverage if you want.
I put $1M on every renters and homeowners quote I run because Stare Farm can provide that coverage for cheap ($1.33/mo. in my area). Your landlord is not an insurance professional. Get a renters policy and that will suffice.

Why are the tenants responsible for this? Shouldn't the landlord buy his own liability insurance on a rental?
