* How Long Can Kids Stay On Parents Insurance?
![Mother helping son carry moving boxes to move out from parent’s home.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/how-long-can-kids-stay-on-parents-insurance.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
As a young adult, it’s crucial to know when to step from the support of your parents’ insurance policies and establish your own. While staying on a parent's policy can be convenient and sometimes more cost-effective, having your own coverage can be an essential step in becoming an independent and financially responsible adult. Generally, you may find your own insurance when you get a job that provides you with financial stability to live apart from your parents. [Discover various insurance types](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-are-all-the-different-types-of-insurance) and rules that may apply below.
When it comes to auto insurance for young adults, there's no strict age limit when a child must be removed from a parent's policy. Typically, if the child resides at the same address, they can remain on the policy. However, if the car is solely in the child's name, it might be time to consider separate insurance. Regarding the question "How long can a child stay on their parent’s car insurance?”. When they become financially independent, start living permanently at a different address or [buy their first car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/first-car-insurance-policy-what-should-you-know) titled in their name, it can be time to [get their own auto insurance policy](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options). Insurance companies may have their specific guidelines, so check with your agent.
Some insurance providers consider [moving away to college](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-for-college-students) as an exception to the rule. For instance, if you attend college and reside in a campus dorm or nearby housing, you may continue to have coverage under your parents' car insurance. However, consider finding your own policy if you've taken steps to establish your financial independence after you’ve graduated or moved away for a job.
Similarly, [renters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-much-renters-insurance-do-i-need) and [homeowners insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-homeowners-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) follow a basic guideline. Once you no longer live at your parent's residence, [consider obtaining renters insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/renters) for the residence you are renting or homeowners insurance for the property you own. Some insurance providers may extend coverage to a student at school from the parents' [homeowners policy](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners), but this typically does not apply if you are fully relocating and living independently.
[Purchasing life insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance) can be helpful when you're young and healthy. One approach is to add coverage through a Children's Term Rider on a parent's policy that can later be converted to a standalone policy. Starting [life insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/life) early can help contribute to financial security and wealth over time.
Umbrella insurance provides an additional layer of [liability protection](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) above what your standard auto or homeowners policy may cover. It can help protect a young adult if they’re responsible for an accident or damage. When you start obtaining significant assets or potential income that could be at risk in a lawsuit, it's time to consider a personal umbrella policy.
[Talk to your insurance agent](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/insurance-questions-to-ask-your-agent) if you are asking yourself, “How long can children stay on parents’ insurance?” and when deciding the most appropriate time for your child to transition to their own policies. Your agent can help based on your child's individual circumstances, such as age, financial stability and living situation.
