Perhaps best known for its roadside assistance programs, AAA also offers [car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) to its members. In most cases, coverage is not provided by AAA themselves, but through partner companies. AAA simply acts as an intermediary, meaning that coverage options and experiences can be vastly different based on location

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/aaa-vs-allstate/)
Allstate is another major insurance company with a wide array of coverage types and mostly positive ratings from third parties and customers. On the whole, Allstate's car insurance policies are often more expensive than most similarly-sized companies. While Allstate has a number of add-ons and other benefits for policyholders — including rebates for safe driving and a rewards program — drivers will want to strongly consider if these added perks are worth the higher prices. See their ratings below to see how they compare to AAA.
