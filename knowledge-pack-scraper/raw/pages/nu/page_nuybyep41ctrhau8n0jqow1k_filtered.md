## The best car insurance companies in Orlando

To identify the [best Florida car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida/) for cheap auto insurance, Bankrate’s insurance editorial team began by analyzing average rate data from Quadrant Information Services. In addition to rate data, we considered [J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), coverage types and discounts, financial strength and more. Each carrier was assigned a Bankrate Score out of a possible 5.0 points to signal the overall benefits the company offers for consumers, but we’ve singled out each company for its primary strengths compared to other insurers in the region.

**Why Progressive made our list:** Below-average rates, a robust range of discounts and a high Bankrate Score of 4.4 out of 5.0 points may make Progressive one of the [best car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for drivers in Orlando, FL. Although Progressive’s slightly below-average customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power indicate that the carrier may not be the best pick for consumers who place a high value on customer service, drivers seeking the cheapest rates may want to get a quote from Progressive.

**Why Progressive may be best for customized policies:** In addition to standard coverage options like liability and collision insurance, Progressive offers [customizable coverage add-ons](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/) that other carriers may not have, such as loan/lease payoff, custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage and disappearing deductibles. If you need a full coverage policy that goes beyond the basics, consider getting quotes from Progressive.

**Why Geico made our list:** Geico was named one of the best budget auto insurance companies as well as one of 2024’s best auto insurance companies overall in the [2024 Bankrate Awards](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2024/best-auto-insurance-companies/). While it may not be a good fit for drivers seeking custom coverage or policy add-ons like gap coverage, Geico excels in providing low-cost basic auto insurance to drivers in a wide range of categories.

**Why Geico may be best for digital policy management:** Geico prioritizes digital sales and policy management through its [highly rated mobile app](https://www.geico.com/web-and-mobile/mobile-apps/), which allows policyholders to reach out to agents, file claims, access ID cards and summon roadside assistance. Although the company scored below average for service in J.D. Power’s [2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), it ranked above the industry average for shopping, indicating that the company makes finding and purchasing your policy online a simple and efficient process.

**Why State Farm made our list:** According to our research, State Farm may have the lowest rates for some drivers seeking cheap car insurance in Orlando. The company also earned the second place spot for customer satisfaction in Florida in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, scoring more than 20 points above the region average. A solid suite of [discounts](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/discounts), including savings opportunities geared towards young drivers, could make State Farm a good choice for some Orlando drivers.

**Why State Farm may be best for working with a local agent:** State Farm maintains a large network of [local insurance agents](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/us/fl/orlando) in the Orlando area. While the company’s mobile app offers digital policy management options for policyholders who prefer doing business on their smartphone, consumers who value an in-person relationship with a local agent may want to get a quote from State Farm.

**Why Allstate made our list:** Allstate received a Bankrate Score of 3.9 out of 5.0 points for auto insurance. In addition to standard insurance like liability, collision and medical payments coverage, Allstate has some less common coverage options like [ridesharing insurance](https://www.allstate.com/auto-insurance/ride-for-hire) and [classic car coverage](https://www.allstate.com/auto-insurance/classic-car). The company also ranked in fourth place for customer satisfaction in Florida in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Why Allstate may be best for usage-based policies:** While Allstate’s average rates are slightly higher than some competitors in the Orlando area, their usage-based insurance could lower premiums for safe drivers. The [Drivewise](https://www.allstate.com/drivewise) app tracks safe driving behaviors in exchange for potential discounts, including automatic discounts of 10 percent for signing up and 6 percent for staying active in the program. Combined with [Allstate’s other auto insurance discounts](https://www.allstate.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts), using the telematics app could help Orlando drivers find affordable rates.

**Why Direct Auto made our list:** Direct Auto is owned by Direct General Insurance Agency, a subsidiary of Allstate, specializing in nonstandard auto insurance for drivers with high-risk factors, such as violations and at-fault accidents, on their driving records. Direct Auto is not rated by J.D. Power, but its parent company, National General, has an AM Best rating of A+ (Superior), indicating its strong ability to pay out claims. Drivers in Orlando who are struggling to find affordable coverage from other insurers may want to get a quote from Direct Auto.

**Why Direct Auto may be best for high-risk insurance:** While our research indicates that Direct Auto’s average rates may be higher than the citywide average, they may offer lower rates to high-risk drivers and coverage to consumers who can’t get a policy elsewhere. Direct Auto offers basic coverage options and a range of discounts, including vehicle equipment and driver training discounts, which could help to lower rates for high-risk drivers.

## How much is car insurance in Orlando, Florida?

On average, Orlando drivers pay $3,725 per year for full coverage insurance and $1,095 per year for state minimum coverage. That’s 4 percent less than the [average cost of car insurance in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-florida/) for full coverage and 4 percent more for minimum coverage. Overall, Orlando drivers with full coverage policies pay 354 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/).

### Orlando rates for teens

Because insurers base premiums on risk and drivers with limited on-road experience carry a significantly higher risk of crashes and claims, [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) in Orlando typically pay above-average rates for auto insurance, especially if they’re on their own policy versus their parents. For example, on average, an 18-year-old driver on their parents’ policy in Orlando pays $6,368 annually for full coverage compared to the annual cost of $10,332 on their own policy.

### Orlando rates for senior drivers

However, rates may begin to climb as drivers reach their seventies and see slower reaction times, potential vision issues and a higher risk of serious injury from a crash. On average, a 70-year-old driver in Orlando pays 5 percent more for full coverage than a 60-year-old and 1 percent more than a 50-year-old, for a total annual premium of $3,597.

## The cheapest car insurance in Orlando by driving record

Insurance companies look closely at your driving record when issuing car insurance quotes in Orlando. Tickets, at-fault accidents and serious convictions for offenses like driving under the influence can make it difficult to find cheap car insurance in Orlando. It’s important to understand how each of these factors affects your driver profile — and how different insurance carriers treat them — in order to find the cheapest rates with a less-than-perfect driving record.

### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Orlando

Drivers in Orlando with a [speeding ticket conviction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) pay 8 percent more for full coverage, on average, than drivers with a clean record. Compare that to the Florida state average, where drivers with speeding tickets usually pay 8 percent more than the average for drivers with no violations.

* ###### Why are car insurance rates in Orlando so high?

  Caret Down Icon 

  There may be a couple of reasons for Orlando's high insurance rates. Florida is a [no-fault state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida-car-insurance-laws/), requiring drivers to carry [personal injury protection coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/), which can increase rates. In addition, Orlando's crowded urban streets and highways mean an increased number of fender benders and other more serious accidents. That often leads to a higher level of claims and indicates to insurers that they need to charge more to compensate for the increased payouts. In addition, Florida is currently battling a statewide issue with auto glass repair fraud that could be causing premium rates to inch higher.

## Methodology

Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.

These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.

**Incidents**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.

**Age**: Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.

**Teens**: Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
