Driving a car in Florida comes with specific legal requirements that all drivers must adhere to as a resident of Florida. Auto insurance is required in Florida and with that required insurance, there are requirements that each policy must have as part of its protections.
## Auto Insurance Requirements in Florida
In Florida, drivers [must have auto insurance](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) that includes Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL). PIP [covers your medical expenses](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/who-pays-medical-bills-after-car-accident/) regardless of fault, while PDL pays for damages to others’ property.
### What Is the Minimum PIP Coverage in Florida?
The minimum for PIP coverage in Florida is $10,000. In addition to PIP insurance, Florida drivers must also have a minimum of $10,000 in PDL insurance. Vehicles registered as taxis must carry additional bodily injury liability (BIL) coverage of $125,000 per person, $250,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for (PDL) coverage.
According to Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, any vehicle with a current Florida registration must also meet the following insurance requirements*:
* Be insured with PIP and PDL insurance at the time of vehicle registration.
* Have continuous coverage even if the vehicle is not being driven or is inoperable. Surrender the license plate/tag **BEFORE** canceling your insurance.
* Purchase the policy from an insurance carrier licensed to do business in Florida. (If you are new to the state, you may ask your agent to transfer your current insurance to a Florida policy.)
* Maintain Florida insurance coverage continuously throughout the registration period regardless of the vehicle’s location. (Military members stationed out-of-state/country may be exempt.)
So if you are driving legally in Florida as a Florida resident, you have auto insurance that [includes personal injury protection](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/pip-insurance-vs-health-insurance/) as a feature of your coverage.
## What is Personal Injury Protection (PIP) on Florida Auto Insurance?
PIP, or personal injury protection, helps cover your medical bills and other expenses after a car accident, regardless of fault. In Florida, you must seek treatment within 14 days of the accident to [access PIP benefits](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/pip-insurance-process/).
[Learn More About PIP Insurance](https://www.complete-care.com/payment-insurance/)
This is one reason that you should be [seen immediately following an accident](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/benefits-of-receiving-immediate-care/), even if you don’t think you were injured enough for treatment. An evaluation can help rule out injuries that could stay with you for a long time and it ensures that you are able to access your benefits if you find later that you are having [lingering issues](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/long-term-effects-of-car-accidents/) as a result of the accident. Do not wait to be seen. It is very important to remember.
### What Does Florida PIP Insurance Cover?
Your no-fault PIP insurance in Florida includes the following personal injury protection benefits, after any applicable deductibles:
* 80% of medical bills, out-of-pocket prescription costs, dental expenses, and rehabilitation services.
* 60% of lost wages.
* Mileage reimbursement to and from your doctor
* $5,000 in death benefits, which are in addition to the medical and disability benefits provided by the policy.
To receive more than $2,500 in PIP insurance coverage benefits following an accident, you will need to have been treated by a doctor within 14 days of your accident, and be determined to have an “emergency medical condition”. You must be [treated within **14 days** ](https://www.complete-care.com/blog/how-to-find-the-right-doctor-after-an-auto-accident/)of your accident by a doctor who can then determine whether your injuries are an EMC or not. If you wait longer than 14 days, you won’t have access to these benefits even if a doctor lets you know that injuries would have been otherwise covered.
### What Isn’t Covered by PIP Insurance?
Florida PIP coverage will not cover the following:
* Collision (coverage for your vehicle repairs)
* Property Damage Liability Coverage (for damage of the other driver’s vehicle or other property damaged in the accident like a fence)
* Medical bills that exceed the limits of your coverage
## See a Doctor Within 14 Days to Best Utilize Your PIP In Florida
Do not wait to be seen by a doctor.
You have benefits as part of any Florida auto policy that you were required to carry. These benefits are there for you to access in the event of a car accident. There are additional benefits and procedures that may be available to you following your initial treatment or evaluation.
To be a legal driver in Florida, you are required to carry auto insurance. You are making those payments and following the law and doing everything you are supposed to be doing as part of the community. If you are in a car accident, you have benefits. You have been paying for them through your insurance.
A car accident is a traumatic event. If you are not sure what your next steps should be after an accident, call [Complete Care](https://www.complete-care.com/schedule-appointment/) at [(844) 699-2273](tel:8446992273) and speak with our Patient Advocates.
