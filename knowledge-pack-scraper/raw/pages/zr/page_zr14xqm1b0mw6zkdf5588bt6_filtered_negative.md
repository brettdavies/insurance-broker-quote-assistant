**If you have a car loan or lease, your lender probably requires you to have a full coverage policy.** That's because full coverage comes with [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?"). These coverages pay to fix or replace your car after an accident, theft, flooding and other types of damage.
**[Collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance#coll "What is collision insurance?")** pays for damage to your car after a crash with another vehicle or structure, regardless of whose fault it is.
* * *
**[Comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance#comp "What is comprehensive insurance?")** pays for damage to your car that's not strictly related to driving.
One of the most important factors is your  deductible. Policies with higher deductibles usually cost less because insurance companies won't pay as much after a crash.
---|---|---|---
---|---|---
**Consider dropping your[comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") when you can reasonably afford to replace your car.** Your car insurance costs will drop. But you'll need to pay for a new car out of pocket if you cause an accident that totals your car.

[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") is the easiest way to get savings all year long without changing your coverage. Different insurance companies will likely quote you different prices for the same amount of coverage. That's because they each set their rates in different ways.
You could save with [car insurance discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") by doing things like signing up for automatic payments, being a safe driver, having anti-theft systems and more.
Getting rid of extra coverage gives you less protection, but the trade-off may be worth it for you. For example, you may not need [rental car reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") coverage if you have a second car or easy access to public transportation. And you might not need roadside assistance if you have AAA.
[Rasing your deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-do-deductibles-affect-car-insurance-premiums "How Do Deductibles Affect Car Insurance Premiums?") will lower your monthly costs, but you'll have to pay more for repairs after a claim. Compare rates for different deductibles to see if the monthly savings is worth it compared to your potential costs after an accident.
[Bundling car and home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles") can save you about 25%. Bundling is popular because it's an easy way to save money, and it can also be more convenient because you only have to deal with one insurance company.
By using a credit card to pay your insurance bill, your card could give you cash back or help you earn points. For example, a $175 per month car insurance bill could earn you  $42 cash back at the end of the year. Make sure that your insurance doesn't add a fee for using a credit card and that you pay off the credit card bill to avoid interest.
![credit score icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_65//icons/credit-score) | Getting car insurance quotes **won't hurt your credit score** so it's OK to get multiple quotes.

![insurance policy icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_54//icons/checklist) |  **Pay attention to the plan details.** Lots of factors can affect which company is cheapest.
Full coverage auto insurance includes [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"), which offer more protection than a minimum liability policy.
A full coverage policy also includes any [other coverage your state requires](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). This could include uninsured motorist coverage or personal injury protection.
* **[Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** pays for your injuries and damage to your car if an uninsured driver hits you. Some states require this coverage.
* **[Underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** pays for your expenses if you're hit by a driver who doesn't have enough car insurance to cover your costs.
* **[Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?")** pays your medical bills if you’re injured in a crash, regardless of who caused it. PIP can also reimburse you for lost wages if you miss work while recovering. "No-fault" states may require PIP.
* * *
Full coverage car insurance costs $175 per month, on average. Some drivers can find cheaper rates from companies like [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance#state-farm "#state-farm"), Erie, Country Financial or USAA.
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance#state-farm "#state-farm") is the cheapest widely available option for full coverage auto insurance, at $134 per month. Drivers should also get quotes from Auto-Owners (which has extra coverage options) and from USAA if they’re eligible because of a military connection.
Full coverage pays for damages to your car as well as any damages or injuries you cause to others.
