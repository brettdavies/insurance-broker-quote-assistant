* Optional _medical payments_ auto insurance coverage
Personal injury protection is a type of insurance coverage that’s only offered in no-fault states—that is, states where insurance coverage doesn’t depend on who’s at fault in an accident. Consequently, personal injury protection is _not_ offered in California, which is an at-fault state.
In no-fault states, personal injury protection pays for medical expenses for anyone who is injured in an accident. This includes medical expenses for you and your passengers, even if you’re at fault. If you’re interested in coverage like this in California, you would shop for _medical payments_ coverage.
