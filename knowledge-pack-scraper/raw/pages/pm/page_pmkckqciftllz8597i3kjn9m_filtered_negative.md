![Roof conditions on a house](https://www.merlinlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/roof-conditions-1024x576.jpg)
**Florida:** Following [recent legislative updates](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/0627.7011#:~:text=\(c\)%20For%20a%20roof%20that%20is%20at,issuing%20or%20renewing%20a%20homeowner's%20insurance%20policy.), insurers are generally prohibited from refusing to issue or renew a homeowners insurance policy due to a roof’s age if it is less than 15 years old. For roofs that are 15 years or older, insurers must allow homeowners the opportunity to obtain an inspection by a licensed inspector at their own expense. If the inspection determines the roof has at least five years of useful life remaining, coverage cannot be denied based on the roof’s age.
