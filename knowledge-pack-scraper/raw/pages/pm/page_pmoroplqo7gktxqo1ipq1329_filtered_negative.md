Anyone leasing their home to the same renter for a longer period will likely need to purchase either a landlord endorsement (if their insurance policy offers one) or a [separate landlord policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-landlord-insurance "The Best Landlord Insurance Companies").
Basic short-term renters insurance protects your home and belongings from damage caused by your guests. It also provides [liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?"), which can help pay guests' medical bills if they're hurt on your property.

Airbnb offers a program called [AirCover for Hosts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-is-airbnb-insurance "Airbnb Insurance: How It Protects Hosts"), which includes $3 million of damage protection for your home and belongings and $1 million of liability coverage. This program doesn't cost anything and also includes guest screening.

Like homeowners insurance, [renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-does-renters-insurance-cover "What Does \(and Doesn't\) Renters Insurance Cover?") won't protect a renter who regularly leases all or part of their home to short-term guests. Unlike homeowners, renters also need to be aware of the terms of their lease agreement before renting out their space.
Renters who regularly sublet their apartment to vacationers should see if their [insurance company offers short-term renter coverage #companies ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/short-term-renters-insurance-basics#companies "#companies"), or purchase a separate policy to make sure they're properly protected.

The liability coverage included in your home or renters insurance policy will also travel with you when you're renting a vacation home. This can help pay for damage you cause to the rental home. **However, your policy may only cover damage to a rental home from specific hazards — usually fire, smoke or explosion.** An [umbrella policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/umbrella-insurance "What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?") may offer extended coverage, but it's best to check with your insurance agent.
Airbnb and Vrbo both offer travel insurance for guests who book a rental through their sites. You can also buy [travel insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel-insurance/average-cost-travel-insurance "Average Cost of Travel Insurance by Policy and Age") through a private insurance company, which may offer more protection, like helping to pay for medical bills if you're hurt while you're away from home.
If you're planning to stay somewhere for more than 30 days, you should consider purchasing a [traditional renters insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-renters-insurance-companies "Best Renters Insurance Companies").
The good news for renters who need insurance for a stay longer than 30 days but shorter than a year is that renters insurance is relatively inexpensive and can usually be canceled if you need to move. The [average cost of renters insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-renters-insurance "Average Cost of Renters Insurance") is $18 per month across the U.S.
People who own a vacation rental property should have [short-term renters coverage #short-term-insurance-homeowners ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/short-term-renters-insurance-basics#short-term-insurance-homeowners "#short-term-insurance-homeowners"). Some home insurance companies give you the option to add this coverage to your existing policy. If your company doesn't offer a short-term renters endorsement, you may need to buy a separate policy to make sure you're properly protected.
Homeowners and renters who regularly lease their home to short-term guests [need to have short-term renters insurance #who-needs-it ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/short-term-renters-insurance-basics#who-needs-it "#who-needs-it").
