While some companies tend to be cheaper overall, don't assume they will have the cheapest policy for you. You should always shop around and get several quotes. Comparing quotes is one of the best ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/25-year-old-car-insurance#shop "How to find cheap car insurance when you turn 25").
## Does car insurance go down at 25?
On average, 25-year-olds pay $132 less per month for full coverage compared to 20-year-olds.
**Most 25-year-old drivers have nearly a decade of driving experience.** Insurance companies view them as less likely to get into accidents than drivers who are younger. This makes car insurance less expensive for 25-year-olds than it is for younger drivers.
### Cost for full coverage car insurance by age

Full coverage rates are for an individual policy for drivers living in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, four of the most populated states in the U.S.
[Compare rates](https://quotes.valuepenguin.com?c=C20049&key=%2F25-year-old-car-insurance&product=auto&v=vp "https://quotes.valuepenguin.com?c=C20049&key=%2F25-year-old-car-insurance&product=auto&v=vp")
There's nothing special about turning 25 that makes your car insurance rates lower. Your rates usually start out higher when you're young and get lower as you gain more experience behind the wheel. In fact, rates generally continue to drop until your mid-60s, when they start to rise again.
### How much is insurance for new drivers who are 25?
**You'll pay more for car insurance if you got your license at 25.** Drivers who get their license and insurance for the first time at age 25 pay 53% more for a full coverage policy compared to 25-year-old drivers who have had their license since age 16.
**That's because car insurance companies use your driving experience alongside your age to rate your policy.** The longer you have had a license and the more driving experience you have, the lower your rates will be. But regardless of when you get your license, you'll still pay lower rates for car insurance in your 20s compared to in your teens.
Age | Experience driver rate | New driver rate | % difference  
---|---|---|---  
[18](https://www.valuepenguin.com/18-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance for 18-Year-Olds") | $532 | $699 | 31%  
[21](https://www.valuepenguin.com/21-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance for 21-Year-Olds") | $302 | $462 | 53%  
25 | $221 | $338 | 53%  
[30](https://www.valuepenguin.com/30-year-old-car-insurance "Find The Best and Cheapest Car Insurance in Your 30s") | $203 | $309 | 52%  
Experienced driver rates are for a driver who has been licensed since age 16. New driver rates are for a driver who has had their license for 1 month. All rates are full coverage.
## Car insurance rates for 25-year-old males vs. females
Men pay an average of 2% more each month for car insurance at age 25 compared to 25-year-old women.
**Men are more likely to be risky drivers compared to women.** Since that makes them more likely to get into accidents, insurance companies charge them higher rates.
For [younger drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs"), there is a noticeable difference in the cost of car insurance between men and women, with men paying more. However, that gap begins to narrow at age 25.

  * California

## Car insurance rates for 25-year-olds by state
Where you live affects how much you pay for car insurance no matter how old you are.
In Pennsylvania, for example, a 25-year-old pays an average of $193 per month for full coverage. But in Texas, the average rate is $254 per month. That's a difference of $61 per month, or $732 per year.

## How to find cheap car insurance when you turn 25
Car insurance rates are lower at 25 than they are at younger ages, but you can probably get an even cheaper policy if you follow a few strategies.
![comparison icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/compare-2)
### Shop around
[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Rates") helps you find the coverage you need at the lowest price. Sometimes the same coverage can be hundreds of dollars cheaper each month depending on the company you pick.
It's a good idea to compare customer satisfaction ratings too. Choosing a company that has good service can mean less of a hassle for you when it comes to filing a claim. You can also review the different extra coverage options and discounts.
![piggy bank icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/piggy-bank)
### Review potential discounts
Most car insurance companies offer [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to help you get a lower rate. Opting for a company that has several discounts you can get might help you get a cheaper policy.
Some common discounts for 25-year-olds include:
  * **Bundling:** If you get your [car insurance along with a renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or homeowners insurance policy from the same company, you could save on both. 
  * **Full payment:** Many companies give you a lower rate if you can pay your full six-month or annual rate in one installment. This also helps you avoid monthly billing fees. 
  * **Safety features:** If your car has anti-lock brakes or anti-theft devices, you may qualify for savings. 
  * **Defensive-driving classes:** Companies may reward you for taking a safe- or defensive-driving course. 


![car icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/car)
### Drive safely
Although safe driving won't lower your rate immediately, it can help you keep your costs down over time. When you cause accidents or get tickets, your car insurance rate goes up. Practicing safe driving habits helps you avoid these rate increases, which keeps your rates down in the long run.

## Methodology
ValuePenguin got quotes from  four of the most populated states in the U.S. to find the average cost for full coverage and minimum coverage car insurance for 25-year-olds.

  * **Bodily injury liability:** $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident 
  * **Property damage liability:** $25,000 per accident 
  * **Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury:** $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident 
  * **Personal injury protection (PIP):** Minimum, when required by state 
  * **Medical payments:** $5,000 
  * **Comprehensive and collision deductible:** $500 deductible 


ValuePenguin reviewed seven major insurance companies for this analysis. Some of the companies were not available in all four states.
