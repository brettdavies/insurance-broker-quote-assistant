While some companies tend to be cheaper overall, don't assume they will have the cheapest policy for you. You should always shop around and get several quotes. Comparing quotes is one of the best ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/25-year-old-car-insurance#shop "How to find cheap car insurance when you turn 25").

**Men are more likely to be risky drivers compared to women.** Since that makes them more likely to get into accidents, insurance companies charge them higher rates.
For [younger drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs"), there is a noticeable difference in the cost of car insurance between men and women, with men paying more. However, that gap begins to narrow at age 25.

[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Rates") helps you find the coverage you need at the lowest price. Sometimes the same coverage can be hundreds of dollars cheaper each month depending on the company you pick.
Most car insurance companies offer [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to help you get a lower rate. Opting for a company that has several discounts you can get might help you get a cheaper policy.
* **Bundling:** If you get your [car insurance along with a renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or homeowners insurance policy from the same company, you could save on both.
