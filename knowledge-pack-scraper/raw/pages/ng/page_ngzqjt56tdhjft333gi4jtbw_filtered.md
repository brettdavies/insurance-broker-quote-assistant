### GEICO vs. Allstate: rates for high-risk drivers

If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, or [DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving résumé, GEICO could be a better choice than Allstate. Each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.

##### RATES BY CITATION: ALLSTATE VS. GEICO

| **Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $3,006 |
| At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $2,290 |
| DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $3,637 |
| Reckless driving | $2,238 | $3,388 |
| Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $2,256 |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### GEICO vs. Allstate: rates by age

Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.

As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Allstate: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $2,934, compared to Allstate.

##### RATES BY AGE: ALLSTATE VS. GEICO

| **Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Teens** | $3,508 | $6,442 |
| **20s** | $1,438 | $2,636 |
| **30s** | $1,218 | $2,636 |
| **40s** | $1,189 | $1,912 |
| **50s** | $1,160 | $1,893 |
| **60s** | $1,065 | $1,768 |

Costs aside, GEICO and Allstate both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and [compare rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before making a decision.

## Telematics options: GEICO vs. Allstate

GEICO and Allstate both offer [telematics car insurance programs](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) that can be beneficial to certain types of drivers. Have a look at the comparison below to see if one stands out as a better option for your insurance needs.

![GEICO logo]()

GEICO DriveEasy

[GEICO Drive Easy Pro](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/geico-driveeasy/) is an app that tracks your driving habits to better assess your level of risk. For safe drivers, this can sometimes result in cheaper rates. Currently, the app is rated on app stores at 3.5 out of 5 stars (both Google Play and the Apple Store).

![Allstate Drivewise]()

Allstate Drivewise

This telematics program uses a mobile app to track your driving behavior, possibly leading to discounts for safe motorists. Drivers receive 3% cashback for signing up for Drivewise. The app-based program can be used by both policyholders and "non-customers" alike to view driving data and receive feedback.

![Allstate milewise]()

Allstate Milewise

Milewise is a newer program that offers [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/). This type of coverage could benefit low-mileage drivers in particular as your rates are based on the number of miles that you drive. These miles are tracked by a plug-in device. While not available in every state, Allstate has plans to continue expansion in an effort to gain more users.

### Zebra tip: Explore Allstate for telematics offerings

---

While GEICO boasts great online reviews overall, their telematics app suffers lower scores across multiple platforms. Furthermore, Allstate has more telematics options overall. The company's dedicated pay-by-the-mile plan, Milewise, is a great option for low-mileage drivers.

## Roadside assistance: GEICO vs. Allstate

No one wants to be caught on the side of the road after a breakdown. Check out the different [roadside assistance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) packages offered by both GEICO and Allstate below.

##### GEICO

GEICO's roadside assistance offers the following:

* Towing
* Jump starts
* Tire changes (when you have a spare)
* Up to $100 for lockout services
* Fuel delivery
* Winching for stuck vehicles (depending on severity)

##### Allstate

Allstate offers three types of roadside service to customers with and without an Allstate insurance plan. Annual roadside membership plans and pay-per-use plans are available, and if you have Allstate insurance, you can add roadside coverage to your policy. The pay-per-use coverage allows you to pay only for service when you need it (typically with a charge of $119 per tow and $84 for other services like tire changes, jump starts, fuel delivery and locksmith services).

## GEICO vs. Allstate: home insurance

While both companies have a huge presence in the auto insurance industry, the same goes for [homeowners coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/). GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner. That said, each company has unique [coverage options](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/) and [price points](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/). See our comparison to find out which company might be the best fit for your home insurance needs.

### Which company comes out on top?

#### Allstate

---

Both GEICO and Allstate can pair customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Allstate's homeowners policies offer lower rates for homeowners policies and a wide array of dicount options. While both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance, Allstate is able to offer a similar scope of coverages with more discount opportunities and slightly lower premiums.

---

### GEICO vs. Allstate: home insurance rate comparison

Allstate's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is **$1,594**. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.

Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will place a different weight upon factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.

![Cheapest average rates]()

Cheapest average rates

Based on the data we have available, **Allstate has the cheaper home insurance rates at around $118 per month**.
