A [minimum-coverage policy](/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") with the discount costs **$71 per month**, or $848 per year. That amounts to a 17% savings for good students.

## How do I get a good student discount?

The most important part to getting a good student discount is making sure your grades are high enough. The process is straightforward.

### 1. Get good grades

To qualify for a good student discount, you need to have a **B average or better** or be in the **top 20% of your class**. This is usually based on your cumulative transcript, so don't worry about one subpar semester.

Another option is to score in the top 20% nationally on one of several standardized tests.

**Full list of requirements for a good student discount**:

* Age: 16–25
* Single
* Full-time enrolled in high school, college or homeschooling
* One of the following:

  + B or 3.0 GPA or top 20% of your class
  + Rank in the top 20% on the ACT, SAT, PSAT, TAP, PACT, California Achievement Test or Iowa Test of Basic Skills

### 2. Shop around for quotes

Many companies give discounts for good grades. The process of finding out your discount is just like getting any other auto insurance quote. Just keep an eye out for a "good student" checkbox on the form.

**Companies with good student discounts include**:

* [Allstate](/allstate-auto-insurance-review "Allstate Insurance Review")
* [American Family Insurance](/american-family-insurance-review "American Family Insurance Review")
* [Country Financial](/country-financial-insurance-review "Country Financial Insurance Review")
* [Farm Bureau](/farm-bureau-insurance-review "Farm Bureau Insurance Review")

* [Farmers](/farmers-insurance-review "Farmers Insurance Review")
* [Geico](/geico-insurance-review "Geico Insurance Review")
* [Liberty Mutual](/liberty-mutual-insurance-review "Liberty Mutual Insurance Review")
* [Nationwide](/nationwide-insurance-review "Nationwide Insurance Review")

* [Progressive](/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive Insurance Review")
* [State Farm](/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review")
* [Travelers](/travelers-insurance-review "Travelers Insurance Review")
* [USAA](/usaa-insurance-review "USAA Insurance Review")

Good student discounts may not be available in all locations or to all students.

Keep in mind, a large discount doesn't necessarily mean the cheapest car insurance. Although Allstate has the biggest student discount, at around 20%, the total rate is still twice as high as the cheapest option overall, State Farm.

USAA is only available to active-duty military, veterans, and their family members.

### 3. Submit proof of your good grades

After you've found the best price and applied for insurance, you'll need to submit proof that you're enrolled in school full time and getting good grades. **Often, this will be a copy of your most recent high school or college transcript**, but requirements vary by company.

If you're using a standardized test to qualify, you can submit an official printout of your score and percentile. Freshmen in high school may have to wait for a report card, but anyone else should be able to apply at any point.

#### Can I get a good student discount if I'm homeschooled?

Things are a little trickier for homeschooled students. It says in Allstate's "Good Student Discount" section that kids who are homeschooled qualify for the discount. Geico and State Farm make no mention of homeschooling, though.

**Homeschooled students will have to ask the company directly and see if there are specific requirements.** A standardized test may be the only way for a homeschooled student to get the discount.

For some companies, including State Farm, you don't even have to be enrolled in college to earn a good student discount. If you have completed a two- or four-year degree and are under 25, a school transcript can earn you the discount.

## Other car insurance discounts for students

A good student discount isn't the only way for students to [save on car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tips-save-car-insurance "https://www.valuepenguin.com/tips-save-car-insurance").

* Many companies have discounts for taking a **[safe driving course](/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount")**, especially for teens and young adults. The course generally reviews and expands on what's covered in driver's education.
* If you're going out of state for school and won't be using your parents' car while you're away, you can usually get an **away at school discount**. If you're in another state for most of the year and likely to do little or no driving, you're a much lower risk.
* Finally, while it isn't technically a discount, one of the best ways for a teen or college student to save money on car insurance **[is to be added onto a parent's car insurance policy](/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers#parents "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens (and Their Parents)")**. An 18-year-old man will save around 62% on car insurance by sharing a policy with two parents.
