**State Farm** has the cheapest car insurance overall for good students. A [minimum-coverage policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?") with the discount costs **$71 per month**, or $848 per year. That amounts to a 17% savings for good students.

* Many companies have discounts for taking a **[safe driving course](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount")**, especially for teens and young adults. The course generally reviews and expands on what's covered in driver's education.
* Finally, while it isn't technically a discount, one of the best ways for a teen or college student to save money on car insurance **[is to be added onto a parent's car insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers#parents "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens \(and Their Parents\)")**. An 18-year-old man will save around 62% on car insurance by sharing a policy with two parents.
Yes, [Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "Progressive Insurance Review") offers a discount for students under 23 with a B average or better. The company's average good student discount starts at 5%.
Good students can save an average of 17% on minimum coverage with [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review"). They also have the cheapest car insurance rate for students — $156 per month for minimum coverage. This includes a good student discount.
[USAA](https://www.valuepenguin.com/usaa-insurance-review "USAA Insurance Rfeview") offers the smallest good student discount, at 5%. But it's still the second-cheapest company for minimum-coverage insurance. Good students can expect to pay around $92 per month.
