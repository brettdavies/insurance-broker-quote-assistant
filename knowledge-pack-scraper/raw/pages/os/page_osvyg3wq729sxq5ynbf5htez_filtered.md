* Bodily injury liability: $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $25,000
* Uninsured motorist: $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident, where required by law
* Personal injury protection: Minimum limits, where required by law
* Collision: $500 deductible
* Comprehensive: $500 deductible

Our team of insurance experts rated insurance companies based on several categories. These categories include average rates, discounts, coverage options, third-party customer service ratings and app/website experience. We weighted these categories based on what customers value in an insurance company.

For third-party customer service ratings, we included complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and financial strength ratings from AM Best. NAIC complaint index scores are used to determine how satisfied customers are with their claims, while financial strength ratings from AM Best reflect the ability to pay out claims.
