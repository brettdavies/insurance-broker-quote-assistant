The average home insurance rate in New York City is $2,257 per year for a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage and a $1,000 deductible — only slightly cheaper than the national average of $2,377.

But the city does experience flooding, thunderstorms, and even the tail-end of some hurricanes, which insurers consider when setting rates.[[1]](#cite-1) This doesn’t mean you can’t still find affordable home insurance coverage in New York City, though.

## How to get cheap homeowners insurance in New York City

You can use a few tips to find cheap home insurance in New York City:[[3]](#cite-3)

* [**Compare home insurance quotes**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/)**.** Comparing quotes from multiple insurers is the best way to save money on your home insurance policy. Insurance companies consider rating factors uniquely, so you should get a homeowners insurance quote from at least three to find the best coverage.
* [**Apply for discounts**](/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-discounts/)**.** Discounts are a great way to save money on your home insurance policy. Most insurance companies offer a wide variety of home insurance discounts — just ask which they carry. Bundling your auto insurance with home insurance is a very common discount that could save you hundreds of dollars per year.
* [**Increase your deductible**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-insurance-deductible/)**.** Increasing your home insurance deductible immediately lowers your premiums, but you’ll have higher out-of-pocket expenses if there’s a claim. Be sure you can afford to pay a higher deductible before you increase it.

### New York homeowners insurance rates by city

New York home insurance costs can even vary by ZIP code. Different areas of New York City are susceptible to different risks. For example, certain parts of the city may experience higher rates of theft or vandalism, so rates will be higher there, while New Yorkers who live next to a fire station will pay lower rates.

## How much homeowners insurance do you need in New York City?

Though New York state doesn’t require its residents to carry homeowners insurance, it’s a very good idea to have it.[[4]](#cite-4) Home repairs and replacement costs can be devastatingly expensive for homeowners without financial assistance from an insurance company. Most mortgage lenders will require you to carry a home insurance policy anyway, so it’s worth knowing what coverage you need.

The 80/20 rule is a good guideline to follow when it comes to home insurance. You should buy coverage equal to or greater than 80% of your home’s replacement cost. No matter how much dwelling coverage you go with, it’s essential to know [**what your home insurance policy covers**](/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/).

### What are some of the biggest risks when owning a home in New York City?

The following natural disasters pose the biggest risks to homes in New York City:

* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/56dd10ca36/climate-change-96x96-yellow_013-flood.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/56dd10ca36/climate-change-96x96-yellow_013-flood.svg)

  #### Flooding

  New York City is no stranger to floods — 30.6% of homes in the city are at risk for flooding over the next 30 years, according to Risk Factor. Unfortunately, a standard home insurance policy doesn’t cover flood damage. You’ll have to purchase a separate policy through the [**National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) or buy private flood insurance.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/68ed522f01/windstorm-and-hail.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/68ed522f01/windstorm-and-hail.svg)

  #### Hurricanes

  Though New York City doesn’t typically take the brunt of hurricanes, they, along with other coastal storms, can do serious damage to the city and its homes. Home insurance typically covers these damages, though, which often are the result of high winds.
* ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/a72798aa06/weather-96x96-green_016-snow.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/a72798aa06/weather-96x96-green_016-snow.svg)

  #### Snowstorms

  New York City winters have been less intense in recent years, but the city still experiences heavy snowfall from time to time, which can severely damage homes and roofs.[[5]](#cite-5) Home insurance covers most of these damages, but you may want to check with your insurer to see exactly what it covers.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Home insurance in New York City costs $2,257 per year for a policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage and a $1,000 deductible, according to Insurify data. Your rate will depend on many factors, including your ZIP code, age of your home, square footage of your home, and the coverage levels you choose.

Ocean Harbor Casualty has the cheapest homeowners insurance in New York City, with premiums of $896 per year. Narragansett Bay and State Farm also offer affordable coverage, with respective annual premiums of $1,457 and $1,495.

No. New York City doesn’t require homeowners insurance, but your lender will require it if you have a mortgage on your home. Without a home insurance policy in place, you’d be on the hook financially if something damaged or destroyed your home and you had to make costly repairs or rebuild.
