Gotta call State Farm at some point. This can be solved over the phone in minutes

Then she, of all people, should know how to read your policy. If State Farm has an accident forgiveness feature it would be listed in the policy for an appropriate premium charge.
If it's not listed then there isn't any.

Check your policy documents. The existence of said program could and likely does vary from state to state, and even may from customer to customer.
Or in other words, nobody here can tell you.

Definitely depends on the state. I write in 3 states and a 10 year accident free discount would also give you accident forgiveness (in the states I write in). Basically, you wouldn't be surcharged for the accident, and they would still allow you to keep the 10 year accident free discount. But, the next at-fault, you'd be demoted back to having no accident free discounts. Now, we use a new system and accident free discounts and accident forgiveness are a thing of the past unfortunately. Just call your agent and see if you have it.

Thank you. I had an issue with them re homeowner's that was contentious although they eventually agreed so I wanted to have some background before I called on Monday.

In Washington, you can get a Good Driving Record discount with a clean record. In 3 years, a 3 year loss free discount, then a 5%, and after 10 years a 10 year loss free discount with accident forgiveness (which only applies to your first accident - a second at-fault accident means both accidents apply). This applies per policy, so with multiple cars, you have multiple policies and they may well have different origin dates/discounts. (Note, some states have single policies with multiple vehicles and I cannot speak for those states.)

Have not had an accident since the early 80s. I think I am just going to take care of the cost myself, not sure I want an accident on my record.

I'm wondering this. Backed into someone at the grocery store it was equally our fault lol she pulled behind me the same instant I backed up, and Ive been with State farm 15 years no accident in PA. Hoping we don't have to go thru insurance but if so I was hoping since I've paid a billion dollars into it it won't go up lol

My agent said State Farm In PA has a forgiveness policy. It is my understanding that is varies by state.
