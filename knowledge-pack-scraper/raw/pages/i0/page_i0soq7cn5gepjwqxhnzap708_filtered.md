What’s new with Texas Farm Bureau Insurance?

AM Best has placed the company [under review with negative implications](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/am-best-places-credit-ratings-165100113.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI3O1JSfrcwQI_dlvhSyAVBmdKJhvN_OiYXIbDDe3jM8O6d0670gA-FXn1AXdGTLGZ9Aj4kQvaNU0-RA28GBXAA-RZJ5ChipRUtsTMNnY0e7sKoLHQ_Hrxi9AdaUoiCHyZOcxa8AcLh9iwdvqtb1mwu0jQ-g6bD1bgSHGf-88QBK) due to a decrease in its surplus. Existing or future policyholders may want to monitor the situation to ensure the company maintains a strong financial outlook.

## Texas Farm Bureau car insurance review

Texas Farm Bureau has offered insurance products to Texans [since 1952](https://www.txfb-ins.com/about-us). Now headquartered in Waco, Texas, the carrier has grown to include more than 850 local agents, 300 claims personnel and 300 offices across the Lone Star State. Since Texas Farm Bureau does the bulk of its business via local agencies, this carrier could be optimal for those who prefer the personalized service that an in-person insurance experience may provide.

The company is part of the [American Farm Bureau Federation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/farm-bureau/) and requires an annual membership fee, although the rate varies depending on where you reside. Membership is open to all Texas residents and includes several benefits, including discounts on products and services as well as access to insurance policies. Many states across the country have their own Farm Bureau agencies, but Texas Farm Bureau insurance is only available in Texas.

Texas Farm Bureau offers a full line of auto insurance coverage, from the minimum liability coverage needed to drive legally in Texas to a [full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) policy with add-ons, including rental reimbursement, roadside assistance and ridesharing coverage. Although Texas Farm Bureau’s [auto endorsement options](https://txfb-ins.com/insurance/auto) may not be as robust as some carriers, it also offers death indemnity coverage, which is not always available with other providers. This optional coverage pays a death benefit to a beneficiary or beneficiaries should you die as a result of a qualifying accident in your vehicle.

### Pros and cons of Texas Farm Bureau car insurance

Finding the [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) may not always be easy, but Bankrate’s insurance editorial team is here to help. Creating a list of pros and cons may help you determine if a specific provider can meet your individualized needs.

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Earned third place for overall customer satisfaction in Texas in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Insurance Study

### Texas Farm Bureau car insurance cost

Bankrate analyzed proprietary premium data from Quadrant Information Services, and according to our research, the national [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) is $2,671 per year for a full coverage policy and $806 for a minimum coverage policy. However, your rates may be more or less than the average, as auto insurance is highly personalized. Car insurance companies may use a variety of [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) to determine how much to charge for coverage, including your location, vehicle, age and in some states (including Texas), your credit information.

Premium data for Texas Farm Bureau car insurance is unavailable, so the best way to [compare rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) may be to request a quote online, in person or over the phone.

### Texas Farm Bureau customer satisfaction

Although affordable rates may be essential when gathering [insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), it’s not the only consideration for many customers. For some, customer satisfaction is just as important as cheap premiums. For this reason, Bankrate reviews a variety of metrics to analyze an insurance company’s customer satisfaction. Among these metrics are third-party scores issued by [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/); however, given its availability, J.D. Power only rates Texas Farm Bureau in its surveys that break down satisfaction by region and not in national studies.

The company does have an excellent financial strength rating with [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), however, which indicates it has met its claims obligations in the past. As we mentioned earlier in this article, though, that rating is currently under review, so current future policyholders may want to keep an eye on its status to see if AM Best changes its rating.

#### Texas Farm Bureau auto claims satisfaction

Auto customer satisfaction is where Texas Farm Bureau truly shines. The company scored first place with a strong 824 points out of 1,000 for overall customer satisfaction in the Texas region during the [J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-auto-insurance-study). It is not rated in the claims satisfaction survey because of its small service area. It has historically performed well in the J.D. Power Auto Insurance Study, however, indicating that its customers are generally happy with the service it provides.

#### Texas Farm Bureau auto insurance customer complaints

Additionally, we study where a company lands on the NAIC Customer Complaint Index. To understand this data, know that the NAIC compiles complaints that policyholders lodge against a company and converts the number of complaints into an index score. A company with an average amount of complaints for its size will have an index of 1.00. A company with an index higher than that receives more complaints on average, while an index lower than 1.00 indicates fewer complaints than average.

### Texas Farm Bureau car insurance discounts

Discount information is limited on Texas Farm Bureau’s website, but it does list a few opportunities that may help you [save on your car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/), including:

* **Multi-vehicle discount**: If you insure more than one vehicle with Texas Farm Bureau, you could qualify for additional savings.
* **Vehicle safety discount**: This discount may apply for drivers with vehicles equipped with safety features, such as curtain airbags and an anti-theft system.
* **Claims-free discount:** If you maintain a claims-free record for a certain number of years, you may earn a discount for good driving.

For more information regarding discount eligibility and savings amounts, please contact a Texas Farm Bureau agent.

## Texas Farm Bureau home insurance review

According to our analysis, Texas Farm Bureau could be best for Texans looking for one of the average [cheapest homeowners insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/) who prefer to do business in person with an agent.

Homeowners insurance with Texas Farm Bureau comes with many of the [standard coverage types](https://txfb-ins.com/insurance/home) you’d expect, such as dwelling, liability and personal property. To find out if the company offers any additional endorsement options, you will need to reach out to Farm Bureau directly — the company’s website does not list any coverage options outside of those that come standard with a typical homeowners policy.

### Pros and cons of Texas Farm Bureau home insurance

When [comparing home insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/), a pros and cons list may help you narrow down your options. To do this, you may find it helpful to write down what you like about a company’s offerings and where they might fall short.

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

### Texas Farm Bureau home insurance cost

Bankrate took a deep dive into the [cost of homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) for 2024 and based on our research, the national average rate for $300,000 in dwelling coverage is $2,408 per year. On the other hand, Texas Farm Bureau comes in at an average of $3,619 per year. While Texas Farm Bureau is 49 percent more than the national average, it is 7 percent less than the average in Texas. Since Texas Farm Bureau is only available in Texas, it may be a solid and cost-effective option for many Texas policyholders.

It's important to note that your actual homeowners insurance premium will vary based on your [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/), such as your home's age, location and your claims history.

#### Compare Texas Farm Bureau homeowners insurance rates

Home insurance rates vary significantly between carriers, even within the same state. Each insurance company has its own underwriting guidelines, risk tolerance level and coverage options and discounts. These variables mean that not one carrier is perfect for every homeowner and comparing premiums, coverage types and discounts amongst multiple companies can help you secure the best home insurance for your needs.

### Texas Farm Bureau customer satisfaction

Understanding how other policyholders feel about their insurance company can help you decide which carrier suits you best. J.D. Power did not rate Texas Farm Bureau since it is a regional carrier and the study is geared toward insurers with national availability. This does not reflect the quality of service that Texas Farm Bureau provides.

#### Texas Farm Bureau home insurance customer complaints

Texas Farm Bureau scores well below the industry average. This low index score may indicate that the company’s homeowners insurance customers are generally satisfied with their experience.

## Is the Texas Farm Bureau a good insurance company?

Whether or not Texas Farm Bureau is a good company likely depends on you and your needs. If you live in Texas, are looking for average cheap homeowners insurance and don’t mind paying an annual membership fee (which also grants access to additional savings and benefits), then Texas Farm Bureau could be the company for you.

This carrier could also be an excellent choice for people who feel passionately about farming and ranching issues, since the Texas Farm Bureau advocates for this demographic. However, better options may be available if you prefer to handle your insurance policies digitally via a mobile app and don’t enjoy an in-person agency experience. To find out if the Texas Farm Bureau could meet your needs, the best course of action may be to call an agent and request a quote.

### What are real-life customers saying about the Texas Farm Bureau?

Reading customer reviews is one way to better understand the customer experience with the Texas Farm Bureau. Review sites and online forums such as Reddit and Yelp offer a space for customers to share their experiences and for other users to add comments. Keep in mind that since Texas Farm Bureau has local agents, some reviews may be about the company in general or a specific agent. Additionally, since Texas Farm Bureau is a super-regional carrier, there isn’t a plethora of reviews to read.

#### Reddit

The Texas Farm Bureau reviews on Reddit tend to be older but focus on how affordable of a carrier it is compared to other insurance companies. One older comment, which we will include below, highlights a situation unique to the Texas Farm Bureau. This carrier may report insurance information differently than other carriers, which could be problematic when it's time to find a different company.

Texas Farm Bureau: Prior insurance reporting

“Texas insurance agent here.The only thing I know about Texas Farm Bureau is that they don't report to the same insurance database that everyone else does. So, when I go to quote someone's insurance and they have Texas Farm Bureau, it doesn't pull up any previous insurance information. This can be slightly problematic when it comes to leaving Texas Farm Bureau, because many insurance carriers will initially rate based on previously available insurance information, and you might see elevated rates because it might look like you don't have insurance when you do. That issue is generally solved by providing a Letter of Experience, however.”

#### Yelp

There are several threads on Yelp for different Texas Farm Bureau agencies but again, most of the reviews are more than a year old. The common theme on Yelp is that policyholders are unhappy with the rising costs, customer service and claims service they receive and miscommunication about coverage is mentioned a few times. This highlights how important it is to feel comfortable with the company and the local agent since they are who you will interact with the most.

Texas Farm Bureau: claims experience

“I have multiple policies, 4 auto policies, term and whole life policies and also renters insurance. I have never filed a claim with them and our house flooded over the weekend. I texted my agent on monday and she said she believed it was covered and to call the office to start the claim. So I went through the whole process and told the girl at the office, the claims department and gave a statement to the adjuster. Again I told them exactly what happened. They still proceeded to waste 30 minutes of my time on the phone along with having my wife stay home to wait on them to come take pictures, just to tell me flood damage isn't covered when they could've told me up front when I first spoke to them and it wouldn't have wasted anymore of anyone's time. Also when I got the policy I was not offered flood coverage nor was I made aware in anyway that it was something separate. Poor service all the way around if you ask me.”

## **Frequently asked questions about Texas Farm Bureau**

* ### Why doesn’t this company have a Bankrate Score?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Ideally, Bankrate would have a Bankrates Score for every carrier that we review. However, some carriers that are super-regional or have several underwriting agencies behind make creating a score more challenging. Since J.D. Power doesn’t rank Texas Farm Bureau in several categories and the customer service experience is connected more to the agent than the carrier itself, we cannot accurately score this carrier at this time.

* ###### Why is Texas Farm Bureaus’ Insurance so cheap?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Texas Farm Bureau tends to charge premiums much lower than its competitors because you must pay membership dues to be able to buy insurance. The true cost is a bit higher than the simple cost of coverage because of those dues.
