## Geico Review
Geico sells homeowners and renters insurance to protect your private residence and personal belongings.
A Geico homeowners insurance policy purchased is underwritten and serviced by one of its non-affiliated insurance partners. While Geico sells the policy, your actual coverage is provided by a third-party insurer who manages and underwrites your policy.
It provides some support services as well, such as facilitating the quote and sign-up process and providing a point of contact for customers. Policyholders can manage their policy and make premium payments online through Geico's website or mobile app.
Additionally, customers can earn a bundling discount for [purchasing home and auto insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles) through Geico, even if it's not part of the servicing or underwriting of the homeowners insurance policy.
## Bottom Line
Geico homeowners insurance is a good choice for customers who want to bundle their home and auto insurance, as well as those who may be having trouble finding a homeowners insurance company in high-risk states.
It offers discounts for bundling home and auto coverage, even though its homeowners insurance coverage is handled by non-affiliated insurance partners, making this a good way to save money on your insurance.
Home insurance policies, premiums, and customization options sold through Geico will vary depending on which of their insurance partners underwrites your coverage.

## What Does Geico Homeowners Insurance Cover?
Because Geico homeowners insurance is underwritten by other insurance providers, basic coverage and options will vary. However, most home insurance policies break down into the following [_types of coverage_](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover):
* **Dwelling**: Dwelling coverage pays for damage to the physical structure of your home after a covered loss, as well as any attached features, like a garage or a deck. [Dwelling coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-insurance) is the biggest portion of your homeowners insurance policy and is used to set the amount of coverage you have for some of the other portions of your policy.
* **Other structures**: Set at 10% of your dwelling coverage, other structures coverage pays to repair or rebuild free-standing structures on your property, like a shed, fence, or guest house.
* **Personal property**: Set at 50% to 70% of your dwelling coverage limit, [personal property coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-insurance) pays to replace your personal property, like furniture and appliances, if it is damaged by a covered peril.
* **Liability**: [Liability coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance) pays for other people’s medical bills and legal expenses if you’re found legally responsible for the damage caused. It can also cover legal fees and settlements if you're found liable.
* **Loss of use**: Loss of use coverage pays for expenses incurred if you can’t live in your home after a covered loss, such as a hotel.
* **Medical expenses**: Typically limited to $1,000 to $5,000, medical expenses coverage pays for other people's medical bills from minor injuries on your property, regardless of who’s at fault. For example, if your neighbor trips over a crack in the sidewalk in front of your house, medical expenses coverage could pay for those bills.
## Additional Options Offered by Geico Homeowners Insurance
Most home insurance companies offer [scheduled personal property](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-scheduled-personal-property-coverage) coverage for items that are commonly excluded or have limited coverage available. These endorsements provide coverage for theft, loss, or damage to high-value items, including:
* Expensive jewelry, silverware, and gold
* Firearms
* Musical instruments and sports equipment
* Fine art and coin collections
Endorsements can vary based on your insurer, location, and your individual needs.
## What Does Geico Homeowners Insurance Not Cover?
Like most insurance companies, Geico and its non-affiliate insurance partners exclude certain perils from coverage, including [flood](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance), [earthquake](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-earthquake-insurance), wear and tear, negligence, pests/insects, acts of war, and intentional loss.
Homeowners insurance [policy exclusions ](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-exclusions)may vary based on a number of factors, including state laws, regulations, and internal company policies. You may be able to purchase endorsements, add-ons, or additional policies to cover excluded perils, like flood insurance or earthquake insurance.
## How Much Does Geico’s Homeowners Insurance Cost?
Because Geico doesn’t offer homeowners insurance directly through the company, there are no sample rates available, but the cost of a policy will depend on several factors, including:
* **Coverage amounts**: Higher levels of coverage provide more robust protection in an emergency, but they will be more expensive than lower amounts of coverage.
* **Location**: Every state has laws and regulations regarding homeowners insurance, which will impact rates. And homeowners in states that are impacted more by extreme weather, such as hurricanes and wildfires, will pay higher rates for coverage than those in states that have fewer extreme weather events.
* **Home condition**: Older homes or homes that are in need of repair will have higher rates than newer homes that are in excellent condition.
* **Home features**: Some home features, like security systems and carbon monoxide detectors, will help you save money on your homeowners insurance. Other features, like trampolines and swimming pools, may cause your rates to go up.
* **Claims history**: You may face higher rates if you have prior claims on your record.
* **Property loss history**: Previous losses or claims at your address can also increase your insurance rates, even if those claims were filed by a previous resident.
* **Credit**: In most states, insurance companies are allowed to consider your credit-based insurance score when setting your insurance rates.
The best way to find out exactly how much it will cost to purchase homeowners insurance through Geico is to call the company at (800) 241-8098 [for a quote](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/quotes).
