If you have a history of car accidents, chances are you’ll have higher minimum requirements. The most common is the [bodily injury liability (BIL)](https://www.autoinsurance.org/bodily-injury-liability-insurance/ "Bodily Injury Liability (BIL) Auto Insurance (2024)") requirement in Florida.

You might see Florida liability requirements written as 10/20/10. This includes the BIL requirements.  The 10/20/10 insurance in Florida refers to:

* $10,000 in BIL per driver
* $20,000 in BIL per accident
* $10,000 in PDL

When would you be required to have bodily injury liability insurance in Florida? Remember, the law only requires BIL for high-risk drivers. Otherwise, you carry 10/10 minimums for the $10,000 in PIP and PDL limits you must have.

> Florida car insurance laws require continuous coverage. Even if your vehicle is inoperable, you must have an up-to-date insurance policy until you surrender the license plate.

Some drivers can opt out of coverage and choose to be self-insured instead. You must apply and qualify for self-insurance through the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

## Penalties for Driving Without Insurance in FL

What happens if auto insurance lapses in Florida? Driving without car insurance can result in several penalties, including fines:

* **Fines**: Fines range from $150 to $500, depending on the number of offenses.
* **Reinstatement Fees**: The fee is $150 for the first offense, $250 for the second, and $500 for subsequent offenses within three years.

And once your license is reinstated, your insurance premiums are likely to increase due to the lapse in coverage.

## Additional Coverage Options in Florida

While Florida’s minimum auto insurance requirements may seem sufficient, they often leave drivers exposed to significant financial risks. To enhance your protection, consider these coverage options:

* [**Comprehensive and Collision Insurance**](https://www.autoinsurance.org/what-is-the-difference-between-collision-and-comprehensive-auto-insurance/): This type of coverage protects your vehicle from damage due to accidents, theft, or natural disasters. Comprehensive insurance covers non-collision incidents, while collision insurance pays for damages resulting from accidents.
* **Bodily Injury Liability (BIL)**: Although not required for all drivers, carrying BIL can help cover medical expenses and legal costs if you are found responsible for injuries in an accident.
* **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage**: This coverage provides financial protection if you’re involved in an accident with a driver who lacks adequate insurance. It can help cover medical bills and damages that exceed the at-fault driver’s policy limits.
* [**Medical Payments Coverage (MedPay)**](https://www.autoinsurance.org/do-i-need-medical-payment-coverage-on-my-car-insurance/): MedPay can help cover medical expenses for you and your passengers, regardless of fault, making it a valuable addition to your policy.

Exploring these options can provide peace of mind and greater financial security while on the road. Choosing the cheapest companies for your auto insurance can significantly reduce your overall costs, but it’s essential to balance affordability with adequate coverage.

![Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements: USAA](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201181%20676'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements: USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Screenshot-2024-09-06-12.21.33-PM.png)

By comparing quotes from various companies, you can find a policy that fits your budget without sacrificing necessary coverage, ensuring you’re well protected against unexpected incidents.

### Understanding Florida Auto Insurance

What is the minimum auto insurance required in Florida? Individual drivers must carry personal injury protection (PIP) to pay for their medical costs after an accident.

![ Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements: Personal Injury Protection Definition Card")![ Personal Injury Protection Definition Card: Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Personal-Injury-Protection-4.png "Florida Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements: Personal Injury Protection Definition Card")

The PIP car insurance requirements in Florida are designed to cover 80% of these costs, while the other required policies cover damages you cause in a collision.

Here is a complete list of Florida minimum requirements for auto insurance:

* **PIP Insurance:** Covers a portion of medical bills and emergency treatment for you and your passengers if you suffer an injury in the crash
* **PDL Insurance:** Pays for property damage you cause in an auto accident or collision. Does not protect your personal vehicle.
* **BIL Insurance:** Covers medical bills for any injury you cause to other drivers and passengers in a collision.

Florida is a no-fault insurance state. This means each driver is responsible for their own injuries and property damage no matter who or what caused the collision.

## FL Auto Insurance Laws: New in the State

Current Florida law requires 10/10 in personal injury and property damage protection, although state representatives have tried to pass different legislation aimed at overhauling auto insurance requirements in Florida.

Most recently, SB54 tried to eliminate the no-fault system and replace PIP and PDL insurance in Florida with traditional 25/50/10 liability limits.

If the bill had passed, the new Florida car insurance laws would have also included a mandatory $5,000 in medical payments coverage (MedPay). However, Governor DeSantis vetoed the new law in 2022 worrying it would increase Florida required auto insurance costs and lead to more uninsured drivers.
