## What is landlord insurance?

Landlord insurance, as the name suggests, covers risk to a property you own and rent out. It works similarly to a standard [homeowners insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) and includes many of the same coverage options, with some key differences. Landlord insurance provides coverage if your property is damaged from covered perils, such as fire and windstorm damage. However, it does not cover tenant belongings within the home. For that, your tenants need [renters insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-renters-insurance-companies/). Although coverage types may vary by carrier, many landlord insurance policies include loss of rent coverage to soften the blow of lost rental income while a home is uninhabitable due to a covered loss.

Like homeowners insurance, landlord insurance is usually required if your tenant-occupied property has a mortgage. Even if your home is paid off, it may be worth having this coverage to avoid paying out of pocket to rebuild or repair your home should you incur substantial property damage.

## How to find the best cheap landlord insurance

The best landlord insurance for you may vary based on your property type, location, budget and personal preferences. For example, landlords with multiple properties may appreciate a carrier with an easy-to-use mobile app to easily manage their policies virtually. Landlords with older rental properties may want a carrier that offers building code coverage to financially protect their property while the home is under construction to bring it up to code. Here are some tactics to find the best cheap landlord insurance for you:

* **Consider coverage options:** Included coverage types and available endorsements may vary between companies. Considering your coverage needs and comparing available options from different carriers may help you narrow down which companies might meet your needs.
* **Compare quotes:** The cost of your landlord insurance may vary based on your property’s characteristics, your personal rating factors, your coverage selections and more. When gathering and comparing quotes, make sure you are asking for the same types and levels of coverage from each insurer (or as close as possible) so you can make an apples-to-apples price comparison.
* **Check for discounts:** Reviewing [potential discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) may reveal additional savings opportunities with each carrier. You might also qualify for bundling or loyalty discounts if you use the same company for both your primary residence and your rental properties.
* **Test digital tools:** Time is money, right? Many landlords juggle a primary job along with managing their properties. That’s why it helps when your insurance company offers intuitive mobile apps and 24/7 customer service — so you can file claims, access documents and pay bills anytime, anywhere.
* **Evaluate third-party scores and ratings:** Organizations like [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/) and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) review insurance companies based on financial strength, customer satisfaction and digital tool capabilities. While it may be tempting to just purchase cheap landlord insurance, checking these reviews can help ensure you’ll receive reliable service and fair payouts in the event you need to file a claim.
* **Review the fine print:** Cheaper policies might exclude critical protections, which can cost you in the long run. Make sure you know what isn't covered so you can supplement with endorsements or shop for more comprehensive options.

Speaking with a licensed insurance agent may help guide your landlord insurance shopping process.

## Frequently asked questions

* ###### Is landlord insurance required?

  Caret Down Icon 

  If your property has a mortgage, you will likely have to carry landlord insurance on your tenant-occupied home. Although landlord insurance is not required by law, it may offer financial protection if your home experiences severe damage from a covered peril. Plus, you can most likely write off the insurance when you file your taxes, so you may be protecting your investment and saving money at tax time.

* ###### Can landlords require tenants to carry renters insurance?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Yes, landlords can include a clause in the lease that requires proof of [renters insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-renters-insurance/). Renters insurance is generally a good idea anyway, as it protects tenants’ property, and it may also include liability to cover damages or injuries incurred on the property. In some cases, landlords can be named as an "additional interest" on the policy (note that this is different from being named as an "additional insured"), so that they are notified if the policy lapses.

* ###### Is landlord insurance expensive?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The cost of a landlord insurance policy may vary greatly based on the property’s features, location and the landlord’s personal rating factors. Landlord insurance does not typically include personal property coverage, which may make it cheaper than [homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/). On the other hand, carriers may see rental properties as riskier to insure than owner-occupied homes, as tenants may be less likely to maintain properties regularly. The best way to understand what you might pay for landlord insurance is likely to compare quotes from a handful of providers.

* ###### Is landlord insurance tax-deductible?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Landlord insurance can be expensive, especially since it can carry more risk than a traditional [homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) policy. Since you are not living on the property, you’re relying on your tenants (and their guests) to limit damage. You’re also counting on them to report maintenance issues promptly, so small problems don’t turn into costly insurance claims. Many landlord policies also include loss of rental income coverage, which helps replace your rental income if the property becomes uninhabitable after a covered loss — another factor that can drive up cost. If you choose to furnish the property or store your belongings there, you may have to consider purchasing personal property coverage for your landlord policy, too. Beyond coverage options and tenant risk, the cost of landlord insurance may vary greatly based on the property’s features, location and your personal rating factors.
