| Car Insurance Provider | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- |

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology

The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### Insurance coverage option comparison: GEICO vs. Costco

With basic coverage, GEICO and CONNECT provide similar levels of protection. The insurers' liability, collision, comprehensive, and state-specific requirements are the same. Once you dive into the finer details of each coverage option, you'll find differences. Let’s explore.

#### Gap insurance

Gap insurance is designed to cover the gap between your insurance company's valuation of your vehicle after it's totaled and the amount left on your loan. If you total your new-ish vehicle while paying installments on a $25,000 loan, your insurance company will only pay you for the value of your car at the time it was totaled. Because vehicles depreciate rapidly, it’s unlikely your claims payout will equal the $25,000 MSRP you're paying. Gap insurance is designed to cover this difference.

> Gap insurance is designed to cover the cost difference between the valuation of a totaled vehicle and the amount left on your loan.

GEICO does not provide gap insurance, but Costco's policies do. This coverage is often required for vehicles that are leased or financed, so GEICO might not be a great option for you if you'd like the peace of mind provided by gap coverage.

You can purchase gap insurance through your auto financing company. Learn more about [gap coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/gap-insurance/).

#### Lifetime renewability

This feature is only available for Costco Executive Cardholders, who won't face insurance cancellation after multiple accidents. Many car insurance companies will cancel or non-renew your policy if you’ve had multiple claims.

There are some restrictions to Costco's lifetime renewability add-on:

* If you live in [Maryland](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/maryland-car-insurance/) or [Michigan](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/michigan-car-insurance/)
* Have “major violations”
* Fail to pay your premium
* Fail to provide requested documentation
* Move to a state not covered by CONNECT
* Purchase an uninsurable vehicle

GEICO does not specifically state its non-renewal policy. A general rule of thumb is you will be non-renewed if you have three claims within three years.

#### Telematics

Neither company offers telematics or a usage-based insurance program. These programs measure your driving habits in order to more accurately price your premiums. If you’re a safe driver, you can earn a discount.

Dealing with a car insurance company is never fun. If you’ve ever been through the claims process, you know decent customer service is crucial. Overall, CONNECT is ranked more favorably than GEICO in terms of customer service and J.D. Power ratings. However, CONNECT's unofficial customer reviews are considerably less favorable.
