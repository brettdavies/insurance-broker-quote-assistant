# State Farm wants me to replace my roof. There’s nothing wrong with it!!

HELP I have no claims. It’s an older roof but it doesn’t leak. They don’t like the way the tiles look. They will drop my policy if it’s not replaced. I can’t afford $15k for a new roof. How to I fight this? This is a single family home in San Bernardino, California. It has asphalt tiles on the roof. Approximately 1200 square feet. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Edit:Thank you all for your advice. You have given me a lot to think about.
