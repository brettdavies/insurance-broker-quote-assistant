It's FL, especially if you are in SFL or Tampa. Almost all claims are litigated and every other billboard is for a lawyer claiming they can get you millions. PLP's used to be cheap but post covid I am seeing premiums similar to yours. You can try to shop it, but unless you live well inland and north, FL is a tough market.

I'm in NW FL which is a high risk hurricane zone. Lots of tourists too, so driving is a bit haphazard especially during the vacation seasons.

I don’t know if your specific rate increase is normal but I do know [umbrella rates](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+rates+increase&cId=c21076ae-3d3d-4016-acd2-34e1ee719508&iId=e58ff183-0941-4a5e-a8ca-307fb8a83b75) in general are going significantly higher because so many claims now exceed policy limits (requiring umbrella payouts). An umbrella is no longer the cheap add on it used to be. But if you have assets you really want to have one.

Umbrella policies are going up everywhere, from what they tell us it’s because of an increase in large jury verdict and depending on your coverage, an increase in the amount of uninsured drivers. Someone umbrella policies carry an endorsement that will allow the coverage to also apply to you in the event that you were hit by uninsured or under insured driver. The cost for that endorsement is going up astronomically due to the reasons above. I agree with the other person you said you should call your agent and review. The youthful driver is also not going to help the premium, but I don’t know if that directly affected it because you didn’t mention if they were on there last term also or not.

Really comes down to nuclear verdicts. Court cases are getting more and more out of hand every year.
A good public example is that obese rapper suing Lyft because she was too large to fit in a driver's car. She's demanding several million dollars, over a simple "nah you can't ride with me" scenario. Will she get all that much? Probably not. But I'm willing to bet she ends up settling and still getting a pretty decent paycheck out of it.
And unfortunately, $1M is like the new $500k. One bad claim can pierce through that no problem
But as always, shop around if you don't like the pricing. If you're finding others are giving you similar prices, that's just the market. Sometimes carriers end up changing their Underwriting appetite and increase prices to the point where it's like "we don't really want you anymore, but if you're willing to pay $XX, then sure". So you either go somewhere else, or pay higher than before. They're fine with either scenario

This plus litigation funding. Groups of people paying the lawyer fees in lawsuits as a return on investment when the judgment/settlement is finalized. These are absolutely hitting the primary umbrella policies and blasting through multi million dollar towers. And even if the claims are legitimate, the payouts are way higher than ever before. It has sent the entire market in a tailspin.

Climate change has very little directly to do with personal umbrella insurance. There may, however, be some spillover due to the implications of climate change on insurers' capacity / need to generate income on the increased amount of required surplus....and that is an outsized problem for Florida.

It's a little tricky with home insurance in Florida. Rates I'm hearing about are crazy high compared to mine. SF is no longer writing home policies in Florida, but I was grandfathered in.

You don't necessarily need to move your HO or auto coverages. There are companies out there willing to write umbrellas without everything else. I know some SF agents that are even recommending it to people considering canceling their umbrellas because of their rate hikes.

1. Florida. The state just manufactures litigation; particularly when it comes to HO claims. Florida fairly consistently accounts for about _**75% of the entire country's homeowners insurance lawsuits!**_ Every year for the past several years. Since insurance companies not only pay property losses, but also the legal expenses for sometimes prolonged litigation. It is very expensive. 2) Youthful driver in the household. This is what it is. My most sincere condolences regarding your son. I want to tread lightly here, but if there was any sort of significant liability payment in connection with his accident this could be a factor, at least temporarily.

It's OK to ask. Hardly any liability payout. Single car accident. A little damage to a guard rail and a $5K payment to me as part of the policy.

State Farm umbrella policy details
**State Farm umbrella policies** provide additional liability coverage above your primary insurance limits, but redditors note **recent cost increases** and **stricter underwriting**, suggesting **shopping around** and ensuring **proper documentation** are key.
### What is a State Farm Umbrella Policy?
* **Coverage**: An umbrella policy kicks in when the liability limits of your underlying policies (like home and auto) are exhausted. It provides an additional layer of liability coverage, typically starting from $1 million. ["An umbrella kicks in if you max out the liability limits on the underlying policies, in this case, your home and auto."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mgz0ld/comment/n6sdbha/)
* **Protection of Assets**: This coverage is crucial for protecting your personal assets from lawsuits that exceed your primary policy limits. ["This provides more protection of your personal assets."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mgz0ld/comment/n6sdoc7/)
### Why Have Umbrella Coverage?
* **High-Risk Scenarios**: If you have minor drivers, a swimming pool, or a dog, you are at a higher risk of liability claims. ["With minor/young drivers, you are at a MUCH higher risk of an at fault accident."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mgz0ld/comment/n6sdbha/)
* **Litigation Trends**: The increasing number of lawsuits and "nuclear verdicts" means that even a minor incident can result in a multi-million dollar judgment. ["More and more claims are piercing umbrella layers than ever before, particularly thanks to plaintiff attorneys."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1o47gyj/comment/nj12fxb/)
### Recent Changes and Challenges
* **Cost Increases**: Many redditors have reported significant increases in their State Farm umbrella policy premiums. ["It went from $725 to $1289!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1o47gyj/umbrella_policy_shock_advice_please/)
* **Underwriting Requirements**: State Farm now often requires you to have your home and auto insurance with them to secure an umbrella policy. ["Most companies at least want you to have auto with them. Some won't offer an umbrella unless you have the home and auto with them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1ok7yh5/comment/nma4jp7/)
* **Loss Ratios**: The insurance industry, including State Farm, has been experiencing high loss ratios on umbrella policies, leading to premium increases. ["SF is paying out $2.30 for every $1 collected in premium on Umbrella's."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mzso3x/comment/nalf7yb/)
### Tips for Managing Your State Farm Umbrella Policy
* **Contact Your Agent**: If you have questions or concerns about your policy, contact your State Farm agent first. They can often help resolve issues and explain the changes. ["Did you call your agent?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1nenqat/comment/ndq1tdq/)
* **Review Underlying Policies**: Ensure you meet the required underlying liability limits for your auto and home insurance, as this can affect your umbrella coverage. ["You need to carry underlying limits of 250/. 500000 or 500k csl (combined single limits) for auto liability and 500k for personal liability to satisfy the underlying insurance requirement."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1o47gyj/comment/nj33n81/)
* **Consider Independent Agents**: If State Farm's rates are too high or they are not offering the coverage you need, consider contacting an independent insurance agent. They can shop around for quotes from multiple carriers. ["Call a local independent agent or two and ask if they have a market for 'stand alone' umbrella policies."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1ok7yh5/comment/nm8mldh/)
* **Documentation**: Keep a record of all communications and documents related to your insurance policies, especially if you are making changes or addressing issues. ["EMAIL your agent ASAP (you want a written record, so a phone call alone is insufficient)"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1mgtmhl/comment/n6r9m72/)

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.
