# State Farm umbrella policy outrageous premium increase

Can I get some advice on this please. I've had a $1 million State Farm Personal Liability Umbrella Policy for many years. It was $300 per year for a long time. Two years ago, it doubled, then went to $900 the next year. Now I get a bill for $1564. WTF? Everything I'm reading on here says it should be around $300 or so.

I have 2 cars insured with State Farm and 3 drivers, one is a "youthful operator". I'm in Florida. My home is also insured with SF. Had one claim a couple of years ago when my son was tragically killed in a single car accident. No other parties were involved.

I'm wondering if this is normal. Should I call my agent, or look at another company for insurance? I've been with SF for many years and the service is great, but the rates are getting out of control.
