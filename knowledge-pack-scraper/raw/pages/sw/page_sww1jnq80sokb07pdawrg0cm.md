## List of 10 Most Liberal Cities In US 2024
As outlined in a publication by the [University of Richmond](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=polisci-faculty-publications), the term 'liberalism' did not find its political connotation until the early 19th century. During this period, 'liberal' emerged as a descriptor for those advocating for a more tolerant and inclusive societal framework. This ideology envisioned a society wherein individuals could freely pursue their ideas and interests with minimal interference. The initial adoption of the label occurred within a faction of the Spanish Cortes during 1810-1811, identifying themselves as 'Liberales'. Subsequently, the term swiftly disseminated to France and Great Britain, culminating in the transformation of the Whig faction, by the 1840s, into the Liberal Party. Here is the list:
1. San Francisco, California
2. New York City, New York

Conservatives exhibit a preference for expansive dwellings situated in small towns or rural locales, ideally amidst individuals who share their religious beliefs. In contrast, liberals gravitate towards the dynamic ambience of urban environments, favouring compact residences, pedestrian-friendly streets, and diverse communities encompassing various racial and ethnic backgrounds.

### Most Liberal Cities In the US 2025
#### 1. San Francisco
San Francisco is the epicentre of progressive liberal ideals, earning its title as the foremost liberal city in America. Renowned as the Golden Gate City, it offers an unparalleled blend of vibrant arts and culture, robust employment opportunities, and extensive outdoor recreational offerings, making it an ideal haven for young professionals seeking a liberal environment. Notably, San Francisco, affectionately dubbed California's capital of quirk and recognised as one of the Gayest Cities in the World, hosts one of the most established and prominent Pride parades globally, underscoring its unwavering commitment to LGBTQ rights. Boasting the largest LGBTQ community in the United States, the city also distinguishes itself with a per capita general expenditure of $14,347 in 2020, ranking as the second-highest nationwide.
#### 2. New York City, New York
In 2023, The Big Apple emerged not only as one of the most liberal cities in the U.S. but also as a global beacon of liberalism. Many attribute the Stonewall Riots as the pivotal moment that ignited an organised gay rights movement across America. Triggered by a police raid on a mafia-owned gay bar on June 28th, 1969, three nights of riots ensued, catalysing the global gay rights movement.
Commemorating the Stonewall events, the inaugural Pride marches took place on June 28th, 1970, in NYC, Los Angeles, and Chicago, heralding an annual global tradition. Further solidifying its liberal stance, in April 2023, the New York State Senate swiftly confirmed Governor Kathy Hochul's nominee for the state's highest court, a judge endorsed by the state's progressive legislators.
#### 3. Boston, Massachusetts
Nestled in the heart of the most progressive state in America, Boston has long been a hub for gay rights activism across the nation. A significant contributor to this movement was the influential Gay Community News, a weekly newspaper widely regarded as the voice of the movement throughout the 1970s. The city also holds the distinction of being home to Elaine Nobel, the first openly gay state representative in the country.
Over the past four decades, Boston has undergone notable demographic shifts, becoming increasingly diverse in terms of race and ethnicity. In the 1970s, around 70% of Bostonians were white, a figure that has since decreased to 44%. As the beloved home of the Red Sox, Boston also boasts a per capita general expenditure of $5,782 in 2020, reflecting its vibrant cultural and economic vitality.
#### 4. Washington D.C.
Washington D.C. is a bastion of liberalism, consistently backing Democratic candidates with an impressive 95% voter turnout in their favor across elections. Since gaining the right to vote in presidential elections, the district has consistently cast its ballots for Democratic candidates, underscoring its steadfast political allegiance. Were it not for its unique status, the city's local government would likely reflect an overwhelming progressive majority.
One key factor contributing to Washington D.C.'s liberal leanings is its political isolation from surrounding suburban areas, primarily located in Virginia and Maryland. This separation fosters a distinct political landscape within the district. Moreover, as a majority-minority region, no single demographic group comprises over 50% of the population, reflecting a rich tapestry of diversity. With a foreign-born population accounting for 13.5% of its inhabitants, Washington D.C. embodies a cosmopolitan ethos. Notably, the city boasts the highest per capita general expenditure in the nation, reaching $22,508 in 2020. This substantial investment underscores Washington D.C.'s commitment to providing robust public services and infrastructure for its residents.
#### 5. Seattle, Washington
Seattle has long held a reputation as one of the nation's most progressive cities, standing firmly at the vanguard of the country's liberal movement for decades. Pioneering various policy initiatives, Seattle has consistently championed progressive causes and enacted groundbreaking measures ahead of the curve.
Notably, it made history as the first major city to implement a $15 per hour minimum wage, leading the charge in the fight for fair wages. Additionally, Seattle paved the way for gig economy workers by granting them the right to union affiliation, demonstrating a commitment to protecting workers' rights. Moreover, albeit briefly, the city boldly introduced a per-employee tax on major corporations, signalling its willingness to explore innovative solutions to address socio-economic challenges.
#### 6. Oakland, California
Oakland, California, stands out as a progressive city deeply committed to social justice, environmental sustainability, and inclusive governance.
Oakland residents actively participate in civic matters, as evidenced by the 2025 mayoral election, where progressive candidate Barbara Lee won with 53% of the vote, succeeding the recalled Mayor Sheng Thao. Lee's platform focused on ethics reforms, auditing city spending, and increasing transparency to restore public trust in city governance. Further, organisations like Oakland Rising and Bay Rising Action work to empower marginalised communities, including BIPOC, immigrant, low-income, and formerly incarcerated residents, by educating and mobilising voters to advocate for racial, economic, and environmental justice. 
#### 7. Denver, Colorado
Denver, the capital of Colorado, is known for its vibrant progressive culture and liberal values. It is often recognised as one of the most liberal cities in the United States, ranking as the 7th most liberal city overall.
Denver is home to a rich cultural mix, with a foreign-born population of 14.2% and a Hispanic/Latino population of 29.4%. This diversity is reflected in the city's community events, local businesses, and neighborhoods, making it a hub for multicultural experiences. This diversity is celebrated through numerous cultural festivals, including the Cinco de Mayo festival and the Denver Chinese New Year Festival. 
Denver is also highly progressive when it comes to environmental sustainability. The city has put measures in place to reduce its carbon footprint, including policies focused on renewable energy, reducing waste, and increasing public transportation. Denver has a strong commitment to maintaining its natural beauty and resources, reflected in its Green Roof Ordinance and Clean Energy Goals.
**Note** : The compilation is derived from a [report](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-most-liberal-cities-in-the-u-s-1165322/?singlepage=1) by Insider Monkey, employing four key metrics to ascertain the characteristics of a liberal city. Primarily, cities with notably elevated general expenditures per capita were identified, drawing data from the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/research-data/data-toolkits/fiscally-standardized-cities/search-database). Subsequently, focus was placed on cities showcasing significant ethnic diversity, as well as those deemed favourable for young professionals, sourced from Niche. This selection rationale is grounded in the observation that young professionals typically align more closely with liberal ideologies. Finally, cities demonstrating a strong inclination towards liberal politics were considered, referencing insights from '[Representation in Municipal Government](https://ctausanovitch.com/Municipal_Representation_140502.pdf)' by Chris Tausanovitch and Christopher Warshaw.
