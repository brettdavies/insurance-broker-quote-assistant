## Vehicle Standards for Rideshare Services in California

Rideshare drivers in California must comply with specific criteria concerning their automobiles. Vehicles need to be recent, typically no older than 15 years, though some regions like the Bay Area allow cars from 2003 or 2004. These age limits help maintain safety and reliability for passengers.

Every vehicle must undergo inspections at licensed facilities approved by the [California Bureau of Automotive Repair](https://www.bar.ca.gov/). This ensures the automobile meets state regulations for roadworthiness. Inspections include checks for safety features and operational integrity.

## Additional Requirements Based on the Rideshare Company

Different rideshare platforms have distinct conditions that drivers must meet beyond basic criteria. These vary depending on the company’s policies and regional regulations.
