#  Bodily Injury Claims in Florida
“I was in an accident over a year ago and I couldn’t ask for a better attorney, Clifford Wells and his team took the time to recommend care, check in on me weekly, and were very quick to respond to all my Emails and questions. If anyone I know is involved in an accident, I will be quick to refer them.”

* Navigating personal injury claims in Florida requires understanding the [statute of limitations](https://hermanwells.com/blog/floridas-new-personal-injury-statute-of-limitations/), which is two years from the accident date, and choosing an experienced lawyer to guide you through the complex process.
If you are in an accident in Florida, your personal injury protection (PIP) coverage will help pay for your medical expenses and lost wages [regardless of who is at fault.](https://hermanwells.com/blog/florida-pip-law-explained-what-does-it-mean-for-you/) This coverage is mandatory in Florida, so all drivers must have it. If you are injured and someone else is at fault, you may also be able to file a bodily injury liability claim. Bodily injury liability coverage helps protect you if you are sued for injuries that you caused to another person. It can help pay for medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages that you are liable for. PIP coverage does not provide this type of protection.
In order to file a personal injury claim in Florida, you must be able to prove that you were [injured as a result of another person’s negligence.](https://hermanwells.com/blog/how-can-i-prove-negligence-in-my-personal-injury-case/) You must also meet the applicable statute of limitations, which is typically two years. In addition, you will need to provide evidence of your injuries, including medical records and receipts for any related expenses.
If you have been involved in a car accident and have not suffered a serious injury, you will not be able to bring a personal injury claim against the other driver. Instead, your only recourse will be to [file a property damage claim](https://hermanwells.com/florida-insurance-dispute/property-damage-lawyer/) with your own insurance company.
After an accident, it’s understandable that you’ll feel overwhelmed and uncertain of what to do next. You may be tempted to try to handle the insurance claim and personal injury lawsuit on your own. However, this is not advisable. There are [many benefits to having an experienced personal injury lawyer](https://hermanwells.com/blog/are-personal-injury-attorneys-worth-it/) on your side after an accident. A personal injury lawyer can:
Many personal injury claims hinge on the severity of the injuries sustained in the accident. If you wait to seek medical treatment, you may find that your injuries are not as severe as you thought and that your case is weaker as a result. It is always best to seek medical attention right away after an accident so that you can make a [clear claim with accurate documentation of your injuries.](https://hermanwells.com/blog/how-gaps-in-treatment-impact-injury-claims-in-florida/)
It is important to [compile all pertinent medical records](https://hermanwells.com/blog/florida-personal-injury-claims-keep-detailed-records/) if you are injured in an accident. This information will help your personal injury lawyer build a strong case on your behalf. The records will show the extent of your injuries and how they have impacted your life. Without this evidence, it may be more difficult to obtain a fair settlement from the insurance company.
If the insurance company has offered you a low settlement, you should contact a personal injury lawyer. A personal injury lawyer can help you [negotiate a higher settlement](https://hermanwells.com/blog/how-much-to-seek-in-a-personal-injury-settlement/) and can also take legal action if necessary. There are many benefits to having legal representation after an accident. A personal injury lawyer will know what to expect in the settlement process and will be able to ensure that you receive fair compensation for your injuries. Additionally, a personal injury lawyer can handle all of the legal paperwork and negotiations on your behalf, so you don’t have to worry about anything.
Another factor that can impact when or if you can file a bodily injury claim in Florida is the experience and skill of the lawyer you choose to represent you. An experienced personal injury lawyer will know the ins and outs of the personal injury claims process and will be able to navigate it effectively on your behalf. They will also be able to advise you on what to do in order to give yourself the[ best chance at a successful outcome.](https://hermanwells.com/blog/the-essential-role-of-personal-injury-attorneys-in-florida-your-advocates-for-justice/) If you have been injured in an accident, it is important to seek legal counsel as soon as possible so that you can understand your rights and options under Florida law.
When you have been injured in any accident caused by someone else, you should have a personal injury lawyer on your side. Since the other party is likely to have a lawyer on their side, a lawyer can help you level the playing field. A lawyer can call upon resources such as expert witnesses or private investigators if necessary.

I couldn’t be more grateful for the outstanding service I received from Warren Duffy and his team. From our very first conversation, Warren impressed me with his professionalism, clarity, and genuine concern for my case. He took the time to explain every step of the process in terms I could understand, and always made himself available to answer my questions—no matter how small. Warren is a sharp, experienced attorney who truly knows how to advocate for his clients. His calm and confident demeanor gave me peace of mind, and his strategic approach delivered results. It’s clear he takes pride in doing things the right way and goes above and beyond to protect his clients’ interests. The support staff at his office was equally courteous and efficient, keeping things running smoothly throughout. If you’re looking for a trustworthy, knowledgeable, and highly capable attorney, I wholeheartedly recommend Warren Duffy. You’ll be in excellent hands.
