## What does a State Farm declarations page look like?

A declarations page (commonly referred to as "dec page") hosts the most important information about your insurance policy — who is covered, what is covered, and for which limits. For State Farm customers, your declarations page looks like this:

### How to read your declarations page by section:

1. **Policy number**: This is your unique policy number, which you’ll need when [filing a claim](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/car-insurance-claims/).
2. **Policy term**: Lists the effective date and expiration date of your policy.
3. **Policyholder name and address**: The address listed must be that of the policyholder and the primary location at which the vehicle is kept.
4. **Vehicle information:**The insured car's make, model, year and VIN are listed here.
5. **Coverages, limits and deductibles:**Lists [bodily injury](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/bodily-injury-liability/) and [property damage liability](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/property-damage-liability/)(required), as well as any elected coverages such as [comprehensive, collision](/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/comprehensive-vs-collision/), etc. The limits list the maximum amount that each coverage will pay as well as any required [deductible](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-deductibles/) you have to pay out of pocket.
6. **Premium**: The amount you’ll pay over the course of the policy term. Can be listed as a six-month or one-year total.

## How to find your State Farm declarations page online

In order to access your declarations page online, you must be logged in to your account on State Farm's website. Once you're in, navigate to the circle icon in the upper right-hand corner and select documents.

![state farm online img]()

Next, look for the correct "policy notice"— this may say "renewal notice" if you have just renewed your policy. Documents are organized by type of insurance, so if you have more than one policy with State Farm (auto and renters, auto and homeowners, etc) select the policy notice for the insurance product you're looking for.

![page 2 state farm]()

By selecting the red hyperlink labeled "Policy Notice" a new tab will open up with a PDF version of your insurance documents, starting with your declarations page.

## How to find your declarations page on State Farm's mobile app

If you need to access your declarations page on the go, the State Farm mobile app also keeps your documents handy.

* **Step 1:** Log in to the State Farm app with your credentials and select the **"Insurance"** tab in the bottom navigational menu.
* **Step 2:**Click on **"Visit Document Center."**
* **Step 3:**Select the insurance policy you wish to view.
* **Step 4:**Find "policy notice" (or "renewal notice"). The next screen will show your declarations page in full.

## Zebra tip: Renewal is a great time to shop around

If your policy renewal premium was higher than you're happy with, consider [comparing quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) with other companies. Now that you've found your declarations page, you can compare coverage exactly and ensure you are getting quoted for a comparable policy.

![katie gold headshot]()

Advice from your agent: Compare coverages line by line

"A lot of people focus only on the cost of insurance without truly comparing coverage apples to apples. I always encourage folks to go line by line through their policy before switching. Often, you’ll discover that certain coverages were removed, limits were lowered, or deductibles were increased. It’s essential to ensure all coverages are equal first, and then compare the price."

***Katie Gold — Head of Agency at The Zebra***

## When would I need my declarations page?

Your insurance declarations page is a key document that details all your coverages and their limits. It's especially useful in a variety of scenarios, like comparing providers, purchasing a new car, or updating your policy to include additional drivers or vehicles. Understanding how to read this document allows you to make confident decisions about your coverage, confirm you're properly protected, and make policy updates or comparisons easier.

Roadside assistance covers towing but it won't cover your car being towed by someone else. Unfortunately, that means State Farm will likely not cover the cost of your car being towed from just being parked in the wrong location in an apartment complex. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you have …

As of October 2022, 49/50 states and Washington D.C. allow for digital proof of auto insurance rather than a printed paper ID card. The only state not currently included is New Mexico which means in Oklahoma it is perfectly acceptable, and legal, to use an electronic copy on your phone.
