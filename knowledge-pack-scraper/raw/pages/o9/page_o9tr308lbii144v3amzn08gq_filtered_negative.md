The cheapest [liability insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/news/one-in-three-drivers-lack-enough-liability-insurance "One in Three U.S. Drivers Don't Carry Enough Liability Insurance") for you may be different because of things like your [accident history](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "Does Insurance Cover a Crashed Car and Will My Rates Go Up?"), [credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") and [location](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-by-state "How Much Car Insurance Rates Vary by State").
And make sure you compare quotes with the same level of coverage. [The cheapest insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Most Affordable Car Insurance Companies") for liability-only coverage don't always have the cheapest full coverage policies.
---|---|---
The main reason that liability-only car insurance is much cheaper than full coverage insurance is because it doesn't include [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"). These protect your car against damage, no matter whose fault it is.

[Full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Insurance?") insurance generally includes:
With an older car, [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") may cost more in the long run than your car is worth. That's because the most that the insurance company will pay after a crash is your car's actual cash value (ACV).
* You don't have a [car loan or lease](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/leased-car "Insurance Needs for a Leased Car").
Liability-only car insurance, also called [personal liability and property damage insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/plpd-auto-insurance "What Is PLPD Insurance?"), pays for other people's medical care and car repairs after an accident you cause. The most basic liability-only coverage you can buy is the [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "Minimum Car Insurance Required by State") you need to legally drive your car. But you can also get higher limits with a liability-only policy.
* [**Bodily injury liability**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?"): Pays for the medical bills of anyone injured in an accident you cause.
* [**Property damage liability**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?"): Pays for damage to other cars and property caused by an accident that's your fault.
* **[Personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?") or medical payments**: Covers medical bills for you and your passengers after a crash, no matter who is at fault.
* **[Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")**: Pays for your injuries or damage to your car if you're in an accident caused by a driver who doesn't have insurance.
