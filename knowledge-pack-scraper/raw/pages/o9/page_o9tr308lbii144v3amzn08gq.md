## How to find the best cheap liability auto insurance
The best way to find affordable liability-only car insurance is to compare liability quotes from multiple insurance companies.
The cheapest [liability insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/news/one-in-three-drivers-lack-enough-liability-insurance "One in Three U.S. Drivers Don't Carry Enough Liability Insurance") for you may be different because of things like your [accident history](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "Does Insurance Cover a Crashed Car and Will My Rates Go Up?"), [credit score](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-auto-insurance-rates "How Does Your Credit Score Affect Auto Insurance Rates?") and [location](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-by-state "How Much Car Insurance Rates Vary by State").
And make sure you compare quotes with the same level of coverage. [The cheapest insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Most Affordable Car Insurance Companies") for liability-only coverage don't always have the cheapest full coverage policies.
## What's the cheapest liability-only car insurance near me?
The average cost of liability-only auto insurance changes by state.
This is because each state has its own insurance requirements. And there are different things that can damage your car, such as hurricanes or more crime, depending on the state where you live.
Wyoming has the cheapest rate for minimum coverage, at $31 per month on average. Michigan is the most expensive, with an average rate of $133 per month.

## How much cheaper is liability-only coverage?
Liability car insurance costs an average of 61% less than full coverage.
The main reason that liability-only car insurance is much cheaper than full coverage insurance is because it doesn't include [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"). These protect your car against damage, no matter whose fault it is.
If you have a liability-only policy, your insurance company won't pay to fix your car after a crash.

### Why is liability-only car insurance so much cheaper?
Full coverage is typically more expensive than a liability-only policy because it offers much more protection for you and your car.
A full coverage policy includes liability plus comprehensive and collision coverages, plus it usually has higher coverage limits. This gives you better coverage after an accident.
[Full coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Insurance?") insurance generally includes:
  * More liability protection than required by your state 
  * Collision and comprehensive coverage 
  * Any other coverages required by law, such as personal injury protection (PIP) 


Comprehensive and collision coverage pay for damage to your car if:
  * You cause an accident 
  * Weather, like hail or flooding, damages your car 
  * You hit a deer or another animal 
  * Someone steals or vandalizes your car 
  * You're the victim of a hit-and-run (except when your state requires uninsured motorist coverage) 


**In comparison, liability-only insurance doesn't pay for damage to your car.** You'll only be reimbursed for repairs if another driver damages your car.
Dropping collision and comprehensive coverage helps you save on car insurance. However, you'll spend much more for repairs after an accident because you'll have to pay to fix your car yourself.
## Is cheap liability-only car insurance worth it?
Liability-only coverage is usually a good idea if your car is worth less than $5,000 or is more than eight years old.
With an older car, [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") may cost more in the long run than your car is worth. That's because the most that the insurance company will pay after a crash is your car's actual cash value (ACV).
**Example**
  * **For a new car that's worth $20,000** , the insurance company will pay you a maximum of $20,000 after an accident. This makes it worth it to have full coverage because of the high possible insurance payout. 
  * **For an older car that's worth $5,000** , you could be paying more than $1,000 per year just for comprehensive and collision coverage. But you'd only get up to $5,000 if your car is totaled in an accident. In a few years without a car accident, you would have paid more for insurance than the value of your car. 


### When to drop comprehensive and collision coverage
You should drop full coverage when you can reasonably afford to replace your vehicle after an accident.
Full coverage insurance becomes a worse deal the longer you have your vehicle, or the older the vehicle is.
If you have an older or less expensive car, it's a better deal to drop full coverage and pay for your own car repairs or replace your car after an accident. However, those without a savings cushion may want to pay for full coverage. It can help you avoid unexpected bills after an accident.
### When to get liability-only coverage
  * Your car is older or not valuable. 
  * You don't have a daily commute. 
  * You don't often drive at night. 
  * You are older than 25. 


  * You have enough savings to replace your car. 
  * You park your car indoors at night. 
  * You don't have a [car loan or lease](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/leased-car "Insurance Needs for a Leased Car"). 


**Even if you don't need to add comprehensive and collision to your policy, you should still consider getting higher liability limits than your state requires.**
The amount of liability insurance required by law often isn't enough to cover the cost of a serious accident. Raising your liability limits typically doesn't cost very much. And it could save you a lot of money if you cause a major accident.
## What is liability-only car insurance?
Liability-only car insurance, also called [personal liability and property damage insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/plpd-auto-insurance "What Is PLPD Insurance?"), pays for other people's medical care and car repairs after an accident you cause. The most basic liability-only coverage you can buy is the [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "Minimum Car Insurance Required by State") you need to legally drive your car. But you can also get higher limits with a liability-only policy.
In most states, liability-only car insurance includes:
  * [**Bodily injury liability**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?"): Pays for the medical bills of anyone injured in an accident you cause. 
  * [**Property damage liability**](https://www.valuepenguin.com/property-damage-liability-car-insurance "What Is Property Damage Liability Car Insurance?"): Pays for damage to other cars and property caused by an accident that's your fault. 


**You can get more liability insurance coverage without comprehensive and collision coverage.** It doesn't cost much to raise your liability limits.
In 22 states, you only need your liability insurance to meet minimum coverage requirements. Elsewhere, drivers must also buy one of the following — or both — in order to meet the minimum insurance requirements:
  * **[Personal injury protection](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?") or medical payments**: Covers medical bills for you and your passengers after a crash, no matter who is at fault. 
  * **[Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** : Pays for your injuries or damage to your car if you're in an accident caused by a driver who doesn't have insurance. 


### What's not included with liability-only car insurance?
Liability-only coverage doesn't include collision and comprehensive coverage. Besides liability, these two coverages generally make up the largest portion of a full coverage car insurance bill.
  * **Collision coverage** pays for damage to your car if you cause a crash or no one is at fault. 
  * **Comprehensive coverage** pays for damage caused by elements out of your control, such as weather, animals, theft or vandalism. 


Some car insurance companies won't let you add other types of coverage, like roadside assistance, without full coverage.
* * *
