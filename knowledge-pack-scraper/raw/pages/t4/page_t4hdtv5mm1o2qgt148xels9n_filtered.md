# What Is the Florida Building Code (FBC)?

![What Is the Florida Building Code](https://www.stormsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-is-the-Florida-Building-Code-300x225.png)The Florida Building Code (FBC) is a set of regulations designed to ensure the safety, durability, and resilience of buildings in Florida, particularly against extreme weather conditions like hurricanes. The FBC establishes construction standards for homes and commercial buildings, including requirements for hurricane shutters, impact windows, and storm-resistant materials.

Below, you will find answers to additional frequently asked questions related to the Florida Building Code and its impact on hurricane protection.

## Why Is the Florida Building Code Important?

Florida is one of the most hurricane-prone states in the U.S., and the FBC was created to:

* Enhance storm resistance – Ensures buildings can withstand hurricane-force winds and flying debris.
* Reduce property damage – Establishes structural requirements to minimize storm-related destruction.
* Improve public safety – Protects residents by enforcing high construction standards.
* Ensure compliance for insurance benefits – Helps homeowners qualify for wind mitigation discounts.

The FBC is regularly updated to reflect the latest research and technology in hurricane protection.

## What Are the Hurricane Protection Requirements Under the FBC?

The Florida Building Code has strict wind and impact resistance requirements, particularly in High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ) like Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Key FBC requirements include:

1. Impact-Resistant Windows or [Hurricane Shutters](https://www.stormsmart.com/aluminum-shutters/)
   * All exterior openings (windows, doors, and skylights) must be protected with impact-rated hurricane shutters or hurricane-resistant glass.
2. Wind-Load Testing Standards
   * Hurricane shutters must withstand winds of 130–180 mph, depending on the region.
3. Impact Testing for Hurricane Shutters
   * Shutters must pass tests involving large and small missile impacts to simulate flying debris.

These regulations help ensure that homes and buildings can withstand strong storms and comply with insurance requirements.

## How Does FBC Approval Differ From Miami-Dade Approval?

Both FBC and Miami-Dade County approvals set high safety standards, but they have some differences:

| **Approval Type** | **Wind-Resistance Requirements** | **Impact Testing** | **Where It Applies** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FBC Approval** | Statewide (varies by wind zone) | Standardized testing | All of Florida |
| **Miami-Dade Approval** | Highest wind resistance (HVHZ areas) | Stricter testing, larger debris impact | Miami-Dade & Broward Counties (HVHZ) |

Miami-Dade approval exceeds standard FBC requirements and is often considered the gold standard for hurricane protection.

## How Do FBC-Approved Shutters Help With Insurance Savings?

Homes equipped with FBC-approved hurricane shutters may qualify for insurance discounts through Florida’s wind mitigation program. To be eligible:

* Shutters must meet or exceed FBC impact-resistance standards.
* A wind mitigation inspection is required to confirm compliance.
* The entire home must be protected, including all doors and windows.

Many homeowners see reduced premiums after upgrading to FBC-compliant hurricane shutters.
