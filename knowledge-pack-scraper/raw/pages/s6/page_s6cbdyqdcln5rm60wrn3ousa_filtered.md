New York City, NY, insurance laws can be confusing. The state requires drivers to carry several types of car insurance coverage. Sorting out [liability](https://www.rosenbaumnylaw.com/resources/what-is-liability/) for a car accident and [filing insurance claims](https://www.rosenbaumnylaw.com/resources/do-i-need-a-personal-injury-lawyer-if-im-submitting-a-claim-to-insurance/) can be challenging, especially if you are still recovering from injuries.

## What Are the Insurance Requirements for New York Drivers?

Before discussing an uninsured motorist claim, it helps to review the [required insurance coverage](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements) for New York drivers. State law requires drivers to purchase at least:

* No-fault insurance coverage (Personal Injury Protection or [PIP](https://www.rosenbaumnylaw.com/resources/personal-injury-protection-pip/)) in the amount of $50,000 per person
* Bodily injury liability insurance in the amount of $25,000 for injury to one person and $50,000 for injury to two or more people in a single accident
* Liability insurance for death in the amount of $50,000 for one death and $100,000 for the death of two or more people in a single accident
* $10,000 in liability property damage coverage
* Uninsured motorist insurance coverage, which has the same minimum insurance amounts as liability bodily injury

No-fault insurance pays the insured and covered individuals regardless of who causes the accident. Liability insurance compensates accident victims when the accident was your fault. [Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.rosenbaumnylaw.com/blog/2020/03/overview-of-no-fault-and-uninsured-motorists-coverage/) applies in cases when an uninsured motorist causes an accident.

## Understanding Uninsured Motorist Coverage in NYC

If an uninsured driver causes an accident, your [uninsured motorist insurance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=b6090187a00e476059f25cc9842dee25&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:42:Chapter:IV:Subchapter:B:Part:411:Subpart:D:411.50) coverage should cover your damages up to the policy limits. The insurance company must verify that the at-fault driver did not have liability insurance coverage at the time of the crash. Furthermore, the uninsured driver must have caused the accident and be liable for damages.

Assuming you have minimum bodily insurance coverage, the uninsured motorist coverage is $25,000. That means the maximum insurance coverage for your claim would be $75,000 ($50,000 PIP coverage and $25,000 uninsured motorist coverage).

Increasing your uninsured motorist coverage is important when you increase your bodily injury coverage. Doing so ensures you have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for damages, even if the driver who causes your car accidents does not have the required liability insurance coverage.

## Do I Need To Hire a Lawyer To File an Uninsured Motorist Claim in New York?

Even though you are dealing with your insurance company when filing the claim, it does not guarantee that you receive the full value of your claim. Insurance companies routinely [fight injury claims](https://www.rosenbaumnylaw.com/resources/the-inside-scoop-on-how-insurance-companies-will-fight-your-personal-injury-claim/) and undervalue claims to save money, even the claims filed by their own customers.

For that reason, you might consider consulting a New York City uninsured claims lawyer. An attorney can help you obtain the maximum compensation for your car accident claim by identifying all sources of insurance coverage and fighting to obtain fair settlement amounts for each insurance policy.
