WalletHub Senior Researcher
The average cost of car insurance is $671 per year for drivers with minimum coverage and a clean record, according to WalletHub’s research. Individual rates may vary based on factors such as driving record, age, car type, and credit history.
## Average Car Insurance Cost by Category
* **Minimum Coverage:** $56 per month
* **Full Coverage:** $176 per month
* **Drivers with a Violation:** $71 per month
* **Young Drivers:** $145 per month
* **Senior Drivers:** $55 per month
The cost of the average car insurance policy can be a good indication of how much a driver should expect to pay for coverage. We consider a young driver to be 16-24 years old, and we averaged the rates for 55- and 65-year-olds for the senior driver profile.

## Average Car Insurance Cost by Company
Each insurance company has its own algorithm for calculating premiums, so the same driver could be quoted different premiums by different insurers. As a result, drivers should always [compare quotes](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/compare-car-insurance/93611) from at least three different insurers before purchasing a policy.

## Average Car Insurance Cost by Violation
Drivers almost always pay more for auto insurance after a moving violation. The exact amount that your rates will go up depends mostly on your state and the specific infraction, but in some states your premium can rise to more than double the rate that a safe driver would pay.
You can [check your driving record](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/driving-record-check/12553) to see how many infractions and points you have on your license, and if you practice good habits behind the wheel, your rates will eventually go back down. It usually takes [3-5 years](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-far-back-does-insurance-check-your-driving-record-2140685680/) to improve your driving record for insurance purposes after a moving violation.
**Violation** | **Premium Increase After Infraction** | **Average Premium**
---|---|---
[Red Light Infraction](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-a-red-light-ticket-2140764875/) | 23% | $69 per month
[Speeding Ticket](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-a-speeding-ticket-2140764862/) | 27% | $71 per month
[Open Container Infraction](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-an-open-container-violation-2140764874/) | 48% | $83 per month
[At-Fault Accident](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-an-at-fault-accident-2140764871/) | 50% | $84 per month
[Reckless Driving Infraction](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-a-reckless-driving-conviction-2140764865/) | 98% | $111 per month
[Suspended Driver’s License Infraction](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-a-license-suspension-2140764878/) | 104% | $114 per month
[DUI](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-does-car-insurance-go-up-after-a-dui-2140764883/) | 107% | $116 per month
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different
## Average Car Insurance Cost by Age
Your age can affect your car insurance rates because younger drivers with less experience on the road tend to have more accidents than older, mature drivers. As a result, they also pay more for car insurance.
Premiums usually drop by 12% to 20% when a [driver turns 25 years old](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/does-car-insurance-go-down-at-25-2140722234/). After that, the average driver’s rate will gradually decrease over time until they reach their seventies. At that point, costs rise once again due to the increased risk posed by senior drivers.
**Age** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
[16 years old](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-a-16-year-old-2140700654/) | $3,192 per year | $266 per month
[25 years old](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-a-25-year-old-2140700649/) | $815 per year | $68 per month
[45 years old](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-a-45-year-old-2140749865/) | $671 per year | $56 per month
[65 years old](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-a-65-year-old-2140749868/) | $680 per year | $57 per month

## Average Car Insurance Cost by Gender
Female drivers pay an average of 6% more than male drivers, according to WalletHub’s analysis. However, several states, including California and Hawaii, have laws in place that forbid using gender to influence car insurance rates.
**Gender** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
Male | $671 per year | $56 per month
Female | $703 per year | $59 per month
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different

## Average Car Insurance Cost by Car Type
The most expensive type of car to insure is a sports car, followed by a truck. In general, the faster a car can go or the more expensive it is to repair or replace, the more its insurance will cost.
Drivers tend to assume that if a car is more expensive, it automatically costs more to insure than a cheaper car. However, this is not always the case. [WalletHub’s analysis](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/insurance-premiums-by-car-type/3969) found that only 22% of the difference in insurance premiums for cars in the same category can be attributed to the cost of the car. The remaining 78% depends on other factors such as the car’s body type, [make](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/car-make-and-model-2140718020/), and age, which affect how much damage a car can cause and how much it costs to repair.
**Type of Car** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
[Crossover/SUV](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-insurance-for-an-suv-2140760120/) | $655 per year | $55 per month
[Sedan](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-insurance-for-a-sedan-2140760112/) | $671 per year | $56 per month
[Truck](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-insurance-for-a-truck-2140760126/) | $657 per year | $55 per month
[Coupe](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-insurance-for-a-coupe-2140760122/) | $660 per year | $55 per month
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different
## Average Car Insurance Cost by Specific Vehicle
The vehicles listed below are the [cheapest cars to insure overall](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/cheapest-cars-to-insure/65580), according to WalletHub’s analysis. These specific cars represent a mix of SUVs and minivans, which are typically cheaper to insure than other types of cars due to their high safety ratings, low repair costs, and low accident rates.
**Car** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
Subaru Forester | $1,773 | $148
Dodge Grand Caravan | $1,786 | $149
Honda Odyssey | $1,800 | $150
Ford Escape | $1,877 | $156
Toyota Sienna | $1,966 | $164
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different.
## Average Car Insurance Cost by Category
Since car insurance costs are based on a driver’s expected level of risk and likelihood of [filing claims](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/car-insurance-claims/12882), certain drivers pay more than others. Students and teens tend to pay more for insurance because of their lack of experience, while married people are seen as being more stable and less likely to take risks, which leads to lower premium costs. Seniors pay slightly more for car insurance than middle-aged drivers because seniors are statistically more likely to be involved in serious accidents on the road.
**Category** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
[Teenager](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/how-much-is-teenage-car-insurance-per-month-2140686530/) | $2,920 per year | $243 per month
[Student](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/average-college-student-car-insurance-2140752094/) | $1,107 per year | $92 per month
Single Person | $671 per year | $56 per month
Married Person | $646 per year | $54 per month
[Seniors](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/best-auto-insurance-for-seniors/88292) | $658 per year | $55 per month
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different
## Average Car Insurance Cost by Credit Score
Drivers with bad credit pay an average of 71% more for car insurance than drivers with good credit, according to WalletHub’s analysis. Insurance companies [consider](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/do-car-insurance-companies-check-credit-2140723278/) drivers’ credit history because it is generally correlated with their likelihood of filing an insurance claim. They do not directly use credit scores when calculating the cost of premiums, but they use the same underlying information: [your credit report](https://wallethub.com/free-credit-report).
**Credit Score** | **Average Annual Premium** | **Average Monthly Premium**
---|---|---
Good Credit | $671 per year | $56 per month
Bad Credit | $1,633 per year | $136 per month
Note: Premiums are representative only; individual premiums will be different
For drivers in California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Washington, and Hawaii, credit data cannot be used to determine car insurance rates because it is prohibited by state law. Instead, insurance companies will simply evaluate factors such as a driver's age, driving record, vehicle, and more.
## Average Cost of Car Insurance by Year
Americans spend more than $1,000 on car insurance per year, according to the latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This data also shows that annual car insurance spending increased by roughly 39% from 2012 to 2022.
**Year** | **Average expenditure** | **% Change from previous year**
---|---|---
2012 | $812 | Info
2013 | $841 | 4%
2014 | $870 | 3%
2015 | $897 | 3%
2016 | $945 | 5%
2017 | $1,009 | 7%
2018 | $1,058 | 5%
2019 | $1,075 | 2%
2020 | $1,048 | -3%
2021 | $1,062 | 1%
2022 | $1,127 | 6%

## Other Factors That Can Affect the Cost of Auto Insurance
Auto insurance companies consider a wide variety of variables when determining the premium for a policy. Each insurance company assigns different weights to the various factors they consider, but the general components are largely the same. In addition to things like your age, what state you live in, what type of car you drive, how good your credit score is and which insurance company you choose (which are covered above), all the factors listed below can also affect the cost of car insurance.
* **Insurance history:** A long gap in your insurance history can result in higher rates, as can a history of claims.
* **Deductible:** The lower your deductible is, the higher you can expect your premium to be. This affects collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, uninsured motorist coverage, and personal injury protection.
* **How many miles you drive:** The higher your annual mileage is, the more you can expect to pay for car insurance, since there’s more opportunity for accidents.
* **When you drive:** Consistently driving late at night can lead to higher car insurance premiums, particularly with usage-based insurance, since the threat of an accident is higher.
* **ZIP code:** Accidents and vehicle thefts are more common in some areas than others, so insurance companies adjust the price of auto insurance policies accordingly.
* **Job/affiliation:** People who belong to certain professional groups or alumni associations may be eligible for a discount on their car insurance. Certain professions are also statistically less likely to file claims and may get a lower premium as a result.
* **Bundling:** If you bundle your car insurance with another type of coverage, such as home insurance, you could get a cheaper price than you would have to pay if you purchased them separately. Similarly, insuring multiple cars with the same company can get you a lower price per car.
* **Payment frequency:** Paying for a full year or six-month policy period up front is usually cheaper than paying monthly for the same time period.
* **Experience:** Your experience on the road can affect how risky you seem to insurers. You might get a cheaper premium than someone else your age if you have more experience, for example. That experience just has to reflect responsible driving to benefit you.
* **Vehicle modifications:** If you improve the performance or appearance of your car and you want the improvement to be covered, you’ll likely have to pay more for car insurance than someone with the standard version of the same vehicle.
