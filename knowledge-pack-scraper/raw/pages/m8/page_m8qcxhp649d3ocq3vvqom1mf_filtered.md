# Can you rent a motorcycle?

Renting a motorcycle works the same ways renting a car. But you'll have to meet certain requirements before you can leave the lot. Renting a motorcycle is a great option if you have limited experience with a motorcycle and you want the chance to get a feel for riding before committing to buying a bike of your own. It's also a good way to test out different models.

## How does renting a motorcycle work?

The process of renting a motorcycle is similar to renting a car. You can rent a motorcycle from a rental service or company. Here are a few of the most popular motorcycle rental businesses:

* **[EagleRider](https://www.eaglerider.com/):** This rental company allows you to choose from a wide variety of motorcycles to rent, including Harley-Davidson, Indian, BMW, Yamaha, and Honda models. EagleRider has more than 150 locations around the world.
* **[EagleShare](https://www.eagleshare.com/):** Operated by EagleRider, EagleShare connects private motorcycle owners with potential renters. Peer-to-peer ride shares offer a wider selection of models for renters.
* **[Hertz Ride](https://www.hertzride.com/us):** Hertz Ride is an international motorcycle rental and tour company that's independent of Hertz Car Rental. Its [operations in the United States are managed by EagleRider](https://www.hertzride.com/en/us-rentals). Hertz Ride specializes in premium motorcycle rentals, offering BMW, Ducati, Honda, Moto Morini, and MV Augusta models.
* **[Riders Share](https://www.riders-share.com/):** Riders Share is a peer-to-peer community similar to EagleShare, connecting private owners with potential renters.

## What do I need to rent a motorcycle?

Once you choose a rental company, you need to provide a few items before you can ride:

* **Proof of age:** Age requirements vary by rental company or service. Many rental companies require renters to show documentation that they're 21 years or older. EagleRider, however, allows 18-20-year-olds to rent if they have a valid ID, motorcycle license or endorsement, have completed the required safety courses, and rent a motorcycle that's 500cc or less.
* **Motorcycle license or endorsement:** All motorcycle rental companies and services require renters to hold a valid motorcycle license or endorsement.
* **Valid credit card:** Motorcycle renters must provide a valid credit card for a security deposit in case the renter damages the motorcycle or the motorcycle is stolen.

## Do I need motorcycle rental insurance to rent a motorcycle?

Yes, [motorcycle liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-liability-coverage/) is required by [law in nearly every state](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-motorcycle-insurance-requirements/) and is typically included as part of the rental agreement. Motorcycle liability coverage can pay for injuries you cause to others and damages while riding.

## Does motorcycle insurance cover rentals?

Depending on the carrier and your policy, a personal motorcycle insurance may cover you for injuries or damages you cause while riding a rental bike, in addition to the motorcycle rental insurance. Be sure to double check how your personal policy may cover motorcycle rentals.

The insurance from the motorcycle rental company included in your rental agreement may cover physical damage to the rental motorcycle in certain scenarios. [Motorcycle comprehensive insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-comprehensive-insurance/) and [collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-collision-coverage/) under your personal policy may also cover damage to your rental bike, depending on your policy.

Comprehensive pays to repair or replace the motorcycle if it's stolen, vandalized, or damaged in a fire or collision with an animal. Collision pays to repair or replace the motorcycle if it's damaged in an accident.
