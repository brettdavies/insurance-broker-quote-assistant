Paying $100 a month for car insurance is not particularly expensive. The average car insurance policy costs anywhere from $56 per month for state-minimum coverage to $176 per month for full coverage, and individual car insurance rates vary depending on factors such as your driving record, age and location.

*Average monthly premiums reflect nationwide quotes for a 45-year-old driver with a clean driving record.*

As you can see, $100 per month is inexpensive for full coverage from a major car insurance company, but it's not the cheapest for state-minimum coverage.

The average cost of car insurance by age and state ranges from $23 per month for 45-year-olds in [Wyoming](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance/wyoming) to $609 per month for 16-year-olds in [New York](https://wallethub.com/cheap-car-insurance/new-york). Monthly car insurance costs vary so widely based on a driver's age and state because age reflects driving experience and states require different levels of coverage. State-to-state car insurance costs also vary based on population density, crime rates, and how many uninsured drivers there are.

Full coverage insurance costs $1,997 per year or $166 per month, on average. Full coverage car insurance is more expensive than the legal minimum auto insurance coverage because full coverage usually includes collision and comprehensive insurance as well as the minimum coverage required by a state.

The cost of full coverage car insurance varies based on the state, the driver's chosen coverage limits, the driver's risk factors, and the vehicle's value. Additionally, [comprehensive](/edu/ci/best-comprehensive-insurance/5469) and...

For customers with a personal auto policy, the additional costs quoted by companies like Farmers and Erie for rideshare insurance are usually from $6 to $25 per month. Allstate offers its rideshare coverage for only $15 to $20 per year.

Rideshare insurance costs less than many drivers would think, making it well worth the price. However, prices vary and it's important to look carefully at what each company covers. Costs often vary because companies...

Car insurance costs $60 per month, on average, for a minimum coverage policy, although individual rates might vary. [Full coverage](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/full-coverage-car-insurance/10505) car insurance is more expensive because it also pays to repair or replace your car after it is damaged by a crash or something other than an accident, like vandalism.

Car insurance for a 21-year-old is $1,217 per year for minimum coverage, on average. Twenty-one-year-old drivers pay even more for full coverage, which typically includes comprehensive and collision insurance in addition to the state's minimum requirements.

Twenty-one-year-olds pay more for car insurance than older, more experienced drivers because insurers consider them to be [high-risk](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/high-risk-driver-2140720827/), meaning they're more likely to file a claim. Because the cost of coverage for 21-year-olds is so high, it's important to...
