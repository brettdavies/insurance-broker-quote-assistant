**Bankrate’s take:** Gender is not used to determine auto insurance rates in Massachusetts due to state regulations. However, in many states men pay marginally higher premiums because they are more likely to be in serious accidents.

* ######  What is the average cost of minimum coverage in Massachusetts?
The average car insurance cost in Massachusetts for minimum coverage is $649 per year, or almost $54 per month. Drivers must carry a [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/massachusetts-car-insurance-laws/#car-insurance-laws-in-massachusetts) in the Old Colony State, which is:
* $20,000 in bodily injury liability and uninsured bodily injury liability insurance per person
* $40,000 in bodily injury liability and uninsured bodily injury liability insurance per accident
* $5,000 in property damage liability insurance per accident
* $8,000 for [PIP (personal injury protection)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) insurance
* ######  What are the cheapest car insurance companies in Massachusetts?
* ######  What is the best car insurance company in Massachusetts?
* ######  Why are age, gender and credit history banned as auto insurance rating factors in Massachusetts?
Although the use of age, gender and credit history is common in most states for auto insurance underwriting, the practice receives criticism from some experts and lawmakers. Massachusetts found the inclusion of these variables to constitute [unfair discrimination](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-consumer-bill-of-rights-for-automobile-insurance) and banned them in the state. The legislation similarly prohibits the use of marital status, education level, occupation, religion, primary parking location, national origin, homeownership status and income level in auto insurance rating. The state of Massachusetts took these steps as a form of consumer protection to help prevent unfair auto insurance pricing.
