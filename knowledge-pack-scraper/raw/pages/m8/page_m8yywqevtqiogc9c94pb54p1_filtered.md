## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Massachusetts

Age and gender are not allowed to be used by insurance companies as a factor in Massachusetts car insurance rates. However, years of driving experience can affect car insurance rates in Massachusetts, which is why the rates in the table below differ [by age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/). As you can see, drivers 20 and under typically pay more for car insurance than drivers over the age of 25. The more experience you have behind the wheel, the less you may pay for car insurance in Massachusetts.

**Bankrate’s take:**
Gender is not used to determine auto insurance rates in Massachusetts due to state regulations. However, in many states men pay marginally higher premiums because they are more likely to be in serious accidents.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in Massachusetts

While it can be quite expensive for parents to add a teen to their auto insurance policy, it’s less expensive than a young driver purchasing their own policy. Young people can usually stay on their parents’ policy as long as they are still living at the same address.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Massachusetts?

One of the most critical factors in determining the cost of car insurance is your driving history. Drivers with a moving violation, like a [speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) or DUI on their driving record, generally incur a surcharge on their auto insurance policy for at least three years. For drivers with repeat infractions on their record, some car insurance companies may even deny coverage. For drivers having difficulty securing coverage, there are carriers that specialize in [high-risk auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/massachusetts/).

The table below shows an estimate of how much each incident could affect the average cost of car insurance in Massachusetts, but your final premium will vary depending on the frequency and severity of incidents, as well as each company’s underwriting process.

## How to save on car insurance in Massachusetts

While car insurance in Massachusetts is more affordable on average compared to many other states, there are still a few ways you may be able to save a little money. Here are some tips:

* **Review your annual mileage.** If you drive less than 12,000 miles, you can usually get cheaper car insurance. Some companies will offer a low mileage rate that is more affordable than the commuter rate. If you work from home or drive well below the national average miles, [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/pay-per-mile-insurance/) may be an even cheaper alternative.
* **Review your coverage needs.** If it’s been a while since you took out your policy, your insurance needs might have changed. For example, maybe you have an older, paid-off car that no longer needs full coverage. Or maybe you have extras you could do without like roadside assistance. An agent can help walk you through your policy and assess your true coverage needs.
* **Explore car insurance with telematics.** Many car insurance companies now offer [telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) that monitor driving habits through an app or plug-in device and reward drivers for safe driving habits. This could be a good opportunity to practice safe driving, like maintaining a legal speed and braking slowly, while also earning a discount on your car insurance. Be aware that some providers reserve the right to raise your premium if the telematics program finds unsafe driving habits.
* **Increase your deductibles.** By raising your [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/), you take on more financial responsibility in the event of a claim, so your insurance provider might reduce your premium. However, if you adjust your deductible, be sure it remains an amount you can easily afford to pay if needed.
* **Check for discount opportunities.** If you’re in a specific profession, part of an organization or are a young driver still in school, you might qualify for discounted rates. Ask an agent about discounts for which you might qualify when gathering quotes from new providers or preparing to renew your policy with your current insurer.
* **Bundle your insurance.** If you need both car insurance and home or renters insurance, consider purchasing them from the same company. A multi-policy discount can typically shave a decent amount off your premium each year.
* **Shop around.** If you’re looking for a new policy or it’s been a while since you originally purchased insurance, you may want to request quotes from several insurance companies. Insurers price policies differently, so you might pay more for the same coverage with one company versus another. Be sure to specify the same coverage types and policy limits for each quote so it’s easier to compare them.

## Frequently asked questions

* ###### What is the average cost of minimum coverage in Massachusetts?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The average car insurance cost in Massachusetts for minimum coverage is $649 per year, or almost $54 per month.  Drivers must carry a [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/massachusetts-car-insurance-laws/#car-insurance-laws-in-massachusetts) in the Old Colony State, which is:

  + $20,000 in bodily injury liability and uninsured bodily injury liability insurance per person
  + $40,000 in bodily injury liability and uninsured bodily injury liability insurance per accident
  + $5,000 in property damage liability insurance per accident
  + $8,000 for [PIP (personal injury protection)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) insurance

  Uninsured motorist coverage is also required and should also match liability limits. Although only the minimum coverage is required, many drivers would benefit from higher limits to provide greater financial protection in an at-fault accident. Working with a licensed insurance agent can help identify how much car insurance you need in Massachusetts.

* ###### Why are age, gender and credit history banned as auto insurance rating factors in Massachusetts?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Although the use of age, gender and credit history is common in most states for auto insurance underwriting, the practice receives criticism from some experts and lawmakers. Massachusetts found the inclusion of these variables to constitute [unfair discrimination](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-consumer-bill-of-rights-for-automobile-insurance) and banned them in the state. The legislation similarly prohibits the use of marital status, education level, occupation, religion, primary parking location, national origin, homeownership status and income level in auto insurance rating. The state of Massachusetts took these steps as a form of consumer protection to help prevent unfair auto insurance pricing.
