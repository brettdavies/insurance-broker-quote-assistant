Bankrate's take

Policyholders who live in Florida and cannot find standard home insurance coverage might consider Citizens as a last resort.

* Company highlights
* Average rates from Citizens

* Available to Florida homeowners who otherwise cannot afford home insurance with other carriers
* Offers standalone wind insurance
* Coverage can only be purchased through an agent
* Mitigation discounts available
* Not rated by J.D. Power for claims satisfaction or customer service

New

What’s new with Citizens?

* As of November 2024, Citizens' policy count dropped below 1 million for the first time in two years. The company transferred more than 428,000 policies to private insurers over the course of the year, marking a 19.5 percent decrease in the number of policies held by the company. As the insurer of last resort for Florida homeowners, Citizens' leadership team saw this as a positive sign.
* On June 18, 2024, Citizens submitted a 13.5 percent rate increase proposal to the Office of Insurance Regulation for review. If approved this would impact the rate of home, condo, unit owners, renters and mobile home policies.
* As of May 13, 2024 policyholders who are required to purchase flood insurance are no longer required to carry flood coverage on their personal property.
* Effective July 1, 2023, the discovery period in which Citizens can [cancel a new business policy](https://www.citizensfla.com/-/20230630-underwriting-rule-changes) if the homeowner has not met the underwriting requirements is shortened from 90 to 60 days. This change does not alter the discovery period for policies obtained through receivership or insolvency.
* Effective July 1, 2023, Citizens cannot issue nonrenewals or cancel policies until damage from covered claims is repaired or until one year after the last claim payment, whichever is sooner. Damage caused by wind or hurricanes following a declaration of emergency holds a different provision.
* In December 2022, the Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 2-A, which includes reform to the Citizens insurance program. To qualify for a policy from Citizens, shoppers must prove that the private market quotes they received are more than 20 percent higher than Citizens’ rate. Additionally, all Citizens policyholders will be required to carry flood insurance, although this step will roll out in [several phases](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022A/2A/BillText/er/PDF).

## Citizens home insurance

Citizens Property Insurance Corporation of Florida is a nonprofit insurer operating in the state of Florida only. It was established in 2002 to provide a last-resort option for homeowners in [Florida's troubled insurance market](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/florida-homeowners-insurance-crisis/) who were not able to find coverage elsewhere. The increase in violent and unpredictable weather patterns in the state has spurred some insurers to stop underwriting policies here, and the average cost of homeowners coverage in Florida is considerably higher than the national average.

For homeowners in the Sunshine State who wonder if this insurer is a good option, Bankrate’s Citizens insurance review delves into the company’s offerings and restrictions. Although Citizens is unlikely to appeal to those who can find lower-cost coverage elsewhere, it may be the only possible choice for coverage for homeowners with property in high-risk areas.

In August 2022, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation granted Citizens a 6.4 percent rate increase for new and renewal home insurance businesses, effective Sept. 1, 2022. Citizens had originally requested a 10.7 percent increase.

Citizens began 2022 with 776,790 policies and ballooned to 1,111,283 by October that year, a 43 percent increase. Since insuring so many of Florida’s high-risk homes could create problems in the aftermath of a catastrophic loss, Citizens implemented efforts to reduce its number of policies, which effectively dropped to 935,948 as of Dec. 20, 2024.

Among other forms of coverage, Citizens sells HO-3 home insurance policies, which are the most common type sold by home insurance companies in the Sunshine State. These policies cover the structure of your home, detached structures, your personal property, additional living expenses, medical payments and liability exposure. You may be able to add a few [endorsements](https://www.citizensfla.com/optional-coverages), too, like sinkhole coverage and personal property replacement cost, for more robust financial protection.

To [qualify for Citizen home insurance](https://www.citizensfla.com/personal-policies), you must be able to show that you have not been able to obtain coverage through any Florida insurer or that the cost of a policy from other Florida insurers is more than 20 percent higher than the cost of a Citizens policy. Citizens also requires policyholders to carry flood insurance, which adds an additional premium. These regulations are likely in place to help encourage homeowners to seek private insurance.

### Pros and cons of Citizens homeowners insurance

As is true of all insurance companies, there are pros and cons of purchasing a policy from Citizens. If you are a Florida homeowner in a high-risk region and have been turned down for affordable coverage with other companies, Citizens may be a viable last-ditch option. Since the company's average rates are relatively high, it is likely not a good option for those looking for cheap homeowners insurance in Florida. If you are unable to find conventional coverage and are considering Citizens, the following perks and drawbacks may matter to you.

![Green circle with a checkmark inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/circle-check.svg)

### Pros

* Available for most homes in areas of Florida with limited or no other insurance option
* Offers standalone wind coverage
* 24/7 claim reporting

![Red circle with an X inside](https://www.bankrate.com/v6.596.2/next/img/svg/remove-circle.svg)

### Cons

* Must go through an agent for quotes
* Premiums are likely to be high
* Home must meet eligibility criteria

### Citizens home insurance cost

While the September 2025 [average cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) in Florida is $5,838 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage, Citizens may be a cheaper insurance option than private insurers. One of the ways to qualify for coverage with Citizens is to show that the rates for a comparable policy with private insurers are more than 20 percent higher than the rates with Citizens. The September 2025 average cost of home insurance with Citizens is $9,582 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage.

Keep in mind that while Citizens rate is 295 percent more than the state average, it isn’t a true apples-to-apples comparison. Citizens is the insurer of last resort, so the bulk of its business is homes that are deemed high-risk for any number of reasons.

### Citizens customer satisfaction

When [comparing home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) companies, reviewing financial strength and customer satisfaction may help you determine if you will be satisfied with a carrier's service. Citizens Insurance reviews are scarce, with neither [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) nor Demotech rating the company for financial strength.

In June 2023, Fitch Ratings gave the company a [“stable” outlook with a AA rating](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-affirms-fl-state-board-of-administration-finance-corp-rev-bonds-at-aa-outlook-stable-07-07-2023) for the second year in a row, but [withdrew its ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-withdraws-ratings-on-certain-citizens-property-insurance-corporation-fl-bond-maturities-06-12-2023) on Citizens FL Security Bonds in December 2023 because the bonds were prerefunded. As it stands now, [Citizens’ latest financial report](https://www.citizensfla.com/documents/20702/30166328/20231206+03Aa+2023+and+2024+Budget+Projected_Layer_Charts.pdf/095c54a3-f878-201e-5a97-7edb495b9dd1?t=1706027630434) showed a $5 billion surplus at the end of December 2023.

Citizens only exists in Florida. Although there are other companies with the same name in other states, they are not affiliated with Citizens in Florida. As a regional company, Citizens wasn’t rated by [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-home-insurance-study?srsltid=AfmBOopPWegRaodULwJcaht5rxg4yC210FHeF-Zt1xlR3ryto_V5jUPa) for customer or claims satisfaction.

#### Citizens home insurance customer complaints

The [National Association of Insurance Commissions (NAIC)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) does track complaints against Citizens. The company has [scored well](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=10064&REALM=PROD&COCODE=10064&REALM=PROD) for each of the last three years, coming in at less than the industry average of 1.00. This suggests that Citizens has fewer-than-average complaints lodged against it, which is good news for Florida policyholders.

### Citizens home insurance discounts

Homeowners who want to [save money on home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/keep-home-insurance-cost-down/) may be able to take advantage of discounts through Citizens Property Insurance. In order to qualify for many of these discounts, you must get a home inspection first. Below are some of the most impactful discounts that Citizens offers:

* **Florida building code compliance discount:** If your home was built on or after Jan. 1, 2002, you may qualify for this discount based on the building codes your home was constructed under. If your home was built prior to 2002 but you have an updated roof that meets the 2002 Florida Building Code, you may also qualify.
* **Monitored alarm system discounts:** If your home has a centrally monitored fire or burglar alarm, or both, you may get a discount. Centrally monitored alarms automatically alert emergency services to dangerous situations.
* **Roof construction discount:** You may save on your Citizens policy if your roof has certain construction features, although you might need to provide the results of a roof or wind mitigation inspection to qualify. If you’re already getting the building code compliance discount, you likely won’t qualify for a separate roof discount.
* **Wind mitigation discount:** If your home has documented wind-damage mitigation features, you could qualify for a lower rate. Examples include storm shutters and doors that are designed to withstand projectiles.

## Compare Citizens with other insurers

Keep in mind that not all companies are available in all areas of Florida. Eligibility may also be restricted based on your home’s unique features. Talking with an agent from each company is the best way to know if you qualify for coverage and if the coverage will fit your needs.

Citizens insures Florida homes that many other carriers shy away from. For homeowners in coastal areas and other storm-prone parts of the state, Citizens may be the only way to get home insurance coverage. As Florida’s [home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) market continues to fluctuate, Citizens may allow homeowners to obtain some measure of financial protection. However, Citizens policies are more basic than you could find elsewhere and you will be required to buy flood insurance to get or maintain coverage with Citizens. Remember that Citizens isn’t designed to be an insurer of choice, but rather an insurer of last resort.

## What are real-life customers saying about Citizens?

Reading customer reviews and candid messages among policyholders is another good way to learn how they feel about their insurance provider. Citizens is unique in that most of its customers don’t have a choice to go with another carrier, and they all were deemed “high-risk” by other carriers. Recent reviews aren’t readily available on most sites, but Reddit has the most current posts.

### Reddit

Most of the reviews concern the rising cost of insurance and Citizens' efforts to depopulate their book of business. To provide some context for the following reviews posted on Reddit, keep in mind that Citizens is legally required to move any policy off the books that has a valid insurance offer priced within 20 percent of the current Citizens policy premium. A valid concern of most policyholders is what happens after their new insurance company renews their policy the following year.

Citizens depopulation

“We got a letter from Citizens last fall that "Good News! A regular insurance company is willing to offer you coverage!" It was Slide and the premium was close to double what Citizens was so we were able to decline.

Offloaded and premium increase

“My Citizens barely increased and then I was notified for renewal. Then a week later, I was told that I was being pushed onto another company, with no choice in the matter, and now my policy will be going up $500 a year for a company with a notoriously awful track record. UGH.”

### Citizens tools and benefits

Citizens' primary focus is to provide property insurance for people who can not purchase it through the private market. That said, they have a number of coverage options applicable to this particular high-risk market.

* **Commercial properties**: Citizens can offer multiperil and wind-only policies to qualifying commercial properties that are used for residential purposes such as apartment buildings and retirement community buildings. These policies exclude personal liability coverage. Non-residential commercial properties may qualify for wind-only policies.
* **Sinkhole loss coverage**: [Sinkholes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/sinkhole-insurance/) and other ground subsidence losses are excluded from most home insurance policies. This optional endorsement can provide coverage for structural damage resulting from a sinkhole loss.
* **Personal property replacement cost**: Standard home insurance policies provide coverage for [personal property](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance/) at actual cash value (ACV), which takes into account depreciation. This optional endorsement will pay to repair or replace your personal property at [replacement cost value](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rcv-vs-acv/), minus your deductible.
* **Increased limits for ordinance or law**: There are times when a home is damaged in a covered claim and the state requires the repair to include updates to meet current building codes or laws. The increased cost is usually excluded from most home insurance policies and this optional coverage can help you bridge the gap between your claim payout and the added cost of the required updates.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
