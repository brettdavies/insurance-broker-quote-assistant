#  How (And Should I) Complete Steer Clear State Farm 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
Hello, 
My dad came across "Steer Clear" by state farm which is a program that allows discounts for young drivers who complete the program. I already did all of the "modules" on the app, but now it says I need to complete 5 hours of driving within 10 trips with the app somehow tracking me to ensure I drive safely. 
I don't really know what all this entails and I'm curious if anyone knows how it works and if it's even worth it. I want to save my old man some money but not if it means I potentially risk raising his rates through this app tracking.

You start the app and click start drive. Put the phone down. When you are done driving click finished. It will give you feedback. It is to help you be a better driver. Once all the drives are done you will get a completion certificate you email to the agent. It is a huge discount. It cannot penalize your dad or increase his rates at all.

Could I, for example, use my phone to listen to music while it's activated? Or will this create an issue on the app. Just want to know before I start

I believe there is no phone usage while doing it (part of the lesson). If you start the music first and then put on the app I think it might work.

It will save you and you should be able to just sign a paper saying you completed the requirements and understand that if you have an accident or ticket you will lose the discount. Ask your agent for the form.
