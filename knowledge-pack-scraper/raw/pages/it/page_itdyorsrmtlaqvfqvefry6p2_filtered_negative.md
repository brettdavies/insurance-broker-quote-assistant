* $25,000 for **bodily injury** per person $50,000 per accident [liability protection _for injury to others_] There is also a matching minimum for **uninsured / underinsured motorist** coverage;
* $10,000 for **property damage** per accident [for damage caused _to property of others_];
Often potential clients come to our offices thinking that because their insurance agent told them they have “full coverage” that means they have _sufficient_ coverage. This may not be so. “Full coverage” simply means, in addition to the liability and No-Fault, coverage, you also have **collision coverage** [for damage _to your car_ from a collision] and **comprehensive coverage** [for damage _to your car_ from non-collision events, such as theft, vandalism, fire, weather, etc.]. This “full coverage” is often required by a lender, while payments are being made. “Full coverage” doesn’t protect you as much as it protects _the lender_. Alone, it certainly does not increase the amount of protection that you have if you are injured.
For the reasons we discuss below, we at [The Eskesen Law Firm](https://nypifirm.com/) suggest that drivers opt for higher-than-minimum limits for **bodily injury** and **uninsured / underinsured motorist** claims at the very least.
Beyond this notion of being responsible towards others, there is a more self-interested reason we recommend purchasing more than the New York State minimum. When you buy higher liability coverage to _protect others_, you also can add that higher limit to your uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. This helps _protect you_ when someone injures you and they do not have insurance, or they do not have enough insurance to adequately compensate for the injuries they cause.
While sticking to the state minimum insurance requirements might seem like a way to save money, it can lead to greater financial risks. By opting for higher coverage limits and making sure you include increased uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, you are safeguarding yourself, your passengers, and your assets with minimal increased expense. Do not settle for state minimum limits. When shopping for insurance, do not simply opt for the _cheapest coverage_. Instead, decide which higher-than-minimum coverage limit best suits you, be it $100,000/$300,000, $250,000/$500,000, or some other amount, then feel free to shop around for the _cheapest_ _company_ that will provide that coverage to you.
