* **Who uses them:** Property damage liability insurance is required by all drivers in the state of Illinois as part of their auto insurance policy. General liability insurance is used by businesses and other parties, such as contractors and service providers, that interact with customers, suppliers, or the general public.
* **Their scope:** Property damage liability insurance only covers property damage that results from an auto accident. General liability insurance also covers property damage, but its scope includes other types of liability risks, such as bodily injury claims.
* **Vehicle damage:** Most accidents include two or more vehicles. If you're the at-fault driver, property damage liability insurance will cover repair costs for other involved vehicles but not your own.
* **Structural damage:** You may accidentally hit various structures, such as buildings, fences, poles, mailboxes, and others. This type of insurance will cover the repair or replacement costs for these.
* **Public property damage:** Some accidents damage public property, such as traffic signs, traffic lights, guardrails, or benches. Being insured prevents you from being financially liable for these damages.

Let’s just say that you have a clean driving history and a decent liability-only policy ends up costing about $550 per year. Combined with a comprehensive and collision policy, your annual cost rises to about $1,060. If you only want to meet the state minimum requirement, you might be looking at around $425 liability only, or $940 comprehensive.
