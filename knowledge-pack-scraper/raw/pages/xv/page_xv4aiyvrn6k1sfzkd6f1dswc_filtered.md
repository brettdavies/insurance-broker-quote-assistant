Car accidents in New York can change your life in an instant. Beyond the damage to your car, you may face expensive medical bills, time away from work, and the stress of recovery. Most drivers in New York rely on their car insurance to help cover these costs, but understanding what is included can be confusing.

New York is a no-fault state, which means your own insurance pays for medical expenses after a crash, no matter who caused it. While this system is designed to provide quick access to care, it does not always cover everything. Knowing what your policy includes and what options you have if your bills exceed those limits is important.

If you or a loved one has been injured in a crash, our team at Cellino Law can help. Fill out our [online form](http://cellinolaw.com/contact/) today to schedule a free consultation and learn more about your options for recovery.

## **Why Car Insurance Coverage Matters in New York**

Car accidents can lead to more than physical injuries—they can bring major financial challenges. Medical bills, time away from work, and damage to your vehicle can quickly add up. Without the right insurance, many drivers would struggle to cover these costs.

Auto insurance gives drivers a safety net. In New York, it can help pay for part of your medical expenses and lost wages, reducing the financial strain after a crash. Even if you consider yourself a safe driver, you cannot predict when someone else’s reckless actions may cause an accident.

Having proper insurance means you’re prepared for the unexpected. It protects you from facing the full financial burden of a serious accident and ensures you have support when you need it most.

## **Minimum Car Insurance Requirements in New York**

In New York, all drivers are required by law to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance. Because New York is a no-fault state, every driver must have [Personal Injury Protection (PIP)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/nofault_faqs) coverage. PIP pays for part of your medical bills and lost wages after an accident, no matter who was at fault. The minimum required amount of PIP coverage is $50,000.

Drivers must also carry liability insurance. This type of coverage protects you if another person claims you were negligent and caused the crash. Liability insurance helps pay for the other person’s damages when you are responsible.

Here are the [minimum liability insurance limits](https://dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-requirements) set by New York law:

●     $25,000 for bodily injury to one person

●     $50,000 for wrongful death of a person

●     $50,000 for bodily injury to two or more people

●     $10,000 for property damage

New York also requires [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.cellinolaw.com/blogs/what-is-sum-coverage-and-why-do-i-need-it/). This coverage protects you if you are hit by a driver who does not have insurance or when you are injured by a hit and run driver.  New York provides OPTIONAL underinsured motorist coverage which protects you if the at fault or driver does not have enough coverage to pay for the damages they caused.

## **How Much of Your Medical Bills Are Covered?**

Under New York’s no-fault system, PIP covers up to 100% of reasonable medical expenses related to your accident, capped at the policy limit. With standard coverage, that means up to $50,000 per person.

Covered medical expenses often include:

●     Ambulance and emergency care

●     Hospitalization and doctor visits

●     Diagnostic tests such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans

●     Surgery

●     Prescription medications

●     Rehabilitation and physical therapy

●     Nursing services in the hospital or at home

This coverage can make a major difference, but it may not be enough if your injuries are severe. Once your PIP benefits are used up, you may need to file a claim against the at-fault driver or use your health insurance to continue treatment.

## **Common Medical Expenses After a Car Accident**

The costs after a crash often begin the moment first responders arrive. An ambulance ride and emergency medical treatment can add up quickly. If your injuries require a hospital stay, bills may include room charges, lab work, and follow-up visits.

Some injuries require surgery, which is often preceded by diagnostic testing. A broken bone, for example, may not heal without surgical intervention. PIP can help cover both the surgery and the testing needed beforehand.

Many accident victims also need ongoing care, such as physical therapy, to fully recover. In more serious cases, nursing care may be required at home. These costs are also covered up to policy limits under New York car insurance.

## **When Insurance Is Not Enough**

Unfortunately, medical bills can exceed the limits of basic PIP coverage. Injuries like traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, or multiple fractures often require long-term treatment that costs far more than $50,000.

When this happens, you may have several options:

●     File a claim against the at-fault driver to recover damages beyond your PIP coverage.

●     Use your health insurance once PIP benefits run out.

●     Work with an attorney to pursue compensation through a personal injury lawsuit.

Understanding your next steps can be difficult, which is why speaking with an [experienced lawyer](https://www.cellinolaw.com/car-accident-lawyer/) can help protect your rights.

## **Protecting Your Rights After a Car Accident**

Insurance is meant to provide financial relief, but the claims process can be frustrating. Delays, denials, or underpayments are [common tactics](https://www.cellinolaw.com/blogs/dirty-tactics-insurance-companies-use-against-accident-victims/) used by the insurance company to minimize payouts. Having a strong legal advocate can make a major difference in the outcome of your case.

A lawyer can explain what your insurance covers, help you file claims, gather evidence to prove the extent of your injuries, negotiate with insurers, and represent you in court if necessary.

* Choosing the right attorney to represent you after an accident can make all the difference. This is no cliche. I recently experienced these words to live by first hand. After a tractor trailer rear ended me at high speed in 2017 I retained Allan Silverstein to handle my case. I quickly realized that bringing a lawsuit rapidly snowballs into a mountain of details that can make or break your results. Documents, case histories, doctor visits, bills, and lots of phone calls all need to be accurately kept track of if a successful outcome it to be attained. To complicate matters I reside in New York and the incident took place in New Jersey. Luckily, Allan was licensed in multiple states. I was fortunate to find Allan to handle this matter from the New York area.
  Armed with an accurate account of the facts Allan went to work on the difficult job of negotiating with the defending insurance company as well as my no fault carrier in order to obtain the best possible outcome for my set of circumstances. In a lawsuit communication is key and and events can be of a timely nature. Allan never failed to return my calls - usually the same day! He fought skillfully and respectfully to get me the best possible settlement. He is easy to deal with and a likeable down to earth guy. He always listened with compassion and respect to my issues. He guided me with objective understanding as well as a realistic analysis of the merits of my case. When we finally settled Allan got me a fair agreement beyond my expectations and negotiated with my doctors to make sure all my bills were paid. It was a great experience having Allan represent me. Quality work in any aspect of life is hard to find. Quality is what I got with Allan Silverstein. I highly recommend him if you find yourself in need of a personal injury attorney.
