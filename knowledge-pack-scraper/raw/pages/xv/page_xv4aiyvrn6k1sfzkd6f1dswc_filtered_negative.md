![What Medical Expenses Are Covered by Car Insurance in New York?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
In New York, all drivers are required by law to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance. Because New York is a no-fault state, every driver must have[ Personal Injury Protection (PIP)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/nofault_faqs) coverage. PIP pays for part of your medical bills and lost wages after an accident, no matter who was at fault. The minimum required amount of PIP coverage is $50,000.
Here are the[ minimum liability insurance limits](https://dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-requirements) set by New York law:
● $25,000 for bodily injury to one person
● $50,000 for wrongful death of a person
● $50,000 for bodily injury to two or more people
● $10,000 for property damage
New York also requires[ uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.cellinolaw.com/blogs/what-is-sum-coverage-and-why-do-i-need-it/). This coverage protects you if you are hit by a driver who does not have insurance or when you are injured by a hit and run driver. New York provides OPTIONAL underinsured motorist coverage which protects you if the at fault or driver does not have enough coverage to pay for the damages they caused.
● Ambulance and emergency care
● Hospitalization and doctor visits
● Diagnostic tests such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans
● Surgery
● Prescription medications
● Rehabilitation and physical therapy
● Nursing services in the hospital or at home
● File a claim against the at-fault driver to recover damages beyond your PIP coverage.
● Use your health insurance once PIP benefits run out.
● Work with an attorney to pursue compensation through a personal injury lawsuit.
Understanding your next steps can be difficult, which is why speaking with an[ experienced lawyer](https://www.cellinolaw.com/car-accident-lawyer/) can help protect your rights.
Insurance is meant to provide financial relief, but the claims process can be frustrating. Delays, denials, or underpayments are[ common tactics](https://www.cellinolaw.com/blogs/dirty-tactics-insurance-companies-use-against-accident-victims/) used by the insurance company to minimize payouts. Having a strong legal advocate can make a major difference in the outcome of your case.
Fill out our[ online form](https://www.cellinolaw.com/contact/) today or call us at [888-888-8888](tel:8888888888) for a free case consultation. We are ready to listen to your story and fight for the financial recovery you deserve.

* Choosing the right attorney to represent you after an accident can make all the difference. This is no cliche. I recently experienced these words to live by first hand. After a tractor trailer rear ended me at high speed in 2017 I retained Allan Silverstein to handle my case. I quickly realized that bringing a lawsuit rapidly snowballs into a mountain of details that can make or break your results. Documents, case histories, doctor visits, bills, and lots of phone calls all need to be accurately kept track of if a successful outcome it to be attained. To complicate matters I reside in New York and the incident took place in New Jersey. Luckily, Allan was licensed in multiple states. I was fortunate to find Allan to handle this matter from the New York area. Armed with an accurate account of the facts Allan went to work on the difficult job of negotiating with the defending insurance company as well as my no fault carrier in order to obtain the best possible outcome for my set of circumstances. In a lawsuit communication is key and and events can be of a timely nature. Allan never failed to return my calls - usually the same day! He fought skillfully and respectfully to get me the best possible settlement. He is easy to deal with and a likeable down to earth guy. He always listened with compassion and respect to my issues. He guided me with objective understanding as well as a realistic analysis of the merits of my case. When we finally settled Allan got me a fair agreement beyond my expectations and negotiated with my doctors to make sure all my bills were paid. It was a great experience having Allan represent me. Quality work in any aspect of life is hard to find. Quality is what I got with Allan Silverstein. I highly recommend him if you find yourself in need of a personal injury attorney.
