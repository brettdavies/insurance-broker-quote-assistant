## GEICO Car Insurance Overview
[GEICO Auto Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/vbf0f5978c4d)GEICO auto insurance offers some of the most affordable rates across all ages and driving histories, on top of its discounts to lower your premiums even further. Available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., GEICO is one of the[ cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/auto-insurance/best-cheap-car-insurance-companies), great for those on a tight budget. It also made it onto our guide to the [best full coverage car insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/auto-insurance/best-cheap-full-coverage-car-insurance).
GEICO also offers some nice benefits and tools, such as free accident forgiveness after five years of accident-free driving and its mobile app, where drivers can request roadside assistance, file claims, manage their policies, and access a digital auto insurance ID card.
GEICO also offers its DriveEasy program through its mobile app. The app tracks driving habits and offers discounts for good driving. Eligible policyholders can get a discount simply by signing up for the program.
However, GEICO is not without its flaws. For one, it lacks many of the additional options and features many of its popular competitors offer, like gap insurance, rideshare coverage, new car replacement insurance, and vanishing deductibles. It also lacks loyalty discounts beyond bundling and multi-car discounts.
It's also worth noting that GEICO's claims satisfaction is on the lower end of the industry, according to J.D. Power's 2024 auto insurance survey. It placed 14 out of 21 auto insurance companies for claims satisfaction.
Ultimately, GEICO is best for people looking for cheap auto insurance coverage. People looking for a variety of coverage options and who are willing to pay more for them may want to look elsewhere.
## GEICO Car Insurance Plans Available
GEICO insurance meets most customers' standard auto insurance requirements. This is true whether you need basic coverage to meet state requirements or if you're financing or leasing a vehicle. Coverage options include:
* **Collision coverage:** This coverage will pay for damages to your vehicle due to a collision-related accident, regardless of who's at fault.
* **Comprehensive coverage:** This coverage pays for non-collision-related damages such as theft, glass breakage, natural disasters, and hitting an animal. Glass coverage might be available separately through other insurers but is included in GEICO's comprehensive coverage in most cases. If you have questions, call a GEICO agent to discuss your options.
* **Bodily injury liability coverage:** Most states require this coverage. It pays for the other party's medical expenses, prescriptions, lost wages, and pain and suffering when you're at fault in an accident.
* **Property damage liability coverage:** Almost all states require you to purchase this coverage. If you're at fault in an accident, liability coverage will pay for the depreciated value of the other party's vehicle, rental cars, and non-vehicular objects you damaged during the incident.
* **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage:** This coverage will pay for your vehicle's repairs and medical expenses if the other party is at fault in an accident and lacks liability insurance.
* **Medical payment coverage:** If you're involved in an accident, GEICO will cover you and your passenger's medical expenses, regardless if you were at fault.
* **Personal injury protection coverage:** This insurance will pay you and your passenger's medical bills, even if you were at fault in an accident. It will also pay lost wages due to injury.
### Additional Coverage Options offered by GEICO Car Insurance (Riders)
Take a look at the following optional coverages offered by GEICO:
* **Mechanical breakdown insurance:** This optional coverage will reimburse you for the cost of repairs and replacement if your car breaks down.
* **Emergency Roadside Service (ERS)**: Through GEICO's [roadside assistance coverage](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/auto-insurance/what-is-roadside-assistance), policyholders can get coverage for a number of issues, like a dead battery, no fuel, or flat tire. Roadside assistance can also cover towing costs to the nearest repair facility.
* **Accident forgiveness:** This optional insurance helps you avoid premium increases after your first accident. Customers who have gone five years without an accident may earn free accident forgiveness.
* **Rental reimbursement:** GEICO will reimburse you for rental car expenses while your damaged car is serviced at the repair shop.
Be aware that your actual options will vary depending on your state.
## How Much Does GEICO Auto Insurance Cost?
Car insurance premiums will vary depending on your personal information, including your age, gender, driving history, car make and model, and even your credit score.
The table below shows the average annual cost of GEICO for different coverage amounts:
Coverage amount | Average annual rate for GEICO
---|---
Required state minimum | $402
Full coverage ($50,000/$100,000) | $1,192
Full coverage ($100,000/$300,000) | $1,261
**_Source:_**_Policygenius_
For reference, the average annual premium for liability-only insurance is $617, and the average full coverage policy costs $1,638.
As you can see, GEICO's car insurance is far cheaper than the average car insurance policy. It can be even cheaper if paired with its long list of discount options. One of its deals includes a multi-policy discount and a multi-vehicle discount of up to 25%. However, consumers may be underwhelmed by its lack of coverage options and limited access to local agents.
_Note: Policygenius used Quadrant data to obtain the average cost of a full coverage policy from GEICO. The sample includes 50/100/50 coverage limits and $500 deductibles for comprehensive and collision coverage for single drivers aged 30, 35, and 45 driving a 2017 Toyota Camry LE about 10,000 miles per year._
### GEICO Car Insurance Discounts
GEICO explicitly offers 16 discounts to help drivers reduce their auto insurance premiums. Drivers may be eligible for more or fewer discounts based on their home state. Here are the discounts available to GEICO policyholders:
* **DriveEasy discount:** DriveEasy is GEICO's driving tracker, which scores a driver's driving habits through a mobile app. Policyholders can earn a discount for signing up and additional discounts for good driving. Enrolling is optional.
* **Airbag discount:** Up to 23% off medical payments and PIP insurance if your car has airbags.
* **Anti-lock brake discount:** Up to 5% off if your car has a factory-installed anti-lock braking system.
* **Anti-Theft System Discount:** Up to 23% off comprehensive coverage premiums on cars with a built-in anti-theft system.
* **Daytime Running Lights Discount:** 3% off for cars with daytime running lights as standard equipment.
* **New Vehicle Discount:** 15% off certain car coverages for insuring vehicle models 3 years old or younger.
* **5-Year Accident-Free Good Driver Discount:** 22% off most coverages for being accident-free for 5 years.
* **Seat Belt Use Discount:** Earn a discount on medical payments and PIP insurance if you and your passengers buckle up. The exact discount can vary.

* **Driver's Education Discount:** Young drivers who complete a driver's education course can earn a discount on most coverages.
* **Good Student Discount:** Full-time students with a "B" average or higher can earn up to 15% off certain coverages.
* **Emergency Deployment Discount:** GEICO offers a 25% discount to members of the U.S. military who are part of an emergency deployment to an imminent danger zone.
* **Federal Employee Discount (Eagle Discount):** Active and retired federal employees are eligible for the Eagle Discount, which offers up to 12% off total auto insurance premiums. Eligibility varies by state.
* **Membership and Employee Discounts:** Membership with [**_one of the 500+ groups listed here_**](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/organization-member/) can earn you additional discounts. This discount is mutually exclusive with the Eagle Discount.
* **Military Discount:** Active duty, retired military, members of the National Guard, and reserves are eligible for up to 15% off certain coverages.
* **Multi-Vehicle Discount:** Up to 25% off most coverages for insuring multiple vehicles.
* **Multi-Policy Discount:** Discounts for enrolling in GEICO's other insurance policies, such as homeowners, renters, condo, or mobile home insurance.
## How to Purchase and Manage a GEICO Car Insurance Policy
Drivers can purchase a policy online at GEICO.com or by calling (800) 207-7847. Keeping the following information (for you and any other drivers) nearby can make the process quicker:
**Personal information:**
* Date of birth
* Name
* Address
* Gender
* Marital status
* Homeownership status (Rent or Own)
* Education level
* Occupation
* Government employee, military, or member affiliation status
* Contact information
* Payment information
**Vehicle information:**
* Make, model, year
* Ownership (Lease, Finance, or Own)
* Primary use (Pleasure, Work/School, Personal)
* Annual mileage
**Driving history:**
* Age you were first licensed
* Past incidents (moving violations, criminal record, suspensions, etc.)
Review your state's DMV or insurance regulatory site to determine how much insurance you must carry. If you have a car loan, your lender may require you to carry full-coverage insurance.
## How to File a Claim with GEICO Car Insurance
If you need to file a claim with GEICO, you can do so on the GEICO mobile app, the GEICO Claims Center, or phone a representative at (800)-841-3000. Remember, you must pay a deductible before GEICO reimburses your claim. If your deductible exceeds your claim amount, GEICO may deny your claim.
The Insurance Information Institute outlines information and documents you should gather to start a GEICO claim:
* Names and contact information of everyone involved in the accident, including witnesses
* Pictures of everyone's license, car registration, and insurance ID cards
* Makes and models of the vehicles involved
* Details including the location of the accident, time, and weather conditions
* If the police were on the scene, the police report number
How long your claim takes depends on the severity of the incident and your insurance company. A minor bender can take a couple of weeks, while a multi-car accident can take months. You can manage and track the status of your claim through your GEICO online account or mobile app.
### What if GEICO Denies My Car Insurance Claim?
If GEICO denies your claim or pays a low settlement, you can request an appeal. Your insurance policy should provide appeal instructions. Alternatively, you can speak to your local insurance agent for more help. Be aware that GEICO may request additional evidence or conduct another inspection as part of the process.
If you're still unhappy with the outcome, you can file a complaint with your state's insurance commissioner or hire an experienced car accident attorney to investigate further.
## GEICO Car Insurance Customer Reviews and Ratings
GEICO car insurance has overwhelmingly negative reviews, receiving an average of 1.2 stars on Trustpilot and 1.11 stars on its Better Business Bureau page. Complaints revolve around GEICO's poor customer service, reporting errors like sending checks to the wrong address and charging the wrong amount for a policy.
Customers also complained that claims payouts were delayed and their rental car reimbursement claims were denied. We also saw consistent complaints about rises in monthly premiums.
GEICO's mobile app reviews are a different story, with exceedingly high reviews. GEICO Mobile has an average rating of 4.6 on the Google Play store and 4.8 on the Apple app store. Most negative reviews revolve around GEICO's DriveEasy function, reporting that the app incorrectly faults drivers for phone use while driving. Additionally, users reported having to constantly tell the app they're not driving when they're a passenger, or when they're traveling in another vehicle like a plane or boat.
It's worth noting that reviews pertain to GEICO and all of its services, not just auto insurance. Additionally, customer reviews should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are often left by people with something negative to say.
For more information on customer satisfaction, we can look at ratings from third-party organizations.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' complaint index rates insurance companies based on how many complaints they receive against their share of the market. A 1.00 means that a company has an expected number of complaints based on its size. A lower score indicates fewer complaints than expected, and a higher number indicates more complaints than expected. GEICO scored 1.83, indicating that it has a little less than double the number of customer complaints expected.
GEICO placed 14 out of 21 car insurance companies surveyed in J.D. Power's claims satisfaction study of 2024 with a score of 692/1,000, indicating that GEICO customers are less satisfied with their claims experience than the average driver. For reference, the study average was 697/1,000, and NJM Insurance Co. earned the first spot with a 782/1,000.
GEICO's J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings generally hover around the regional average. Very rarely does GEICO place significantly below or above the average customer satisfaction rating. That said, GEICO has the second-highest customer satisfaction index rating for usage-based insurance, receiving an 837/1,000 compared to the average of 821/1,000.
Here are all of GEICO's J.D. Power regional customer satisfaction ratings compared to the region's average:
* California: 626 vs. regional average of 637
* Central: 622 vs. 647
* Florida: 629 vs. 625
* Mid-Atlantic: 647 vs. 654
* New England: 638 vs. 637
* New York: 649 vs. 647
* North Central: 641 vs. 652
* Northwest: 637 vs. 643
* Southeast: 651 vs. 663
* Southwest: 618 vs. 635
* Texas: 653 vs. 645
GEICO has an A++ (Superior) financial stability rating from AM Best, the highest rating available. This rating indicates that the company is very likely to uphold its financial obligations, such as payouts for claims.
## GEICO Car Insurance Alternatives
### GEICO Car Insurance vs. State Farm
GEICO and [State Farm Auto Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/lf2efffd9afc) offer affordable rates to a diverse range of drivers. The companies also provide opportunities to lower premiums even more. However, State Farm allows you to bundle your auto and life insurance policies. GEICO doesn't, as it underwrites its policies with different life insurance companies depending on your state.
GEICO has more discounts than State Farm. For instance, GEICO offers a military discount, while State Farm doesn't. You may also experience better customer service and claims satisfaction with State Farm than with GEICO.
GEICO and State Farm offer similar amounts of coverage options. GEICO sells accident forgiveness and mechanical breakdown insurance, while State Farm doesn't. Conversely, State Farm offers rideshare insurance, essential for Uber, Lyft, and other gig workers who use their cars for work. Customers can manage policies through online portals, but all State Farm policies have to be quoted by licensed insurance agents.
**Feature** | **State Farm**
---|---
**Average Cost** | Lower than GEICO
**JD Power Auto Customer Satisfaction** | Better than GEICO
**JD Power Auto Claims Satisfaction** | Better than GEICO
**Optional Coverages** | More than GEICO
**Discounts** | Fewer than GEICO
Read our [State Farm auto insurance review](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/auto-insurance/state-farm-auto-insurance-review).
### GEICO Car Insurance vs. Progressive Car Insurance
[Progressive Auto Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/f5bfc1bbe4af) is slightly more expensive than GEICO. Additionally, GEICO offers more discounts to lower your rates and scores better in claims satisfaction than Progressive. However, while Progressive and GEICO offer online quoting, Progressive works with local insurance agents to provide another layer of support.
If you're looking for a quality telematics program in your state (that's the app feature that tracks your driving to qualify you for discounts), Progressive offers incentives without the possible penalties you might expect with GEICO. For example, discounts for Progressive's telematics program (Snapshot) are offered in 47 states. In comparison, GEICO (DriveEasy) is only available in 37 states plus D.C.
Progressive offers many coverage options, including rideshare insurance, gap coverage, and customer party coverage, while GEICO doesn't.
**Feature** | **Progressive**
---|---
**Average Cost** | Higher than GEICO
**JD Power Auto Customer Satisfaction** | Worse than GEICO
**JD Power Auto Claims Satisfaction** | Worse than GEICO
**Coverages** | More than GEICO
**Discounts** | Less than GEICO

## Why You Should Trust Us: What Went into Our GEICO Auto Insurance Review
Business Insider strives to create accurate, unbiased, and helpful reviews. We use our tools to ensure we publish up-to-date, comprehensive reviews so you can make the most informed decision on where to spend your money. We write our product guides and reviews based on research from third-party rating agencies and online customer reviews.
The best insurance company offers quality coverage and customer service at a reasonable price. We then assess how an insurance company stacks up against the industry average and among competitors of similar caliber in several areas. To review GEICO auto insurance, we considered the following:
* **Breadth of coverage:** The standard auto insurance company offers comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage. As an insurance customer, you want your insurance company to have various policy options to meet your driving needs. We look at what carriers offer outside the standard options, such as gap insurance, new car replacement, and rideshare insurance. GECIO lacked many of these optional coverages.
* **Prices:** Policy costs vary significantly with each applicant. As such, we look at average prices and compare them to the industry averages. We also look at the variety of discounts available for consumers, such as bundling opportunities, discounts for safe driving, and loyalty discounts.
* **Customer service:** Having a reliable and smooth claims process is essential, which can be accomplished by quality agents delivering superior customer service. To evaluate a provider's quality of customer service, we look at J.D. Power's Auto Insurance Study to see how each provider ranks among its competitors.
* **Financial stability:** An insurance company's financial health indicates an insurer's longevity and ability to meet its financial obligation. While exceedingly rare, an insurance company's bankruptcy can jeopardize your policy. So, we use AM Best to determine a company's ability to withstand economic downturns and reliably pay claims.
* **Additional features:** We look at additional features that a company might offer that are unique or uncommon. For example, we considered GEICO's mobile app, DriveEasy program, and free accident forgiveness as unique features.

###  Why is my GEICO auto insurance all of a sudden so much higher?
Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.
Your GEICO auto insurance rates may have increased due to several reasons. For example, you may have changed the specifics of your policy, or you've had a traffic incident (e.g., DUIs, speeding tickets, at-fault accidents, etc.). An increase in claims in your area could also have caused your premiums to increase.
