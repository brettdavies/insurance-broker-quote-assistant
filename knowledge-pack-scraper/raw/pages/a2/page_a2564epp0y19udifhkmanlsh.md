[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
I recently got my license, and my dad was looking to add me to the insurance policy. The rep said over the phone that adding me to the cheaper of the two cars as a driver is enough for covergae and I will be covered in case something happens when I'm driving the other car. I can't find this happening anywhere else so is this really how it works?

Most companies rate all drivers across all vehicles. Nonetheless, even if they "tag" a driver to a particular vehicle for rating purposes, as long as you're a [rated driver](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=rated+driver+insurance+policy&cId=bb85ca8e-3fab-4354-a1ef-31d2dae8ac57&iId=ae59fb72-ba05-44a4-9f25-e4e6c43277d0) on the policy, you should be fine.

Are you sure about that with State Farm? State Farm often writes individual policies for each vehicle, so I'm wondering if that holds true. I'm positive it's like that for all of the companies I work with because the cars are all on the same policy. I'd get that in writing from the [State Farm agent](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+agent&cId=0bdec14b-20c5-4886-a2d4-2640ca2cd3f5&iId=ddbeca79-df73-4bbc-b295-84c5c287eef5).

They reversed course and merged the individual policies back together last year. The only vehicles that may be listed separately still are if the coverage is different. I have two 2025 vehicles with the full ride coverage on one policy and a beater truck with just liability on a separate policy.

Depends on the State. State Farm is changing their auto policy computer system state by state. States under the new system already, IL for example, driver has to be listed on each car they drive to be covered.

The rates will go up on every car in the household. So yes you are primary on one but are covered to drive them all. I bought a simple 3rd car for my daughter when she got her license, liability only on that car, but my 2 other cars she has never once driven almost tripled in price to cover.

Not true. The only car policy that went up when my kids were added was the car they were listed as the primary driver. And they are covered when driving any of my cars.

I asked my State Farm agent about this when my daughter was 14. They said that I did not need to let them know voluntarily when she eventually got her license. But if they asked me about licensed household member, then I would be required to tell them. Up to that point she would be covered but if I lied if they asked then she would not.

Well your State Farm agent is wrong and I say this as a State Farm agent. Once she has a license she needs to be added to the policy. Doesn’t matter if you lie or not if you don’t add her to the policy State Farm has every right to deny any coverage for her if something happens. They won’t ask your agent if they talked to you about a driver they ask these questions “is the driver licensed or a permit driver? Do they have current Insurnace some where else not with your policy?” State Farm can also drop you if you have an undisclosed driver who causes an accident.

Hi there. I’m a State Farm agent. As long as you’re listed as a driver somewhere you’re good to go on all vehicles. 
Sounds like your parents are still on the old type policies (I won’t go into details as to what this means, the policies will switch over to the new version at some point in the future - could be weeks, months, or years depending on what state you’re in). 
On the older type policies agents can assign, or “place,” whatever driver on whatever vehicle is cheapest. So if there are three vehicles in the household your agent is going to assign you to the one that’s the cheapest to add a teenager to. 
As your agent about Steer Clear and Drive Safe and Save. 
Hope this helps.

All of the policies will be more expensive though with a new teen driver in the house even if they have their "own" car. Because they can and probably will drive the other cars as well.

I was told within the last month by a State Farm agent, that they won't insure anyone who hasn't had a driver's license for at least three years - This is in California and I was shopping rates for my 18 year old daughter and myself.

That's odd. I'm in CA too, and SF helped us out during the learners permit process (thanks for letting us know, but she's covered under state law) and when her license was issued this summer - (thanks again for letting us know, now bend over, here are the new rates). 
They did the assignment of the new driver to the cheapest car on the policy as a primary. Our cards have myself and my wife listed on one card, and all three of us listed on the other card for the other car. 
Our daughter can still drive either car, but 100% drives the one she's assigned to.

Yes, that's how it works. As long as you are added to the policy, you are covered when driving any vehicle in the household.

Most insurers no longer require vehicle assignment when rating drivers. They rate all vehicles and all drivers. State Farm does do separate policies for each vehicle in some states, so in those states you would have to be rated on each policy.

With State Farm each driver gets assigned to a specific vehicle but all household drivers listen can drive each others vehicles and be covered. Especially if you do not own any of the vehicles, typically they assign you to the cheapest car and you are covered to drive

It might depend on your insurance company and state. I know where I live and my insurance company has the same policy. As long as my kids are listed on one of my cars they are able to drive any of my cars. So my agent always puts them on the cheapest vehicle.
