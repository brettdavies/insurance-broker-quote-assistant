# Just wondering... why can Progressive raise my renters insurance premiums 35% in one year?

I've never had any claims. Same coverages this year as last year. It's technically by Homesite but it's under the Progressive bundle.

I called and asked why, and the only answer they give is "costs for covering claims have gone up" ... by 10x the rate of inflation??? I know natural disasters are more prevalent, but can that really account for such a large increase? I didn't even know it went up until the first payment because I only get the electronic documents which are buried under submenus on the website. Just a bit infuriating.
