#  Just wondering... why can Progressive raise my renters insurance premiums 35% in one year? 
I've never had any claims. Same coverages this year as last year. It's technically by Homesite but it's under the Progressive bundle. 
I called and asked why, and the only answer they give is "costs for covering claims have gone up" ... by 10x the rate of inflation??? I know natural disasters are more prevalent, but can that really account for such a large increase? I didn't even know it went up until the first payment because I only get the electronic documents which are buried under submenus on the website. Just a bit infuriating.

Keep in mind that in the US, personal lines insurance is rate-regulated in all states. Every insurer has to justify their proposed pricing to state regulators, and most of the documentation of the rate filings are public record. You can, if you really the details, go to your state's Department of Insurance and request a copy. (A few states' rate filings are publicly accessible online.) 
Claims cost inflation has exceeded the general rate of inflation. The situation is exacerbated by reinsurance costs (reinsurance = insurance for insurers, and is a global mechanism to spread the costs of catastrophes out across a broader range of participants) having risen sharply in the past few years due to increasing catastrophe costs worldwide. The increased risk (or recognition of that increased risk) has increased the amount of cash insurers have to keep on hand, invested at minimal returns, adding pressure to insurance rates as they need to cover the cost of that capital. 
Homeowners (including renters) insurance has been unprofitable for the American insurance industry for several years...long enough that competitive pressure to keep prices down has evaporated. 
Put all that together.... 
If you don't like the cost, it might be time to shop around. Consider chatting with an independent agent, whose CSRs generally have tools to easily / quickly get quotes from multiple insurers.

Appreciate the insights! Had no idea rate increases have to be approved by the state... that would have been some nice context to get from progressive. I actually switched to Progressive this time last year to avoid State Farm price hikes. Still, its hard to justify why my home I rent specifically is somehow 35% more expensive to insure in 2025 vs 2024

Just shop around for a cheaper rate and then cancel your Homesite policy. It's possible Homesite is giving you a go away price due to other claims in your area. 
Renters insurance is always going to be crazy cheap compared to other products.

It's crazy cheap because it's got much lower benefits. The building (landlord) costs much more to insure than the contents (renter). 
Insurance is pretty much pass-through. We really aren't taking your money and refusing to pay benefits, we're taking a cut off the top and redistributing the rest from all the policyholders to those with claims. Plus providing a guarantee that the pool of funds won't run out.

Renters (and home insurance) should be primarily for liability coverage, not measly items in your apartment.

True... I actually switched to Progressive this time last year to avoid State Farm's price hikes... problem is my car insurance will go up if I don't have the renter bundle, so I'd probably want to shop for both elsewhere

It's not price gouging - there's no shortage of renters insurance companies offering policies. Don't like your rate? Shop around. Don't like having important info buried in emails and submenus, opt out of receiving electronic notices and rely on the postal system instead. 
Price gouging is when you've trekked halfway through death valley and collapse on the steps of the only store for twenty miles that sells water, and when they see you coming they raise the price from $1/bottle to $20/bottle. If there are 10 stores on the block, then you can go find one that will sell for less, and as long as the stores aren't illegally colluding, market forces will result in normal pricing.

Others here have offered some good possible explanations for the price increases, but price gouging could still be happening. Companies don't have to formally collude to raise prices if they are all just independently greedier and taking advantage of the recent inflation as a scapegoat.

Insurance is the last thing to get hit by inflation. Insurance prices are reactionary (although management wants to think they can predict the future). Claims in 2022 and 2023 were significantly higher. Insurance company goes to the state and says they need a rate increase to cover costs. State takes 6 months to approve. New rates are effective 1/1/24 (just an example) and you renew now for the first time after the increase. That’s just one explanation out of about 10.

yeah the governments rate of inflation averages all areas of the economy.  
well if all the areas that hardly concern us are below inflation or deflating but the areas that do affect us are still inflating like crazy, the average inflation rate reflects lower than it should. except that we the common person use all those areas that are still at the high inflation rate so that average they give us is not accurate as far as it applies to us.

Insurance unfortunately is not an area that is slowing down it's inflation rate. weather, accidents, claims are all still skyrocketing in terms of frequency and cost. you might shop and get to the cheapest carrier possible, but if they adjust the next term at renewal and it's an extra $250 per term. they still might be the cheapest option but the bottom of the bar has risen. you have to account for the new lowest possible cost. This is why mortgages have gotten out of hand. the increases from insurance have made it hard to keep the mortgage steady. banks need to start accounting for this drastic inflation when they valuate their loans.

My property insurance, on several properties, was raised 300% for 2025. California, both commercial and residential properties. Same coverage. For example, one went from $2100 to $9300.

The hard part with California specifically is rate increases were blocked for so long that instead of a gradual increase of time insureds are seeing HUGE rate hikes. Also a reason so many insurers started fleeing the state, between the DOL not allowing increases and the high risks it just wasn’t profitable. Now less carriers and huge increases

Because they requested approval from the state that they needed that amount of increase in order to be able to pay claims, and state signed off and approved that request.

My renters insurance was $290 last year and this year it’s $620. I’m definitely shopping around and canceling before it renews because that’s insane.
