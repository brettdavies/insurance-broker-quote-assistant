Progressive Premium Insurance Co. agreed to a $43 million class action lawsuit settlement to resolve allegations it undervalued total loss vehicle claims.

The Progressive class action settlement benefits Georgia residents who made a first-party claim on a vehicle based on an Instant Report from Mitchell with a Projected Sold Adjustment applied to at least one comparable vehicle. The settlement includes Georgia residents who made a first-party claim on a Progressive Mountain Insurance Co. policy between Oct. 11, 2015, and Feb. 18, 2025, and on a Progressive Premier Insurance Co. of Illinois policy between June 8, 2016, and Feb. 18, 2025.

Plaintiffs in the [**class action lawsuit**](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/insurance/progressive-schemed-with-mitchell-to-reduce-payouts-for-total-loss-cars-class-action-alleges/) accused Progressive of undervaluing total loss claims in Georgia by applying a flawed methodology, resulting in policyholders being paid less than they were owed.

Progressive Mountain Insurance Co. and Progressive Premier Insurance Co. of Illinois are part of [**Progressive Corp**](https://www.progressive.com/). which offers insurance coverage for vehicles, homes, and businesses.

Progressive has not admitted any wrongdoing but agreed to pay $43 million to resolve the class action lawsuit.

Under the terms of the Progressive class action settlement, class members can receive a cash payment, with the average estimated at $173. The final payout per person will depend on how many eligible class members participate in the settlement.

The deadline for exclusion and objection is April 30, 2025.

The final approval hearing for the Progressive total loss class action lawsuit is scheduled for May 15, 2025.

No claim form is required to benefit from the settlement. Class members who do not exclude themselves will automatically receive a settlement payment.
