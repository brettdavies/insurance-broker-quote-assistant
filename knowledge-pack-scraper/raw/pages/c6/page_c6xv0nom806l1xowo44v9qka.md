## Our Expert Take
## Our Expert Take
We like that Progressive has three levels of accident forgiveness. Small accident forgiveness for claims of up to $500 is included as part of your policy. After five years without accidents or violations, you qualify for a loyalty accident forgiveness for claims over $500, or you can also purchase accident forgiveness that ignores one accident per policy period.
Progressive has competitive car insurance rates for good drivers, teens, young adults, seniors, those with bad credit or speeding tickets, and people who have caused accidents. It also offers the cheapest rates for drivers with a DUI conviction compared to the companies we reviewed.
You may also get additional discounts if you’re a teacher or military member. Progressive offers an average 13% car insurance discount for teachers and 14% for military members.
Progressive’s mobile app is a nice bonus. You can view your insurance ID card and it lets you pay your bill, report a claim, send claim photos and receive roadside assistance.
Based on our survey of Progressive customers:
  * They are likely to recommend Progressive car insurance to a friend or family member.
  * They are very satisfied with their purchase.


Among Progressive customers who have made claims:
  * They were somewhat satisfied overall with the claims process.


  * You can get a quote and buy a car insurance policy online.
  * Low level of complaints made to state insurance departments about Progressive auto insurance.
  * Offers nonowner car insurance, rideshare insurance and SR-22 filings.
  * Offers a vanishing deductible.


  * Received only a mediocre C grade for the last four years from auto repair experts for its collision claim process.
  * Snapshot, Progressive’s usage-based program, may give you a decent discount, but rates could increase if your driving score is low. Progressive says 20% of drivers see their rates increase by using Snapshot.
  * Doesn’t have new car replacement coverage.


Best for Accident Forgiveness

## Progressive Car Insurance Overview
Progressive started in the auto insurance business in 1937 when Joseph Lewis and Jack Green proposed offering basic insurance that anyone could afford.
Progressive Insurance first specialized in nonstandard auto insurance, which led it to launch the Safe Driver Plan in Ohio. This plan offered lower rates to drivers who went without accidents.
Today, Progressive is the second-largest auto insurance company in the United States, with a market share of around 15%. It’s also a leading seller of commercial auto insurance and motorcycle insurance.
Progressive has been headquartered in Mayfield Village, Ohio, since 1974.
### Progressive’s AM Best Financial Strength Rating

## Progressive Auto Insurance Coverage and Add-Ons
Progressive provides the [standard types of car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/types-of-car-insurance/), such as liability insurance that most states require, but it stands out for its range of extra coverage types.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Praying-handsx2.svg) |  **Accident Forgiveness** Progressive offers three types of [accident forgiveness insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/) to keep your rates from rising after an accident. Accident forgiveness for claims $500 and less is automatically included in most states. If you qualify, you can buy accident forgiveness for claims exceeding $500. You can also purchase benefits so that one accident is forgiven per policy period.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-car.png) |  **Custom Parts and Equipment (CPE)** Progressive’s custom parts and equipment coverage pays to repair or replace items you added to your vehicle, such as an upgraded stereo, custom paint job or custom wheels. The CPE coverage limit is normally $5,000.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Deductible.png) |  **Diminishing Deductible** Progressive’s [diminishing deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/diminishing-deductible/) is called “Deductible Savings Bank Coverage.” It subtracts $50 from your comprehensive and collision deductible every six months that you don’t cause an accident or get a ticket. A person with a $500 deductible may not have any deductible after five years of good driving.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compare-quotes.png) |  **Gap Insurance** Progressive sells [gap insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/gap-insurance/) as “loan/lease payoff” coverage. It pays the difference between what you owe on your vehicle and its value if your car is stolen or totaled in an accident covered by your policy. Progressive’s gap insurance limit varies by state but typically pays only up to 25% of your vehicle’s value.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rental-car.png) |  **Rental Reimbursement** [Rental reimbursement](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement/) coverage pays for a rental if your car is being repaired due to damage covered by your comprehensive or collision coverage. Progressive typically pays for up to 30 days, with a daily limit of $40 to $60.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Rideshare@2x.svg) |  **Rideshare Insurance** Progressive’s [rideshare insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-to-find-best-rideshare-insurance/) extends your coverage when your rideshare app is open and you’re waiting to match with a rider. Transportation network providers like Uber or Lyft provide only liability insurance during this time.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pets.png) |  **Pet Injury Coverage** Progressive’s pet injury coverage pays up to $1,000 of vet bills if your pet is injured in your vehicle in an auto accident. It’s included when you buy collision coverage.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Road-side-assistance@2x.svg) |  **Roadside Assistance Insurance** [Roadside assistance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-roadside-assistance-plans/) with Progressive pays for towing, flat-tire fixes, battery jump starts, locksmith services, fuel delivery and more if you have an emergency on the road.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Drunk-driver@2x.svg) |  **SR-22** Some states require [SR-22 insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-sr-22-insurance/) for risky drivers, such as those with a DUI conviction or who have been caught driving without insurance.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Usage-based-insurance@2x.svg) |  **Usage-Based Insurance** Snapshot is Progressive’s [usage-based insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usage-based-insurance/) program. It tracks miles driven and your driving habits. You can save if you’re a safe driver, but you may see an increase if you don’t score well in the Snapshot system. Snapshot is not available in California.  
### Add-On Coverage Progressive Does Not Offer
Progressive does not offer these types of add-on coverage or programs:
  * **New car replacement.** Progressive doesn’t offer [new car replacement coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/new-car-replacement/), an add-on that pays to replace your vehicle with the same make and model if it’s totaled and typically is two model years old or less.
  * **Pay-per-mile insurance.** Progressive doesn’t offer [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/pay-per-mile/). Though Progressive’s Snapshot tracks mileage, it’s not strictly a pay-per-mile insurance option. A pay-per-mile policy determines your rates based partly on how many miles you drive but doesn’t track driving habits such as speeding.


* * *
## How Does Snapshot by Progressive Work?
Participating in the Snapshot program will earn you an immediate discount (except in Hawaii and New York). Depending on the quality of your driving, you could earn another discount when your policy renews.
You can choose to have your driving tracked either through a mobile app or a plug-in device. Snapshot by Progressive will track driving behaviors such as:
  * Sudden changes in speed.
  * Rapid acceleration.
  * Hard braking.
  * Time of day you drive.
  * The amount you drive .
  * How you use your mobile phone while driving.


You’ll get emails that show your progress during the Snapshot program. Your [car insurance costs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) will be adjusted at your first policy renewal after you sign up for the program. If you practice safe driving habits, you should see lower rates. But if you have had poor driving habits like speeding or using your phone while driving, you could see your rates increase.
### How Much Can Drivers Save With Progressive Snapshot?
**Progressive Snapshot drivers save an average of $231 a year** , according to the company’s website. Your savings will depend on your results from the Snapshot program.
Your rates could increase with high-risk driving. For example, if you speed, use your phone while driving or frequently drive between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. on the weekends, you could see your costs go up.
Progressive says about 20% of drivers using Snapshot see an increase.
* * *
## Progressive’s Auto Insurance Discounts
Progressive offers many [car insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/), especially for drivers who practice safe driving habits. If you have a teen driver, look for Progressive’s discounts for teen drivers, good students and students away at school.
Here are Progressive auto insurance discounts you may qualify for.

## Methodology
To identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, collision repair grades from auto body professionals and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit and drivers caught without insurance.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


**Source:** [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Car insurance coverage options (20% of score):** Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer:
  * Accident forgiveness
  * Gap insurance
  * New car replacement
  * Nonowners policies
  * Usage-based insurance
  * Pay-per-mile insurance
  * Rideshare insurance
  * SR-22s
  * Vanishing deductibles


**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Complaints (15% of score):** We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.
**Source:** [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
**Collision repair (5% of score):** We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
**Source:** CRASH Network’s [Insurer Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.
**Digital experience (5% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated car insurers on:
  * Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple.
  * If there’s a useful website search function.
  * If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
  * If there’s a Spanish version of the website.
  * If you can get a quote online.


**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Likelihood to recommend car insurers to others (5% of score) and satisfaction with customer service and price (5% of score):** We surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company.
**Source:** This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11-29, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.5 point with 95% confidence. This survey was overseen by Talker Research, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society (MRS) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).
**Satisfaction with claims process (up to 5% of score):** We surveyed 3,000 American drivers who have filed a car insurance claim within the past 12 months.
