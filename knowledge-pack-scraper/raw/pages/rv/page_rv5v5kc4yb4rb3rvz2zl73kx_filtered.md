# Sign Online Discount - Progressive, one time?

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

Just wanted to clarify this is a 1 time discount and my rates would increase by the amount of the discount for my 1st (and subsequent) renewal assuming nothing else changed.

Progressive quoted me and its about 100 cheaper per 6 month period (when paid in full) but then I noticed it included the sign online discount which the customer support said was about 110 dollars.

I've been with Geico for 16 years and drice about 3500 miles a year in my personal car. Ridiculous prices I pay for insurance either way.

I also found out that geico called my windshield repair from 4 years ago a comprehensive claim which didnt remove the 5 year safe driver discount for them (its not even shown as a claim on my account) but it is shown when I quoted with progressive (another $100+ discount per 6mo period lost).

Thanks in advance
