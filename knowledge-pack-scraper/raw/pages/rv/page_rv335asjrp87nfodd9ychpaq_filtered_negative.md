To find the cheapest minimum liability insurance in California, our editors gathered quotes from nine top companies across 1,824 California ZIP codes. [Full methodology #methodology ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/requirements#methodology "#methodology").
**The minimum limits may not be enough to cover the full medical expenses or damage if you cause a serious accident.** Most drivers should [choose higher liability limits](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?"), if they can afford it.
**In addition, California car insurance laws don't require[collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** These coverages help pay to fix or replace your car after a crash, regardless of whose fault it is.
Liability coverage is required by law in California. But other [optional auto insurance coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance") can be useful for many drivers.
* **[Comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?"):** Collision coverage pays to repair damage to your car after an accident, regardless of whose fault it is. Comprehensive coverage pays for other types of damage, such as vandalism, theft or damage from a natural disaster.
* **[Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance"):** This coverage pays your medical bills and car repair expenses if you're hit by a driver who either doesn't have insurance or doesn't have enough coverage.
* **[Medical payments (MedPay)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medical-payments-car-insurance-coverage "What Is Medical Payments Coverage? How Does It Work?"):** This coverage pays the medical bills of you or your passengers after an accident, regardless of who is at fault. Coverage typically comes in $1,000 increments and usually starts at $1,000 per person.
* * *
* * *
**You can get a self-insurance certificate from the California DMV if you own more than 25 vehicles in your name.** The certificate states that you can cover medical bills, car repairs and property damage expenses as a minimum liability policy would, and this certificate can prevent [your vehicle registration from getting suspended](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/vehicle-registration-suspension "Vehicle Registration Suspension in California"). Before issuing the certificate, the department may require evidence that you can meet these financial demands.

**If you can't afford minimum liability insurance in California and you qualify for a policy through[California's Low Cost Auto Insurance Program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/low-cost-auto-insurance-program "California Low Cost Auto Insurance Program"), or CLCA, you can legally buy auto insurance with lower limits.**
* **Uninsured motorist BI*:** Up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident
* **Medical payments*:** Up to $1,000 per person

Most people in California need car insurance. There are a few [alternatives to buying car insurance #alternative ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/requirements#alternative "#alternative"), including a surety bond, a certificate of self-insurance from the DMV or a cash deposit. However, these options may not be practical or affordable for many people.

California is not a [no-fault insurance state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/no-fault-auto-insurance "How No-Fault Insurance Works and Which States Are No-Fault").

Drivers in no-fault states also have a limited ability to sue other drivers over damages.
