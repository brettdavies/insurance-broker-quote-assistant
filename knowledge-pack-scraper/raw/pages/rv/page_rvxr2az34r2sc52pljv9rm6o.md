WHAT TO DO IF PROVIDERS DENY YOU COVERAGE
The Louisiana Automobile Insurance Plan (LAIP) serves as a safety net for drivers who cannot find standard auto insurance coverage. Drivers must show proof of rejection from at least two insurance companies before applying to LAIP, which then assigns them to an insurance provider based on the company's market share in the state. While LAIP guarantees coverage for eligible drivers, including those needing SR-22 filings, it typically comes with higher premium costs than standard insurance policies.
