Yes, it's a one time discount. Future rates can only be estimated, but you have a more reasonable baseline estimate of your next term if you remove that discount.
Glass claims are a type of comprehensive claim. Some carriers will not factor them into future renewal rates if the claims are with them, but when you shop for a new policy they will appear as comprehensive claims. Very likely you would have had a similar experience if you had been with Progressive and then quoted at GEICO.

If you’ve had GEICO for a while, I would check your declarations page bullet points:
1. You may have earned free accident forgiveness. I know you don’t drive much but if you did cause an accident, GEICO wouldn’t surcharge your policy or remove any safe driving discounts if you have this benefit.
2. There may be some language about a new rating plan available. If you have that, call the number and they will quote you in that program with all the same coverages and limits you have now. If it’s cheaper, they’ll move you to it. If it’s not, they’ll let you stay where you’re at so there’s no downside to trying.

Thanks. I do have free accident forgiveness that they told me about. They did try the new rate plane but no change.

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors.
### Home Insurance
* **Coverage Types**: You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Rebuild Cost**: Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
* **Personal Property**: Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
* **Bundling**: Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
* **Deductibles**: Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)
### Life Insurance
* **Mortgage Protection**: This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Policy Types**: Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)
### Health Insurance
* **Premium Stability**: Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
* **Enrollment Periods**: You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
* **Employer Plans**: If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)
### Car Insurance
* **Coverage Considerations**: Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
* **Car Choice**: Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
* **VIN Quotes**: Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)
### Additional Tips
* **Use a Broker**: Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Read the Fine Print**: Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Check Claims Handling**: Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)
