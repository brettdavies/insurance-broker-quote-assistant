######  **State Farm researchers recognized for strategic shingles research program**
**![State Farm AIF Fellow Award](https://content.presspage.com/uploads/1441/a4e6a0b5-ce79-4a20-89cd-134b3a4c679f/500_statefarmaiffellowaward.jpg?x=1712074159967)**

State Farm researchers at the Technology Research and Innovation Laboratory (TRAIL) have conducted long-term shingle weathering and durability research for 20+ years. To share our findings and to leverage available technologies to improve the quality of asphalt shingles, State Farm recently partnered with the Asphalt Institute Foundation (AIF) to conduct product lifecycle research that will advance the science around the durability of asphalt shingles-- specifically the asphalt used in residential roofing.
Research findings indicate that as asphalt shingles age, they degrade and become brittle, sometimes leading to premature failure. The first phase focused on evaluating the aging of the asphalt binder and the change in physical properties because of aging. This may lead to brittleness, cracking, and loss of adhesion to granules. The goal is to work with the roofing industry to bring affordable improved product options to market for our policyholders that extend the window of good roof performance during a products’ lifecycle.
In December 2023, State Farm was honored to accept the Asphalt Institute Foundation Fellow Recognition Award for company support of AIF strategic research programs.
