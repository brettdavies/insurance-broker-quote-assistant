Lemonade offers the best renters insurance rates for most people. Its average policy costs **$140 per year**, which is $74 per year cheaper than the national average. However, Lemonade renters insurance is only offered in  29 states and Washington, D.C., so it's not available to everyone.
As for [claims](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-file-renters-insurance-claim "How to File a Renters Insurance Claim"), renters generally have a smooth experience using Lemonade’s app. The company receives fewer customer complaints than competitors of a similar size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). It also earned a high score on J.D. Power's annual customer satisfaction survey. That means renters can count on Lemonade to help them get their life back to normal quickly after an emergency.

Before you start shopping for the best renters insurance company, it's important to determine [how much coverage you need](https://www.valuepenguin.com/do-i-need-renters-insurance "Do I Need Renters Insurance? And How Much Should I Get?").
Personal property coverage protects all of your belongings. That means the limit should be high enough to replace all of your stuff if it's destroyed or stolen. The best way to determine how much coverage you need is to create a [home inventory](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-inventory-checklist "How to Make a Home Inventory for Insurance") listing all of your belongings and an estimated cost to replace them.
While the overall limit is the most important thing to consider, pay attention to coverage for expensive or valuable items. Insurers cover a maximum amount in certain categories, like [jewelry](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-renters-insurance-protecting-jewelry "Protecting Jewelry With Renters Insurance"). If your valuables exceed the coverage limit, you may need to purchase additional insurance.

1. **Rates:** The cost of renters insurance is based on a number of factors, including where you live, how much coverage you need and your insurance history. You’ll want to compare your renters insurance quotes to [national and state averages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-renters-insurance "Average Cost of Renters Insurance") to make sure you’re getting the best rates.
The best renters insurance companies offer [affordable rates #cost ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-renters-insurance-companies#cost "#cost"), adequate protection and reliable customer service.
