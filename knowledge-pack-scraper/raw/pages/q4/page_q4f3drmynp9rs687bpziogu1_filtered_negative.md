##  Car insurance discounts for teen drivers
**It’s important to take advantage of[car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) for you and your teen.** Make sure to ask about these discounts from the companies you contact for a quote.
###  Good student
###  Safe driving apps
###  Driver’s education and training
###  Away-at-school discounts
Several companies offer discounts to parents with teens who are [away at college](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-college-students/) without a car. These programs save parents money while keeping the teen insured when they borrow cars at school or back at home.
###  Dropping full coverage
A teen with an older car can save money by removing [full coverage](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) from their vehicle. Your car’s resale value is the most your insurance company pays if your car is destroyed or stolen. If your car is worth less than a few thousand dollars, the potential benefits of full coverage are usually not worth the cost.
##  Why car insurance is so expensive for teens
**High crash rates are the main reason why car insurance is so expensive for teens.** Drivers ages 16 to 20 have higher crash rates than other age groups. This is blamed largely on their lack of driving experience.
##  When to get car insurance quotes for a teen driver
**It’s good to start shopping for car insurance a few months before your teen gets their driver’s license.** Their coverage needs to take effect on the day they get their license.
##  Reasons to add a teen to a parent’s car insurance
**For a family, the advantages of adding a teenager to a parent’s car insurance go beyond price.** Here are a few other reasons to keep a teen on the same policy as their parents:
###  What is the youngest age to get car insurance?
###  Are teens with a learner’s permit covered by car insurance?
###  Does a teen need separate insurance for their own car?
