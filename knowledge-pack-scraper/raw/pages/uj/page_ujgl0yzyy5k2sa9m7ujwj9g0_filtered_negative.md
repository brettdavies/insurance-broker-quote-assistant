Finding the best car insurance company isn't just about securing the lowest rate — it's about getting the right mix of coverage, service and reliability when it matters most. There's no one-size-fits-all option, and no single insurer dominates every category across the board. The right company for you depends on your priorities, whether that's rock-bottom pricing, top-tier customer support or flexible payment options. That's why it pays to shop around. Bankrate's insurance editorial team did the legwork to assess dozens of insurance providers and identify the best car insurance companies for most drivers. Our list is designed to help you cut through the noise and find the coverage that fits your priorities and your budget.

##  **Car insurance industry trends:****Premium increases slow down, but don’t decline**
High levels of vehicle theft also contributed to the increase in car insurance costs in recent years. In 2024, more than [850,000](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle-safety/vehicle-theft-prevention) vehicles were stolen across the United States, contributing to over $8 billion in losses for vehicle owners. Due to this increased risk, insurers often raise comprehensive coverage costs to account for the higher likelihood of theft-related claims.
However, the spike in post-pandemic car crash fatalities has started to decline. Since insurance companies were approved for significant rate increases over the past few years, many carriers may be near rate adequacy. This means that 2025 may usher in a time of rate stabilization, but there are no guarantees. The insurance industry is composed of several moving parts, and a sudden increase in risk or loss in any of the following situations could destabilize the market yet again:

* ###  What is the best car insurance company?
* ###  What are the most popular car insurance companies?
The most popular car insurance companies are State Farm, Progressive and Geico (which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway), according to [market share data](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/research-actuarial-property-casualty-market-share.pdf). These three companies combined wrote over 47 percent of the total auto insurance premiums in the United States in 2024. However, the most popular companies may not provide the best car insurance for your specific needs. The best company for you will offer a good mix of affordable rates, high customer satisfaction scores and robust coverage and discount options.

Top rated car insurance companies The best auto insurance companies by state Car insurance industry trends What are the different types of car insurance? How much does car insurance cost? How to find the best rates on car insurance Frequently asked questions Methodology
Finding the best car insurance company isn't just about securing the lowest rate — it's about getting the right mix of coverage, service and reliability when it matters most. There's no one-size-fits-all option, and no single insurer dominates every category across the board. The right company for you depends on your priorities, whether that's rock-bottom pricing, top-tier customer support or flexible payment options. That's why it pays to shop around. Bankrate's insurance editorial team did the legwork to assess dozens of insurance providers and identify the best car insurance companies for most drivers. Our list is designed to help you cut through the noise and find the coverage that fits your priorities and your budget.
