**The average cost of a full-coverage car insurance policy is $2,101 a year nationally.** However, the state you live in has a lot to do with how much you pay for car insurance. This is because states often have different car insurance requirements and different risks for drivers.
##  Cost of car insurance by state
###  Average car insurance rates by state
---|---|---
[Alabama](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/alabama-car-insurance/) | $2,322 | $907
[Alaska](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/alaska-car-insurance/) | $1,694 | $544
[Arizona](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/arizona-car-insurance/) | $2,618 | $1,094
[Arkansas](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/arkansas-car-insurance/) | $2,314 | $717
[California](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/california-car-insurance/) | $2,017 | $700

Although [minimum-coverage car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-liability-car-insurance/) policies are much cheaper, [full-coverage](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/cheap-full-coverage-car-insurance/) policies offer more protection. Minimum coverage, also known as liability-only coverage, covers injuries and damage to others you cause in a car accident. Full coverage covers all injuries and damage, including to yourself and your vehicle.
##  States with the most expensive rates
**Nevada is the most expensive state for full-coverage car insurance at $3,439 a year.** Michigan has the highest liability car insurance rate at $1,559 a year.
###  Most expensive states for car insurance
---|---|---|---
##  No-fault states
**If you live in a no-fault state and are injured in a car accident, you need to contact your insurance company no matter who caused the crash.** Your personal injury protection (PIP) coverage will help cover your medical bills.
###  No-fault states for car insurance
##  Minimum state car insurance limits
**A state’s minimum-coverage requirements for car insurance can also impact how much you pay** compared to someone in a different state.
###  Minimum liability coverage requirements in each state

*Car insurance is not required in state
Some states require other [types of car insurance coverage](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/types-of-car-insurance/), too, such as:
##  What happens to my car insurance when I move states?
**You need to get a new insurance policy when you move to another state.** Contact your current insurance company to see if they offer policies in that state. If they don’t, you will need to switch companies.
Your car insurance rate may go up or down depending on where you move. Shop around and [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from several companies before you buy a new policy.
