## The best auto insurance companies by state

While we stand by our picks for the top car insurance companies on a national level, it is important to know that the best insurers will vary by state. To determine the best auto insurance company in your state, you’ll want to look at more than just each carrier’s [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/).

Although average price is important, third-party customer satisfaction scores can vary widely between regions. This means that one company might shine in one part of the country but not fare as well in another. To help you find the best car insurance in your state, Bankrate conducted extensive research into the car insurance markets in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. and evaluated the largest carriers by market share using our proprietary Bankrate Score method.

### Car insurance rates by state

To assist our readers no matter where they live, we’ve created the interactive map below of [car insurance rates by state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/). With an understanding of the average rates in your state, you can get a better idea of what’s considered a normal price range for your policy.

Rates refreshed as of Sep 2025

[Read our full methodology](#methodology)

## **Car insurance industry trends:** **Premium increases slow down, but don’t decline**

Full coverage car insurance premiums average $2,671 per year in September 2025, and while rate increases have slowed, don't anticipate a rate reduction any time soon.

Car insurance premiums and auto industry costs are closely intertwined. When the cost of materials and technology related to building cars increases, the cost to repair and replace the vehicle when damaged in an accident increases, causing car insurance rates to rise for policyholders. According to [Bankrate’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/latest-inflation-statistics/), the cost of motor vehicle repairs was 48.7 percent higher in September 2024 than in February 2020.

High levels of vehicle theft also contributed to the increase in car insurance costs in recent years. In 2024, more than [850,000](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle-safety/vehicle-theft-prevention) vehicles were stolen across the United States, contributing to over $8 billion in losses for vehicle owners. Due to this increased risk, insurers often raise comprehensive coverage costs to account for the higher likelihood of theft-related claims.

### Auto insurance industry trends to keep an eye on in 2025

However, the spike in post-pandemic car crash fatalities has started to decline. Since insurance companies were approved for significant rate increases over the past few years, many carriers may be near rate adequacy. This means that 2025 may usher in a time of rate stabilization, but there are no guarantees. The insurance industry is composed of several moving parts, and a sudden increase in risk or loss in any of the following situations could destabilize the market yet again:

* Increases in [third-party litigation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/third-party-litigation/)
* Increases in [social inflation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/what-is-social-inflation/#:)
* Continued increases in the cost of vehicle parts and labor

Mark Friedlander

Director of corporate communications, Insurance Information Institute](https://www.bankrate.com/authors/mark-friedlander/)

“The Insurance Information Institute’s underwriting projection forecasts a countrywide average personal auto rate increase of 7 percent in 2025. This is down from our estimates of 14 percent in 2023 and 12 percent in 2024 as the industry continues to recover from a 112 combined ratio in 2022, its worst underwriting performance in decades. Our projected average premium increase in 2025 includes a 3.8 percent spike in the costs of repairs (parts and labor). Other macro factors that will continue to impact the cost of coverage across the U.S. this year include more technologically advanced vehicles costing more to repair; distracted driving, such as texting while driving, leading to more accidents; a continued spike in litigated auto accident claims as billboard attorneys aggressively market their services to consumers to file suit following a crash; and rising health care costs to treat accident victims. Additionally, local market rating factors such as severe weather events and other natural catastrophes like wildfires damaging or totaling vehicles, as well as vehicle theft and vandalism rates, will impact the cost of coverage."

Tony Cotto

Policy vice-president, Auto and Underwriting, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC)

“We expect that rates will continue to reflect the modern realities that auto insurers and policyholders face as they confront the many challenges of a new era of risk. These include extreme weather, inflation, legal system abuse and regulatory overreach. Difficulties around parts, labor, vehicle complexity and deteriorating driving behavior on U.S. roads compound those cost pressures. As the prices of vehicles, parts and labor continue to rise, so must the cost of the financial security insurers promise. Carriers will continue to seek ways to improve consumer choice while supporting enhancements to vehicle and road safety that serve all drivers.”

## What are the different types of car insurance?

One of the first steps to finding the best [auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-guide/) for you is to understand your needs. That starts with learning about the [key coverage options](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/coverage-types/) available and how these options work together to provide financial protection.

* [**Bodily injury liability coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) helps pay for injuries incurred by the other driver and their passengers in an at-fault accident. Almost all states in the U.S. require you to carry bodily injury and property damage liability insurance in order to drive legally.
* [**Property damage liability coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) helps pay for repairs to the other driver's car or any property you damage in an accident that you are found to have caused. This may include stationary objects such as fences or lampposts.
* [**Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) helps pay for your injuries (and, in some states, your property damage) if it was caused by a driver who either lacks sufficient coverage or any coverage at all.
* [**Personal injury protection (PIP)**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/), also known as no-fault insurance and only available in certain states, pays for medical expenses you and your passengers incur following an accident, regardless of fault. It also accounts for non-medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident, such as lost wages or the cost of childcare.
* [**Medical payments coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/medpay-in-car-insurance/) is similar to PIP insurance coverage but includes only payments for medical expenses. It is required in some states and optional in others.
* [**Comprehensive coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) is for a broad range of non-collision-related damage. This can include vehicle theft, fire, weather damage and more. Comprehensive coverage can also help if you hit an animal.
* [**Collision coverage**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/collision/) helps cover damage to your vehicle if you’re involved in a collision, whether you hit another vehicle, a stationary object or a pedestrian.

While the main types of car insurance coverage are listed above, every carrier is different and may offer unique or specialized coverage options. For instance, if you purchase a brand-new vehicle, you may be interested in [new car replacement coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/new-car-replacement-insurance/). Or, if the roads near you are full of potholes that could pop your tire, [roadside assistance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-roadside-assistance/) might be worth looking into.  Speaking with your agent and reviewing your options online can help you find coverage tailored to your needs.

### Minimum vs. full coverage car insurance

Minimum and full coverage insurance are terms commonly used to describe an auto insurance policy. Understanding the vast distinction between the two is paramount when searching for the right levels of financial protection.

Minimal coverage refers to a bare-bones policy that carries only the state-mandated insurance limits. Typically, this includes only [bodily injury and property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-liability/) at the lowest limits allowed, but depending on [state coverage requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) can also include other coverage types, such as personal injury protection. This option covers damage to others up to the policy limit but does not pay for damage to your vehicle if you are at fault for an accident, which is one reason it is usually the cheapest available option.

A policy with liability limits higher than the state requires but without physical damage coverage, would be considered a [liability-only policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-vs-full-coverage/) instead of a minimal coverage policy.

Full coverage insurance includes liability coverage plus comprehensive and collision coverage. The limit of liability can range from state minimums up to the highest option available by the insurance provider, but the key difference is that a full coverage policy provides financial protection for your vehicle whether you are [at fault](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/) for an accident, a victim of theft or vandalism or experience weather damage.

Since there isn't an industry-standard definition of full coverage, some insurance providers may add roadside assistance, [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/) and rental reimbursement to your policy if you request full coverage, so work closely with your agent and read your paperwork carefully to avoid paying for more coverage than you need.

#### Should you get minimum or full coverage car insurance?

The right coverage amount for you will strike a balance between how much you can reasonably afford for your policy and how much financial risk you’re willing to assume. If you're mostly concerned with getting a cheap premium, then a minimum coverage car insurance policy might work best for you: it meets your state’s legal insurance requirements and almost always costs less than full coverage. Plus, minimum coverage could be the best insurance for older cars or ones near the end of their driveable years. However, with minimum coverage, you could wind up with significantly higher out-of-pocket costs after an accident. This kind of car insurance only helps pay for the damage you cause in an accident. If you’re at fault for an accident and there’s damage done to your vehicle, you would be left footing the bill on your own.

A full coverage car insurance policy will increase your premium, but it comes with broader protection for your vehicle and finances. Vehicle repairs and medical expenses after an accident can get expensive fast, and purchasing more car insurance coverage can act as a valuable financial safety net. Bankrate found that [only 44 percent of U.S. adults](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-crash-emergency-funds/) are able to spend $1,000 or more from their emergency savings. With that in mind, many insurance experts suggest opting for full coverage or at least purchasing higher liability limits than the state minimums.

### Factors that impact your cost of car insurance

Knowing the factors that impact your cost of car insurance may help when comparing auto insurance quotes and reviewing policy renewals.

## How much does car insurance cost?

Proprietary data from Quadrant Information Services indicate that the national average cost of car insurance currently sits at $2,671 per year for a full coverage policy and $806 for minimum coverage. However, these figures are just a baseline. Using [Bankrate’s car insurance calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-calculator/) can give you a general idea of what your car insurance budget should be. But keep in mind that car insurance is highly individualized, and rates vary based on numerous personal factors.

Location is just one of those factors. In general, states that pose higher risks for filing claims (whether that is due to elevated levels of vehicle theft, [extreme weather](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rising-cost-extreme-weather/), traffic congestion, poor highway infrastructure or something else) will likely see higher average car insurance rates.

Driving incidents can also affect the total cost of your car insurance. Drivers with speeding tickets could see their premiums cost more compared to drivers with clean records. Your state’s laws and your age, gender and credit history can also determine how much you pay for car insurance. For a more specific overview, you might want to research the [average insurance cost in your state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/).

* A basic full coverage auto insurance policy includes collision and comprehensive coverage in addition to bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage. For the rates shown, we’re assuming 100/300/50 liability limits with $500 comprehensive and collision deductibles.

  Info Icon

  Full coverage
* Minimum coverage refers to carrying only the minimum amount of car insurance coverage required by your state. This required coverage can vary, but almost always includes bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage, which make up liability-only insurance.

#### How to save on car insurance

Knowing the factors that impact your cost of car insurance may help when comparing auto insurance quotes and reviewing policy renewals.

Arrow Right Icon

## How to find the best rates on car insurance

Although you can’t control some of the factors that are used to determine the cost of your car insurance, there are a few things you can do to help secure a competitive rate:

* **Shop around:** Car insurance companies use unique rating algorithms to determine your premium, so you’ll get a different rate with each carrier. You may wind up paying a lower premium if you take a little extra time to compare auto insurance companies.
* **Shop early:** Shopping up to a month ahead of your renewal date can be helpful, as it allows you time to [gather quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) and make a decision. Most companies require at least a month’s down payment, so make sure you account for that in your budget.
* **Utilize discounts:** Most carriers, from the top auto insurance companies to local agencies, offer their customers a selection of discounts. Exact offerings and eligibility will vary among providers.
* **Participate in a telematics program:** A telematics device or app tracks your driving habits. If you drive safely and obey traffic laws, your insurer might reward you with a discount.
* **Keep a clean driving record:** At-fault accidents and tickets are signs that you may engage in risky driving behaviors and can significantly increase your rates.
* **Consider your vehicle:** While not the most practical step for everyone, you could consider shopping for a different vehicle if you need to lower your rates drastically.
* **Set realistic expectations:** Not all drivers will be able to score an amazing deal on their insurance. For example, if you have a [DUI conviction](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/#how-does-a-dui-affect-insurance-premiums) on your record, data show that average rates for a full coverage policy can be up to 96 percent more.

### Types of car insurance discounts

When navigating the world of insurance, being aware of discount opportunities can help you find the best auto insurance and significantly reduce your overall premium. When comparing auto insurance companies, keep in mind that not every discount is available in every state and eligibility requirements change depending on your provider.

Here are some of the [best car insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) to ask your insurance agent about:

Affinity or occupational discount
Caret Down Icon

Some insurance providers offer discounts and premium reductions for policyholders associated with qualifying clubs, employers or professions.

Anti-theft discount
Caret Down Icon

Most insurance carriers offer discounts on comprehensive coverage for vehicles with anti-theft devices, and the discount amount aligns with the device's effectiveness. Basic car alarms usually have the least savings and systems with emergency tracking and disabling systems have the most.

Automatic payments discount
Caret Down Icon

Enrolling your policy in an automatic payment plan with your insurer may save you money. While each carrier is different, policyholders who set up auto-pay with their bank account instead of a credit or debit card may save even more since carriers usually pass down their savings from finance charges.

Green or hybrid vehicle discount
Caret Down Icon

Eco-friendly cars may earn a discount with some providers.

Low-mileage discounts
Caret Down Icon

The less you drive the lower the risk is of being in a car accident. Many insurance companies have discounts for carpooling and farm use, which are low mileage behaviors and offer lower rates to drivers with low annual mileage.

Loyalty discount
Caret Down Icon

Many insurance companies offer a discount for policyholders who stay with the same carrier over several years.

Multi-line discounts
Caret Down Icon

Car and home insurance bundles are just one kind of multi-line discount. Some providers offer savings for bundling auto policies with other insurance products like boat, RV and renters insurance.

New business discount
Caret Down Icon

Some insurance companies offer discounts to new customers switching over from other carriers.

Paperless or online billing discount
Caret Down Icon

Policyholders who opt for digital documents over paper mail may receive a discount.

Pay in full discount
Caret Down Icon

Policyholders who can pay their insurance premiums in full at the time of sale and renewal may receive a discount and save money by avoiding the service fees included in each billing cycle.

Safe driving discounts
Caret Down Icon

Along with being placed in a preferred risk group, drivers who stay incident-free may qualify for extra savings.

Youthful operator discounts
Caret Down Icon

There are several discount options geared toward teen drivers with many carriers, such as a good student discount or driver training discount.

* ### How much car insurance do I need?

  Caret Down Icon 

  The [amount of car insurance you need](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/how-much-car-insurance-do-you-really-need/) depends on several factors, such as your state's minimum requirements, the value of your car, your financial circumstances and more. While liability-only coverage with minimum limits may save you money, higher liability limits offer more financial protection. If you have a leased vehicle, you may be contractually obligated to carry limits of 100/300/50, however this selection may work well for other drivers too.

  Policyholders who own their own homes, businesses or have different types of valuable assets may consider these limits and an umbrella policy. Umbrella policies can provide $1 million to $10 million in liability coverage depending on eligibility and provider. When comparing auto insurance companies and premiums, speak to your agent about your risk tolerance level so they can help you select the best option for your situation.

* ### What car insurance company has the highest customer satisfaction?

  Caret Down Icon 

  Based on data from the [J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study), USAA tends to have the highest customer satisfaction ratings, but it doesn’t qualify for official ranking due to eligibility requirements. Geico and State Farm generally have above-average ratings, but rankings vary by region. Bear in mind that “good service” can mean something different to everyone. Third-party ratings are a helpful metric, but aligning a company to your needs may be even more important. If you want a local agent, for example, choosing a company that operates mainly digitally will likely leave you feeling unsatisfied, even if the company has high customer satisfaction scores.

  Third-party ratings are a helpful metric, but aligning a company to your needs may be even more important. Some drivers prefer maintaining their policies digitally; others appreciate the guidance of an in-office agent. And some drivers want to keep all of their financial products in one place, while others don’t mind purchasing auto, home and life insurance from different providers.

* ### Can I find better rates by switching car insurance companies?

  Caret Down Icon 

  You may be able to find better rates by comparing auto insurance companies and [switching carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/switching-carriers/), but do so with caution. Homeowners in most states have seen rate increases in the past few years regardless of their insurance carrier, so you might not be able to save as much as you would have in the past. Along with making sure you're getting quotes for the same types and levels of coverage from each, keep an eye out for new customer discounts. If you are offered one, verify how much you can save and when the discount will drop off the policy. It's possible your rate could increase to an amount that's higher than what you currently pay once that discount is removed at the following renewal.

  Many insurance experts recommend reviewing your auto policy annually, checking to make sure the coverage options still fit your needs and asking for quotes from several other companies. Since obtaining quotes is generally free and easy to do (most major insurers offer online quotes), there's no harm in looking around to see if another company might offer you a better rate than what you're currently paying. Keep in mind, however, that cost is only one metric to consider when shopping for the best company. You may also want to look at third-party ratings for customer service and financial strength as well as consider other factors that matter to you.

You may also want to look at third-party ratings for customer service and financial strength as well as consider other factors that matter to you.
* ### Are large car insurance companies better than small carriers?

  Caret Down Icon 

  When [choosing between small and large insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/small-vs-large-car-insurance-companies/#top-10-largest-insurance-companies-by-market-share), knowing what you want from a provider can help you decide. Bigger companies typically have robust digital tools, 24/7 customer service, offer more lines of insurance and are better financially equipped to handle catastrophic losses. However, a small agency could offer more personalized service, have real-world experience with the risk in your area and your premium would help support the local economy. Someone who prefers self-service options may want a company with a well-developed app, while others may want a live agent to walk them through policy changes and answer questions.

* ### Credit-based insurance scores:

  Caret Down Icon 

  Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

* ### Age:

  Caret Down Icon 

  Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
