## What happens to my car insurance when I move states?

**You need to get a new insurance policy when you move to another state.** Contact your current insurance company to see if they offer policies in that state. If they don’t, you will need to switch companies.

Your car insurance rate may go up or down depending on where you move. Shop around and [compare car insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/) quotes from several companies before you buy a new policy.

## Methodology

LendingTree uses insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services using publicly sourced insurance company filings. Rates are based on an analysis of hundreds of thousands of car insurance quotes for a typical driver. Prices are shown for comparative purposes only. Your own rates may be different.

Unless noted otherwise, quotes are for a full-coverage policy for a 30-year-old man with good credit and a clean driving record who drives a 2015 Honda Civic EX.

Minimum-liability policies provide liability coverage with the state’s required minimum limits.

Full-coverage policies include collision, comprehensive and liability coverage:

* Bodily injury liability: $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage liability: $25,000
* Uninsured / underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident
* Personal injury protection: Minimum limits, where required by law
* Collision: $500 deductible
* Comprehensive: $500 deductible

Our team of insurance experts rated insurance companies based on several categories. These categories include average rates, discounts, coverage options, third-party customer service ratings and app/website experience. We weighted these categories based on what customers value in an insurance company.

For third-party customer service ratings, we included Complaint Index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best. NAIC Complaint Index scores are used to determine how satisfied customers are with their claims, while financial strength ratings from A.M. Best reflect the ability to pay out claims. Overall satisfaction ratings are from the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.
