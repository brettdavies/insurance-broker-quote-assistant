# Commercial umbrella insurance cost

The cost of commercial umbrella insurance varies based on a number of factors about your business, including your industry's level of risk, the amount of coverage you buy, location, and more.

## What is the average cost of umbrella insurance coverage?

Small businesses pay an average premium of **$75 per month**, or about $900 annually, for [commercial umbrella insurance](/small-business-insurance/umbrella-liability "Commercial umbrella insurance").

[Our figures are calculated](/small-business-insurance/cost#our-methodology "Our methodology for calculating business insurance premiums") using the median cost of policies sold by [leading insurance companies](/about-us/our-insurance-partners "Our trusted business insurance companies") to Insureon's small business customers. The median offers a better estimate of what your business is likely to pay because it excludes outlier high and low premiums.

Commercial umbrella insurance boosts liability coverage when you reach the maximum policy limit on your underlying [general liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/general-liability "General liability insurance"), [commercial auto insurance](/small-business-insurance/commercial-auto "Commercial auto insurance"), or [employer's liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/workers-compensation/employers-liability "Employer’s liability insurance").

Most small businesses purchase this extra coverage as a way to meet client's demands for limits exceeding $2 million.

![How much do small businesses pay for commercial umbrella insurance with Insureon?](https://www.insureon.com/-/media/insurance-policies/insurance-policy-imagery/umbrella-excess-liability-insurance/commercial-umbrella-cost-page/graph_umbrella-liability-cost.png?h=991&iar=0&w=1913&rev=da362301598448c1ba108f3ee528e9d6 "How much do small businesses pay for commercial umbrella insurance with Insureon?")

## Factors that impact umbrella insurance rates

A number of factors will determine your umbrella insurance costs, including:

* [Policy limits and deductible](/blog/what-are-insurance-premiums-policy-limits-deductibles "What are insurance premiums, policy limits, and deductibles?")
* Claims history
* Location
* Property handling
* Business size and revenue
* Types of coverage
* Industry risks

![Umbrella insurance cost factors graphic.](https://www.insureon.com/-/media/insurance-policies/insurance-policy-imagery/umbrella-excess-liability-insurance/desktop_umbrella_cost.jpg?h=1396&iar=0&w=1801&rev=90b894c208154948bb64b2dd2947d895 "Umbrella insurance cost factors graphic.")

### Policy limits and deductible

The cost of umbrella insurance increases with the amount of insurance coverage. In short, you'll pay more for higher liability limits.

Generally, it costs about $40 per month for each [$1 million](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/1-million-dollar-liability-cost "How much does $1 million liability insurance cost?") of additional coverage you buy.

For example, raising the limits on your general liability insurance from $2 million to $5 million might cost an additional $120 per month over the cost of the underlying policy.

Commercial umbrella insurance boosts your limits across several liability policies. If you only need coverage added to one liability insurance policy, then you could purchase [excess liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/excess-liability-coverage).

To select the most cost-effective policy for your business, assess its potential liabilities and determine whether it needs the extra protection that commercial umbrella insurance provides.

### Claims history

Previous liability claims against your business could increase the cost of your umbrella liability policy. The fewer claims you have on your record, the lower your insurance costs will be.

Underwriters often see previous insurance claims as an indicator of future risk, and will adjust insurance rates accordingly.

This doesn't just apply to umbrella insurance claims, either. Even if you made a claim on another policy, such as [general liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/compare/general-liability-vs-umbrella-liability "General liability vs. umbrella liability insurance"), it could still increase your umbrella insurance rates.

### Location

The city, region, or state where your business property is located could impact your commercial umbrella coverage costs.

Your local laws and regulations could impact your insurance costs. [New York](/states/new-york-business-insurance "Business insurance in New York") businesses, for example, will likely pay different rates than those in [Texas](/states/texas-business-insurance "Business insurance in Texas").

Because state laws mandate the levels of insurance required for small businesses for policies such as [workers' compensation](/small-business-insurance/workers-compensation/state-laws "State laws for workers’ compensation") and [commercial auto](/small-business-insurance/commercial-auto/state-laws "State laws for commercial auto insurance"), your business may need an umbrella policy to expand your coverage in order to remain compliant.

Higher density areas often have higher insurance rates as well, due to the increased rates of incidents due to higher populations.

### Property handling

If you regularly handle customer property, you may be at increased risk of a [property damage](/insurance-glossary/property-damage) lawsuit.

The more customer property your business handles, the higher your rates might be due to the increased risk of you or an employee causing property damage or destruction.

For example, a [computer repair business](/technology-business-insurance/computer-repair-businesses "Computer repair business insurance") could pay higher rates than a fully digital business due to the increased risk associated with handling hardware.

### Business size and revenue

The bigger your business and the more revenue you generate, the more you will likely pay for commercial umbrella insurance coverage.

This is, in large part, because the more work you perform for clients, the more opportunities there are for errors, accidents, and incidents.

A solo [general contractor](/construction-contracting-business-insurance/general-contractors "General contractor insurance"), for example, will have different business needs and insurance rates than a large [commercial building](/construction-contracting-business-insurance/commercial-builders "Commercial builders insurance") company.

### Types of coverage

The cost of your umbrella policy will depend, in part, on what policies are being expanded.

For example, an umbrella policy for a company that only carries an auto policy will likely cost less than a business with [general liability](/small-business-insurance/general-liability "General liability insurance"), [commercial auto](/small-business-insurance/commercial-auto "Commercial auto insurance"), and [employer's liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/workers-compensation/employers-liability).

### Industry risks

Our analysis of commercial umbrella insurance providers reveals that for small businesses, your [industry](/who-we-insure "Industries we insure") has the biggest impact on your premium.

Businesses in industries that are vulnerable to costly lawsuits may need higher limits than those with limited liability, and will pay a higher premium for umbrella insurance.

For example, [building design professionals](/design-business-insurance "Building design business insurance") pay an average of $112 monthly for umbrella coverage, while [nonprofits](/nonprofit-business-insurance "Nonprofit business insurance") pay an average of only $43 per month. The graph below illustrates how the type of business affects what you'll pay for a commercial umbrella insurance policy.

Depending on the industry that you work in, such as [construction](/construction-contracting-business-insurance "Construction business insurance") or [cannabis](/cannabis-business-insurance "Cannabis dispensary insurance"), you may be [required by your state](/states "State laws and requirements for business insurance") to carry general liability insurance.

For other businesses, such as those in [real estate](/real-estate-business-insurance "Real estate business insurance"), [insurance](/insurance-agent-business-insurance "Insurance agent and broker insurance"), or [healthcare](/healthcare-professionals-business-insurance "Healthcare business insurance"), you may need [professional liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/professional-liability) (also called [errors and omissions insurance](/small-business-insurance/errors-omissions)) before you can get a license.

## Does my business need umbrella insurance?

Commercial umbrella insurance increases the coverage limits of your underlying insurance policies in $1 million increments.

It's fairly common for a client's contract to call for a $5 million limit on a policy. In that case, an umbrella policy with a limit of $3 million would be added to a business liability policy with a $2 million limit to reach the total requested amount.

It's important to make sure you're fully protected against the high costs of a lawsuit. At any business, a visitor could trip and suffer an injury. The resulting legal and medical expenses might escalate to the point where they could sink your business.

Even if no one outside your company visits your office, someone could still hold your business liable for damages. For example, businesses that run advertising campaigns or [post on social media](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/social-media "Social media liability insurance coverage") could face a lawsuit if they post content that doesn't belong to them, or [make a false claim](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/false-advertising-insurance "False advertising insurance coverage") about a competitor.

When someone sues your business – even if it's a frivolous lawsuit – you'll have to pay legal defense costs, such as the cost of hiring an attorney. If you lose the suit, you could end up paying a fortune in a court-ordered [judgment or a settlement](/blog/settlements-vs-judgments "What is the difference between a judgment and settlement?").

Umbrella insurance kicks in when your underlying policy reaches its limit, which could save your business from a devastating loss. Because the premium is based upon your level of risk and how much coverage you buy, small businesses like [LLCs](/small-business-insurance/llc-insurance "LLC insurance") and [sole proprietorships](/small-business-insurance/sole-proprietor-insurance "Sole proprietor business insurance") often pay only a small monthly premium for this coverage.

## How can you save money on umbrella insurance?

There are a few ways to keep umbrella insurance costs down and avoid more [expensive rates](/blog/why-is-commercial-insurance-expensive "Why is commercial insurance so expensive?"), including:

**Pay your entire premium upfront.** You can typically pay your premium in monthly or annual installments. It might be tempting to go with a smaller monthly payment, but consider paying the full premium instead. Many insurers offer discounts on annual premiums.

**Proactively manage your risks.** Umbrella insurance covers your liability risks across several policies, and fewer claims mean lower insurance rates.

For example, if a client at a [real estate business](/real-estate-business-insurance/umbrella-liability "Commercial umbrella insurance for real estate businesses and rental properties") falls in the office and suffers a major injury that goes beyond the standard policy, an umbrella insurance would kick in and provide additional financial coverage. However, subsequent insurance policies purchased by the real estate agency may be higher due to the claims.

Business owners can create a comprehensive [risk management](/insurance-glossary/risk-management) plan to avoid claims. For example, you might:

* Develop a thorough training program for employees
* Invest in a security system
* Compile rules for posting to social media
* Create procedure checklists and reviews
* [Minimize hazards](/blog/how-to-prevent-workplace-injuries "How to prevent workplace injuries") on your business premises
* Limit who can drive business vehicles to avoid claims on your auto insurance policy

You can also learn more about [saving money](/small-business-insurance/cheap-business-insurance "Cheap business insurance") on other types of insurance, from our pages on [cheap general liability insurance](/small-business-insurance/general-liability/cheap) and [cheap commercial auto insurance](/small-business-insurance/commercial-auto/cheap).

## Are there any exclusions to umbrella insurance coverage?

You can only buy an umbrella policy for general liability, commercial auto, and employer’s liability policies. You must first buy one or more of these policies before you can buy umbrella coverage for each one.

Other business insurance coverages, such as [workers’ compensation](/small-business-insurance/workers-compensation), [cyber insurance](/small-business-insurance/cyber-liability), and [commercial property insurance](/small-business-insurance/commercial-property), are excluded from umbrella coverage.

## Why do small businesses choose Insureon?

Insureon is here to bring you peace of mind. The right insurance policies can help you avoid expensive out-of-pocket costs and save money on some of the biggest small business risks.

By completing Insureon’s [easy online application](/start-quote "Get free quotes now!") today, you can get free quotes for commercial umbrella insurance and other policies from top-rated U.S. insurance companies.

You can also [consult with an insurance agent](/contact-us "Contact a licensed agent!") on your business insurance needs if you have questions about umbrella coverage or other small business policies, such as a [business owners' policy (BOP)](/small-business-insurance/business-owners-policy) or a [general liability](/small-business-insurance/general-liability "General liability insurance") policy.

Most small business owners begin coverage and receive a [certificate of insurance](/small-business-insurance/certificate-of-liability-insurance "Certificate of insurance for small business") within 24 hours of applying.
