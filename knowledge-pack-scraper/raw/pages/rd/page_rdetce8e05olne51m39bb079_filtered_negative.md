* USTR Seeks Comments on Unfair Trade Practices
#  USTR Seeks Comments on Unfair Trade Practices
**What**: On February 20, 2025, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published a notice seeking comments in reviewing and identifying unfair trade practices by other countries. Unfair trade practices may encompass an expansive range of practices, such as policies, measures, or barriers that undermine or harm U.S. production, exports, or a failure by a country to take action to address a non-market policy or practice in a way which harms the United States.
**Why:** The information provided by the public, including small businesses, will assist USTR in recommending appropriate actions to remedy such practices and report to the President proposed remedies in pursuit of reciprocal trade relations.
**Action:** Small businesses are encouraged to include the foreign country or economy concerned, the practice or trade arrangement of concern, a brief explanation of the operation of the practice or trade arrangement, and an explanation of the impact or effect of the practice or trade arrangement on the interested party or on U.S. interests.

The Office of Advocacy supports businesses with less than 500 employees, non-profit organizations, and independent contractors. Our mission is to help small entities as regulations are developed in Washington.
We are an independent office within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). We do not take part in SBA’s work on loans, disaster relief, or procurement.
