## Our Expert Take
## Our Expert Take
Geico offers competitive car insurance rates for a variety of driver profiles. That includes motorists with poor credit, who often pay much higher rates than people with good credit.
If you’re a digital-first person, you may appreciate Geico’s excellent digital experience. Users gave the company’s apps an average rating of 4.8 out of 5. The company’s website has a user-friendly online quoting process and a live chat.
Though Geico ranked highly, the company’s coverage options aren’t as expansive as some competitors. Geico doesn’t offer new car replacement, gap insurance, rideshare insurance or a vanishing deductible. If you want any of those types of coverage, you’ll need to check out other companies.
We surveyed Geico customers who made a claim and found that 86% were satisfied with the claims process. That’s better than the survey average (83%). We also found that 87% of Geico customers said they would recommend the company, which is about the average (86%). An impressive 90% of customers said they liked Geico’s service and prices, which was better than the survey average of 86%.
  * Low level of complaints made against Geico car insurance to state insurance departments can reflect high customer satisfaction.
  * Excellent insurance costs for senior drivers ages 65 to 80.
  * Low rates for good drivers.


  * Higher than average rates for drivers with a DUI.
  * Received only a grade of C- from collision repair experts for its claims procedures.


Great for Drivers with Poor Credit

### Geico Car Insurance Rates by Credit Score

---|---|---  
Excellent |  $1,501 |  17% cheaper

![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Praying-handsx2.svg) |  **Accident Forgiveness** Geico’s optional [accident forgiveness insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/) means rates won’t increase after your first at-fault accident. Geico provides free accident forgiveness after you are accident-free for at least five years.  
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rental-car.png) |  **Rental Car Reimbursement** [Rental car reimbursement](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement/) helps pay for a rental car if you’re unable to drive your car due to a problem covered by your policy.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Road-side-assistance@2x.svg) |  **Roadside Assistance** If you’re stranded on the side of the road, [roadside assistance plans](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-roadside-assistance-plans/) offer services such as battery jump starts, towing, changing a flat tire, fuel delivery, and winching of your vehicle if it’s stuck. You can also buy Geico roadside assistance for boats, motorcycles and RVs.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Drunk-driver@2x.svg) |  **SR-22s** Geico offers [SR-22 insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-sr-22-insurance/) for high-risk drivers who are required by their state to prove that they have at least minimum auto insurance coverage.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Usage-based-insurance@2x.svg) |  **Usage-based Insurance** Geico’ s [usage-based insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usage-based-insurance/), DriveEasy, tracks your driving habits through an app. Geico evaluates the driving data and adjusts the premium based on your driving. DriveEasy might lead to lower insurance rates, but Geico says riskier drivers could pay more based on their DriveEasy data.  
### Add-On Coverage Geico Does Not Offer
These coverage options are **not** available with Geico:
  * **Diminishing deductible.** Geico doesn’t offer a [diminishing deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/diminishing-deductible/). A diminishing deductible decreases your collision and comprehensive deductibles over time if you don’t receive tickets or file claims.
  * **Gap insurance.** Geico doesn’t provide loan or lease [gap insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/gap-insurance/). It can bridge the gap between a car’s value and the amount still owed on the vehicle after a total loss.
  * **New car replacement.** Geico doesn’t offer [new car replacement coverage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/new-car-replacement/). Other insurers with new car replacement coverage replace a vehicle with the same make and model if it’s totaled within two model years.
  * **Pay-per-mile insurance.** Geico doesn’t offer a [pay-per-mile car insurance ](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usage-based-insurance/)option. Pay-per-mile car insurance partially calculates your rates based on how many miles you drive each month.
  * **Rideshare insurance.** Geico doesn’t offer [rideshare insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-to-find-best-rideshare-insurance/). Drivers who work for Uber or Lyft may want rideshare insurance to cover gaps in coverage between their personal auto insurance and rideshare company insurance policies.

## Methodology
To identify the [best car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, collision repair grades from auto body professionals and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit and drivers caught without insurance.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


**Source:** [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Car insurance coverage options (20% of score):** Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer:
  * Accident forgiveness
  * Gap insurance
  * New car replacement
  * Nonowners policies
  * Usage-based insurance
  * Pay-per-mile insurance
  * Rideshare insurance
  * SR-22s
  * Vanishing deductibles


**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Complaints (15% of score):** We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.
**Source:** [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
**Collision repair (5% of score):** We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
**Source:** CRASH Network’s [Insurer Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.
**Digital experience (5% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated car insurers on:
  * Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple.
  * If there’s a useful website search function.
  * If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
  * If there’s a Spanish version of the website.
  * If you can get a quote online.


**Source:** Forbes Advisor research.
**Likelihood to recommend car insurers to others (5% of score) and satisfaction with customer service and price (5% of score):** We surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company.
**Source:** This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11-29, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.5 point with 95% confidence. This survey was overseen by Talker Research, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society (MRS) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).
**Satisfaction with claims process (up to 5% of score):** We surveyed 3,000 American drivers who have filed a car insurance claim within the past 12 months.
