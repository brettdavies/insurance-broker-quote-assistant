## About GEICO renters insurance

GEICO is best known for auto insurance, covering more than 28 million vehicles, but it also offers other types of insurance through its partners. GEICO renters insurance comes from third-party companies — not GEICO itself — and you won’t learn which insurer you’ve been paired with until you’ve gotten most of the way through the quote process.

You may want to explore GEICO’s renters insurance options if you already have car insurance with GEICO. You’ll qualify for a discount by [bundling auto and renters insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/best-auto-renters-insurance-bundles) through the company.

* ### Why doesn’t this company have a NerdWallet star rating?

  We make every effort to rate each company we review. However, we’re sometimes unable to provide a NerdWallet star rating for insurers that work with multiple third parties to underwrite their policies. That’s because the quality of the policy you get may vary depending on the coverage options, financial strength and other factors of each separate underwriting company.
* ### Why you can trust NerdWallet

  Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) that ensure fairness and accuracy in order to help you choose the financial products that work best for you. Here is a list of [our partners](https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/our-partners) and [here’s how we make money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/advertiser-disclosure).

## Where GEICO stands out

**Availability.** GEICO can find you a renters insurance policy in any state or Washington, D.C.

**Bundling savings.** You can get a discount for buying both renters and auto insurance through GEICO.

## Where GEICO falls short

**Information on coverage options.** Because your coverage add-ons depend on which company you’re matched with, GEICO’s website is short on details about how you might be able to customize your policy. You’ll have to get a quote to get more information.

**No choice of third-party provider.** GEICO works with many third parties, but when you get a quote online, you won’t have a choice about which one insures you.

## GEICO renters insurance coverage

The GEICO Insurance Agency serves as a broker that matches you with one of its dozens of renters insurance partners, including well-known companies like [Liberty Mutual](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/renters/liberty-mutual-renters-insurance-review) and [Travelers](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/renters/travelers-renters-insurance-review). (Note that you don’t get to choose which company you’re matched with.)

The exact types of coverage available to you will depend on which third-party insurer GEICO assigns to you, but standard renters policies include:

* **[Personal property coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/personal-property-insurance)** in case your belongings are stolen or damaged.
* [**Renters liability coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/renters-liability-insurance) for lawsuit damages, medical payments and legal fees if someone is injured on your property or you cause damage to someone else’s property.
* [**Loss of use coverage**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/loss-of-use-coverage) for expenses above your normal living costs if you need to move out of your home while it’s being repaired after a disaster.

Additional coverage options vary depending on where you live and which insurer GEICO matches you with. Based on our research, some of the following optional coverage types may be available from GEICO’s partners:

* **[Water backup coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/water-backup-coverage)** in case a drain or sewer line backs up into your home.
* **[Identity fraud coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/identity-theft-insurance)** to help you cope with expenses related to identity theft.
* **[Replacement cost coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/replacement-cost-insurance)** for your belongings, so you’ll be paid the amount it would cost to purchase new items (rather than the depreciated value of your 3-year-old phone, for instance).
* **Additional coverage for jewelry and other valuables** beyond the limits listed in your renters policy.
* **[Earthquake coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/earthquake-insurance)** for those in at-risk states.

## Discounts

You can get a discount if you buy both auto and renters insurance through GEICO. Other savings available to you will depend on the third-party insurer that provides your renters policy.

Note that many insurers offer discounts if your home has smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems, burglar alarms or other safety features.

## Consumer experience

**Website:** On GEICO’s site you can get a renters insurance quote, estimate the value of your personal belongings, and read basic information about coverage and discount options. You can also find contact information for GEICO’s renters insurance partners.

**App:** GEICO’s mobile app is mostly designed for its auto insurance customers. However, the third-party insurer that provides your renters insurance may have an app you can use to manage your policy.

**Claims:** You’ll have to file renters claims directly with the third-party insurer.

**Customer service:** GEICO’s chatbot can answer quick questions. You can also log in to send direct messages to the company, or call 800-241-8098 to ask questions about your renters policy.

## GEICO renters insurance vs. other insurers

Here’s how GEICO renters insurance stacks up against policies from other popular companies.

### GEICO vs. Lemonade renters insurance

The biggest difference between GEICO and Lemonade renters insurance is that Lemonade sells its own policies, while GEICO works with third parties. With GEICO, your coverage and discount options may vary depending on which company ends up writing your policy. Both GEICO and Lemonade offer bundling discounts if you buy more than one type of insurance.

The claims filing experience is another area where the companies differ. Lemonade claims are filed through its app, and some are processed instantly. With GEICO, you’ll need to reach out to the third party that services your policy to file a claim.

You can get quick online quotes from both companies, but Lemonade’s renters policies aren’t available in all 50 states the way GEICO’s are.

Lemonade has a unique “Giveback” program that donates a portion of its premiums to charities chosen by its policyholders. Meanwhile, GEICO supports a variety of causes through the GEICO Philanthropic Foundation.

### GEICO vs. State Farm renters insurance

The main difference between GEICO and State Farm renters insurance is that State Farm sells its own renters insurance policies, while GEICO works with third-party companies to offer renters insurance.

Both companies have extra coverage options you can add to your base policy, but which ones are available depend on where you live. (With GEICO, they also depend on which third party underwrites your policy.) Both companies offer a bundling discount if you buy auto insurance along with your renters policy.

When it comes to filing claims, State Farm gives you more options. You can submit your claim online, through the State Farm app or by calling a dedicated claims line. With GEICO, you’ll need to call the company that issued your policy or submit online through its website.
