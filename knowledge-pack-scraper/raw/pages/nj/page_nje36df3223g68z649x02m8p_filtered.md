Florida law requires all registered drivers to carry car insurance.

Vehicles cannot be registered unless drivers obtain auto insurance. As Florida is a no-fault state, going through insurance is mandatory if an accident occurs. Drivers must carry personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability with their policies. These types of coverage compensate anyone who suffers injuries or damages in a [car accident](https://www.andrewpickettlaw.com/car-accident-lawyers/).

## Car Insurance Requirements in Florida

You should expect various car insurance requirements in Florida. They include that Florida is a no-fault state, minimum requirements in Florida, property damage liability coverage limits, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and personal injury protection (PIP).

### No-Fault State

As a no-fault state, Florida requires drivers to carry auto insurance and turn to their policies after accidents. Coverage pays for expenses related to injuries and other damages.

#### Definition of No-Fault State

The definition of no-fault state means that if a car accident occurs, the parties involved don’t have to prove fault. Instead, any damages are compensated through the person’s auto insurance policy. This differs from fault states, where liability must be established when filing a claim.

#### How it Affects Car Insurance Requirements

[According to Florida Statute 627.7407](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.7407.html), no-fault law requires drivers to carry the minimum personal injury protection (PIP). This amounts to $10,000 in coverage to protect each driver in the event of an accident to pay for their medical expenses, lost wages and lost earning capacity.

### Minimum Requirements in Florida

Florida requires drivers to have minimum coverage with their car insurance. These amounts equate to $10,000 for PIP and property damage liability (PDL).

#### Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Limits

The minimum bodily injury coverage is $10,000 per person and up to $20,000 per accident. However, in severe crashes, this may not be enough to cover your damages. As such, you might have to increase your insurance coverage or file a lawsuit.

### Property Damage Liability Coverage Limits

Property damage liability coverage limits are $10,000 per policy. The liable driver’s insurance pays for damage to someone’s vehicle and other property. If the limit is insufficient to compensate for damages, the person can file a lawsuit.

### Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage

Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage protects drivers in accidents involving drivers who don’t have insurance or don’t have enough coverage. It’s not mandatory but is good to carry.

What Is Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage?

[According to Florida Statute 627.727](https://m.flsenate.gov/statutes/627.727), uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage can pay for damages caused by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver or cover the difference for an accident with an underinsured driver. It can compensate beyond your regular PIP and PDL coverage.

#### Is It Required in Florida?

Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is not required in Florida. However, it’s smart to have it in case you get into a car accident with someone uninsured or underinsured.

### Personal Injury Protection (PIP)

[According to Florida Statute 627.736](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.736.html), PIP covers the policyholder and relatives in their household for injuries. Minimum coverage of $10,000 is required to cover up to 80% of medical expenses and $5,000 in death benefits.

### What Does PIP Cover?

PIP covers all necessary medical treatment and expenses regardless of fault. It also provides death benefits to pay for funeral and burial expenses if someone is killed in a car accident.

### PIP Coverage Limits

PIP coverage limits are 80%, up to $10,000 per person for injury expenses such as medical bills, therapy, rehabilitation and diagnostic testing. This also includes up to $5,000 per person for death benefits.

## Benefits of Having PIP Coverage in Florida

Florida drivers can benefit from having PIP coverage. The insurance allows them to be reimbursed for medical expenses stemming from car accident-related injuries. It also covers up to 60% of lost wages and provides death benefits and replacement services.
