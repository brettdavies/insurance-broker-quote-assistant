Your wine collection represents more than a hobby or a few bottles collecting dust. Collections can also be a [curated investment portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/12/portfolio-management-tips-young-investors.asp) that could rival traditional investments in both their value and market volatility. 
A single bottle of Screaming Eagle Sauvignon Blanc can go for over $7,000, and the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at an auction was a 1869 Chateau Lafite Rothschild that went for $207,075.1 With single bottles commanding this much, an entire collection can easily sell for six or seven figures. Yet unlike stocks and bonds, wine is a [tangible asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp), putting it at risk for things like temperature fluctuations, theft, label damage, fires, and more.2
Some collectors may spend thousands on climate control systems and security for their wine, but fail to realize their [standard homeowners insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp) only covers the equivalent of a few bottles in their collection. 
### Key Takeaways
  * Wine collections worth several thousand dollars should have dedicated insurance beyond your standard homeowners policy.3
  * Insurance costs typically range from 40 to 80 cents annually per $100 of collection value.4
  * Proper storage, documentation, and regular appraisals will help you maintain adequate coverage. 
  * Coverage options include individual bottle scheduling or blanket collection policies.


##  How To Protect Your Wine Collection 
One of the most important measures you can take is protecting your wine collection proactively, even before you sign up for insurance. Here are a few tips to help you secure and preserve your wine collection: 
###  Storage Best Practices: 
  * Store your wine in a climate-controlled environment that maintains consistent temperatures (55°F) and humidity (65-75%).5
  * Secure your wine bottles horizontally on racks to prevent breaking and to keep the corks moist.
  * Keep wine away from windows, heating vents, direct sunlight, or vibrating appliances.
  * Avoid storing wine near chemicals, cleaning products, or other odor-producing items.
  * Choose a location not prone to flooding, frequent movement, or vibrations.6

###  Security and Documentation: 
  * Install security systems such as alarms, cameras, or motion detectors to prevent theft. 
  * Update your inventory and appraisal tracking at least annually. 
  * Keep detailed purchase records with dates, prices, and provenance in a secure location away from your wine.6


##  Your Options for Insuring Your Wine Collection 
When it comes to insuring your wine collection, you have several coverage approaches to choose from: 
###  Schedule Coverage 
This option involves insuring individual bottles or specific high-value wines separately. Scheduled coverage is ideal for several bottles worth over $1,000 or more each. Each scheduled item receives its own coverage limit based on its appraised value. 
###  Blanket Coverage 
If you have a substantial collection, blanket insurance provides comprehensive coverage for your entire collection under one policy. This typically includes a per-bottle limit and is more cost-effective for larger collections with more moderately priced bottles. 
###  Hybrid Approach 
Many collectors choose a combination strategy, using blanket coverage for their general collection while separately scheduling their most valuable individual bottles. 
###  Off-Site Storage Coverage 
For collections stored in professional wine storage facilities, specialized coverage can protect against facility-specific risks while your wine is stored off-premises.67
##  What Does Wine Insurance Cover? 
Comprehensive wine insurance typically covers: 
  * Fire, theft, and vandalism 
  * Water damage from leaks, floods, or sprinkler systems
  * Transit damage during shipping or relocation
  * Climate control systems failures that spoil wine and power outages impacting climate-controlled storage 
  * Damage to the label from fire, flood, or other covered disasters2


### Warning
Some exclusions that wine insurance will not cover include bottles that have been opened, drunk, wear and tear from natural aging, improper storage conditions, and damages from specific natural disasters unless stated in your policy (such as earthquakes).32
##  Is Wine Insurance Worth It? 
Wine insurance begins to make financial sense once your collection reaches certain thresholds. Some of these thresholds include a collection valued at more than a few thousand dollars, if you own more than 100 bottles, you have individual bottles worth more than $1,000, or if your collection represents a large portion of your overall assets. 
Wine insurance premiums typically range from 40 to 80 cents annually per $100 of collection value. For example, for a collection worth $25,000, you might expect to pay $100 to $200 annually for coverage.4
Factors that will be considered include your collection's total value and size, age and variety of wines, and your storage methods and security risks.84
##  Appraising Your Collection 
To get a better sense of what level of insurance you need, consider having your collection [professionally appraised](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp). Many insurers will, in fact, require a professional appraisal for collections worth over a certain amount. Look for appraisers who are certified by recognized organizations like the International Society of Appraisers, or for a certified sommelier and wine expert.9
Remember that a professional appraiser will consider the current wine market, the physical condition and storage of your wine, and your documentation and record-keeping of your collection. 
##  Finding the Right Wine Insurance Provider 
Not all insurance companies offer wine coverage, and for companies that do, their coverage and expertise can vary greatly. Decide if you want to work with a specialized wine insurer who will offer more comprehensive coverage with more extensive knowledge of collector needs, or if a general insurer that offers wine coverage is sufficient for your needs. Some of the most popular wine insurers include Chubb, Horton, and Pure Insurance.10211
When picking which provider is best for your needs, make sure to compare: 
  * **Coverage limits:** Make sure your coverage limit is sufficient to insure your full collection at current market values. Consider whether you need a limit that covers your entire collection or a per-bottle limit for individual items. 
  * **Deductibles:** The [deductible](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071515/why-do-insurance-policies-have-deductibles.asp) is the amount you’ll pay out-of-pocket before insurance coverage kicks in. Lower deductibles reduce immediate costs during a claim, but you will pay higher annual premiums. Higher deductibles mean you will pay more if there is an incident, but less ongoing costs. 
  * **Claims processes:** Research each provider’s claim-filing [process](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp) and customer service reputation. Look for insurers with dedicated wine specialists who understand how to value wine. 
  * **Coverage Exclusions:** Review the fine print carefully for exclusions that might leave gaps in your protection. Common exclusions include [normal wear and tear](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wear-and-tear-exclusion.asp), deterioration, and some catastrophic events. 
  * **Additional Services:** Some insurers offer value-added services like access to wine storage facilities, transportation assistance, or collection management tools that can justify higher premiums if you are a serious collector. 


## Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Wine?
Homeowners insurance may not cover wine and spirits. It may also offer a small amount of coverage–say, $1,000–that equals your deductible. If your wine collection exceeds that value, you may opt to purchase a standalone wine and spirit policy.3  

## What Should a Wine Insurance Policy Cover?
Wine insurance policies may cover damages due to fire, flood, theft, climate control failure, and accidents during transit. Some policies may even offer protection against label damage, as the label's condition sometimes affects the bottle's value.32  

## How Much Does It Cost To Insure a Wine Collection?
Costs vary by insurer and package, but you can expect to spend about 40 to 80 cents per $100 worth of wine per year.4
##  The Bottom Line 
For wine collectors with significant investments in their cellars, proper insurance coverage is essential for risk management. Whether you’re protecting a modest collection or a substantial investment of rare wines, the relatively small cost of wine insurance will give you peace of mind. 
When shopping for wine insurance, make sure your coverage matches the value of your collection, the storage methods, and your risk profile. Remember that wine insurance is just one part of protecting your collection. Proper storage, documentation, and appraisals are equally important to [preserving your wine investment](https://www.investopedia.com/understanding-the-risks-of-investing-in-wine-11781932).
