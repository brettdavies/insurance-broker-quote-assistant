# What Is PLPD Insurance and What Does It Cover?
UPDATED: June 20, 2025
Share:
[ ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fplpd-insurance%2F) [ ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+Is+PLPD+Insurance+and+What+Does+It+Cover%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fplpd-insurance%2F)
**PLPD** stands for **Personal Liability and Property Damage** insurance—a basic, liability-only auto insurance policy that meets Illinois’ legal minimum requirements. It covers injuries and damage you cause to others in an accident but does **not** pay for repairs to your own vehicle. PLPD is often the cheapest option for legal driving in Illinois, but it comes with limitations.
For help finding affordable liability coverage, call **Insure on the Spot at**[773-202-5060](tel:773-202-5060).
## **What Does PLPD Stand For?**
In Illinois, PLPD refers to a **liability-only auto insurance policy** made up of two key coverages:
* **Personal (Bodily Injury) Liability****
**
* **Property Damage Liability****
**
This type of policy satisfies the **Illinois state minimum** insurance requirements. PLPD is often used by drivers of older vehicles or those who want to keep insurance costs as low as possible.
## **What Does PLPD Insurance Cover in Illinois?**
PLPD covers **other people’s losses** when you are at fault in an accident. It includes:
* **Bodily Injury Liability (BI)****
**Pays for the medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering of people injured in a crash you cause.
**Illinois minimum**: $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident
* **Property Damage Liability (PD)****
**Pays to repair or replace another person’s property that you damage—most often, their vehicle.
**Illinois minimum**: $20,000 per accident
This is all you need to legally drive in Illinois—but it doesn’t cover your car, your injuries, or damage from theft or weather.
## **What’s Not Covered by PLPD in Illinois?**
PLPD does **not** cover:
* **Damage to your own car** (requires collision coverage)
* **Theft, vandalism, fire, or storm damage** (requires comprehensive coverage)
* **Your medical bills** (requires MedPay or health insurance)
* **Damage from uninsured drivers** (requires uninsured motorist property damage, which isn’t required in Illinois but is available)
* **Rental car reimbursement or roadside assistance****
**
## **PLPD vs. Full Coverage in Illinois**
**Coverage Type** | **PLPD Insurance** | **Full Coverage Insurance**
---|---|---
Others’ Injuries & Property | Yes | Yes
Your Vehicle’s Damage | No | Yes (collision & comprehensive)
Legal Requirement | Yes | Optional
Monthly Cost | Lower | Higher
**PLPD** is ideal for meeting legal minimums.
**Full coverage** offers broader protection—especially for newer or financed cars.
## **When Is PLPD a Good Choice in Illinois?**
PLPD may be right for you if:
* Your car is **older or low value****
**
* You’ve **paid off** your vehicle
* You need **budget-friendly** coverage
* You can afford to pay for your own repairs if needed
* You mostly drive **short distances or in low-traffic areas****
**
PLPD is not ideal if you:
* Drive a newer or valuable vehicle
* Want financial protection after a collision
* Can’t afford to replace your car out of pocket
* Live in a high-risk driving area
## **Illinois Minimum Coverage Requirements**
Illinois law requires drivers to carry the following liability limits at a minimum:
* **$25,000** for injury or death to one person
* **$50,000** for injury or death per accident
* **$20,000** for property damage
* **Uninsured motorist bodily injury**: $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident
Note: Illinois **does not** require uninsured motorist property damage or comprehensive/collision insurance—but adding them can provide vital protection.
## **When Should You Drop Full Coverage and Switch to PLPD?**
Consider switching to PLPD if:
* Your car is worth less than $3,000–$5,000
* You’ve fully paid off your vehicle
* Your full coverage premium is **more than 10% of your car’s value annually****
**
* You’re comfortable covering repairs or a total loss yourself
Always weigh the risk before removing full coverage.
## **What Happens If You Get in an Accident With PLPD?**
**If You’re At Fault**:
* Your PLPD policy covers the **other driver’s injuries and damage****
**
* You’re responsible for **your own car’s repairs****
**
* You’ll need MedPay or health insurance for your medical bills
**If You’re Not At Fault**:
* The at-fault driver’s liability insurance should pay for your damages
* If they’re uninsured, your **uninsured motorist coverage** (if added) may cover your injuries—but not your car
**In a Hit-and-Run**:
* You’d only be protected for **injuries**, not vehicle damage, unless you carry additional coverage
## **Frequently Asked Questions About PLPD Insurance in Illinois**
* * *
**Q: What does PLPD insurance mean in Illinois?****
****A:** It stands for Personal Liability and Property Damage insurance. It’s a basic liability-only policy that covers damage and injuries you cause to others.
* * *
**Q: Does PLPD cover my car if I’m at fault?****
****A:** No. PLPD does not pay for your vehicle’s repairs. You’d need collision or comprehensive coverage for that.
* * *
**Q: Is PLPD cheaper than full coverage?****
****A:** Yes. PLPD is typically the lowest-cost option and meets the legal minimum required in Illinois.
* * *
**Q: Is PLPD the same as liability insurance?****
****A:** Yes. In Illinois, PLPD and liability insurance refer to the same basic type of coverage.
* * *
**Q: Can I buy uninsured motorist property damage with PLPD?****
****A:** Yes, it’s optional in Illinois and can be added to help protect your vehicle if hit by an uninsured driver.
* * *
**Q: When should I remove full coverage?****
****A:** Consider dropping full coverage once your car’s value is low enough that repairs or replacement wouldn’t justify the added premium.
