New legislation enacted in four states ups the amount of liability insurance required to operate a vehicle, according to AIS Insurance Specialists.

* California increased its minimum insurance requirements from 15/30/5 to 30/60/15.

Senate Bill 1107 went into effect on January 1st, 2025, increasing the minimum liability insurance drivers to:

$30,000 for bodily injury or death per person  
$60,000 for bodily injury or death per accident  
$15,000 for property damage per accident

California’s auto insurance liability limits will increase again in 10 years to 50/100/25.

New minimum limits for uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM) motorist coverage also increased to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident.

* North Carolina’s auto liability insurance limits increased as well.

Under Senate Bill 452, North Carolina raised its liability limits from 30/60/25 to 50/100/50, likely due to the frequency of litigation in the state.

Like California, new minimum limits for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage will match the increase seen under the liability limit requirement.

* Utah increased its limits under HB 113, effective January 1st, 2025.

The state’s minimum car insurance liability limits have increased from 25/65/15 to 30/65/25.

Though not mandatory coverage, Utah’s minimum limits for UM/UIM are $30,000 per person and $65,000 per accident.

* Virginia increased its limits for auto liability insurance from 30/60/20 to 50/100/25 under SB 112.

If purchased, minimum limits for UM/UIM must match the new liability limits.
