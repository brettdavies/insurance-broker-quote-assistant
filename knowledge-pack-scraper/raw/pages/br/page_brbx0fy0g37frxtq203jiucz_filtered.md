Manufactured home insurance, also referred to as mobile home insurance, may cover damage to your mobile home, personal belongings, and liability claims if you're responsible for someone else's damages or injuries. Mobile home insurance has many similarities to standard homeowners insurance, though there are some unique elements and exceptions to these policies for factory-built homes placed on a designated lot or other location.

## Is manufactured insurance required?

[Manufactured home insurance](https://www.progressive.com/mobile-home/) isn't required by law, but if you're financing your mobile home, lenders typically require proof of insurance. And even if your mobile home is paid off, insuring the roof over your head and your personal belongings can be critical if your home and personal property are damaged or destroyed by a [covered peril](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/).

## What does manufactured home insurance cover?

Here are the standard coverages on a manufactured insurance policy:

* ### Dwelling

  [Dwelling coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/dwelling-coverage/) may cover the cost to rebuild or repair the structure of your mobile home, as well as attached structures to the home, such as a deck or awning, in the event of a covered loss.
* ### Other Structures

  [Other structures coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/other-structures-coverage/) covers structures that aren't attached to the mobile home but are located on your property or lot, such as a shed or fence.
* ### Personal Property

  [Personal property coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-property-coverage/) protects your personal belongings, including electronic devices, clothing, and furniture. Certain items, like jewelry, art and collectibles, are often only covered up to a specific limit, but you may purchase an endorsement to schedule these items on your policy at the coverage amount needed, also known as [adding a rider."](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-rider/)
* ### Personal Liability

  [Personal liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-liability-insurance/) may cover you if you're legally responsible for damage to another person's property or their injuries.
* ### Loss of Use

  [Loss of use coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/loss-of-use-insurance/), sometimes referred to as "additional living expenses," may pay for hotel costs and other expenses above what you'd normally spend if you're unable to stay in your residence due to a covered incident, up to your coverage limit.

## What doesn't mobile home insurance cover?

There are a few common exclusions to manufactured home insurance policies, including:

* **Earthquakes:** Damage to your mobile home from an [earthquake](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-earthquakes/) is typically excluded from your policy.
* **Flooding from the outside:** A separate [flood insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) may protect your mobile home against flooding, but a manufactured home policy likely won't.
* **In-transit incidents:** Typically, mobile home insurance policies don't provide coverage while the home is being transported from one location to another.
* **Wear and tear:** The gradual deterioration of your mobile home isn't covered by manufactured home insurance.

## How much is mobile home insurance?

Your rate for mobile home insurance depends on many factors, such as:

* **Location:** Where you live may greatly impact the cost of your policy.
* **Age:** Older mobile homes may pose more of a risk to insurers, along with the home's condition.
* **Size:** Larger manufactured homes generally cost more to replace than smaller models.
* **Prior claims:** Multiple manufactured home insurance claims may increase your rate.

## Can you get insurance for older mobile homes?

It may be challenging to obtain coverage for an older manufactured home, especially if it was built before 1976 — the year [the U.S. Department established federal safety and construction standards for manufactured homes](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/HUD%20Code%20Proposed%20Updates%20Overview%20-%20Fact%20Sheet_071922.pdf). An older manufactured home can be riskier to insure due to outdated safety features and a greater susceptibility to damage from weather.
