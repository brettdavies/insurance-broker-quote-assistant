# Car Hail Damage in Texas: How to Protect Your Vehicle

Posted Mar 04, 2025

By the Mercury Team

Texas is no stranger to extreme weather, and hailstorms are some of the most frequent—and expensive—weather events for drivers. Whether you’re in [Dallas](/local/texas/dallas/auto-insurance/), [Houston](/local/texas/houston/auto-insurance/), or anywhere else in the Lone Star State, being prepared can save you from stress and costly repairs. In this blog, we’ll explore the risks of hailstorms in Texas, discuss the impact on vehicles, and share tips to protect your car from hail damage.

## Why Hailstorms Are a Concern for Texas Drivers

Let’s explore why hailstorms are such a major concern in Texas:

### The Impact of Hail Damage on Vehicles

Hail may seem like harmless ice falling from the sky, but even small hailstones can pack a serious punch. Here are some of the most common types of hail damage vehicles face:

* **Dents and dings:** Hailstones can leave unsightly dents all over your car, especially on the roof, hood, and trunk. Fixing these dents often requires specialized techniques like paintless dent repair.
* **Cracked or shattered windshields:** Large hailstones can hit with enough force to crack or even shatter your car’s windshield.
* **Paint damage:** The impact of hail can chip away at your car’s paint, exposing the metal underneath and increasing the risk of rust over time.

The financial burden of hail damage can add up quickly. Depending on the severity, repairs can cost anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.

**Texas Weather Patterns and Hail Risks**

Hailstorms are most common in Texas during the spring and early summer months, particularly between March and June. However, they can occur any time of year. Why?

Texas’s unique geography and weather patterns create the perfect conditions for hailstorms. The state sits at the crossroads of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains, and hot, dry air from the desert southwest. When these air masses collide, they create strong thunderstorms that are often accompanied by large hail.

Take a look at some of these statistics that highlight the impact of hailstorms in Texas:

* Texas led the nation in the number of major hail events in 2023 (1,123), according to the most recent data from the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hail).
* According to a report from [CoreLogic](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/texas-hail-2023-record-insured-losses/), there were 141 days with large hail (greater than two inches in diameter) in 2023, the highest number recorded since 2003.
* CoreLogic reported that Texas accounted for 2 million of the 10 million U.S. homes impacted by hail in 2023.
* CoreLogic also stated that a single week in May 2023 saw hailstorms and straight-line winds causing an estimated $7–$10 billion in insured losses across Texas.

## Best Ways to Protect Your Car from Hail Damage

Here are some of the best ways to protect your car from hail, whether you’re at home, on the road, or caught in an unexpected storm:

### Using a Garage or Covered Parking

One of the most effective ways to [protect your car from hail damage](/resources/weather/how-to-minimize-hailstorm-damage.html) is by parking it indoors or under a covered area. A sturdy garage is your car’s best defense against Texas hail damage, but what if you don’t have access to one? Here are some alternatives:

* **Portable car shelters:** These structures are affordable, easy to set up, and provide solid protection for your vehicle.
* **Carports or covered parking spaces:** Whether at home or a public facility, these options can shield your car during hailstorms.
* **Temporary solutions:** If you know a storm is coming, consider moving your car to a parking garage or covered lot nearby.

### Investing in Hail Protection Accessories

When a garage or carport isn’t an option, hail protection accessories can provide valuable coverage. One of the best ways to protect your car from hail is by using a specially designed hail-resistant car cover. However, not all car covers are created equal. Look for covers specifically designed for hail protection, as they usually include padded layers to absorb impact and prevent dents.

Portable car blankets or shields are also an option. These products are easy to store in your vehicle and can be quickly deployed if you’re caught in a storm.

### Windshield-Specific Protection

Your car’s windshield is one of the most vulnerable areas during a hailstorm, but there are ways to protect it:

* **Heavy blankets or hail-resistant shields:** Keep a thick blanket or specialized windshield cover in your car to shield the glass from impact.
* **Floor mats as a last resort:** If you’re caught in a storm without other options, use your car’s floor mats to cover the windshield and reduce the risk of cracking.
* **Park strategically:** If you’re outside, park with the windshield facing away from the direction of the storm to minimize damage.

## Tips for Protecting Your Car During a Hailstorm

So, what should you do if you get caught in the middle of a hailstorm? Here are some tips to help you protect your car during a hailstorm:

* **Avoid parking under trees:** It might seem like a good idea to shield your car from hail by parking under a tree, but this can backfire. Falling branches and debris from high winds can cause additional damage to your vehicle, leaving you with more than just dents to worry about.
* **Use floor mats or blankets:** If you’re caught without a garage or car cover, you can improvise with what you have on hand, like floor mats and blankets. You can lay floor mats over your windshield, roof, or hood to cushion the impact of hailstones. Also, keep a thick blanket in your car for emergencies. It can provide serviceable protection for your windshield and other exposed areas.
* **Park on the opposite side of a building:** When there’s no shelter nearby, use the environment to your advantage. Park on the opposite side of a sturdy building relative to the storm’s direction. The structure can act as a barrier and shield your car from the brunt of the hailstorm.

## Does Hail Damage Affect Car Insurance in Texas?

[Filing a claim](/claims/) for hail damage typically won’t increase your [car insurance in Texas](/local/texas/auto-insurance/). Why? Hail damage is considered an “act of nature” or “act of God,” meaning it’s not something you could have prevented. Insurance companies don’t hold you responsible for these events, so filing a claim for hail damage shouldn’t directly impact your premium.

However, if hailstorms become more frequent and costly in your area, insurance companies may adjust rates across the board for all policyholders to reflect the increased risk.

If you’re worried about how to handle hail damage to your car, comprehensive coverage is your best friend. Unlike liability or collision insurance, [comprehensive coverage](/insurance/auto/coverage/comprehensive-coverage.html) is specifically designed to protect your vehicle from non-collision damage, including hailstorms. Comprehensive coverage typically includes repair costs for dents, cracked windshields, and paint damage. If your car is severely damaged and deemed a total loss, this coverage can also help cover the cost of replacing your vehicle.

Without comprehensive coverage, you’d be responsible for covering all hail repair costs out of pocket, which can be expensive. If you’re unsure about your coverage, it’s a good idea to review your policy or reach out to [Mercury Insurance](/) for assistance.

## What to Do If Your Vehicle Suffers Hail Damage

If your car gets caught in a hailstorm, it’s important to take the right steps to address the damage quickly. Here’s what you should do:

### 1. Inspect Your Vehicle for Damage

Once the storm has passed and it’s safe to go outside, take a close look at your car for signs of hail damage (e.g., dents on the roof, cracks in the windshield, paint scratches, etc.)

### 2. Take Photos

Before moving your car or attempting any repairs, grab your phone and take clear photos of the damage. Be sure to capture close-ups of dents, cracks, or chipped paint, as well as wide shots showing the overall condition of your vehicle.

### 3. Contact Your Insurance Provider

Reach out to your insurance company as soon as possible to report the damage and start the claims process. Be prepared to provide details about the hailstorm (e.g., date and time) and the photos you took of the damage. Your insurance provider will guide you through the next steps, including getting an estimate for repairs and arranging inspections, if necessary.

### 4. Explore Repair Options

Choose a trusted repair shop, and if your insurance provider has recommended options, consider using them to streamline the process.

## Conclusion

Hailstorms are an unavoidable part of life in Texas, but these tips can help greatly reduce the risk of damage to your vehicle. It’s also a good idea to sign up for weather alerts to stay informed about approaching storms and keep protective accessories on hand so you’re ready when the unexpected happens.
