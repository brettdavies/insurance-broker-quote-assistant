Purchasing home insurance is often mandatory for getting a mortgage. Even if it’s not a requirement for you, home insurance is still one of the most important ways to protect yourself financially. Home insurance covers damage to your house and certain liabilities you may incur due to property damage or bodily injury to others.
The value of your home insurance coverage is a combination of both: One part is called [dwelling coverage](https://www.insure.com/home-insurance/dwelling-coverage/), and the other is called liability coverage. You’ll also have to pay a deductible, which we’ll discuss later. This article will dig into what $400,000 of home insurance dwelling coverage looks like with different combinations of liability coverage.
## How to use our $400,000 home insurance cost calculator
Using our [home insurance calculator](https://www.insure.com/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-calculator/) is simple. Enter the property’s ZIP code, followed by how much dwelling and liability coverage you need. If you need $400,000 worth of coverage for homeowners insurance, the dwelling field should be set to $400,000. Liability coverage is up to you, but we’ll include some sample rates with different liability coverage options below.
When you file a claim for covered damage or loss, the deductible is the part you must pay out of pocket before the insurer pays for the rest. By default, the calculator uses a deductible of $1,000.
Once you hit the calculate button, the calculator will display the highest, lowest and average homeowners insurance rates for the ZIP code and coverage amounts you entered.

## Key factors that affect the cost of homeowners insurance for a $400,000 policy
Your home insurance cost is affected by how much dwelling coverage and liability coverage you require.
Dwelling coverage covers everything from the cost of rebuilding or repairing your home to the cost of replacing property that was inside. How much dwelling coverage you need is a combination of these costs, so our $400,000 baseline may not be sufficient for your circumstances. Your dwelling coverage should include loss of use coverage to pay for living expenses while your house is uninhabitable.
Liability coverage is for property damage or bodily injury for which you’re liable. It’ll cover injuries sustained by someone on your property or if you damage someone else’s property, whether in your home or elsewhere.
**💡 Homeowner hack: Save big with small changes**
Raising your deductible or bundling policies could lower your home insurance bill, sometimes by hundreds of dollars a year.
## What property features affect home insurance rates?
Any property features that make it riskier for an [insurance company](https://www.insure.com/best-home-insurance-companies/) to insure your home could increase your rates. Location matters, especially if you live in an area prone to environmental perils like fire or flooding. Living in a high-risk area will likely result in higher rates.
“If you have a $700,000 house, your insurance will be more expensive than if you have a $300,000 home,” says Melanie Musson, an insurance expert with InsuranceProviders.com. “If your house is destroyed, your insurance provider will be responsible for the cost of rebuilding. Since rebuilding a $300,000 house costs less than a $700,000 one, you pay lower rates for the cheaper house.”
The age of your home also matters, says Zhaneta Gechev, owner of One Stop Life Insurance in Las Vegas and an expert in property and casualty insurance.
“Older homes typically have higher insurance premiums because their electrical, plumbing, and roofing systems are often older, increasing the likelihood of insurance claims,” she says.
The size of your home will make it more expensive to insure because there’s more area to protect, and upgrading your home could increase rates even more.
“Renovations, such as new flooring or a modernized kitchen, can increase the home’s [replacement cost](https://www.insure.com/home-insurance/home-replacement-cost-calculator/) and, consequently, the insurance premium,” Gechev says.
Any risks arising from the circumstances within your home could raise your rates.
“For example, you’ll likely pay higher rates if you have a fireplace,” Musson says. “If you have a dog, you may pay higher rates because there’s a higher chance you’ll need to file a liability claim.”
However, there are things you can do to mitigate risk and lower your rates, such as adding a security system.
“Many carriers offer discounts for homes monitored by a security company, as this reduces the risk of losses from break-ins,” Gechev says.

## Frequently asked questions
### How can I lower my homeowners insurance premium for $400,000 of dwelling coverage?
You can lower your home insurance costs for $400,000 worth of dwelling coverage in a number of ways. You can decrease how much liability coverage you need and increase the deductible, although both options could result in your paying more out of pocket for a claim.
You could also ask your insurance company how to mitigate any risks to your home. For example, trimming large, overhanging tree branches – which could fall on your house and damage it during a storm – demonstrates that your home is less risky to insure. As mentioned above, installing a home security system could also lower your risk of a loss and result in lower rates.
### Is $400,000 enough dwelling coverage for my home?
To estimate whether $400,000 is enough dwelling coverage for you, you need to calculate three things: how much it’ll cost to rebuild your home if it’s destroyed or damaged; the combined value of all your insurable property inside the home, and how much it would cost to replace it today; and how much you would expect to pay if you can no longer live in the home while it’s being repaired or rebuilt — referred to as “loss of use”.
### **Why does location affect my $400,000 insurance quote?**
Insurers factor in local risks like wildfires, hurricanes, crime rates, and construction costs. So, the same $400,000 home can cost drastically more to insure, depending on where it’s located.
### ****Can I lower my premium on a $400,000 home insurance policy?****
Yes. Bundling with auto insurance, increasing your deductible, installing home security systems, or improving your credit can all lower your premium.
