# Can I cancel and then restart my Progressive Insurance for a better deal?

Hey all.

I pay for my car insurance for 6 months up front at a time. It's almost time for my renewal period, but I went online and started "a new quote" in an incognito browser and the quote is $537 for the same amount of coverage instead of the $957.53 the automatic payment wants to charge me. I have nothing on my record, no accidents, never had to use my insurance. Can I call them and ask them to honor the new quote or should I say I want to cancel? If I go through with canceling, can I then start a new policy with the better pricing?

I'm still new to doing all of this, so any advice or help is appreciated. TIA!
