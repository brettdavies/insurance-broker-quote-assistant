The new quote includes a new customer discount. It doesn't recognize it yet, but it will eventually recognize that you are not a new customer. Progressive has 60 days to underwrite and review the application you submit. At minimum, they will remove the discount.

I did this with Progressive for two renewals with no problem. Then for some reason it didn't work the next time.

I'd shop around if I were you. You almost always get a better deal doing so.
(Anecdotal, but Progressive's been upping my premiums for 4 years despite having a clean record. I've never felt the impact of their loyalty awards AT ALL.)

Yep! My Progressive premium has been slowly but steadily rising for several years, but yesterday when it came time to renew for 6 months, they were asking for $530, when only 6 months prior I paid $450.
That is a massive increase, considering in the 10 years I've been a customer, I've not had a single incident. No claims, no accidents, no tickets. Just straight up moving money from my bank to theirs with nothing asked in return for 10 years.
This time I said I won't do it anymore, so based on suggestions from Reddit, I got a quote from Liberty Mutual. $230 for 6 months ($38/mo) for exactly the same coverage. That's literally less than half the price.
The only difference is with Progressive I had a fancy 10-year loyalty badge. That was a tough choice, but in the end, I decided to take the 56% cheaper option.

Same. At least on my end. I had a recent accident where I was not at-fault, but even despite my driving record they have been bumping up rates.:/

Mercury. They were cheaper overall with bundling 2 cars and a house.

It all depends on which state and rate program you’re currently in versus which one you’re quoting in.
All the BS about “new customer discount blah blah” is BS. You’ll get a $50 paperless credit on the first policy term that goes away, but the big one will be the snapshot discount. If you fail to install, enroll or drive like a jackass, you will lose that discount.
The minute you entered your name and address they ran a soft pull and CCR and know if you’re with them on an active policy.

You can ask some insurance companies to re-rate your policy if they have that option otherwise you'll just need to switch to another company for 6mo then go back to your original company in the future as a new customer -- not sure if Progressive allows re-rating but you can check your Declarations page PDF to see if its listed.
My renewal with State Farm shows this in Declarations PDF:
"You have the right to request, no more than once during a 12-month period, that your policy be re-rated using a current credit-based insurance score. Re-rating could result in a lower rate, no change in rate, or a higher rate."
For me its easier to shop around and switch every few years than dealing with re-rating

so- there is a better than great chance that you might get a balance due, once underwriting processes the application- but there is also a chance that you still end up saving. you need to be 100% honest with all answers- so if it's asking for your current insurer and the length of time with the insurer- make sure it is accurate, they'll have that info anyway.
make sure you cancel the old policy the day after the new one begins, so you don't have any lapse.
I'm trying to think of what could really go wrong as long as you're not trying to misrepresent anything, but I feel like the _worst_ that could happen is that you end up getting a better rate up front and then an additional balance due notice post underwriting- which you can just pay and be (probably) no worse off?
it could still end up less, but I doubt it would be _more_ than your current renewal.
keep us updated if you try it. I'm curious.

Have you ever had your windshield repaired because of a rock chip? That will raise your rate apparently and won't show up on a quick quote. Happened to me. Got a quote, signed up, and then they raised it because of a recent windshield replacement.

Unfortunately promo offers to bring in new customers don’t usually apply for existing customers. The business models tends to be getting people to subscribe for a low rate and then gradually increase
