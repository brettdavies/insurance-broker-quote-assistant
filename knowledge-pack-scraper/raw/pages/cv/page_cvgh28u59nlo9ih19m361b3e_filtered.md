## What is the Progressive good student discount?

Progressive offers a good student discount to drivers enrolled in school full-time who are younger than the age of 23 who maintain at least a B average.

This style of [car insurance discount](https://www.cheapcarinsurancequotes.com/car-insurance-discounts-how-to-lower-your-premiums/) is very common.

> But the Progressive deal rewards you with up to 10% savings, depending on where you live.

The starting rate reduction is lower than 10% if you live in Arizona, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, or Texas.

You cannot earn a good student discount from Progressive if you live in Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, or West Virginia.

## How do you qualify for the Progressive good student discount?

Qualification rules and saving amounts for car insurance discounts almost always vary by state. This is because regional laws often affect what a car insurance company can offer customers in any given location.

Primarily, to qualify for the Progressive good student discount, you only need to meet three objectives. First, you have to be younger than 23. Second, you must be a full-time student. Lastly, you must maintain at least a B average.

> A few other stipulations may impact your ability to qualify for this discount.

For example, you cannot be the primary named insured, or PNI, on your policy to earn the rate reduction. You also cannot be the spouse of the PNI of the auto policy.

According to the Progressive website, you cannot earn a good student discount in specific states. As a reminder, you cannot qualify for this rate reduction if you live in Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, or West Virginia.

## Does Progressive offer other discounts for students?

Progressive is known for being one of the better insurance companies for [young driver car insurance](https://www.cheapcarinsurancequotes.com/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-17-year-olds/). Along with offering lower average rates for drivers younger than age 25, Progressive also has multiple discounts for student drivers.

The table below compares the good student discount to two other saving opportunities offered by Progressive that students and young drivers may easily qualify for.

**Progressive Car Insurance Discounts for Young Drivers**

| Discount name | Average Savings Amount | Qualification Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Good student discount | 10% | Must be 22 or younger, enrolled in school full time, and maintain a B average. |
| Distant student discount | 5-10% | Must be 22 or younger and attend a school 100 miles or more from your home with no car at school. |
| Teen driver discount | 5-10% | Must be 18 or younger. |

Compare Rates[Start Now →](#mdatop)

Understand that the rate reductions and availability vary by state. You also must be on someone else’s car insurance policy, not your own, to qualify for all three opportunities.

> Typically, you can earn multiple of these discounts to add up for more substantial savings.

A student with Progressive car insurance coverage may earn up to a 30% rate reduction by qualifying for the teen driver savings, plus the good student and distant student discounts.

However, some car insurance companies limit how much you can save per policy term through discounts. It may be worth verifying with your local Progressive agent how much you are eligible to earn in rate reductions or if your savings are capped.

## How does the Progressive good student discount compare to other companies?

Let’s compare the Progressive good student discount to discount offerings from some other [top car insurance companies](https://www.cheapcarinsurancequotes.com/best-car-insurance-companies-finding-the-best-policy-for-your-needs/).

The table below shows details for earning a good student discount from other car insurance companies. Understand that the rate reductions below represent national averages and may not be available where you live.

**Good Student Car Insurance Discounts by Company**

| Company | Good Student Discount Average Rate Reduction | Qualification Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allstate | 20% | Must be unmarried, younger than 25, have a GPA of 2.7 or above, attend school 100 miles away from your home with your vehicle in a garage, and complete the teenSMART driver education program. |
| Geico | 15% | Must be a full-time student with a B average. |
| Nationwide | 7% | Must be between the ages of 16 and 24, enrolled in school full time, and maintain a B average. |
| USAA | 7% | Must be between the ages of 16 and 25, enrolled in school full time, and maintain a 3.0-grade point average. |

Progressive’s good student discount is pretty average for the industry in terms of savings amounts. Geico, Allstate, and State Farm offer higher rate reductions for this deal. But there are more guidelines for qualifying for Allstate or State Farm’s discount.

> However, to qualify for this deal with Progressive, you must be younger than 23.

This is younger than what most other companies use as an age limit for earning good driver deals.

Overall, Progressive’s good student discount is ideal for younger high school and college students who are not the primary policyholder.

But older college students living independently from guardians or parents may consider other car insurance companies that allow you to keep the discount past age 22.

## How does age impact your car insurance rates?

Your age heavily impacts your car insurance costs no matter what company you use.

Drivers younger than the age of 25 do not have a long driving history for insurance companies to analyze. This makes it tricky to know an individual young driver’s risk factor on the roads.

Plus, if we look at young drivers as a whole, statistically, they are involved in more car accidents than most other age groups. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the [highest-risk age group are drivers between ages 16 to 19](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html).

Plus, the death rate for male drivers in that age group is twice as high as for female drivers of the same age.

For these reasons, young drivers often pay higher rates for car insurance than more mature drivers. Sources suggest that high school and college students pay $318 per month or $3,816 annually on average for coverage. Yet, the national average cost of car insurance is just $99.16 per month or $1,190 annually.

> So insurance companies often use a driver’s GPA as an indicator of responsibility.

If you maintain good grades, your car insurance company assumes this means you’re more likely to be responsible when you’re behind the wheel as well. Therefore, good student discounts and other similar deals are offered to drivers to help reduce the higher than average rates young people often pay for car insurance.

At what age does car insurance get cheaper? Typically, you see a significant rate reduction once you turn 25.

But according to the website, at Progressive, your rate drops by an average of 8% when you turn 19. Your rate drops by another 7% once you turn 21.

## Progressive Good Student Discount: The Bottom Line

Overall, the Progressive good student discount is simple to earn and may save you up to 10% on your car insurance policy. This discount is ideal for parents or guardians who have teens or college drivers on their policy.

However, it is not available in every state. Plus, you cannot be the primary policyholder or the spouse of the primary policyholder to earn this rate reduction. The age limit on this discount is also younger than average compared to other companies.

Older students, or people who purchase policies independently, may have an easier time qualifying for a good student discount from a different car insurance company.
