**Update:** As of March 2023, Esurance is no longer selling insurance policies to new customers. Instead, it's directing potential customers to its parent company, Allstate, to get quotes or buy a policy.

Esurance isn't canceling its existing policies, so current customers aren't affected by the change at this time.

When comparing Esurance and Progressive, there isn't a clear winner when it comes to price. Drivers pay less for full-coverage auto insurance from Esurance, plus those with a DUI can find great rates, too. Progressive offers cheaper minimum-coverage car insurance rates and has great quotes for young drivers.

Drivers can find a better customer service experience with Progressive, however. The company also offers more coverage options and discounts.
