However, drivers with an at-fault accident on their record should consider Progressive. The company offers [accident forgiveness #accident-forgiveness ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-esurance-vs-progressive-car-insurance#accident-forgiveness "#accident-forgiveness") and doesn't raise rates after your first at-fault accident if the payout is under $500. As a result, a full-coverage policy from Progressive costs **$552 less per year** than Esurance.

In addition, young drivers with a minor accident on their record can take advantage of [Progressive's accident forgiveness program #accident-forgiveness ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/compare-esurance-vs-progressive-car-insurance#accident-forgiveness "#accident-forgiveness"), which keeps your rate from going up if your claim payout is less than $500. That makes a minimum-coverage policy from Progressive **$849 per year** cheaper than Esurance after a single accident.
