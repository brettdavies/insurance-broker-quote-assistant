# Do you need auto insurance with a learner's permit?
New drivers always need auto insurance, including while they're learning to drive. The minimum insurance requirements in your state apply to everyone operating a vehicle, even if they only have a permit. If your teen driver has their learner's permit and plans to start driving, make sure they have auto insurance, whether you add them to your policy or they purchase their own.

## Who has to be insured when learning to drive?
When someone is learning to drive, the student and any adults who will supervise the student's driving should be insured. When choosing a driving school, make sure their drivers are also insured, as they might be held responsible [if a student driver gets in an accident](https://www.progressive.com/answers/student-driver-car-accident/).
## Adding a permit driver to a parent's insurance policy
To add a permit driver to your policy, simply call your insurer and ask for the driver to be added to your policy. Adding them to your policy allows a permit driver to be covered under your existing [car insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/auto/). Not only is [insurance for teen drivers](https://www.progressive.com/answers/teen-driver-insurance/) generally cheaper under a shared policy, but the permit holder can also benefit from the same coverages as the rest of the family. Plus, once your permit driver is added, they'll start building an insurance history, which can be beneficial when they get their own policy.
### Purchasing a separate policy
Getting separate coverage for a permit holder is typically more expensive, but in some cases, it's unavoidable. This may be necessary if:
  * The permit holder's parent or guardian doesn't have insurance
  * The permit holder is an adult
  * The permit holder lives at a different permanent address from their parent or guardian (and isn't attending school)


## How much car insurance for a learner's permit driver do you need?
Every state sets its own minimum insurance requirements, but the right amount of auto insurance for your permit driver depends on your vehicle and situation. Your [liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/liability-insurance/) should be set at limits that can cover your assets if your permit driver is responsible for another driver's injuries or property damage. Also, since new drivers are typically more prone to mishaps than experienced drivers, you may want to add [comprehensive car insurance coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) to the vehicle being used by your permit driver.
Learn more about your [state's minimum car insurance requirements](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/).
## Do you need insurance with a provisional license?
Provisional license holders need insurance like any other driver. If your teen has a provisional license, they must carry auto insurance in nearly every state.
Some states have passed [graduated driver's licensing laws](https://www.progressive.com/answers/graduated-driver-licensing-laws/) that restrict drivers under the age of 18 to a certain number of passengers or driving hours or both. [In certain states](https://www.iihs.org/topics/teenagers/graduated-licensing-laws-table/), drivers who have passed the permit phase but haven't yet received their full license are issued a provisional license.
## Can you get car insurance with a permit?
If you've only just earned your learner's permit but have already purchased a vehicle of your own, you'll be eligible to purchase your own car insurance policy just like any licensed driver.
