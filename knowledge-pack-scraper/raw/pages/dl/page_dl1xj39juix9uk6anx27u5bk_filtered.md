[**Temporary car insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/temporary-insurance/) is a short-term policy that lasts for a few days, weeks, or months — much less than standard policy lengths of six months or a year. You may need temporary auto insurance when you rent a vehicle or drive a car your standard insurance policy doesn’t cover.[[1]](#cite-1)

The average monthly cost of a standard auto insurance policy in Illinois is $149 for full coverage and $80 for liability, which is below the national average of $177 for full coverage and $100 for liability coverage. Most insurers don’t offer temporary car insurance, but Illinois drivers can consider other options.

Quick Facts

* Hugo, Metromile, and Nationwide are the best options for temporary car insurance in Illinois.
* Infrequent Illinois drivers can save money on auto insurance with pay-as-you-go and pay-per-mile policies.
* A non-owner policy or rental car insurance provides coverage when you’re operating a vehicle you don’t own.

## Best temporary car insurance in Illinois

If you’re shopping around for temporary coverage, you won’t have as many options to pick from, so it’s important to do your homework to find the lowest rates. Here are three of the best short-term car insurance companies in Illinois.

Why we picked this company

Hugo is one of the only companies offering short-term insurance coverage in 13 U.S. states, including Illinois. The company operates on a “micro-payment model,” so you can buy insurance for a few weeks or even a few days.[[2]](#cite-2) Hugo has one coverage option: an Unlimited Basic plan.

This plan meets the state of Illinois’s basic liability requirements, and you can secure coverage without any up-front fees. You can buy coverage for three-day, seven-day, 14-day, 30-day, and six-month periods.

Pros 

* No required down payment
* Provides instant proof of insurance

Cons

* Not a great option for high-mileage drivers
* Requires usage-based tracking

Why we picked this company

Metromile offers pay-per-mile insurance, making it a good option for infrequent drivers. When you sign up, you’ll pay a low monthly rate plus a set fee for every mile you drive. Metromile claims customers save 47% on average compared to what they were paying for standard auto insurance.

Unlike Hugo, Metromile offers a variety of coverage options. You can choose from comprehensive coverage, bodily injury, property damage, medical bills coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, and personal injury protection (PIP) insurance.[[3]](#cite-3)

Pros 

* Wide variety of available coverage options
* Good option for infrequent drivers

Cons

* Premium will change each month based on your driving habits
* Not a good choice for Illinois drivers who regularly drive long distances

### Nationwide: Best for safe drivers

The average quote displayed here reflects policies with the following coverage limits: $50,000 bodily injury liability per person; $100,000 bodily injury liability per accident; $50,00 property damage liability per accident; $1,000 collision deductible; and a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. | $179/mo |

Why we picked this company

Nationwide also offers pay-per-mile insurance through its Milewise program. You’ll receive the same coverage options as a traditional Nationwide policy, but your monthly rate depends on how many miles you drive.[[4]](#cite-4)

You’ll track your miles by installing a small device in your vehicle or through an eligible connected car. Only the first 250 miles you drive in a single day count toward your daily rate, so the occasional road trip won’t hike up the price too much.

Pros 

* Additional 10% discount for demonstrating good driving habits
* Only the first 250 miles driven in a day count toward your rate

Cons

* Not all vehicle types are eligible
* May be more expensive than Hugo or Metromile

## Options for temporary car insurance

You have multiple options to choose from when it comes to temporary car insurance. Here’s what you should know about the different types of temporary insurance and what type of driver each coverage option works best for.

### Pay-as-you-go car insurance: Best for infrequent drivers

[**Pay-as-you-go insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/pay-as-you-go/) — sometimes referred to as usage-based insurance — has grown in popularity in recent years as people spend less time driving due to remote work.

When you sign up, the company assigns you a low base rate and an additional charge for every mile you drive. Low-mileage drivers can save money with pay-as-you-go insurance, but poor driving habits could drive up your monthly rate.

### Non-owner car insurance: Best for borrowing a vehicle

[**Non-owner car insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/non-owners/) provides coverage if you regularly operate a vehicle you don’t own. For example, you might benefit from this insurance if you’re a college student who plans to borrow a friend or family member’s car for an extended period of time.

Progressive, State Farm, and GEICO all offer non-owner car insurance policies. Since these policies only provide coverage in specific scenarios, they tend to be more affordable than standard auto insurance.

### Pay-per-mile car insurance: Best for low-mileage drivers

The cost of [**pay-per-mile insurance**](/car-insurance/coverage/pay-per-mile/) depends on how many miles you drive, rather than your daily driving habits. It can be a great way to save money on auto insurance if you work from home or rely on public transportation and spend little time driving. Metromile, Nationwide, and Allstate all offer pay-per-mile car insurance.

This type of car insurance can lower your premiums significantly and provide more personalized coverage. But you’ll likely have to use a telematics app to track your mileage, and your rate will vary from month to month.

### Rental car insurance: Best for frequent travelers

[**Rental car coverage**](/car-insurance/vehicle/rental-car-insurance/) is helpful for anyone who regularly travels for work. If you don’t already have car insurance, rental insurance will cover you when you need to use a rental car. It’s also a good idea if you plan to travel internationally since your auto insurance won’t cover you while you’re outside the U.S.

You can purchase this insurance through a rental company or your insurance company. Call your insurance agent with any questions.

## Pros and cons of temporary car insurance

Pros 

* Flexibility of purchasing coverage for a few days, weeks, or months
* No long-term commitments make it easy to cancel your policy
* Works well for people in unique situations, like students who only borrow a car from family members on occasion or someone who’s visiting internationally

Cons

* Limited available options, as most insurance companies don’t offer it
* Will likely cost more in the long run, especially if you drive frequently
* You’re at risk for lapsed coverage if you forget to renew your insurance, which could lead to fines or penalties

## Temporary car insurance in Illinois FAQs

The following general information can help answer your questions about how temporary car insurance works and how to find the best policy for your needs.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

We selected the best temporary car insurance companies based on pricing, flexibility, the number of favorable reviews, and how easy each policy was to sign up for. Each of the companies listed is a good option for infrequent drivers who don’t want to commit to a long-term policy.

A standard auto insurance policy in Illinois lasts from six months to one year. If you need a policy that lasts less than six months, you can consider temporary insurance from a reputable company like Hugo.

No. Per Illinois law, all drivers must meet the minimum liability requirements before driving a car, even if they’ve just purchased it. If law enforcement catches you driving without insurance, you’ll receive a minimum $500 fine.[[5]](#cite-5)

The shortest term offered by most major car insurance companies is six months. But Hugo offers plans lasting as little as three days.

Auto-Owners is the cheapest car insurance company in Illinois, with an average monthly rate of $48 for liability coverage and $80 for full coverage.
