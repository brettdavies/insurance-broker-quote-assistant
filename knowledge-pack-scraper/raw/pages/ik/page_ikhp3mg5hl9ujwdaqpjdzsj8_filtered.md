In most states, Progressive automatically offers small accident forgiveness for car insurance claims with a total of less than $500. But that only applies to your first claim, with the option to upgrade to large accident forgiveness later.

You can also buy an additional [Progressive](/reviews/car-insurance/progressive/) accident forgiveness add-on that allows you to have another qualifying accident forgiven in the same policy period.

[Accident forgiveness](/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness/) helps you avoid a post-accident surcharge to your car insurance rate that would apply to certain accidents, like if you are found at fault and the accident resulted in property damage or injuries. According to Progressive countrywide data, one [at-fault accident](/car-insurance/at-fault-accident/) can raise your rates by up to 28% on average.

## Progressive small accident forgiveness

**How to get it:** Free as part of Loyalty Rewards.

Small accident forgiveness protects your rate from rising if you have a claim of $500 or less. As of June 2025, small accident forgiveness can be automatically included with your policy as soon as it starts in most states — for free.

## Progressive large accident forgiveness

**How to get it:** Loyalty Rewards benefit, when qualified.

Large accident forgiveness is available for claims beyond $500, if you fulfill certain criteria.

* No accidents or violations for up to five consecutive years.
* Progressive customer for at least five years.
* Live in a qualifying state.

If you qualify, you also won’t be surcharged for an accident with a claim larger than $500.

**How to get it:** Optional, available for new policies and renewals.

Available in some states, you can choose to add this protection when you start or renew your policy through their Loyalty Rewards program.

If you go this route, you can still utilize small or large accident forgiveness. This means you could be forgiven for more than one accident within a single policy period.

Your Loyalty Rewards accident forgiveness will apply first, and if you need to use your upgraded accident forgiveness protection, you can use it on the next eligible claim.

## How to get accident forgiveness from Progressive

You have several options whether you’re a customer or not:

* Call Progressive at 866-749-7436.
* Get a [car insurance quote](/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) online and see if accident forgiveness can be automatically added.
* Existing customers can log in to see if accident forgiveness is available and included in their policy.
