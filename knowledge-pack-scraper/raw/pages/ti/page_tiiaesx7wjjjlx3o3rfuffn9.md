I would give this place a zero if possible- stay away from this company, they are completely crooks. We had a driver they insure that used his truck to hit our school car with tons of stickers on a white car that says student t driver. Smeared the side of our student that was in a lane on the highway, wasn’t paying attention and smashed the car on the driver side that proves he hit us while changing lanes. He even admitted to our driver and instructor that he was not paying attention and clearly hit us. This rip off insurance company tried to say it was both people fault because they merged, how do you merge in the same lane you are already in. This is the 3rd time they have negligent drivers that hit our cars and the insurance company comes up with a bogus excuse to not pay. We had one of their drivers t-bone our car in the side, when he was drunk and ran a red light. That was a brand new car and we had for 3 days and they paid us half- so we had to eat the car payment and buy a new car with half the money. Stay away from them before they screw you. Amazing how a company this big and does commercials of if you don’t have their insurance it could cost you. Yes because they take your money and don’t pay anything for their insured people to smash other people’s vehicles.

I tried to add a new vehicle online and it said to call.  
  
I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with a rep who gave me a quote but was having trouble inputing the VIN so without telling me transferred to someone else...where I had to start all over again.  
  
I took a deep breath and gave the person my zip code. She wasnt licensed in FL so she hung up on me.  
  
I called back and am one hour into my experience and on my 3rd rep who now has me on hold.  
  
I will look elsewhere for insurance as this experience has me concerned that this is how future experiences will go.

DO NOT INSURE WITH THIS COMPANY!!!   
UPDATE: Sept 7. Still no check, according to Progressive, the letter had problems at customs & so was returned to them!! When I pointed out that according to the tracking # it had never left their building. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!! Now, they say they're going to mail it again without a tracking #..gee, I wonder why no tracking #.We cancelled our house insurance in Mar. because we sold our house. We are supposed to get a refund check of a little over $100 dollars. Now, it is mid-Aug & we have yet to get our refund. They continue to say they have sent the check but the reason we haven't gotten it...according to them...#1, they sent it to the wrong address....#2 It got lost in the mail ....#3...lost in the mail again...#4 the check was issued on July 11...apparently lost in the mail again...#5 check issued on Aug. 18 & is being mailed via USPS with a tracking #....I just checked today, Aug 23 & here is what I got Label Created, not yet in system  
A status update is not yet available on your package. It will be available when the shipper provides an update or the package is given to USPS. Check back soon. When I contacted them & asked to speak to either the account dept or the mailroom (I think if there were any checks sent, they are still in the mailroom). I was told they have no way to contact the account dept or the mailroom. I cannot emphasize enough....DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY because just think if they are this shifty over a little over $100, what are they like when someone has a claim for a car accident or a house problem.

## [Worst Insurance Company](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/689c95a26d5c2d0a1a17a541)
This is by far the worst insurance company I’ve ever dealt with. They don’t work for you — they work for the other party filing a claim against you. When I filed a claim, it was bounced between FOUR different adjusters without anyone bothering to tell me. I’d contact my “assigned” adjuster only to be completely ignored, and after chasing them down with multiple calls, I’d find out my case had been handed off to someone else — in a different state. Two weeks later, it happened again with yet another adjuster in yet another state.  
  
Meanwhile, Progressive was charging me an outrageous $1,008 a month for a claim against me. I’ve since switched to GEICO and now pay $482 a month for the exact same coverage.  
  
Do yourself a favor — don’t get ripped off by Progressive and their smiling mascot Flo. Spend your money wisely and choose literally any other insurance company.

Worst claim experience ever! Stay away is all I can say. They are nothing but snakes from top to bottom of management. The rumors are true and I should have listened. They say they live by the golden rule.......not sure their definition but not mine. There is a distinct culture problem with this company. If there is a "0" star I would have given it.

I participated in the snapshot program and earned a $200 discount. When I got my renewal it was actually $200 increase from last year. When I asked about this they said that I did get the discount but they just also raised my rate by $200. This is a scam this company is corrupt I suggest looking elsewhere.

## [Glacial claims service and rude agents](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/686b08b5eae8a4611f7fc914)
06/21/25, I filed an auto claim with Progressive after a tornado dropped a building on my car. The soonest they told me they could get an adjuster out to look at the car was the 11th of July. Three weeks. My boyfriend's insurance had agents out within a week, and he had damage payments a couple days after that. His company is a smaller regional company with less resources than a nation-wide company like Progressive. I called to see if there was any way to expedite the process, and they very generously moved the date to the 9th. I had very good luck with all the claims people I interacted with. They were polite and sympathetic. However when I talked to a "licensed agent" about my policy, she got nasty with me. Glacial claims service and rude agents are not what I pay for. Progressive expects us to pay our premiums in a timely manner, but when it comes time to reciprocate, it takes almost three weeks to even get someone out to start the recovery/repair process? Unacceptable. I have been without a car since the incident, in addition to the stress and heartbreak of having my home destroyed by a tornado. I see absolutely no reason why it is taking so long to get the process started.

## [What does a "Diamond" customer mean to Progressive](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/68656b88cfcdded27abf87c1)
I have bundled my auto, home, and umbrella policies with Progressive. I've been with Progressive for over 5 years and have received a "Diamond" rating. My auto policy renews every six months, and I have a credit card on file for auto-renewal. This month, Progressive was unable to process a payment because the credit card on file was replaced by a new one due to fraudulent activities. Shawn, the representative, mentioned that the system generated an email to notify me that the card was declined. I did not receive that email, but I did receive an email today that my policy had lapsed. I logged on today and made a payment. When I made the payment, I noticed that Progressive added an additional $30 surcharge for a six-month auto policy with a one-day lapse in coverage. Shawn told me the reason for this increase is due to the lower rating that the system generated because of the one-day lapse in payment. Even though I mentioned that I did not receive a notification that my card was declined, he would do nothing to remedy the situation. Lower ratings usually mean higher premiums. So much for being a loyal Progressive customer and trusting them with my auto, home, and umbrella policies.

## [watch out on price creep](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/685d6f10395a311751700b82)
The initial response was good and premium look competitive, however, once I accepted the rate and try to purchase the premium creep up and up even after I purchased the policy they still try to nickle and dime to charge additional cost. My initial quote was $702, without any change the final price was 870. After I purchase the insurance, they send in premium adjustment and now it is $920. It is like I got lock in and I have no way to go back but to keep paying because canceling has a heavy cancellation cost.

I've sold the vehicle that I had insured through progressive and yet they're holding me hostage and won't let me cancel my insurance. I've sent several emails the way I was told to do with name, address, dob, policy #, and cancelation reason and date yet here we are. You are still taking money from me when new owner has had this vehicle insured for months. I would never recommend you guys to my enemies!

## [Caveat Emptor. Buyer beware. Don’t do business with this company.](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6852b3a5e549feb322b8b2e1)
My granddaughter was T-Boned as she was going down a one-way street. A vehicle hit the passenger side of her car as it entered the street from an intersection. The airbags in her car were deployed and she suffered a concussion. Progressive said she was more than 50% at fault and wanted the insurance commissioner to surcharge her for that reason. She appealed the decision and a hearing took place. Progressive had no viable response to her assertion that she was at at fault at all. They definitely acted in bad faith. ￼

THIS COMPANY IS ALL ABOUT ROBBING PEOPLE WITH POLICIES AND THEN RUIN THEIR CREDIT SCORE IF THEY DO NOT COMPLY. EASY TO SEE HOW CORRUPT THE SEC IS FOR LETTING THIS COMPANY OPERATE! I closed a bank account, I attempted to cancel the policy by phone but got disconnected. I am a very busy person and did not make any additional attempts. I got a letter in the mail from Progressive stating I now owe 7 TIMES MORE than what my normal monthly balance was at the time after they already automatically canceled the policy. Progressive became really aggressive with price gouging when they realized another customer was lost and then threatened to ruin my credit if I did not pay on what should be considered a fraudulent request. I called Progressive again after receiving a statement in the mail, and offered to make 1 final payment of the standard monthly balance if all remaining price gouging balance was removed and do not turn me into a credit agency. This greedy company would have not part of that, said have a good day and hung up.

## [Don’t do worst company ever, they will not protect you ](https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6842684335c3924494448116)
This company will rip you off. I was in an accident last year. Guy ran a stop sign and it was high impact. I suffered a traumatic brain injury ( will have life long cognitive issues) injury to both sciatic joints which I’m now on my second round of cortisone injections so I can walk normal without pain. They sighted it as a no fault accident because there was no camera that caught the accident. Then they told they would reimburse me for pay car insurance up until the date I signed the car over to them. I never saw a dime let alone a call, then I find out the car I bought was being charged $25 a month extra insurance because I sent their smart driver device back. 7 month of not knowing this. I only found out because I traded that car in for a different one to get cheaper insurance. I was quoted $175 a month which I was paying $255 a month. Next bill come and it’s 212 a month. Wow wait a second what happened to the quote I was promised. So then I’m they will see what the can do to get my payment lower. I call back okay it’s down to $185 a month but they want $350 on top of the 212 I payed and that was only good for that day. WTH. So next insurance bill $265 a month. So I call and ask why is it so much more, first $175, then $212, now $265. There reason oh your raised taxes. Funny how everyone I know including patients in my medical profession non of their insurance went up. So they said they would cancel my policy. I know owe them over $500 because they didn’t cancel the policy when they said the would. FYI I still haven’t heard back about getting refund for paying for a device I sent back or the month and half of car insurance I paid on my Jeep. And I’m stuck being cognitively impaired for the rest my life because they didn’t want to go after the person that hit my Jeep (insurance company stated that he wad at fault per the damage done).  
Thanks Progressive

If you want to turn your life into a living hell, sign up for Progressive. I was at a full stop, and rear-ended by an oversize tow truck. Obviously 100% not my fault. They did *almost nothing* to help me with this situation, and in fact NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO THE OTHER DRIVER'S INSURANCE COMPANY. Abysmal customer service
