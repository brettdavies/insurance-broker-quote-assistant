**USAA and Progressive** have the lowest auto insurance cost for drivers filing an SR-22, according to our analysis. Full coverage car insurance with a DUI and an SR-22 costs an average of $2,776 per year with USAA and $2,894 per year with Progressive.
An SR-22 is a form filed by an insurer with the state verifying you have auto insurance in place—it’s not a type of [car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/). However, the term “SR-22 insurance” is commonly used to describe that process.
The high cost of SR-22 insurance is based mainly on the rate increase for the infraction, such as a DUI. It could tack on a few hundred dollars or more, depending on the company and state. That makes comparison shopping a must when searching for cheap SR-22 insurance.

Our Expert Take
We’re impressed that USAA has the lowest SR-22 insurance rates among the companies we analyzed. You must be a military member, veteran or military family member to be eligible for USAA auto insurance.

Pros & Cons
* Cheapest auto insurance for drivers with a DUI who need an SR-22.
* Offers very good rates for drivers with a speeding ticket, accident or DUI on their records.
* Offers non-owner car insurance.
* Only offers auto insurance to veterans, active military members and their immediate families.
* USAA’s complaint level is just under the industry average. Many of its competitors have a lower level of complaints.

Our Expert Take
Progressive stood out in our evaluation because it has the second-lowest rates for SR-22 insurance. We also liked that Progressive is available nationwide. That means if you live in one state and need an SR-22 filed in another, Progressive can help you out.
**More:**[Progressive Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-car-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
* Has the cheapest cost for SR-22 insurance for drivers who don’t qualify for USAA with a military connection.
* Good car insurance rates for drivers with a DUI conviction.
* Offers non-owner insurance.
* Only so-so auto insurance rates for drivers with speeding tickets, who have caused an accident, had a lapse in insurance coverage or have bad credit.
States Available In

In some instances USAA was the cheapest, but we have listed the next-cheapest company because USAA auto insurance is only available to veterans, military members and their families.

You can live in a state without an SR-22 requirement but still need to file an SR-22 in a different state. This may happen if:
* You move to a state without an SR-22 requirement but you have an SR-22 still required in your previous state.
* You are convicted of an infraction, such as a DUI, in a state with an SR-22 requirement but live in a state without one.
In these cases, you must find SR-22 insurance with an auto insurer that operates in both states. This way the insurer can sell you a policy in your current state and file the SR-22 in the other state. It may be easier for nationwide insurance companies, such as Progressive, State Farm and USAA, to help you in this situation.

#### Shop Around
The issue that caused you to need an SR-22 is the primary reason your rates will be higher, such as a DUI. I find the best way to combat high rates is to [compare car insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/) with at least three insurance companies. That gives you more chances to find an insurer with cheap SR-22 insurance rates.

#### Seek Out Discounts
The final cost you pay is important, so look for [car insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/discounts/). Many are easily attainable, such as discounts for paying in full, going paperless or getting a quote in advance of starting a new policy.

#### Consider Limiting Your Coverage
Higher liability limits are generally smart, so you’re less likely to exhaust your insurance if you cause an accident. But I’ve found that if you need cheap SR-22 insurance, you might consider buying only the state minimum limits required for your SR-22.
If you lease a car this may not be possible, as leasing companies typically mandate higher limits on an auto policy.

#### Buy a Non-Owner Policy
If you don’t own a vehicle but need SR-22 insurance, it’s wise to seek a [non-owner car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/non-owner/) policy. This policy fulfills the SR-22 mandate of having liability insurance when you don’t own a car. Because you don’t have a specific vehicle insured under a [non-owner policy](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/non-owner/), it can be cheaper than a standard policy.

## How To Get an SR-22
Make certain to take the proper steps to ensure you get the required SR-22 by the deadline given to you by the state or court. If you miss the deadline, you can face penalties, such as a license suspension.
### Find a Car Insurance Company Offering SR-22 Insurance
See if your current auto insurer offers SR-22 insurance. If so, inform it of your situation. If the insurer doesn’t provide SR-22 filing services, quickly shop around and switch [car insurance companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/how-to-switch-car-insurance/) to one that does.
If you must look for a new company, make sure you’re upfront that you need an SR-22. Switching to a company that won’t file the SR-22 is no help. When filling out online quote forms, look for a section that asks if you need an SR-22 filed. If the form doesn’t include this question, speak with an agent or keep shopping around with other insurers.
### Pay the SR-22 Filing Fee
An SR-22 filing fee is typically $25. Most car insurance companies will pass this fee onto you, but some insurers, such as Dairyland, don’t charge you the filing fee.
### Your Car Insurance Company Files the SR-22
Generally your car insurance company files the SR-22 certificate of financial responsibility electronically with the DMV or other entity requiring it. The form has to be mailed in some states, but your car insurance company is still responsible for sending it in.
### Get Confirmation
Confirm with your car insurance company that it sent in your SR-22 filing and follow up with the entity that required the SR-22 to ensure it was received. Electronic filings are typically received quickly but mailed filings may take up to 30 days to process.
For instance, the Illinois Secretary of State’s office notes that it can take up to 30 days to process an SR-22. Once that is done, you should receive a copy of the SR-22 from your car insurance company and a letter from the secretary of state’s office confirming receipt of your SR-22.
## Proof of Car Insurance Besides the SR-22
Depending on your state, you may encounter forms similar to an SR-22.
### SR-21 Insurance
An SR-21 is a form used in some states after an accident as a one-time verification that you had car insurance at the time of the incident. States such as [Hawaii](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state/cheapest-car-insurance-in-hawaii/), New Jersey and Wyoming use the SR-21 form and, like the SR-22, your car insurance company needs to fill out the insurance information.
Similarly, an SR-1 in [California](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) used to report auto accidents that result in property damage over $1,000, injuries or death and to verify you have car insurance.
[Arkansas](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state/best-cheap-car-insurance-arkansas/) combines the two numbers for its SR-1-21 form. It’s both an SR-1 auto accident report and SR-21 verification of car insurance (to be filled out by your auto insurer).
### SR-22A Insurance
The SR-22A is a form used to verify car insurance in Georgia, Missouri and [Texas](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state/best-cheap-car-insurance-texas/). An SR-22A certifies that you have prepaid in full for six months of coverage.
The reasons for requiring an SR-22A vary by state. The main reasons are being in an auto accident without having car insurance or having multiple driving convictions without insurance.
### FR-44 Insurance
The FR-44 is similar to the SR-22 but requires much higher car insurance limits. SR-22s require you to carry state-minimum car insurance. Two states, Florida and Virginia, require the FR-44, typically after a DUI conviction.
Those required to have an FR-44 in Florida must buy [liability car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/liability-insurance/) limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident for bodily injury liability and $50,000 for property damage (known as 100/300/50 coverage). In Virginia, drivers must carry double the state minimum limits.
### SR-50 Insurance
SR-50 is a form used in Indiana to show proof of current car insurance coverage. The SR-50 form is similar to the SR-22 but it just shows your existing policy’s start and end dates. According to the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, this form is used to reinstate your driver’s license after a suspension for being uninsured but it stopped being used in 2013.
## Methodology
To find the cheapest SR-22 car insurance, we analyzed car insurance rates based on a 30-year-old driver with a DUI conviction and an SR-22 who is insuring a new Toyota RAV4.
**Auto insurance rates (100% of score):** We used data from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/) for coverage of:
* $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
* Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
* Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.
* Any other coverage required in states.

##  Cheap SR-22 Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### How long do you need to carry an SR-22?
How long you need to carry an SR-22 varies by state, but three years is a common time requirement. It may also depend upon the offense and could be extended if you drop coverage at any point or commit another serious offense, such as getting a second DUI.
For example, in [Idaho](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/state/best-cheap-car-insurance-idaho/) you must have an SR-22 for one year after a first offense for driving without insurance, but need it for three years for each subsequent offense.
### How do I find out when my SR-22 expires?
Your paperwork from the state or court should tell how long you have to keep the SR-22, but if you can’t find it, contact the entity mandating it to find out the exact length of time. Don’t cancel your car insurance or ask your car insurance company to remove the [SR-22 insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/what-is-sr-22-insurance/) until you’re positive your time is up. Otherwise, you could face penalties, such as license suspension.
### What states don’t require an SR-22?
Not all states mandate an SR-22 after a DUI or other serious traffic offense. The following 12 states do not use the SR-22 form:
1. Delaware
2. Kentucky
3. Maryland
4. Minnesota
5. New Jersey
6. New Mexico
7. New York
8. North Carolina
9. Oklahoma
10. Pennsylvania
11. Rhode Island
12. West Virginia
