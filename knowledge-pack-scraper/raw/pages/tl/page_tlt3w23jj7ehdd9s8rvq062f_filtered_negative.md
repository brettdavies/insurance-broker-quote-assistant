There's a difference of $735 per month between the cheapest company for full coverage, Erie, and the most expensive, Farmers. That's why you should always [compare insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") to find the best rates for you.
**On average, 18-year-old drivers pay 13% less for car insurance than 17-year-olds.** At 18 years old, you have more driving experience than newly licensed 16- and 17-year-olds. [Your rates reflect that](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs").
[New drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-new-drivers "The Best Car Insurance for New Drivers") are an exception to this rule. If you're a new driver at 18 years old, you'll likely pay more than a driver who got their license at age 16 and has two years of driving experience.

*USAA is only available to current and former military members and their families.
Men ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be involved in a fatal car crash as women in that age group. That makes male teens a much higher risk to insurance companies.

**However, you should[share a policy with your parents](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers#parent "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens") if possible.** It's usually much cheaper than having your own separate policy.
Parents typically see their rates go up when they add a teen driver to their policy. They can help offset the increased cost by asking for [discounts aimed at teens](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts"). For example, you could get a good student discount if your teen has a minimum 3.0 GPA.
* * *
**Besides staying on your parents' policy, the best way to get cheap auto insurance quotes is to shop around.** Prices can differ by thousands of dollars per year depending on the company. So it's helpful to compare [car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Free Auto Insurance Quotes") from multiple insurance companies.
**Look for discounts.** Insurance companies offer many [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#status "Car Insurance Discounts") to help you save money.
**High school or college students can get a[good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "How a Good Student Discount Can Save You on Car Insurance") on car insurance if they have good grades.** Insurance companies usually give a discount if you have a B average or 3.0 GPA, or better.
**College students who leave their cars at their parents' home during the academic year can often get an away-from-home student discount.** This discount is typically available if you attend a university more than 100 miles away from home. You may also qualify for a [low-mileage discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#driver "Car Insurance Discounts").
If you don't live with your parents, you can save on your auto insurance policy by bundling it with your [renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or [homeowners](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle") insurance.

* * *
**Increase your deductible.** Another way to lower your insurance rate is to [choose a higher deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?"). However, this means you'll pay more after an accident. So it's important to choose a deductible you can easily afford in an emergency.
* * *
[Usage-based auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance") lets you earn big discounts if you practice safe driving habits, like staying under the speed limit. Some programs will raise your rates if you have bad driving habits, though.
* * *
**Lower your coverage limits.** It's a good idea for 18-year-old drivers to buy a [full coverage policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?"). Young drivers are more likely to get into an accident, and full coverage insurance helps pay for damage to your own car.

An 18-year-old can expect to pay an average of $530 per month for full coverage car insurance. Minimum coverage costs around $223 per month. However, rates vary significantly based on where you live and [the insurance company you choose #company ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/18-year-old-car-insurance#company "#company").
Yes, 18-year-olds can get car insurance policies on their own. However, you could pay much less if you [share a policy with your parents](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens \(and Their Parents\)").
An 18-year-old driver can expect to pay around [13% less for car insurance than a 17-year-old #age ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/18-year-old-car-insurance#age "#age"). Rates are usually cheaper for 18-year-olds because they have more experience behind the wheel than younger drivers. However, a newly licensed 18-year-old will pay more for car insurance than someone who has been driving since they turned 16.
Yes, it is cheaper for teen drivers to share car insurance with their parents. On average, 18-year-old drivers can save [62% per month on full coverage insurance by having a joint family policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Cheap Car Insurance for Teens and Young Drivers").
However, the [cheapest company for you may be different depending on where you live #state ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/18-year-old-car-insurance#state "#state").
