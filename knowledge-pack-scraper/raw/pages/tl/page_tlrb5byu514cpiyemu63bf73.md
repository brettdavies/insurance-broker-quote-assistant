[GEICO Auto Insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/geico-insurance-review) is known for its affordability. This online bargain insurance provider lets interested buyers run quotes on its website in minutes. In addition, the site automates discounts based on the answers it receives, along with numerous perks for seniors, making it even more competitive. Because of its size and other factors, GEICO is also more flexible for imperfect drivers and multi-generation households.
One of the popular programs for seniors is GEICO's Prime Time program. It offers drivers over 50 guaranteed renewals if they've not had any moving violations or car accidents in the previous three-year period. Unfortunately, it's not available in all states, but it provides drivers peace of mind when it's available.
GEICO also offers defensive driving discounts and lower rates for seniors with five years accident-free, former government workers, and military members and veterans. Seniors may also qualify for its multi-car discount. Senior-specific discounts are available to policyholders 50 or older.
Another way to save with GEICO is through its Accident Forgiveness program, which means your rate won't increase after a first-time at-fault accident. Of course, accidents and tickets are not the only factors determining your annual rates. Unfortunately, large incidents, supply chain issues, etc., can cause premium hikes nationwide. If you're participating in its Accident Forgiveness Program and see your premiums increase, GEICO's customer service agents are available via phone, email, and online chat.

If you're retired or have reduced working hours, your budget matters more than ever. To lower costs, you want a competitive annual premium to help you pay less while staying protected. [Nationwide Auto Insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/nationwide-car-insurance-review) provides affordable coverage for seniors.
On top of the company's traditional auto insurance, which includes collision, coverage, and liability. Nationwide also has a signature pay-per-mile insurance offering called SmartMiles® in most states. However, it is unavailable in Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Carolina, or New York.
This option can lower costs if you no longer commute to work or rarely drive. Instead of paying a set price, your premium is based on base and per-mile rates. Its website provides an example with a base of $60 and a per-mile rate of $0.07. This flexible approach offers many seniors a happy medium with their current driving profile.
If you're worried about driving too much, after 250 miles per day, you won't be charged anything extra. You may also qualify for a 10% safe driving discount on your renewal. For drivers 55 and up, Nationwide also offers a defensive driving discount.

[The Hartford Car Insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/the-hartford-insurance-review) is only available to AARP members. It provides the essential coverage senior drivers need with unique coverage options and benefits to customize coverage. A few coverage options include:
  * **New car replacement coverage** : The value of your car drops as soon as you drive it off the lot when you're buying new. If you total your car in your first year of ownership, The Hartford gives policyholders the funds to replace their old car with a new one of a similar make and model.
  * **RecoverCare** : This specialty care offers extra TLC for seniors recovering after a car accident. It pays for everyday living expenses, such as additional transportation costs, food preparation, dog walking, and lawn mowing.
  * **Lifetime car repair assurance** : It connects you with a service provider to repair your vehicle after a qualified claim. If you use an approved repair shop, The Hartford will pay to fix any future related issues if something goes wrong. This protection applies as long as you own the car.
  * **24/7 claims hotline available** : Whenever you need help, The Hartford offers support 24/7.


As you might expect, The Hartford offers accident forgiveness if you're accident-free for five years. Your first accident after this won't count against you or raise your rates. Policyholders also enjoy an optional disappearing deductible. If you choose this additional coverage, your collision deductible will drop each year you maintain a spot-free driving record.
Policyholders enjoy 10% off for being an AARP member, bundling discounts of up to 5%, and many other discounts. Ultimately, these discounts can make full coverage accessible to seniors on a tight budget. If you're interested in this company, review its website for state-specific information to verify coverage is offered in your state.

Many seniors move to a lower-cost area or to be closer to family after retirement. While this has clear benefits, it can also translate into unknown risks and different insurance needs. The last thing you need is the added complication of switching auto insurers because your current company is not licensed in the state you're moving to.
State Farm auto insurance is available in all 50 states and Washington, DC. Its standard coverage includes liability, comprehensive, collision, emergency road service coverage, car rental, and travel expenses coverage. If you're a car collector with sports or antique cars, you can also get those covered through State Farm.
If you bundle insurance policies with [State Farm Auto Insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/state-farm-auto-insurance-review), you could save up to $1,127 on your auto and home insurance coverage, according to the company website. It offers additional discounts for taking a defensive driving course, being accident-free, and having no moving violations or incidents within three years.

Most car insurance companies offer standard liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage with rental car coverage, medical payments, and limited roadside service. But if you want optional coverage providing even more, Farmers Auto Insurance can customize your plan to help you find a solution for your unique needs.
The company offers a long list of optional coverages to enhance customer satisfaction. The important part is if it doesn't fit your budget or doesn't seem applicable to your needs, Farmers' base insurance coverage protects you from the big stuff. A few riders available include:
  * **Loss of use** : Even with rental car coverage, you may need other transportation assistance while your car is in the shop. This is particularly common after a severe accident (involving injuries). Its loss of use coverage offers the flexibility to cover your unique transportation needs after a claim.
  * **Guaranteed Value™** : It offers a flat sum if your car is totaled. This coverage is used for collector cars, restoration projects, and other cars with greater value than traditional appraisal methods might conclude.
  * **Customized equipment** : A traditional insurance policy covers your car as originally built. If you customize your vehicle for style or to make it more accessible for someone with mobility issues, standard insurance may not cover it. The customized equipment rider with Farmers ensures you're compensated for your chosen vehicle upgrades.
  * **Personal umbrella** : It can elevate your liability coverage limits and help against potential lawsuits. Many people buy the minimum liability coverage to meet state requirements, mistakenly thinking extra coverage would cost too much. Increased liability coverage is often affordable. But suppose you have a home, auto, and other policies. In that case, an umbrella policy can be bundled in to raise coverage where needed instead of paying for higher liability limits on home, auto, and any other policies you have on an individual basis.
  * **Glass deductible buyback** : This unique Farmers insurance rider provides glass repair with a $100 deductible. Alternatively, its full windshield and glass coverage offers glass repair or replacement with no deductible.
  * **Spare parts coverage** : Many car owners don't need spare parts coverage. If you're rebuilding a car, like to tinker, etc., Farmers offers up to $750 to replace any spare parts you have. This is most commonly purchased for collector cars and classic cars.
  * **Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)** : OEM coverage is available for cars up to ten years old. If you're in a covered accident, it will kick in to pay the extra cost of original manufacturer parts. Particularly with newer cars, the idea is OEM parts are more compatible with your vehicle and will perform more efficiently.
  * **New car replacement coverage** : Unfortunately, not all new cars last as long as we want. When you leave the dealer lot, new cars drop in value, but you can get in an accident anytime. This rider offers enough coverage to replace your brand-new car if it's totaled within the first two years of ownership up to 24,000 miles.
  * **Accident forgiveness** : This perk is offered to accident-free drivers, and it kicks in to cover one accident every three years. If you file a claim under accident forgiveness, your rates will not increase with Farmers.


Given the range and volume of optional coverage, you can tailor your policy to your needs and be protected in many ways. If you're interested in buying a Farmers auto, home, or other policy, we recommend working with a Farmers insurance agent.
