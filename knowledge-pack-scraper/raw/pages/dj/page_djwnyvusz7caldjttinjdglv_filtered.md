## California home risks

Although its sandy beaches and ancient Redwood and Sequoia forests make it an ideal place for homeowners looking to settle down, [California](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/california-home-insurance/) is not without its dangers. As of September 2022, California has experienced 6456 wildfire incidents that have burned 364,883 acres of land.[[1]](#footnote-1) If you live in the Sunshine State, it's important to consider investing in a good homeowners insurance policy that will provide reparations in the event of a catastrophe. But what if you're having trouble because you're in a high-risk area? This is where the California FAIR Plan policy comes into play.

## What is the California FAIR Plan policy?

The California FAIR Plan was created in 1968 to ensure that all homeowners can obtain basic home insurance coverage, regardless of their risk level.[[2]](#footnote-2) It is an insurance association that offers coverage to [high-risk homeowners](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/fair-plan-high-risk-insurance/) and renters who are unable to secure coverage through a traditional insurer.

Through the California FAIR Plan, all licensed insurance companies in the state are required to participate. The FAIR plan issues policies on behalf of these companies, which share in both profits and losses commensurate with their overall market share. As homes in wildfire-prone areas are too high-risk to insure on the private market, the California FAIR Plan eases the coverage debacle for homeowners.

## What is covered under the California FAIR Plan policy?

California's FAIR Plan offers **basic coverage** with its standard policy since it is meant to be **a temporary safety net**, **a last-resort option** in case you fail to find protection elsewhere. If you desire additional coverages that are available in standard homeowners insurance policies, you’ll have to purchase add-ons or separate policies at an additional charge.

Fair Plan policies are capped at $3 million for all coverages.[[3]](#footnote-3) You also cannot insure your property for more than the cost of rebuilding.

## How to apply for a California FAIR Plan Policy?

Applying for the California FAIR Plan policy is fairly easy. But it is not similar to getting a traditional home insurance policy. Here’s how you do it:

#### **1. Search for a credible provider**

While the California FAIR plan can be purchased directly from the FAIR plan’s website, you can also apply for it through a registered and licensed broker in the state. It is to be noted that brokers DO NOT collect a fee when selling FAIR plan insurance policies as they do with standard home policies.

#### **2. Determine your eligibility**

Simply owning a home in California will not make you eligible for the FAIR plan policy. Your broker will conduct a thorough examination of data before qualifying you for the FAIR plan policy. They want to make sure you don't qualify for traditional coverage before proceeding with the FAIR Plan application.

#### **3. Fill in the application form**

In case you are working with a broker, they will help you fill in the application form by guiding you in choosing a suitable amount of coverage and endorsements as well as calculating a fair market value of your home. Once the application is completed, you will receive an instant quote rate. You need to note that if you apply for a FAIR plan without a broker, you will not be able to get an immediate price estimate.

#### **4. Schedule a home inspection**

A home inspection may be scheduled by a representative from the FAIR Plan to better understand your home’s insurability. For instance, if your home is located in an area highly susceptible to wildfires, then it may impact the amount of coverage you may receive.

#### **5. Pay the first month’s premium**

After your application has been approved, pay your first premium and you're covered!
