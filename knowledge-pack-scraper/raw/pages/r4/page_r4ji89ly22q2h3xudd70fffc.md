Insurance premiums are a major monthly expense, but many providers offer discounts if you get more than one policy from them, a strategy known as [bundling](https://www.cnbc.com/select/should-i-bundle-home-and-auto-insurance/).

##  How to bundle home and auto insurance
Bundling insurance policies isn’t complicated, but it’s important to avoid penalties or a lapse in coverage. 
**Decide on the coverage you need:** Research home and auto insurance companies with bundling discounts and pick several that meet your priorities — whether it’s cheaper rates, lower deductibles, higher coverage limits, fewer exclusions or something else.
**Compare rate quotes** : Make sure you apply the same coverage and limits to all the options you investigate. Note the cost of premiums, as well as the amount of the bundling discount and any requirements or limitations. 
**Check your existing policies** : If you already have home and auto insurance, consider the timing of ending your current policies. Some insurers may require 30 days’ notice or charge an early termination fee.
**Start your new policies:** To avoid a lapse in coverage, your new policy’s start date should coincide with your current policy’s end date. If you have a mortgage, you may need to notify your lender about a change in homeowners insurance.
**Cancel your existing policies:** In most cases, if you cancel your plan before the end of your term, you’ll receive a pro-rated refund.
##  Pros and cons of bundling insurance
Pros
  * Bundling can lower the cost of your home and auto insurance.
  * Using the same company makes it easier to review your policies, pay premiums and file claims. 
  * If something happens to both your home and your car, some insurers will waive the lower of your two deductibles


Cons
  * One company might not be the cheapest for all the policies you need
  * Bundling could make you less likely to shop around for a better deal
  * Choosing a single insurer means accepting the coverage limits and add-ons it has available


## FAQs
### How does bundling home and auto insurance work?
Bundling means purchasing more than one line of insurance from the same provider. A home-and-auto bundle, for example, would mean getting homeowners insurance and auto insurance from the same company. Most insurers offer a rate reduction for having multiple policies, which can be referred to as a bundling, multipolicy or multiline discount.
### Does bundling insurance save money?
Bundling insurance policies can save you money on monthly premiums, but it’s not always the cheapest option. You may pay less using two different companies, even without a discount. Getting rate quotes from multiple companies can help ensure you’re getting the best deal.
### How much do you save by bundling insurance?
The size of the discount depends on the provider, the policies you are bundling and how many. The largest discount we’ve found is 25% for bundling [car](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) and [homeowners insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/select/best-homeinsurance-options-cnbc/?mf_ct_campaign=cnbc-homeins-statefarm-spl-lp&product-name=State+Farm+Home+Insurance&s1=107217887) with State Farm.
### Does Progressive offer a bundling discount?
[Progressive](https://www.cnbc.com/select/progressive-car-insurance-review/) offers a multi-policy discount for customers who bundle [auto](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625), [home](https://secure.money.com/pr/g2ecdbd1039f), [motorcycle](https://secure.money.com/pr/d06764986055) and many other types of insurance. Customers save an average of 5% when they bundle, according to Progressive.

Every insurance**.** While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content independently of our commercial team and any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on maintaining high journalistic standards and ethics. See [our methodology](https://www.cnbc.com/select/about-us/) for more information on how we choose the best home and auto insurance bundles.
##  Our methodology
To determine which home and auto insurance bundles are the best, [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) analyzed dozens of U.S. insurance companies that offer multi-policy discounts.
When narrowing down our choices, we focused on the following features:
  * **Bundling discount:** We reviewed both the percentage discount available for bundling and the types of policies that could be bundled.
  * **Cost:** While premiums vary, we gave more weight to companies that had more affordable base rates.
  * **Availability:** Companies that were available in more states were given additional weight.
  * **Policy coverage:** Standard policies tend to include coverage for structural damage, personal property loss or damage, personal liability and medical payments to others. Some companies may also include water damage, water backup and high-value items as add-ons for extra coverage.
  * **Customer satisfaction:** We reviewed companies’ ranking on J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys and the volume of complaints reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. We also considered a carrier’s Better Business Bureau grade.
  * **Signup process:** We considered whether an insurance company offered a convenient online enrollment process and clear directions for receiving a bundling discount 


We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. 
Based on these criteria, the companies with the best auto and home bundles are:
