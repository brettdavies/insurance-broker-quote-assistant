Most [flood insurance policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance-coverage "What's Covered Under Flood Insurance?") in the U.S. come from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a government-backed program that's managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). National Flood Insurance Program policies are sold by private insurance companies.
**Homeowners can also get[private flood insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/private-flood-insurance "Private Flood Insurance: Is It Good Enough?"), which can be cheaper and typically offers more coverage options.** However, it may not be available in some high-risk areas.
The most basic flood insurance policies should cover the [cost to rebuild your home](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-replacement-cost-estimator "How to Estimate the Replacement Cost of Your Home") if it's destroyed by floodwater. You should also have enough coverage to replace your belongings, like furniture, clothing and appliances.
Unlike the NFIP, private flood insurance companies can cancel your policy if your flood risk becomes too great. In addition, private flood insurance may not meet the  requirements of your home loan company.
**[USAA](https://www.valuepenguin.com/usaa-insurance-review "USAA Insurance Review") and [Auto-Owners](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-owners-insurance-review "Auto-Owners Insurance Review") have the best customer service ratings of the largest companies that offer NFIP insurance.**
However, USAA is only available to  those who qualify, and Auto-Owners isn't available in every state. American Family and Amica are good alternatives.

You should also compare quotes from private flood insurance companies. [Chubb](https://www.valuepenguin.com/chubb-auto-home-insurance-review "Chubb Insurance Review"), AIG and AXA SA have the best customer service scores among large private flood insurance companies.

Yes, it's important to [shop for flood insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/how-get-flood-insurance "How to Get Flood Insurance: Everything You Need to Know") from multiple companies. All government-backed National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) insurance policies will offer the same coverage and rate. But you might be able to find more protection and cheaper quotes from a private company.
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") does not offer flood insurance. The company recently pulled out of its partnership with the NFIP. If you have a home or renters policy with State Farm and would like to buy flood insurance, you may go directly to the NFIP.
