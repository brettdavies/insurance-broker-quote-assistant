They advertise **savings of up to 40%,** making them some of the best [car insurance discounts](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts.html), but you should be aware that some insurers will increase your rates if poor driving habits are recorded.

## How does a pay-as-you-drive discount work?
Pay-as-you-drive is a type of usage-based insurance (UBI) that gives you a discount based on how and when you drive.
“Usage-based insurance monitors drivers’ actual driving behaviors and transmits those to the insurance company,” says Brenda Wells, director of the risk management & insurance program at East Carolina University. “[While} UBI still uses the factors for regular auto insurance, it also adds in the insured’s actual driving performance.” 
“The monitoring device, usually a cell phone with a special app installed, measures things like miles driven, time of day driven, speed, hard braking, taking curves too fast, etc. This data gives the insurance company the ability to add actual driving performance to the list of risk indicators used to calculate the premiums,” she says 
The monitoring systems are known as telematics. If the data collected is favorable, you could earn discounts ranging from **10% to 40%** , depending on the insurance company. You are usually awarded discounts every six months or upon policy renewal.
Bear in mind that any discounts depend on being a safe driver, which means not speeding and obeying all traffic laws. “UBI can lower your premiums if you’re a safe driver _._ If you’re not, or if you drive a lot of miles that the insurer otherwise would not know about, UBI can actually increase your premiums,” she says. 
Not all companies will charge higher premiums based on telematics data.
### What is usage-based insurance?
Usage-based insurance (UBI) offers a discount based on how much you use your car and how you drive. The insurance company tracks your driving and then charges you accordingly, applying discounts for maintaining low mileage and being a safe driver. Depending on the insurance company, this could happen every six months or whenever your [policy renews](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-renewal-guide). 
Most carriers factor in your speed, how much or how hard you brake, whether or not you pick up your phone a lot – which is a sign of distracted driving – and other things like acceleration habits. They also look at what time of day you drive. Driving during peak rush hour or on holidays is a negative factor, as is driving in the middle of the night, as statistically, many accidents happen during those hours.
Pay-per-mile programs are also available, which track your actual mileage and charge you a set rate for each mile you drive. These programs track only mileage and not driving habits.
## Pay-as-you-drive car insurance companies: Which companies have usage-based programs?
Allstate, American Family, State Farm and Travelers are among the major car insurance companies that offer usage-based programs.
The following companies offer usage-based programs, although they may not be available in every state. Each company weighs different [factors of your driving](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/rate-factors.html), such as speed, braking and what time of day you drive.
**Company** | **Program name** | **Device or app** | **Possible discount*** | **Possible rate increase?**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Allstate | DriveWise | Mobile app | 10-40% | Yes  
American Family | Drive My Way | Mobile app | 5-20% | Yes  
Esurance | DriveSense | Mobile app | 30% | No  
National General | Dynamic Drive | Mobile app | 10% | Yes  
The Hartford | TrueLane | Mobile app | 12-25% | No  
Progressive | Snapshot | Mobile app or plug-in device | varies | Yes  
Safeco | Rewind | Plug-in device | varies | No  
State Farm | DriveSafe & In-Drive | Mobile app & Bluetooth beacon | 10-30% | Yes  
Travelers | IntelliDrive | Mobile app | 30% | Yes  
Nationwide | SmartRide | Mobile app | 40% | No  
*Note that top-end discounts are often difficult to attain, requiring excellent driving habits. Most drivers see smaller discounts.

Rates can’t increase due to recorded driving habits.
## What’s the difference between usage-based car insurance, pay-as-you-go car insurance, and pay-per-mile car insurance?
Usage-based car insurance is any car insurance program that bases rates on how you drive. [Pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/pay-per-mile-auto-insurance.aspx) is a little different. Your insurance company will charge you a certain mileage rate, for example, 80 cents per mile, as well as a base rate. This is designed for low-mileage drivers who have a very predictable, low-mileage driving schedule.
You can track your miles in the same way as the usage-based programs via a mobile app or with a “connected car,” which can connect to the insurance company's telematics system. This device is added to your car to track your driving.
Both usage-based and pay-per-mile programs are sometimes called pay-as-you-go, but it most often refers to a plan where you pay based on actual miles drive.
To see how your mileage might impact your insurance costs under a usage-based plan, get an estimate with our [pay-per-mile calculator](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/pay-per-mile-car-insurance-calculator/).
## FAQ: Usage-based insurance discounts
### Does usage-based insurance save you money?
In general, **yes**. If you have safe driving habits, you will save money. The only time it backfires is if you speed or have bad driving habits while using the mobile app. Your insurance company will see how you drive.
### Can usage-based insurance raise your premium?
It can, if you don’t obey posted speeding signs or have other negative driving habits. The telematics device the car insurance company gives you to monitor your usage records not only how far you drive but how you drive. Your rates will go down (or up) accordingly.
### What does a telematics program track?
Programs vary, but they generally track braking and acceleration, time of day, how far you drive, and, in some cases, your phone use.
