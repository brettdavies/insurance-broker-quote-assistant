## What is high-risk car insurance?

There's no industry standard, but many insurers will consider you a high-risk driver if you have:

* An at-fault accident
* A speeding ticket
* A DUI or DWI conviction
* An SR-22 or FR-44 filed with your state insurance office
* A high number of points on your license
* A low credit score
* Multiple insurance claims filed in the last three years

Having a lapse in coverage, being a teen driver or living in a high-crime area can also put you in a high-risk category.

## How much does high-risk car insurance cost?

Here's how much premiums go up for drivers in a variety of high-risk categories:

| Category | Average annual rate |
| --- | --- |
| Clean driving record with good credit | $2,677 |
| Poor credit | $4,700 |
| Teen driver | $5,719 |
| At-fault accident | $3,858 |
| Speeding ticket | $3,278 |
| DUI conviction | $5,252 |

*Source: Bankrate data as of July 2025*

## How long are you considered a high-risk driver?

The length of time a risk factor stays on your record depends on the incident, the state you live in and your insurer.

At-fault accidents and speeding tickets typically stay on your insurance record for three to five years. A violation involving a DUI or reckless driving, however, can stay on your record for 15 years or longer.

## How high-risk drivers can lower their insurance rates

While you can't erase a ticket or accident from your record, you can take steps to mitigate higher premiums.

### **Step 1: Enroll in a safe driving course**

Taking an approved defensive driving course shows insurers you're taking steps to become a better driver and may result in a discount.

### **Step 2:** Bundle policies

Getting an auto policy from the same company you take out home or renters insurance can translate [to savings of more than 20%](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/).

### Step 3; Improve your credit

In most states, your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/) can be used to determine how much you'll pay for insurance. Paying your bills in full, limiting how many credit card applications you submit and otherwise boosting your credit score can help lower your car insurance rates.

### **Step 4:** Shop around

Compare quotes from several insurers to make sure you get the best deal. Some insurance companies, including [First Acceptance](https://secure.money.com/pr/ifd2bb9a6fcb) and [Dairyland](https://secure.money.com/pr/b6d553a3df3f), specialize in high-risk drivers.

## If you're denied coverage as a high-risk driver

If you're rejected by an auto insurance provider, it's worth applying to several others: Insurance companies treat drivers differently when deciding on approvals and premiums.  
  
An insurance agent can also help you find coverage that fits your needs and driving record.

If you're still having trouble getting covered, look into a state-assigned risk pool. These programs can help make sure you'll get coverage, though the price might be higher.

## High-risk driver FAQs

### How much does car insurance go up after an accident?

Insurance premiums can go up as much as 45% after an at-fault accident, although it depends on your age, driving history, location and other factors.

### How long are you considered a high-risk driver?

Insurance companies generally only look at your record for the past three to five years, though your state may keep a record of your driving for considerably longer. In New York, for example, an accident involving intoxicated driving can stay on your record permanently.

### What is the cheapest car insurance company for high-risk drivers?

If you are considered a high-risk driver, the cheapest auto insurance policy for you will depend on a variety of factors, including your driving record, age and coverage needs.

Overall, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d), [Erie](https://secure.money.com/pr/t21369540d31), [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163), [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625) and [USAA](https://secure.money.com/pr/sb2ad78ec907) have some of the lowest rates and best coverage options for those with an accident, DUI or other blemishes on their record.

### Will my insurance go up even if an accident isn't my fault?

Only a few states, including Oklahoma and California, prohibit insurance companies from raising rates after an accident you're not held liable for. In general, insurers assess risk, not blame, so any collision reported to the police or your insurance company can result in a premium increase.

### How much is high-risk car insurance?

Car insurance for high-risk drivers is more expensive but the severity of the price difference depends on the situation. While a speeding ticket could bring a hike of 22%, an at-fault accident will raise your rates by about 45% and a DUI could lead to a 65% increase. Other types of drivers, like teens and seniors, have different rates.

## Our methodology

[CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) looked at more than 30 insurers offering coverage to high-risk drivers, focusing on average premiums for a variety of high-risk categories.

Sample premiums are based on data from [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers) on a 40-year-old with an otherwise clean driving record and a 2020 Toyota Camry, who commutes five days a week and drives 12,000 miles a year, with the following coverage:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
* $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
* $50,000 property damage liability per accident
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
* $500 collision deductible
* $500 comprehensive deductible

We also considered each company based on coverage options, add-ons, discounts, nationwide availability and online experience.

We reviewed customer satisfaction ratings from [J.D. Power,](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study) the Better Business Bureau and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as well as financial strength ratings from A.M. Best.

We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.
