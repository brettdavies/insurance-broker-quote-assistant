## Getting car insurance after living abroad

If you’ve just returned to the U.S. after living abroad, getting your [car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) set up might not be as simple as picking up where you left off. Even if you carried insurance overseas, many American [insurers](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) will view that time as a gap in coverage unless you can show [proof of insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/proof-of-insurance/) (in English).

Because most companies want to see **at least three years** of continuous insurance, this gap can sometimes lead to higher rates. The good news: keeping a copy of your old policy documents and being ready to show your driving history can help smooth the process and save you money.

### Didn’t have car insurance abroad?

If you either didn’t have coverage or can’t prove your coverage, expect your US auto insurance rates to be slightly higher than they would be if you had maintained continuous coverage. Typically, **a driver with six months of continuous insurance coverage saves nearly $100 per year** versus a driver with no sustained coverage.

Average annual insurance premium by time insured

| Time Insured | Average Annual Premium |
| --- | --- |
| None | $1,599 |
| 6 Months | $1,509 |
| 1 Year | $1,475 |
| 3 Years | $1,439 |
| 5 Years | $1,409 |

---

## Stay insured whenever possible

Not all insurance companies will approve someone [without continuous coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-canceled-policies/). Because of the risks presented by an uninsured driver, the insurance company might underwrite your car insurance policy with a subsidiary.

When returning to the States from abroad, be sure to secure proof of your expat car insurance. This record will help to prove your continuously insured status. If it looks like your [coverage has lapsed](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-after-lapsed-coverage/), some insurers might not cover you at all or quote you higher premiums. No matter your unique circumstance, finding [affordable car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/how-to-shop/best-cheap-auto-insurance/) for expats isn't impossible. Enter your new zip code below to [receive quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) in minutes

If you decide to leave the U.S. again, consider carrying [storage insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/what-is-car-storage-insurance/) or lowering your coverage to the minimum levels, rather than canceling completely. Of course, this depends on how long you plan to be away, but it's something to consider.

## Car insurance for expats FAQs:

What will companies look at when determining my rate?
Chevron down icon

Some of the factors insurance companies take into consideration when calculating a rate are your age, marital status, your specific vehicle, and your personal driving history. Your location can also make a difference; whether you settle in a particular state, in a rural or urban area, or in a specific zip code can make a difference. This is why it is essential to compare rates and coverage options with different insurance companies to find the best fit for your needs.

What if I never had car insurance in the U.S. before I went abroad?
Chevron down icon

If you haven't had car insurance in the U.S. in the past, you're generally considered a "new driver" by insurance companies, which is a **higher risk** for the insurer. If you had car insurance while you were abroad, it can be helpful for your insurance company to see documentation (in English) of the policy you carried in your previous country.

Do I need insurance if I'm only living in the U.S. temporarily?
Chevron down icon

If you're in America for a short visit and renting a car for a few days or weeks, a simple solution is to **purchase insurance through the rental car company.** However, if you're staying for a longer period of time and purchase a vehicle, then you'll want to get your own policy that meets state minimum requirements. Most policies are typically written for six months or a year, but some companies do offer shorter policy periods. You may also want to ask about the company's cancellation policy, too.

What if I'm from Canada and I'm driving my own car while I live in the U.S.?
Chevron down icon

If you're relocating from Canada and bringing your personal vehicle with you, then you'll want to obtain a U.S. driver's license from the state you plan to live in. Like other drivers, you'll be required to carry the state minimum when it comes to insurance on your vehicle, so take the time to shop around and find a policy and rate that works best for your situation.
