You got a renewal offer in California. That alone is ahead of many people

All rates are filed and approved by the state department of insurance. So yes, it is reasonable. It’s a [free market](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+free+market&cId=e197b822-869c-41eb-a0f3-b21341a7569d&iId=19114257-c7ba-4c87-aeb4-72d5d9ed8ed2). You can insure with another carrier if you want.

Of course I could and most likely will. But to charge me the price of financing a new car just makes me feel like next time, I'll total the car and come out on top over the loan and just be done with it.

Except you don’t get to pick if the car is totaled so that’s not the “nananana booboo” you think it is.
They disagree that it was unavoidable and have properly asserted you now have an [at-fault claim](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=at-fault+claim+insurance&cId=01cd1d23-1bb7-4260-ab42-ccbd619d4f5c&iId=d3486fee-fb6b-4d9a-a898-01d983f259f6).
Add to that that the CA DOI was artificially forcing carriers to keep rates that were pushing companies to insolvency AND the recent change to increase state minimum coverage across the board - well, there you go.

It won't work like that. Because more expensive claims also get factored in on a higher rate also.

I can't speak for CA but in GA, when you file your first claim, you will lost the "no claim in past 3 years" discount that is required by state law, and it is at least 10% for each coverage.

This poster has a valid point. You may have been hit with an accident surcharge and lost a claims-free discount, which may account for such a huge increase.

I feel you,I just got slapped with a 14% rate hike from State Farm out here in California. No tickets, no accidents, literally nothing changed on my end. Called up my agent, and he told me it’s part of some statewide adjustment they pushed through earlier this year.
From what I’ve been seeing (and reading around Reddit too), if your record’s clean, anything between 6–15% seems to be the new “normal” right now. It’s not just you repair costs, inflation, and claim payouts are making everyone’s premiums creep up, no matter who you're with.
Honestly, if your bump is under 10%, it’s probably not even about you just the industry doing its thing. But if it’s hitting 15–20% or more, and your situation hasn’t changed? That’s your cue to start comparing. A lot of people I know have switched carriers and knocked a good chunk off their rates just by shopping around.
And if you recently added a driver (especially a teen), moved ZIP codes, or your credit took a dip (depending on your state), that alone can spike your premium another 20–40%.
If nothing’s changed on your side and you’re under 15%, it’s probably just market shifts. But if it’s more than that, definitely worth checking other quotes. Never hurts to know your options.

We’ve had luck arguing the “at fault” decision in cases like yours by appealing the decision and arguing that accident was unavoidable. For example swerving to avoid the debris would have caused you to strike another vehicle or object in another lane. Talk to your agent they might be of some help.

State Farm in California has raised rates in California the last two years. 22% 2024 and 17% in 2025. That of which has nada to do with your claim. Tack that onto your claim. State Farm is garbage. Find a better insurance company. The CAA and consumer watchdog has advocated against shit like this.

CW can advocate all they want, but when the data behind the revisions is actuarially sound, justifiable, and reasonable to keep the company in business, they can’t do shit about this shit.

While that’s true, CW still does. It’s not the fault of anyone but State Farm and their numbers. Agree or disagree?

Are you buying state minimum limits? Because those have increased recently in California which might be having an impact as well.

That’s crazy. I made a SF claim under comprehensive for a similar event when a truck picked up a piece of plywood and it hit the front end. I had video but they didn’t ask for it.

I will. Call it what you want, but I've just been autopaying coverage since I've got the car and not really shopped for competitive rates beyond "who can get me insured by my deadline in the least amount of my time spent chasing them".
