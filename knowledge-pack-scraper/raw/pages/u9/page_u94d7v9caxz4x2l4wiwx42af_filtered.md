# Reasonable State Farm rate increase?

[Auto Insurance](/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)

ETA: California

I have gotten my auto-renewal letter that states my insurance is increasing around $1,000 per 6 month period for full coverage (going from $2214 to $3,188) on a 2022 Honda Civic Sport. The stated reason when asking is due to a claim I had filed and was paid out a few months back from an unavoidable collision with roadside debris (a truck with attached tool crate obscured or even dropped a full blown muffler on to the freeway, which I then ran over). I was found to be at fault due to "unsafe backing" (reversing on the freeway, really?)

Other than the fact I obviously disagree with the severity of the accident causing my record to drop from "Superior" to "6" on State Farm's scale, does the rate increase match with the determination? I havent had a need to use State Farm for anything over the span of roughly 10 years I have been insured with them, and I feel like I'm being taken for a slight ride on this. Geico is stating they can give me similar coverage for $1950, and it's starting to sound like I need to move on. Or am I just out of touch?
