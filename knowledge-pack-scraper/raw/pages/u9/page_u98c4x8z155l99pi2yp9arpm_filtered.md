# Florida Building Codes and Laws Around Hurricane Shutters

3. Florida Building Codes and Laws…

Can a $3000 investment in hurricane shutters save you from $30,000 in storm damage? You may be surprised.

Hurricane season rolls around annually from June to November. It has the potential to cause billions of dollars in hurricane-related damages, especially in Florida. This is why Florida has some of the strictest building codes requirements nationwide, especially when it comes to hurricane protection, such as hurricane shutters.

Florida building codes and laws centered around hurricane protection might seem excessive. But they have a good intention. These codes are aimed to protect residents and reduce hurricane-related property damage. The requirements around opening protection, including hurricane shutters and impact windows & doors help to safeguard your home and family. These requirements also help to reduce hurricane-related repair costs.

And while these codes and laws are aimed at protecting residents, sometimes they create more questions than answers. What exactly do the Florida Building Code and related statutes mean for you and your property? Are all shutters created equal? What happens in the case of non-compliance? Read on as we answer these questions and more, then contact Eurex Shutters to discuss your options for [hurricane shutters in Southwest Florida](https://eurexshutters.com/) before the next storm rolls through.

## How the Florida Building Code Protects Homes and Residents from Hurricanes

To Floridians, the [Florida Building Code (FBC)](https://eurexshutters.com/florida-building-code-intro/) is a bible of hurricane preparedness. The FBC is updated every three years, with the opportunity to improve the codes to meet the changing hurricanes and other factors. These ever-changing, rigorous standards are important to protect new and existing construction in Florida’s wind-blown, water-damaged regions.

Among many other components the FBC covers opening protection, such as hurricane shutters and impact glass. These standards focus on strength, durability, and optimal performance for hurricane opening protection, especially under extreme conditions like 150+ mile-per-hour winds.

The building code specifies the requirements for hurricane-rated products, also referred to those with Florida Product Approval. Shutters must pass impact, missile tests. Wooden beams are hurled at the shutters at over 100 miles per hour, ensuring they are strong enough to withstand flying debris in Category 5 hurricanes. In addition they must pass pressure cycling tests, to ensure the shutters can withstand the positive and negative pressures of a hurricane.

Additionally, local municipalities may implement their own requirements, or they may adopt requirements above and beyond the FBC ones. One well known example is Miami-Dade product approval standards. These standards are centered around properties located in High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ), like Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. HVHZ areas have more demanding requirements and can be subject to high wind speeds of 180 miles per hour or more. Many homeowners in coastal areas may be subject to HVHZ requirements, so knowing which [beach house](https://eurexshutters.com/beach-house-shutters-for-hurricane-season/) [hurricane shutters](https://eurexshutters.com/beach-house-shutters-for-hurricane-season/) to use is important.

While it makes building a new home or significantly renovating an old home (if required to meet current FBC requirements) more expensive, the building codes have helped.

The results? Homes built under the modern FBC are 60% less likely to sustain significant damage during a hurricane than pre-code homes. This statistic is a testament to Florida’s no-nonsense approach to storm safety, which has saved countless lives and billions of dollars in damages.

## Florida Requirements for Storm Shutters and Impact Windows Installation

Hurricane-rated shutters and impact windows are two of the most popular forms of opening protection. But the FBC has requirements on both the products and how they are installed. They must be installed correctly and meet specific legal standards. The FBC dictates shutters must match wind-load requirements for an area based on detailed wind zone maps. Shutters in Jacksonville, for instance, may not need to withstand the same forces as those in Key West, but both regions must be installed to code.

### Professional Installation vs DIY

Professional installation of hurricane protection products is required. Florida law mandates that licensed contractors install hurricane shutters following manufacturer guidelines. Permits and inspections are required for compliance. Improperly mounted shutters can become deadly projectiles in a storm. If they come off they also do not serve their protective purpose.

So, while DIY may seem like a great way to save a few bucks, professional installation is a must.

### HOA Requirements

If you are like many in the sunshine state living in a condo or HOA community, you need to be aware of their specific rules. HOAs and their HOA Architectural Committees play a role in what type of hurricane protection products they allow in the community, along with colors, and other things. While Florida statutes, such as House Bill 293 prohibits HOAs from outright banning hurricane shutters, they can enforce timing, maintenance, and aesthetics rules to keep a cohesive, visually appealing community.

## Penalties and FAQs: Navigating Florida’s Hurricane Related Safety Requirements

What happens if you try your luck and skip hurricane protection altogether? If your home falls under the FBC requirements and you do not comply then you may have some issues.

Penalties may include citations, fines, or corrective actions (which have a cost of course) from local building/permit bodies. Outside of local authorities, you may face other issues. For example, hurricane protection provides insurance discounts. In addition, homes without opening protection face skyrocketing insurance premiums. You may also face denied claims when your home suffers what your carrier considers preventable damage. Florida law isn’t forgiving when it comes to negligence around avoidable destruction.

### Some exceptions

With all of that being said, there are some legitimate reasons why properties do not meet the FBC requirements around opening protection. For instance, homes built before the FBC regulations on opening protection were enacted do not need to meet the requirements if the windows are not replaced. Also, existing homes in a designated low-risk zones may not have the hurricane opening protection requirements, even if they’re strongly recommended.

But while these situations may not require you to install impact shutters or windows/doors, it is a very good idea. Homes without adequate protection risk significant out-of-pocket expenses if disaster strikes their home.

### Some FAQs

* **Do renters need to install hurricane shutters or windows?**

Property owners are responsible for their properties. If the property requires hurricane protection under the FBC, then the owner is responsible for this expense. It is advisable that tenants should confirm with their landlord that their rental is prepared for big storms. It should also be noted that your lease may specify who is responsible for installing and removing storm panels or deploying and preparing the rental property.

* **Are there exceptions for historic homes?**

Historic properties may qualify for exemptions or alternative compliance methods. This will depend on many factors, including if you are replacing windows or doing renovations that enact the 50% rule. With all of that said, safety should still be a priority. There are hurricane shutter options to meet the design of your historic home, such as Colonial Hurricane Shutters or [Bahama Hurricane Shutters](https://eurexshutters.com/products/bahama-shutters/).

For Floridians facing 6 months of potentially damaging hurricanes, compliance with the FBC is as much common sense as it is following Florida law. Hurricane shutters and [impact windows in Southwest Florida](https://eurexshutters.com/) are a step toward must-have protection during hurricane season.

## What Happens if you Opt to Not Have Hurricane Protection On Your Florida Home?

Hurricane protection is an investment, but it is an investment none-the-less. Skipping shutters or impact windows may save you upfront cash. However, the long-term costs can be astronomical.

Here’s what you risk by leaving your home unprotected and vulnerable to storms:

* **Insurance Denials –** Many insurers require proof of hurricane protection before approving claims in Florida. Without shutters, you could be footing the bill for damages. A policy may be tough to secure, and they may be very expensive. Hurricane protection allows you to qualify for more carriers and lowers the premiums.
* **Significant Hurricane Related Damages** – Hurricane shutters and impact windows help protect vulnerable openings of your home. They prevent water damage through these openings. They also help to prevent more serious damage, such as your home becoming pressurized, which may cause structural damage.
* **Lower Resale Value** – Homes lacking compliant hurricane protection are less attractive to buyers, especially in hurricane-prone areas. While this may not be a big deal if you are staying put, it does matter if you want to maximize the value and equity of your home.

According to FEMA, every $1 spent on hurricane protection saves $6 in disaster costs. Therefore, compliance is a wise financial move.
