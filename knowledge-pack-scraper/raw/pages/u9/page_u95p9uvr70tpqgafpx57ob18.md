**3-step plan to qualify for the best rate:**
  1. **Clean record tune-up (last 36 months):** take an approved defensive driving course, remove old drivers you no longer insure, and verify accident/violation dates on your MVR.
  2. **Telematics prep:** during your Snapshot evaluation, avoid late-night trips (12–4 a.m.), space out commutes, and keep phone mounts to reduce hard-brake events.
  3. **Stack discounts:** combine safe-driver + Snapshot with _paperless, pay-in-full, homeowner/renter, and multi-car_ where eligible.


Beyond Snapshot and good-driver pricing, Progressive frequently stacks **multi-policy** and **pay-in-full** discounts. If you also carry a homeowners or renters policy, consider consolidating with Progressive’s [home & auto bundling options](https://homeownersinsurancem.com/progressive-s-bundling-options-for-home-and-auto.html)—it’s one of the easiest ways for safe drivers to amplify total savings. 
Qualifying behavior that typically improves Snapshot results includes smooth braking, daytime driving, and fewer hard accelerations. If you’re concerned about occasional long trips, aim to keep late-night mileage lower during your evaluation period; time-of-day driving is often a key factor in usage-based pricing models. 
  * **Safe Driver Discount:** For a spotless driving record.
  * **Snapshot Program:** Earn additional savings for real-time safe driving habits. Learn more in the [Snapshot guide](https://homeownersinsurancem.com/understanding-progressive-s-snapshot-discount-program.html).
  * **Bundling Discounts:** Save more when you combine auto with home or renters insurance.


**Tip:** Always compare Progressive quotes with at least two other companies to ensure you get the best deal. 
### Additional Discounts and Perks
Progressive also offers savings for students with good grades, military members, and those who pay premiums in full. Don’t forget to ask about paperless billing and automatic-payment discounts—small percentages that compound nicely alongside safe-driver rewards. 
**Common Snapshot pitfalls to avoid:** repeated hard stops from tailgating, frequent late-night driving, and aggressive accelerations after toll booths. Plan routes with longer following distances and leave earlier to reduce risky patterns.
