Additionally, local municipalities may implement their own requirements, or they may adopt requirements above and beyond the FBC ones. One well known example is Miami-Dade product approval standards. These standards are centered around properties located in High-Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZ), like Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. HVHZ areas have more demanding requirements and can be subject to high wind speeds of 180 miles per hour or more. Many homeowners in coastal areas may be subject to HVHZ requirements, so knowing which [beach house ](https://eurexshutters.com/beach-house-shutters-for-hurricane-season/)[hurricane shutters](https://eurexshutters.com/beach-house-shutters-for-hurricane-season/) to use is important.
What happens if you try your luck and skip hurricane protection altogether? If your home falls under the FBC requirements and you do not comply then you may have some issues.
Historic properties may qualify for exemptions or alternative compliance methods. This will depend on many factors, including if you are replacing windows or doing renovations that enact the 50% rule. With all of that said, safety should still be a priority. There are hurricane shutter options to meet the design of your historic home, such as Colonial Hurricane Shutters or [Bahama Hurricane Shutters](https://eurexshutters.com/products/bahama-shutters/).
* **Insurance Denials –** Many insurers require proof of hurricane protection before approving claims in Florida. Without shutters, you could be footing the bill for damages. A policy may be tough to secure, and they may be very expensive. Hurricane protection allows you to qualify for more carriers and lowers the premiums.
* **Significant Hurricane Related Damages** – Hurricane shutters and impact windows help protect vulnerable openings of your home. They prevent water damage through these openings. They also help to prevent more serious damage, such as your home becoming pressurized, which may cause structural damage.
* **Lower Resale Value** – Homes lacking compliant hurricane protection are less attractive to buyers, especially in hurricane-prone areas. While this may not be a big deal if you are staying put, it does matter if you want to maximize the value and equity of your home.
