# State Farm Stands with Texas During Flood Recovery

Our hearts go out to all the families and communities whose lives have been forever impacted by the catastrophic and widespread flooding in Texas. Our greatest concern is for the safety of everyone in the devastated areas, and our thoughts especially are with those who have lost friends, family, and loved ones during this tragedy.

State Farm® takes seriously our responsibility to be there for people when they need us the most during recovery. Agents and team members have been mobilized to help our customers and the communities who have been impacted by this catastrophic event. When safe to do so, customers with damage are encouraged to reach out to State Farm when ready to begin recovery.  Many vehicles have been damaged or destroyed in the catastrophic event, and customers with a comprehensive auto policy are typically covered for flooded vehicle. Resources for customers with home damage from flooding also can be found at [FEMA/NFIP](https://www.nfipdirect.fema.gov/login) or reaching out to your local agent for consultation.

## Moving toward recovery

**Options for submitting a claim:** through our mobile app, calling or emailing your State Farm agent, calling 1-800-SFCLAIM, through our website at [statefarm.com/claims](https://www.statefarm.com/claims) or by texting the word “CLAIM” to 62789

## Recovering from the unexpected

**What are my first steps?**

* After a claim has been submitted, a claim handler will contact you to discuss the extent of damage and review what is covered under your policy.
* If at any time during the claim process, you have questions, do not hesitate to ask your claim handler. We know this can be a difficult time. We are here to help you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

**Who is going to help me with my claim?**

* State Farm is here to provide you claim service throughout the claim process.
* To best assist you during this time, we may involve various members of our claim handling team.
* This approach to enhanced customer service allows State Farm to provide quality and efficient claim service, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.

**Additional information?**

* While a comprehensive auto policy typically covers flooded vehicle losses, flood insurance for homeowners is purchased from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
* For questions about FEMA, the NFIP and the flood claims process, please contact FEMA as they are the most appropriate resource.
