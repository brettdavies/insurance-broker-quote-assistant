The bill would repeal the state's no-fault insurance law. In Florida, there is a no-fault auto insurance that means all drivers must have personal injury protection to cover their own medical expenses and lost wages if there is an accident, no matter who is at fault.

#####
* Legislators are once again considering a bill that would repeal Florida's no-fault insurance law
* HB 1181 would require drivers get $25,000 in bodily injury coverage
* The founder of the West Coast Florida Riders motorcycle club says the bill would lower insurance premiums and offer more protection than bikers currently have
* The president of the Florida Justice Reform Institute says 2023 reforms are reducing the amount of personal injury protection litigation, and he wants lawmakers to hold off on changes until more data can be gathered

"In my opinion, PIP never really worked. The first time that PIP started working was in 2023, thanks to Gov. (Ron) DeSantis's reforms," said William Large, president of the Florida Justice Reform Institute.
