**Should I get insurance directly from Tesla?**

Tesla [sells its own insurance](#in-house "#in-house"), and its rates are very competitive for good drivers. It sets prices primarily using sensors onboard your Tesla, and ignores things like credit score, speeding tickets or claim history.

But that means your rates can change a lot from month to month, and the company gets lots of complaints from customers who aren't happy with the service they receive. It's also only currently available in

**Pros and cons**

* Cheapest company to insure a Tesla car
* Doesn't consider driving history or credit score
* Convenient sign-up process in Tesla app

* Rates go up or down a lot each month depending on your driving
* Poor customer service
* Only available to Tesla owners

Tesla's insurance program is only available if you own a Tesla car, but you can cover a non-Tesla with the company as well.

Tesla's own insurance rates are much cheaper than other companies. The typical rate is **$169 per month** across all new Tesla models. That's about half the average rate.

Rates in every state except California are primarily set using Tesla's own "Safety Score," with little to no consideration for tickets, recent claims or your credit score.

Tesla drivers with high Safety Scores can see even more savings. A perfect score of 100 typically saves you 37% off the regular rate.

### Tesla Safety Score uses these to set rates

* Hard braking
* Aggressive turning
* Unsafe following

* Excessive speeding

* Late night driving (11 p.m.-4 a.m.)
* Forced autopilot disengagement
* Unbuckled driving

Exact criteria may change based on which Safety Score version you have. These are for Safety Score 2.2.

### Tesla does not use these to set rates

* Accident history
* Tickets (such as speeding)
* Claims
* Credit
* Age
* Gender
* Marital status

However, Tesla's extensive use of its onboard sensors means that a single incident, even if it's not your fault, can raise your rates. Customers have reported another driver unexpectedly pulling in front of them leading to price increases of $10 or more for next month's bill.

Tesla Insurance also gets a lot of complaints from its customers, suggesting drivers are often unhappy with the service they receive. Tesla Insurance receives more than 13 times as many complaints as a typical car insurance company.

### Where is Tesla Insurance available?

Tesla's car insurance is available exclusively to Tesla owners in 12 states.

* Arizona
* California\*
* Colorado
* Illinois

* Maryland
* Minnesota
* Nevada
* Ohio

* Oregon
* Texas
* Utah
* Virginia

\*Tesla Insurance in California doesn't set rates using your Safety Score, as telematic insurance rates aren't permitted there.

### Extra Tesla coverage options

You can add the Autonomous Vehicle Protection Package to cover:

* Autonomous vehicle owner liability
* Electronic key replacement

* Cyber identity fraud expenses
* Wall charger coverage

### Tesla Insurance rates by Safety Score

While Tesla's insurance rates are very affordable for nearly all drivers, your rate drops even more if you have a high Safety Score.

A perfect score of 100 will get you a monthly rate of just $74 on a new Model 3. That's very affordable compared to the overall average of $282 per month (across insurers) to insure a Model 3.

Tesla adjusts rates according to five-point Safety Score increments. So if your average score falls between 95 and 99, your rate will increase to $87 per month.

![Tesla Insurance rates by safety score](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto/tesla-safety-rates-d_sjzuwo)

### How does the Tesla Safety Score work?

Tesla's Safety Score works much like other [telematics car insurance](/car-insurance/telematics "Telematics Car Insurance") like Progressive Snapshot. The Tesla app monitors your driving habits and assigns a score between 0 and 100, with most drivers getting an 80 or above.

The biggest difference is that your score is the only thing Tesla considers when setting rates, so your actions have a big impact on what you pay each month.

Tesla is specific about what causes your score to go down.

* Forward collision warnings (per 1,000 miles)
* Hard braking (percentage of time)
* Aggressive turning (percentage of time)
* Unsafe following speed or distance (percentage of time)
* Forced autopilot disengagement (number of instances)

Your Safety Score is calculated daily, and a weighted average based on driving time is calculated over the last 30 days.

### Average monthly Tesla Insurance rates by Safety Score

| Safety Score | Monthly rate | Difference from average |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | $74 | -25% |
| 95-99 | $87 | -12% |
| 90-94 | $91 | -8% |
| 85-89 | $95 | -4% |
| 80-84 | $99 | — |

### Tesla Insurance rates in California

Tesla Insurance in California works differently than Tesla Insurance in other states because the **California rates aren't based on your Safety Score**.

However, Tesla's own insurance program is still the most affordable option available in the Golden State. Its average price across all 2022 Tesla models is $187 per month. That's 45% less than the state average, and $81 per month cheaper than the second-best option, [Geico](/geico-insurance-review "Geico Insurance Review").

## Why are Teslas so expensive to insure?

Tesla cars are expensive to insure because they are expensive to buy and repair. They're even more expensive to cover than other electric cars.

* Teslas can only be repaired at Tesla-approved body repair shops. The training and equipment to become qualified mean much higher costs for drivers.
* Electric cars are [more expensive to repair](/how-having-electric-car-affects-your-auto-insurance-rates "How Much Does Electric Car Insurance Cost?") and insure because they have more expensive equipment and technology.
* Teslas have a longer battery range than other EVs, so they tend to rack up more miles. More driving time means higher crash risks.
* The Model S aluminum frame is more expensive and difficult to repair than a steel frame.

That's why the cost to repair a Tesla, even for a minor fender bender, can easily reach several thousand dollars. As the cars include more custom parts, safety features and technology, the cost per collision may continue to rise.

Quotes for a Tesla also factor in the cost of replacing the car's high-end tech after a crash.
