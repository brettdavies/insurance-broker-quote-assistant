**Why you can trust NerdWallet:** Our writers and editors follow [strict editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) to ensure fairness and accuracy in our coverage so you can choose the insurance policy that works best for you. These carrier ratings are specific to auto insurance — a company's rating for other products may be different on our site. See our criteria for [evaluating auto insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

* ### How we review auto insurance companies

  In our auto insurance reviews, our editorial team considers both the customer and the insurer. These are some of the factors we take into account:

  **Financial strength.** We use AM Best ratings to confirm an insurer’s long-term financial stability and ability to pay claims. NerdWallet does not recommend companies with a rating lower than a B.

  **Complaints.** These ratings are based on complaints to state regulators relative to a company’s size, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The best auto insurance companies have fewer than the expected number of complaints.

  **Ease of use.** This category looks at how easily consumers can interact with an insurer through its mobile app and website. This includes how much coverage information is offered online, whether a user can start and track a claim online and get a quote and mobile app scores based on the Apple and Google Play store ratings.

  **Discounts.** We look at both the kind of discounts a company offers and the total number of discounts available.

## Where Travelers stands out

**Accident and traffic violation forgiveness.** Travelers offers qualifying drivers two accident forgiveness plans that could help them avoid a rate increase after an at-fault accident or a ticket.

**Coverage options.** Travelers offers coverage that some other insurers don’t, including gap insurance and [new car replacement](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/new-car-replacement-car-insurance). Both of these coverage types come in handy if you total a relatively new vehicle.

**Affordability.** Full coverage car insurance from Travelers is often cheaper than similar coverage from other large insurers. It may be a relatively cheap option even if you have an accident, DUI or speeding ticket on your record.

## Where Travelers falls short

**Claims satisfaction**. Although Travelers boasts few customer complaints, its customer satisfaction rating is below average in J.D. Power's 2024 auto insurance claims satisfaction study.[1]

## How much does Travelers car insurance cost?

## How Travelers' rates compare

Your car insurance rate depends on a variety of personal factors, including your driving record and, in most states, your credit history. While Travelers has relatively cheap rates, on average, it’s still worth [comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance) to learn which company offers you the best price.

Here are Travelers’ average annual auto insurance rates for different levels of coverage and driving histories compared to national averages, according to NerdWallet’s October 2025 analysis. Rates are for full coverage car insurance unless otherwise specified.

| Driver profile | Travelers' average rate | National average rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum coverage | $541 | $627 |
| Full coverage | $1,712 | $2,301 |
| One speeding ticket, good credit | $2,210 | $2,932 |
| One at-fault crash, good credit | $2,410 | $3,406 |
| One DUI, good credit | $3,025 | $4,265 |
| Clean driving record, poor credit | $2,932 | $3,850 |

## Travelers auto insurance coverage

When you're shopping for car insurance coverage, it's important to understand what [types of car insurance coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/types-of-car-insurance) you want and what you’re required to buy. Most states require a minimum amount of car insurance to drive a vehicle. Alternatively, if you want extra protection, you may be interested in full coverage insurance.

Travelers offers the usual auto coverage choices, plus some optional features you can add (depending on your state) for an extra cost. These include:

* ### Gap insurance

  [**Gap insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/gap-insurance) protects your auto lease or loan. If your car is totaled before it’s paid off or the lease is up, Travelers pays the difference between your loan’s balance and the car’s value when it’s totaled.

  **Who might need it?** The terms of a lease or loan will likely require you to carry gap insurance. Even if no one requires you to buy gap insurance, it could be worth having for a new car that would rapidly lose value if you totaled it shortly after purchase.
* ### Rideshare insurance

  [**Rideshare insurance**](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/rideshare-insurance) is available for people who drive for companies like Uber or Lyft. Rideshare insurance can fill in coverage gaps left by your rideshare company’s insurance.

  **Who might need it?** Anyone driving for a rideshare company should consider rideshare insurance. Your personal car insurance may provide only some coverage while you’re driving for Uber, Lyft and other rideshare programs. Your rideshare company’s insurance may not cover all periods during your shift.
* ### Premier New Car Replacement

  **Premier New Car Replacement** is a coverage package that includes new car replacement for cars five years old or newer. New car replacement replaces your damaged car with a new one, once you pay any applicable deductibles. Along with new car replacement, you also get gap insurance and a glass deductible, which lowers your out-of-pocket costs when your car’s glass needs repaired.

  **Who might need it?** Few other insurers offer new car replacement to vehicles that are up to five years old (the cutoff is often much shorter). This, combined with the convenience of purchasing three types of coverage at once, means it might be a fit for more drivers — but check that its price fits in your budget.
* ### Responsible Driver Plan

  **Responsible Driver Plan** forgives one accident and one minor violation after your first accident or violation, so your rates won’t go up after a crash or ticket.

  **Who might need it?** This could be a fit if you’re someone who’s happy to pay a higher premium now to avoid the potential of an even higher future increase. Having an [accident or driving violation](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-insurance-goes-up-after-accident) can cause the cost of car insurance to increase significantly.
* ### Premier Responsible Driver Plan

  **The Premier Responsible Driver Plan** includes the above accident and violation forgiveness perks, as well as a decreasing deductible ($50 off for every six months accident-free, up to $500 off your deductible). If your car is totaled, your deductible is waived in this program.

  **Who might need it?** This coverage option has a similar upside to the basic Responsible Driver Plan. It might be a better option for you if the cost is right and you want to limit your out-of-pocket expenses on a future claim.
* ### Non-owner car insurance

  **[Non-owner car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/non-owner-car-insurance-where-to-buy-and-what-it-covers)** provides liability coverage for drivers who don’t own a car, but still regularly drive.

  **Who might need it?** It’s worth considering this type of coverage if you regularly use someone else’s car, like a friend’s car, company car or a rental. You may also want to get this type of coverage if you don’t often drive but need insurance to [restore your license](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/sr22-insurance) after a suspension.

#### Methodology

**Insurer complaints methodology**

NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

**Auto insurance ratings methodology**

NerdWallet’s auto insurance ratings reward companies for customer-first features and practices. Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints and discounts. Our “ease of use” category looks at factors such as website transparency and how easy it is to file a claim. Using our editorial discretion, we also consider customer satisfaction surveys. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our [editorial guidelines](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/nerdwallet-editorial-guidelines) and full [ratings methodology for auto insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/l/ratings-methodology-for-auto-insurance).

**Average rates methodology**

NerdWallet averaged rates based on public filings obtained by pricing analytics company Quadrant Information Services. We examined rates for men and women for all ZIP codes in any of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.

In our analysis, “good drivers” had no moving violations on record; a “good driving” discount was included for this profile. Our “good” and “poor” credit rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.

These are average rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider.

Sample drivers had the following coverage limits:

* $100,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person.
* $300,000 bodily injury liability coverage per crash.
* $50,000 property damage liability coverage per crash.
* $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per person.
* $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage per crash.
* Collision coverage with $1,000 deductible.
* Comprehensive coverage with $1,000 deductible.

We used the same assumptions for all other driver profiles, with the following exceptions:

* We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit. In states where credit isn’t taken into account, we only used rates for “good credit.”
* For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash costing $10,000 in property damage.
* For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken-driving violation.

We used a 2022 Toyota Camry LE in all cases and assumed 12,000 annual miles driven. We analyzed rates for drivers of the following ages: 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60 and 70.

**Auto insurance survey methodology**

The opt-in survey of 7,503 U.S. adults ages 18 and older was conducted online by Russell Research on behalf of NerdWallet in June and July 2024. Respondents were asked to rate one auto insurance brand they obtained or renewed a policy within the past 12 months, with at least some changes to the original policy. These brands were rated on overall satisfaction, overall value, online experience, trustworthiness, mobile app experience, claims experience and customer support on a scale of 1-100.

Only brands with 100 or more qualifying respondents are reported. Of those respondents: 300 were State Farm customers, 300 were Progressive customers, 300 were Allstate customers, 300 were GEICO customers, 100 were USAA customers, 157 were AAA customers, 100 were Liberty Mutual customers, 100 were American Family customers, 100 were Farmers customers, 100 were Travelers customers and 101 were Nationwide customers.
