Tesla [sells its own insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tesla-car-insurance#in-house "#in-house"), and its rates are very competitive for good drivers. It sets prices primarily using sensors onboard your Tesla, and ignores things like credit score, speeding tickets or claim history.
But that means your rates can change a lot from month to month, and the company gets lots of complaints from customers who aren't happy with the service they receive. It's also only currently available in  12 states.

*Tesla Insurance in California doesn't set rates using your Safety Score, as telematic insurance rates aren't permitted there.
Tesla's Safety Score works much like other [telematics car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/telematics "Telematics Car Insurance") like Progressive Snapshot. The Tesla app monitors your driving habits and assigns a score between 0 and 100, with most drivers getting an 80 or above.
