For example, having an address in the middle of tornado territory or hurricane area can drive the average rental insurance cost up compared to locations not in those areas. Also, increasing the limit of valuable jewelry or electronics or getting extra liability coverage will increase average [renters insurance](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/renters-insurance) costs. Keep in mind that liability coverage will help cover the costs associated with another person’s injury on and off your property, and for damage done to others. For example, say you throw a dinner party and one of your guests trips, falls and hurts their leg on an uneven surface in the apartment. Your liability coverage will help pay the medical bills needed for healing their leg.
