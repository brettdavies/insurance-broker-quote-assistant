Nearly [50% of California residents are renters](https://www.simplyinsurance.com/renters-insurance-statistics/), and if you are one of them, you need to know that if you rent, you will need a policy of your own if you want to protect your personal property. Getting[ renters insurance quotes online](https://www.simplyinsurance.com/compare-renters-insurance-quotes-online/) has never been this easy and the application process has never been faster. But with so many options out there how do you choose?
This blog post will help you find the most affordable renters insurance for your needs based on coverage amounts, premiums and customer service. [ ](https://go.simplyinsurance.com/view-best-renters-plans)
## How Much Is Renters Insurance In California? 
The **average cost of renters insurance in California is $16 per month or $192 per year**. Thus, the cost of coverage in California is slightly more expensive than the U.S. average of $187 per year at about $5 per year when renting an apartment or house.
### Who Has The Cheapest Renters Insurance In California? 
Lemonade has some of the best cheap renters insurance rates in California, and they offer one of the easiest and fastest ways to get renters insurance coverage.
However, renters should compare rates and policies with multiple companies to ensure they get the best deal for themselves.
With Lemonade, you can also bundle your homeowners insurance and very soon bundle auto insurance policies as well to get even lower rates on your coverage overall.
### What Factors Impact The Renters Insurance Premium?
The renters insurance cost in California will vary depending on several factors such as:
**Where you live -** Different cities in California will always have a different renters insurance rate, depending on environmental risks, such as fire and crime. If your home or apartment has security cameras or you live in a gated community, this could also reduce your cost.
**Your deductible -** A higher deductible usually means lower monthly payments. Would you instead pay less monthly and more at once, or would you instead pay more monthly and a lower deductible if you need to use your coverage? It depends on what is best for your budget and your personal belongings.
**How much coverage you need -** What items are you covering? If your belongings have a value that exceeds the minimum coverage, you might want to increase the limit on your renters insurance policies. However, such a change might increase the cost of your renters' insurance. [ ](https://go.simplyinsurance.com/choose-good-sam-rv)
## What Does Renters Insurance Cover In California? 
In California, **renters insurance, also called personal property insurance, covers** everything you own that’s portable, temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable, and injuries sustained by other people at your residence.
Coverage options include:
  * Clothing Computers
  * Other electronics Furniture
  * Appliances Jewelry (up to a limit)
  * Malicious activities - theft, vandalism, riots
  * Accidents - fire, smoke damage, vehicle impact, or water damage from appliances
  * Weather – damage from the weight of snow, frozen pipes, lightning, or windstorms.


More specifically, a renters policy typically covers:
#### Personal Property Coverage
Personal property coverage means that if something happens to your belongings, the insurance company will give you money to replace them at either cost or current value (depending on your type of policy).
#### Personal Liability
Personal liability insurance will cover you if someone decides to sue you after getting hurt at your house. The insurance company will pay the legal costs and any settlement to the injured party. 
#### Medical Payments
Medical expenses go hand in hand with personal liability protection. So, for example, if someone sues you because they hurt themselves at your house, this coverage will take care of their medical bills.
#### Loss Of Use (also called Additional Living Expenses - ALE)
Loss of use coverage means that if something happens to your home and cannot live there because of the damage, your insurance company will reimburse your living costs.
### What Does Renters Insurance Not Cover In California? 
Renters Insurance usually will not cover anything outside your dwelling and might not cover property damage for all perils. Below is a list of a few things usually not covered on your renters' policy:
  * **Bed bugs and pests** - The majority of renter's insurance policies will not cover damages associated with bed bugs, with limited exceptions. Along with other pests, such as rodents, they are considered a maintenance issue and are therefore ineligible for coverage under your typical renter's policy.
  * **Earthquake and flood damage** - Renters coverage does not usually include earthquake or flood damage. Still, if you live in a high-risk area and can't get earthquake or flood coverage through your renters policy, you'll need to purchase an additional policy for those perils. But, again, speak with your renters insurance company about these options, as they're often available to add-on.
  * **Car theft or damage** - If you own a car, the renter’s policy will not cover damage or theft. Your best option is to purchase a comprehensive insurance package that also protects your vehicle from collisions and weather-related damage. This way, your auto and renters insurance can work in tandem.


### Will Renters Insurance Cover My Roommate In California?
With such high housing costs, many California residents have roommates to offset expenses. 
However, **renters insurance does not cover any damage costs associated with your roommate's belongings unless they are listed on the policy** , and you split the cost of renters insurance.
[Renters insurance will cover](https://www.simplyinsurance.com/best-renters-insurance-san-diego/) anyone listed on the policy. Thus, if your roommate’s name is on the policy, they have coverage.
However, we would not recommend adding roommates unless they are related or a spouse. Adding a non-relative to your policy may save you some money, but it will split coverage among all those assigned to the policy.
So if your policy covers up to $20,000 in damage, you and your roommate would only be covered for up to $10,000 each.[](https://go.simplyinsurance.com/view-best-pet-plans)

**Is renter's insurance worth it?**
Yes, renters insurance is worth it because it protects your possessions and has other benefits such as paying for some personal property losses, such as the cost of repairing or replacing the furniture that is damaged by fire from a lightning strike. 
**What is a reasonable renters insurance rate?**
The average renters insurance cost in the United States is $168 per year or about $14 per month. This estimate is based on a policy for a hypothetical 30-year-old tenant with $30,000 in personal property coverage, $100,000 in liability coverage, and a $500 deductible. If you can get your monthly premiums as close as possible to your state’s average, that is a good renters insurance rate.
