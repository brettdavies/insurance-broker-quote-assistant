# Roof claim with State Farm

I have never filed a roof claim or any claim for that matter until recently. We had two pretty severe hail and wind storms blow through and after all of the storm chasers left, I called a few reputable roofing companies and both asked me who my carrier was. When I said State Farm, they both said that my claim process, before even looking at the roof, will be difficult as State Farm tends to deny, minimize, or underpay claims. Both looked at my roof and said the same thing, extensive hail damage with over 18 "dings" per square and the metal vents and gutters were all dinged pretty badly. The one guy said that most carriers want to see 8 dings per square, but State Farm tends to want to see at least 10. The adjustor came out and met with my roof guy, and my guy said the adjustor noted even more damage than him and this was a pretty text book claim for hail damage roof replacement. State Farm called me to say that they were working on my claim and that my connected patio would not be covered as the damage from what she said was due to "wear and tear" but she was still looking at everything but felt she would be able to authorize "some repairs". This already sounds nickel and dime to me. I have a 1% deductible meaning I am going to have to pay roughly 6500 right off the bat for my deductible and I am not sure how a connected roof could be damaged due to wear and tear but the rest of the roof is hail damage? Also my roofer said that he would come to let them know that the partial replacement would not meet code requirements in my county. Anybody else have a similar experience with State Farm or had a similar issue? I found it upsetting that both roofers called out State Farm, especially because over the last four years they raised my rates 20%, 20%, 15%, 15%, and another 400 per year because we had a pool installed.
