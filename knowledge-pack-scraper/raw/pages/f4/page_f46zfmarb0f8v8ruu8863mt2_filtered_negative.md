This is the State Farm strategy. Deny, deflect, delay.
Within 1000 feet of my house there are about 15 homes that all got new roofs last summer/fall from insurance due to hail, including the neighbor to the left of me, and across the street.
Somehow... my roof is just fine.
What are the odds?
In fact, all of the homes in my neighborhood who have State Farm insurance were magically spared from the hail damage. /s

Deny, deflect, delay. State Farm can be the worst in straight up telling you there’s absolutely no damage without explanation

<shrug> We had a hail damaged roof claim a couple of years ago with SF. Ignored all of the door knockers, SF's estimator came out, got a handwritten quote from a highly respected local roofer and got it done. Paperwork.... I don't care for the claim process management itself, but in the end, everything was covered. Roofs all over town were damaged, and some were waiting a year for replacement.

On 3 occasions SF has come through. Including hail roof and auto theft. I've thought they are not cheap, so that's the value, less BS...hope it works out for you.

* its all about cost control and its not just State Farm....we had severe hail storm last year and easily 10,000 roofs were replaced in my immediate area and town. My own roof I was goign to have it reroof any way due to age and simply had to ignore the 20+ door knockers that hit my house to make insurance claim
* everyone's premiums are going up as the HOI industry has had huge payouts due ti impact of climate change and storms, fires, floods and hurricane and THEY KNOW it will only grow worse. Be glad you are not in Florida.

It’s not always that they are denying that there is damage. With 1% and 2% deductibles many times it is that the damage does not exceed the deductible. “Soft metals” like gutters will be the first to show hail damage. They are also the cheapest to replace. Get a second opinion from another roofer. Make sure the roofers know your deductible and/or the damage exceeds the deductible. If another roofer also agrees that an entire roof replacement is needed, then have them take multiple pictures. Ask your agents office upload them to the claim and ask them to advocate for you and request a second adjuster come out and do an estimate.
Also it’s normal for homeowners policies to increase in premium each year due to the dwelling coverage amount increasing each year. It’s all about the cost it would take to rebuild your home from the ground up with today’s materials. You can always talk with your agent to review the replacement cost estimate for your home.

This all makes sense, and my roofer was extremely thorough. Took pictures of all the soft metals, roof vents, etc. tons of hail damage. The replacement cost of my house is based on the tax appraisal value and that hasn’t changed in 4 years. State Farm has just blanket raised rates for everyone across the board because of their losses. They had a net profit of 5.3 billion dollars last year but they sought to recoup the 6 billion in losses from the year prior. My taxes haven’t increased, my appraised value hasn’t increased, but each and every year my homeowners policy increases. Aside from that, they have had all of this in hand since April 12th, I was told a week ago that they would be done with their review by last Friday. Meanwhile I have open holes in my roof from the storm damage and it’s rained multiple times since the claim was filed. They certainly aren’t in any rush to get the claim finished and I’m sure that there will be jockeying back and forth to get them to cover what they should be covering. The roofers I had come out, like I said, stated that All State and State Farm were by far the worst insurance companies to work with regarding claims. We shall see.

I know this thread is a bit older, but are there any updates concerning this roof claim with State Farm? I’m interested in seeing if you have had any fair and reasonable responses or outcomes from corporate since you filed your claim.
I too am currently dealing with a similar claim on my home that unfortunately may result in me getting a lawyer for a bad faith lawsuit.

Well not sure it'll be much help but State Farm ended up covering my entire roof after some jockeying back and forth with my roofer. I will say my roofer was a bad ass. He knew the town codes, building codes, etc. and was able to use the town codes to get State Farm to cover everything.

Where are you located? I’m in Sumner County in middle Tennessee and SF adjuster said we only have 15 missing shingles and no hail or wind damage, which is strange because we have several roof leaks in our home, huge window that is leaking from the storms. I’ve requested a new adjuster (the adjuster that came was in his 20’s) senior adjuster and a manager to contact me and was denied that. Our house was built in 2007 original roof.

Cost-effective home insulation methods
Insulating your home can significantly reduce energy costs and improve comfort. Here are some cost-effective methods and tips from Redditors on how to achieve this:
### Attic Insulation
* **Blown-in Cellulose**: This is often recommended for its affordability and ease of installation. ["Blown insulation is probably the cheapest. Material and a blower rental is not terrible."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4piwf5/)
* **DIY Installation**: You can rent the necessary equipment from big box stores and do it yourself to save on labor costs. ["You can get the stuff at the big box stores and they usually give you a free machine rental."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
* **Cross-Hatched Method**: For better R-value, consider laying insulation in a cross-hatched pattern. ["For example you could put R3 in between the ceiling joists, then lay R4 perpendicular covering the joists."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7tijov/)
### Wall Insulation
* **Blown-in Cellulose**: If you have existing walls, blowing in cellulose is a good option. ["You can blow in cellulose insulation behind drywall but you will need the right machine and cut a billion holes."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
* **Injection Foam**: This is another method for insulating walls without removing drywall. ["For the walls, your best bet is probably injection foam."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmn2rx/)
### Crawl Space Insulation
* **Vapor Barrier and Foam Boards**: Covering the crawl space with a vapor barrier and attaching foam boards to the perimeter can significantly improve insulation. ["Cover the perimeter beam from the inside with like 10 mil vapor barrier."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)
* **Encapsulation**: This involves sealing the crawl space to prevent moisture and air infiltration. ["Tape everything together so it's watertight, like turning the space into a bath tub."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)
### General Tips
* **Air Sealing**: Before adding insulation, make sure to seal any air gaps. ["Start with doing a complete air seal and you'll be amazed at how much that will help."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pp4s1/)
* **Thermal Imaging**: Use a thermal camera to identify heat loss areas. ["See if your local library has 'energy efficiency kits' or anything similar - ours included a thermal camera."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7t7y5q/)
* **Professional Help**: Sometimes, hiring a professional can be cheaper in the long run due to their access to bulk materials and efficient installation methods. ["Hire a company that only does insulation. They have access to much more product and it will be cheaper installed then you can buy it for at the box stores."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1364vzq/comment/jimuij1/)
