Umbrella insurance—a form of extra liability insurance—helps to protect the insured from major claims and lawsuits, offering an additional layer of security over existing policies such as auto or homeowners insurance. Annual premiums can start as low as $300-$400 per year for $2 to $3 million in coverage, particularly when bundled with other policies.

For high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), determining the right amount of umbrella coverage—and whether the umbrella insurance cost is justified— can be challenging.

## What Does Umbrella Insurance Cover?

[Umbrella insurance](https://www.longangle.com/blog/umbrella-insurance-for-high-net-worth) covers not only the policyholder but also other members of the household, providing liability protection for a variety of incidents, including:

* Property damage
* Personal injury
* Some lawsuits
* Personal liability
* Landlord liability

Typically, umbrella insurance kicks in when the liability coverage from other policies is exhausted.

Many high-net-worth individuals find umbrella insurance to be an affordable and helpful way to mitigate financial risks. However, the cost of umbrella insurance varies widely based on factors such as location, bundled services, risk profile, and provider.

## How Much Umbrella Coverage Is Enough?

Some high-net-worth individuals believe that one’s umbrella coverage should roughly match their net worth. However, this rule is not universally accepted and there isn’t a direct 1-to-1 tie between net worth and umbrella coverage. For instance, having $5 million in assets doesn't necessarily translate to carrying $5 million in coverage, as larger settlements or judgments could exceed that amount.

Instead, the level of umbrella insurance should be based on personal risk exposure. Some opt for lower coverage ($1 to $3 million) if they lead a low-risk lifestyle, while others may combine lower coverage with asset protection strategies, such as irrevocable trusts. Many factors can increase someone’s risk profile; for example, owning rental properties, especially outside an LLC, can increase liability exposure and may warrant additional coverage.

Most umbrella insurance plans start at around $1 million in coverage, but high-net-worth individuals might want more extensive policies. While the specific amount of coverage needed is a personal decision, a common recommendation is to carry between $5 million to $10 million in umbrella insurance. Annual premiums for these policies can vary widely, from as low as $600 for $5 million coverage with some providers to $1,318 for $10 million with others.

This range is sufficient for most people, covering the risk of significant lawsuits without being overly burdensome. However, some high-net-worth individuals choose even higher limits. For example, State Farm has been reported to offer umbrella policies up to $15 million, and other high-net-worth-focused insurers like Chubb provide similarly high-limit options.

Still, very few people need more than $10 million in umbrella insurance coverage since personal injury and liability judgments rarely exceed that amount (and most cases are adequately covered by $2 million to $5 million). However, in certain professions or situations (e.g., surgeons or people engaging in highly risky activities), higher limits may be advisable.

When determining coverage, consider factors such as total assets, potential risks (including rental properties or teenage drivers), and lifestyle factors that might increase liability exposure.

Umbrella insurance helps ensure a smooth settlement process since insurance companies tend to settle within coverage limits rather than risk higher judgments. However, if an insurance company chooses to go to trial and loses, they are responsible for the full amount, even if it exceeds the policy limits.

Ultimately, determining the amount of umbrella insurance needed depends on an individual’s assets, liabilities, and risk exposure. For those who own rental properties, have family members to protect, or frequently engage in activities that carry inherent risks, higher coverage may be advisable.

The chart below shows a breakdown of umbrella insurance coverage amounts among a group of high-net-worth individuals. None of the participants had policies exceeding $15 million in coverage.

## How Much Does Umbrella Insurance Cost?

Umbrella insurance costs vary significantly based on the provider, location, bundled services, and personal circumstances. On the low end, an umbrella insurance policy could cost just around $200 a year. For a $10 million policy, average umbrella insurance costs are between $1,500 and $2,500 annually.

Those whobundle auto and homeowners insurance with the same provider can get discounts. Also, be sure to coordinate coverage amounts across policies to ensure that the umbrella insurance kicks in when it is needed.

It is important to shop around and get quotes from multiple providers. While some have success bundling their insurance with one company, others found that brokers could help secure better deals by shopping across different insurers.

## Factors That Influence Umbrella Insurance Cost

Several factors can significantly impact the price of umbrella insurance, including:

* **Location**: Pricing often varies by state due to insurance regulations. For example, some states don’t allow credit scores to be considered when determining premiums, which can impact pricing for high-net-worth individuals.
* **Bundling**: Bundling an umbrella policy with other forms of insurance, such as auto and homeowners coverage, can open the door to discounted rates.
* **Risk Factors**: Factors such as owning rental properties, having teenage drivers in the household, and previous accident history can increase the cost of coverage.
* **Telematics:** Some insurers now offer usage-based insurance options for auto policies using telematics. When bundled, this can potentially affect umbrella policy rates.
* **Policy Details**: Umbrella insurance policies vary widely in terms of what they cover. Some policies may include additional protections such as international travel coverage or uninsured motorist protection, while others don't. Review coverage details carefully and consider the specific risks that take priority, as these differences can significantly impact both cost and value.

## Popular Umbrella Insurance Providers

These are some of the top umbrella insurance providers among high-net-worth individuals:

* **State Farm**: HNWIs report affordable rates and reliable service with State Farm.
* **Chubb**: Known for catering to HNWIs, Chubb is a popular choice among those seeking high-value umbrella insurance. Chubb offers comprehensive worldwide coverage, including rental cars, jewelry, and photography equipment.
* **Berkeley One**: A lesser-known provider, Berkeley One is a reputable option that focuses on higher-end clients.
* **RLI**: With RLI, coverage ranges from $1 million to $5 million, with premiums generally less than $1,000 a year.
* **USAA**: USAA can be an affordable option, particularly for those with military ties.
* **Progressive and GEICO:** Both of these providers offer competitive rates but may have lower coverage limits.
* **AIG:** Similar to Chubb, AIG is another provider catering to high-net-worth clients.

## Is Umbrella Insurance Worth It?

For many high-net-worth individuals, theumbrella insurancecost is low enough to make it worth the peace of mind it provides. It is also particularly helpful for those who own and manage rental properties and those with families.

Bundling umbrella insurance with other policies can lead to discounts and helps ensure that coverage limits are coordinated across policies, preventing potential gaps in protection.

While insurance choices are highly personal, umbrella insurance is generally a good investment for high-net-worth individuals.

If cost is a concern, consider working with an insurance broker. An insurance broker can help high-net-worth individuals get the best insurance rates, especially when dealing with more complex insurance needs. Brokers are aware of the nuanced differences between umbrella policies and can often secure better rates than what is available on the open market by comparing quotes across multiple insurers and finding the best combination of price and coverage.

In addition to umbrella insurance, using irrevocable trusts or other [estate planning](https://www.longangle.com/blog/high-net-worth-estate-planning) tools can protect assets from large settlements. These strategies make it difficult for plaintiffs to collect beyond the insured amount.

## Finding the Best Umbrella Insurance Cost

For high-net-worth individuals, umbrella insurance provides an extra layer of protection against liability risks that exceed the coverage limits of standard insurance policies. However, with the cost of umbrella insurance varying significantly, it is crucial to:

* Shop around and get quotes from multiple providers.
* Consider using an insurance broker to help navigate the options.
* Review policy details carefully to ensure comprehensive coverage.
* Be mindful of how factors such as rental properties, teenage drivers, and accident history can impact premiums.

Securing the right umbrella insurance policy requires balancing cost, coverage, and peace of mind. As the risk landscape evolves, high-net-worth individuals should stay informed about emerging trends that may impact their insurance needs. As of 2024, factors such as increased cyber liability risks, climate change impacts, and the rise of the gig economy are influencing insurance offerings and coverage requirements. These evolving risks may necessitate adjustments to coverage levels or the addition of specialized policy riders to ensure comprehensive protection.
