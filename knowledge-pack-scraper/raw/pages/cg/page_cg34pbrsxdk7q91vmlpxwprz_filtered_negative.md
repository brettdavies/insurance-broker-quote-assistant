Acts of vandalism and other types of criminal mischief are often done when there are few people in the area. As such, [law enforcement](https://www.omaralawgroup.com/blog/fleeing-law-enforcement-officers-in-florida/) often gets it wrong and charges the wrong person for the crime. It is important to remember that a charge is not a conviction. To secure a conviction for criminal mischief, the prosecution must prove certain elements of their case. These include:
When the property damage is valued between $200 and $1,000, the offense is classified as a first-degree misdemeanor. A conviction for this type of charge is punishable by up to one year in jail. Charges that involve property damage valued at $1,000 or more are considered [third-degree felonies](https://www.omaralawgroup.com/orlando-criminal-defense-lawyer/felony-lawyer/). The most serious of criminal mischief crimes, a conviction can result in up to five years in prison.
If you have been charged with criminal mischief, our[ Orlando criminal lawyer](https://www.omaralawgroup.com/orlando-criminal-defense-lawyer/) at **O’Mara Law Group** can help you retain your freedom.
