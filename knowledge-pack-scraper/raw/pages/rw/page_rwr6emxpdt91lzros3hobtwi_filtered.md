# How to create a home inventory

Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)

A home inventory can help expedite the insurance claims process after theft, damage or loss.

Imagine needing to list every possession in your home or apartment, along with each item's worth after your belongings have been stolen or destroyed in a [hurricane](/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-after-a-hurricane), [tornado](/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-in-a-tornado), [wildfire](/simple-insights/residence/wildfire-safety-tips) or other natural disaster. That task may seem impossible, so it may be helpful to make the list before you need it.

## Why do I need an inventory of my home or apartment?

A home inventory can be an excellent way to help make [home insurance](/insurance/homeowners) and [renters insurance](/insurance/renters) [coverage decisions](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-are-all-the-different-types-of-insurance "What are the different types of insurance") and expedite the [claims process](/claims). Recording your [insurable assets](/simple-insights/financial/types-of-personal-assets) can help you settle a covered loss or claim, verify tax-deductible property losses and determine the insurance coverage amount you need. A home inventory list can also assist you with estate planning or dividing possessions during life changes, such as a [divorce](/simple-insights/financial/how-to-prepare-for-a-divorce).

## How do I create a home inventory?

The first step is to decide on what type of inventory would be easiest for you to create. A home inventory can be as simple as a list of all your possessions or a visual record of each item, but an effective home inventory will typically include both for added security. Today, there are even digital tools to help maintain the list.

* **Written inventory** — a comprehensive home inventory list catalogs your belongings. Try to include the item description (make, model and serial number, if applicable), value, where you bought it and the purchase date. You can create your list using a spreadsheet or fill out a [home inventory checklist](/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/pdf/V-home_inventory_checklist.pdf) to help you get started.
* **Digital inventory** — if you have an iPhone or Android phone, there are apps you can download, some of which are free. These digital home inventory apps usually allow you to record a photograph of the item along with the description, value and purchase date.
* **Visual record** — a visual record of your possessions can help show proof of ownership. This can be accomplished with a video walk-through of your home or through a series of photographs along with written descriptions.

Once you decide on the type of home inventory you want to create, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/how-create-home-inventory), there are some simple steps you can take to start the process. Also, consider obtaining [appraisals for your most valuable possessions](/simple-insights/residence/how-to-appraise-and-insure-collectibles), such as antiques, art, jewelry, collectibles and electronic equipment. If you have any questions about which items may be covered by your policy, [contact your insurance agent](/agent/).

* **Record possessions if you pack for a move** — when [moving to a new apartment or home](/simple-insights/residence/packing-tips-for-moving), take some extra time to record the belongings in each room.
* **Pick one area at a time to record** — you could start with a hall closet or small kitchen cabinet. Then, after capturing your belongings, move on to the next space.
* **Document recent purchases** — get into the habit of recording new purchases. Along with the record, try to store sales receipts and appraisals (including the appraiser's name and address) to help verify the value of each item.
* **Record important information** — provide a detailed description by listing where you purchased the item, date of purchase, the make and model and the amount you paid. Include the serial number if the item has one.
* **List the number of each clothing type** — for example, "three black dress pants, two white button-down shirts, one pair of blue sneakers…" Most importantly, document all valuables in detail.
* **Include stored items as well** — these could include items kept in your basement, attic, garage, [detached structures](/simple-insights/residence/backyard-structures-and-home-insurance) or a self-storage unit.

## A real-life example of why a home inventory is important

When you experience a catastrophic event that completely burned your house, you know better than anybody the importance of having a home inventory for insurance purposes (and how to complete one): documenting the things you own can help make your insurance claim easier if your residence is destroyed. In the following video, you’ll meet Mary Knapp, a survivor of the Jesusita Fire of 2009 in Santa Barbara, CA, and Irene Henry, her State Farm® agent.

## Home Inventory: How To Create One

00:02 [Music]

00:16 [Irene]: Hi, I'm Irene Henry. I'm here today in Santa Barbara on Stearns Wharf. I have the lovely mountains in the background and as you know it's a high fire area.

00:25 [Music]

00:29 [Irene]: We are at a Santa Barbara fire station, and one of the things that's really important to do is doing an updated or do one if you've never done it — an inventory of the contents of your home. Whether it's taking pictures or video with your smartphone or simply writing down your inventory lists — so if and when you have a claim, you have documented proof of the items that you own. It's very important — it will make your claim smoother and easier to process.

00:56 [Music]

01:01 [Irene]: The fire came across from Mission Canyon — the Jesusita Fire — and it jumped over here. And when it came over this way, this entire house burnt, the garage, all of this was gone.

01:12 [Music]

01:19 [Irene knocks on door]

01:22 [Mary]: Hey!

01:24 [Irene]: Hey, good to see you!

01:29 [Irene]: And you know why this inventory is so important. Because we have kind of crossed this bridge.

01:33 [Mary]: Yes.

01:34 [Irene]: With you having lost your home. Paper is a good way to do it, but videoing it with your smartphone these days — very simple,very easy.

01:41 [Music]

01:50 [Irene]: I know you have a lot of family pieces from all over the world.

01:51 [Mary]: Yeah, and sometimes I prefer a picture to a video. Good point.

01:56 [Irene]: I think opening the drawers and cabinets really triggers your mind into silverware, plates, pots and pans — there is just so much.

02:05 [Mary]: In the kitchen, especially, you could never write it down.

02:09 [Music]

02:15 [Irene]: Let's definitely video because they are one of a kind.

02:19 [Music]

02:21 [Irene]: You need to have your important files ready to go or really easily accessible.

02:25 [Mary]: I agree.

02:26 [Irene]: Ready to go.

02:27 [Mary]: Yeah, ready to go. Take the backup drive. It's in the cloud, but this is a lot easier to have and it feels good to have it with you.

02:36 [Mary]: So in 1978, my husband having graduated from UCSB, the local school here — I wanted to stay, so he purchased some land and started building the house. We moved in, in the 80s. And then May 7th hit, 2009, and the Jesusita Fire went through our canyon. Well, I was actually nearby at a friend's house and I started hearing sirens and helicopters. We thought, oh, they're gonna get this out but we're leaving anyway. It's never been our intention to ever stay.

03:13 [Mary]: Because we're so well insured, we were able to comfort the children by saying, "here you go, go get what you need," and within I think three months we were already with building permit in hand. We just had a positive experience. We knew where State Farm was, where checks were being cut for immediate expenses and life was great. We were gonna be able to survive.

03:38 [Mary]: Um, we had one girl finishing high school, one in college. So during the rebuild, we had two in college and family living with us, building the house… We were able to take our time and move from our rented house (that State Farm was taking care of) into our new home. I was able to have furniture delivered to the new home while still being in the rented house. Everything was, was unbelievable — it was just so smooth.

04:06 [Mary]: Um, and that's being prepared thanks to Irene. And we're able to communicate with Irene. When I say "Hey, I don't understand this," she explains it.

04:15 [Music]

## How should I store my home inventory?

Don't let your home inventory become part of a property loss. Whichever inventory method you choose, it's important to [keep a copy of your property checklist in a fireproof safe](/simple-insights/residence/home-safes-for-protection), safety deposit box or digitally in the cloud. You can even email your inventory to your insurance agent. Sending the list may have the added value of allowing your inventory to be reviewed by your agent to see if you need extra home or [renters coverage](/simple-insights/residence/how-much-renters-insurance-do-i-need) or to add a [personal articles insurance policy](/insurance/personal-articles-policy). To help maintain an accurate inventory list, update it annually or anytime you move. This might help save you time and stress in the future if you experience a loss.

#### How to submit a content inventory list?

We are dedicated to help you recover your losses quickly and efficiently. If you have a State Farm® claim that involves significant personal property damage, you can use [content inventory aids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYrCEDM92g "State Farm Claims Process: Contents Inventory Aids") we have available to guide you during your loss recovery.

You can access these aids in 3 different ways:

* [Claims Hub](/claims "State Farm claims center")
* [Homeowners forms](/claims/home-and-property/homeowner-forms "Personal property inventory tools") on our website
* By contacting your [claim handler](/customer-care/contact-us "State Farm - contact us")

Once complete, your damaged personal property list can be sent to us via claims hub and/or email. Adjustments and additions to your inventory can also be made after submission.
