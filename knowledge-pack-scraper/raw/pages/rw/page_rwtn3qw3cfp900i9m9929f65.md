###  American Family 
![American Family](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/06/06023505/american-family.png?width=300&fit=cover&format=webp)
#### Average bundling discount
18% 
#### Auto insurance complaint level
Very low 
#### Home insurance complaint level
Very low 
###  Why it’s the best 
American Family offers a solid bundling discount for home and auto insurance and has a very low rate of complaints about both types of coverage. Its auto insurance premiums are a bit higher than those of other insurers we evaluated, but the bundling discount can help offset some of the cost.

## Who has the cheapest home and auto insurance bundle?
[Auto-Owners](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/auto-owners-car-insurance-review/) has the cheapest option to bundle [homeowners insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/home-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) and [auto insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/best-auto-insurance/).

When shopping around for home and auto insurance bundles, it’s important to do the math on the actual savings amount, versus focusing simply on the bundling discount percentage. The biggest bundling discount may not always mean the lowest overall rates. 
For instance, with Auto-Owners, the average bundling discount is 10%, much less than the 23% offered by State Farm. However, the final price for combined coverage is the lowest among the companies we compared. 
Shopping around can help you find the best homeowners insurance and auto insurance bundle for you based on not only multi-policy or bundling discounts but also on other factors, like the price of your home, where you live, the car you drive, and your credit and driving history.

## Pros and cons of bundling home and auto insurance
To bundle home and auto insurance or not to bundle? There are advantages and disadvantages to bundling.
**You might consider bundling if you:**
  * Want to save money on home and auto insurance.
  * Would like to simplify your insurance billing and combine policies with a single company.
  * Are hoping to take advantage of other discounts or incentives with a new insurance company.


On the other hand, it’s important to do your research to make sure bundling is a good option. 
Bundling your home and [car insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/best-auto-insurance/) might not guarantee that you’ll save a substantial amount of money. That’s especially true if your current insurance company doesn’t offer the most competitive rates or if you’re switching to one that charges higher rates despite a competitive bundling offer. As our analysis shows, bigger discounts don’t always translate to more savings. 
Bundling could also work against you if you’re giving up certain coverages or benefits by moving to a new insurer. For example, you might be in for a surprise if you switch homeowners insurance policies only to find out that your new company has a banned dog list or doesn’t offer guaranteed replacement coverage. 
Taking time to compare all of the options can help you decide whether it makes sense to bundle home and auto insurance and which company is the best choice for you.
## How to save money when bundling home and auto insurance
To save money when bundling home and auto insurance, start by evaluating your current coverage, including:
  * How much you’re paying for home and auto insurance now.
  * The amount of coverage you have with each policy.
  * What discounts you’re currently enjoying.
  * How your driving, claims and credit history may affect your insurance rates with a new company.


This information can serve as a framework as you shop around and compare bundling discounts. Getting multiple quotes can give you a general idea of how much you’ll pay and some numbers to work with so you have an idea of how much you’re likely to save. 
Also, remember to look beyond bundling discounts for other opportunities to save. Insurers can offer a variety of discounts for home and auto insurance, including new home discounts, first-time customer discounts and safe driver discounts. Discounts should help reduce overall costs.

Methodology
Our insurance experts evaluated top home and auto insurance companies to determine which offer the best home and auto bundles. We evaluated each insurer based on its average bundling discount, home and auto coverage rates and rate of consumer complaints. All discount and rate data used in our analysis are from [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
Each insurance company was eligible for up to 100 points for each of the following factors:
**Bundling discount:** 20 points. The primary benefit of bundling your home and auto insurance is the multi-policy savings many insurers extend when you purchase more than one insurance product. We examined bundling discounts for each insurer to determine which offered the highest percentage of savings to customers who purchase both a home and auto insurance policy through the same insurer.
**Auto insurance rates:** 30 points. Discounts alone aren’t enough to determine which company offers the best auto and home bundling deal. We collected and compared average rates from insurers to provide a better picture of which home and auto insurance bundles are the best.
Rates are based on a 40-year-old female classified as a good driver — one without speeding tickets or traffic accidents on her record. Coverage rates reflect those for a Toyota RAV4 with the following:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


**Home insurance rates:** 30 points. Like auto insurance rates, a company’s home insurance rates play an important role in determining which insurance companies offer the best overall bundling offer. We collected and analyzed average rates offered by top insurers for a standard homeowners insurance policy that includes $350,000 in dwelling coverage.
**Auto insurance complaints:** 10 points. We used complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Each state’s department of insurance logs and monitors complaints against companies. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and denials.
**Home insurance complaints:** 10 points. We used complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Each state’s department of insurance is in charge of logging and monitoring complaints against the companies that operate in their states. Most home insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and handling of the claim.

## Bundling home and auto FAQs
What does it mean to bundle home and auto insurance?
Bundling [home insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/home-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) and [auto insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/best-auto-insurance/) means buying both types of coverage from the same insurance company. Many insurers reward customers who buy both policies from them with a multi-policy or “bundling” discount, which can lower your insurance costs. Bundling can also make it easier to manage your policies. 
Bundling discounts aren’t limited to homeowners and auto insurance, however. Insurers often extend bundling discounts to other types of coverage, including [renters insurance](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/renters-insurance/best-renters-insurance/), boat insurance and motorcycle insurance.
Is it cheaper to combine car and home insurance?
It can be cheaper to bundle home and auto insurance if you’re moving to an insurance company that charges lower premiums or offers a sizable discount. In addition to bundling discounts, you may qualify for other discounts for safe driving or going a set period of time without a claim. 
Why do insurance companies want you to bundle?
Insurance companies use bundling as a way to attract new customers. For example, if you see that you might be able to save 20% on your home and auto insurance with Company B, that could be a good reason to move your policy from Company A. You can save money while Company B gets to collect premiums from you each month. It may also be cheaper for insurance companies to service one person under multiple policies than multiple people with only one policy, which is a reason it helps customers save as well. 
How much do you save with insurance bundling?
The average annual savings for bundling is 14%, but some insurers we reviewed offered up to a 23% savings to bundle home and auto insurance. Your actual savings will depend on what’s included in your home and auto insurance coverage, how much you pay for premiums and which company you’re bundling your policies with.
