The Insurance Marketing Coalition Limited (IMC) is a non-profit professional association aimed at promoting ethical and compliant marketing practices in the health insurance industry. Its members include insurance companies, advertising and marketing organizations, and technology firms.

The IMC and its members are committed to educating Americans and helping them make informed decisions when it comes to healthcare and Medicare coverage.

## **History of Insurance Marketing Coalition**

The IMC was launched in November 2023 during the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Fall National Meeting in Orlando, Florida. Its goal was to align lead generators with industry best practices and regulatory compliance.

The organization was founded by Mark Seghers, chief executive and co-founder of Inspire Health Tech, and Shaun Greene, principal at Hoplite Insurance Services. Both remain with the coalition as board members.

In a LinkedIn post, Seghers revealed that the proposed changes by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on how Medicare is sold and marketed prompted the IMC’s formation. He added that the organization had the backing of about 30 Medicare leaders and with their help, it would ensure “the ethical and lawful generation and handling of insurance leads.”

## **What does the Insurance Marketing Coalition do?**

The IMC aims to ensure that marketing efforts within the [Medicare and health insurance sector](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/guides/affordable-health-insurance-everything-you-need-to-know-430050.aspx) are transparent and legally compliant. Marketing activities must also prioritize the consumers’ best interests. On its website, the organization lists some of its contributions to the industry:

* in 2022 alone, the IMC enrolled more than a million beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans, giving many senior-aged Americans [access to comprehensive health plans](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/guides/health-insurance-plans-common-types-and-their-benefits-429116.aspx)

* advertising and marketing member firms help connect beneficiaries with insurance agents and brokers, who, in turn, provide them with personalized guidance in finding the right coverage

* member tech firms give insurance agents, brokers, and marketers access to digital platforms and other support services to make the insurance-buying process more transparent and efficient

* IMC members help educate consumers about the benefits of having health coverage through various media and speaking engagements

## **Insurance Marketing Coalition in the news**

The IMC was in the news recently because of a case it brought against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The case centered on the conditions on how companies get permission before making robocalls.

*Insurance Marketing Coalition Ltd. v. FCC, et al., [No. 24-10277](https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202410277.pdf) (Eleventh Circuit)* involved the TCPA, which says that companies must get “prior express consent” before robocalling a potential customer. In 2012, the FCC required that permission be in writing for marketing or sales calls.

In 2023, the FCC added new restrictions to what “consent” means:

* customers can only give consent to one company at a time

* the subject of the calls must be “logically and topically” related to the interaction that led the customer to give consent – this means that if a client clicked “yes” to get health insurance quotes, they shouldn’t get calls about unrelated products like car insurance deals

The IMC believed that the new rules went too far. The coalition argued that the FCC didn’t have the legal authority to change what “consent” means. It also said that the commission was overreaching by adding conditions that the original law didn’t require.

In the end, the court sided with the IMC. The court ruled that “prior express consent” should be taken in its usual meaning – that someone clearly agreed ahead of time to be contacted. It also said that the FCC’s new rules changed the basic meaning too much. Because of this, the court cancelled the FCC’s additional requirements.

The IMC’s webinar about the court decision can be viewed on its website.
