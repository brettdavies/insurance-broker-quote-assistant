Car insurance quotes from USAA are also cheaper for a liability-only policy. At $33 per month, a policy from USAA is half the cost of coverage from Progressive. It's also $31 per month cheaper than the [national average](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-insurance "Average Cost of Car Insurance").
**Most drivers should consider[full coverage insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest \(and Best\) Full Coverage Car Insurance"), which protects your vehicle.** If you have a car loan or lease, your lender will typically require you to have full coverage insurance.
Liability-only car insurance has the [minimum amount of insurance required to drive legally in your state](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). However, the low coverage limits may not provide enough protection if you're in a serious accident.
