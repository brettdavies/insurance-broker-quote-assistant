# Is it very rare to have a separate Umbrella Insurance from auto insurance? Are there disadvantages of getting auto insurance from Umbrella Insurance companies like CinFin or Chubb that don't specialize in auto insurance?

[Need Advice](/r/fatFIRE/?f=flair_name%3A%22Need%20Advice%22)

I'm looking into getting an Umbrella Insurance to protect my family's assets. Reading previous posts on this sub, people recommend Cincinnati Financial and Chubb. However, it seems like if I get Umbrella Insurance, my auto insurance would be under that as well. Are there disadvantages of getting auto insurance from insurance companies not specializing in auto insurance?

My current regular auto insurance (like Geico/Statefarm/Progressive) has been extremely lenient and forgiving so I don't know if I can enjoy such generosity from places not known for auto insurance.

Is it very rare to have a separate umbrella insurance from auto insurance?
