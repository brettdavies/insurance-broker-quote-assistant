Comparing Geico to Chubb is comparing a Honda to a Ferrari.
The biggest advantages Chubb would generally have include:
1. White glove claims service. I’ve had claims with Geico and Chubb; Geico was entirely okay; Chubb was “don’t worry about anything, we’ve got you”.
2. Coverage: Chubb operates on agreed value: you and Chubb agree on the value of the auto, if the worst happens for a total loss, you get a cheque in that amount. Less than a total loss? They’ll cover everything, comprehensively, without much in the way of exclusions. Geico, doesn’t even offer OEM parts coverage.
3. Limits: Chubb will routinely offer 10M+ Umbrella policies and very generous (3M+ if memory serves) uninsured/underinsured extensions. You have to go with a HNW carrier like them to access such limits.
Where this matters is:
1. Coverage limits / how much you want.
2. Type of vehicle. Insuring a used Honda Civic is very different than a “there’s only 10 of these in existence” vehicle.
I say all of this as someone who had Geico insure my daily driver, along with Chubb for my home and umbrella; sample size of one, consult a broker for professional advice.
YMMV. Good luck.

I have had claims against Chubb and Geico.. (their drivers at fault).
It was MUCH easier to deal with Geico. More responsive, quick resolutions, etc.. Chubb was a shitshow. I don't know if they are better to their own clients.. but based on my interactions I would never work with them.

> I don’t know if they are better to their own clients
My claim experience with Chubb was the smoothest I’ve ever had (as a customer), bar none; I never felt like they were going to cause any issues whatsoever, and the breath of their coverage meant everything was an easy yes, on the claim.
Having sued an at fault driver covered by a mass market carrier, it was a 💩 show to deal with their carrier.
YMMV but generally I’d never choose based on my adversarial experience with a carrier, I would absolutely choose based on my “I was a customer” experience, personally.

Need some clarity. I drive a 1988 Chevy Celebrity. Pretty sure there’s only 10 of those left on the road.
Is Chubb a good fit?

You don’t need to have the umbrella insurance and your auto insurance under one roof
I used to have my umbrella insurance through Statefarm, which insured my homes as well but my auto was with Geico
All I had to do was forward copy of my Geico policy and they will tell you minimum auto policy I need to maintain to qualify for umbrella

I’d rather have one insurance company have more on the line if they lose the lawsuit. It would also make the legal defense simpler rather than having two insurance companies fighting with each other.

I think the real question is why you think State Farm or GEICO would provide better coverage/claim experience than Cincinnati or Chubb on anything… let alone automobiles? You are comparing mass market vs top of the line.

Really I didn't know this. Chubb I know had executive insurance and others things but are they regarded as higher quality in all insurance? In what ways are they deemed top of the line.

High net worth insurers like Chubb pay claims, which is what an insurance company should do, rather than deny them or nickel and dime you on the amount. The scope of what is covered by insurance, and at what amount, is far greater. Random equipment breakdown? Cyber fraud? Underground sewer line issue? Covered. My policy even covers kidnapping and ransom, not that i specifically asked for it.
Their premiums are more expensive, and they are more aligned with people who feel they have significant assets to protect and want to sleep at night.
As another example- my homeowners policy with Cincinnati is an HO5 rather than HO3. GEICO will write you an HO3. How do they differ? HO3 only covers explicitly named issues; HO5 covers anything not explicitly mentioned as uncovered. Sounds like trivial legal nonsense until a raccoon invades your attic and has babies and causes massive damage- covered in HO5 but not HO3 (Happened to my mom).
GEICO and equivalents are known for denying and underpaying as mass market insurers. Their premiums are cheap and they are more aligned to “I need insurance to meet my legal needs to drive or get a mortgage” type clientele. If you shop for insurance based on rate, you are their target client… but think about how they keep rates down.

Cincinnati and Chubb aren’t umbrella insurance companies. They are general insurance companies just like any of the others you mentioned except a tier above and better in nearly every way. You only think of them as umbrella companies because you didn’t know they existed until you started looking for umbrella coverage. They don’t spend money on TV ads because they don’t rely on animal mascots or comedic spokespeople to reach their target customers.

I would recommend searching for a local independent insurance agency that can quote most of them so they can shop you around and find the best fit for your specific situation. If you don’t know your local agencies Chubb and Cincinnati both have agent finders on their websites. Maybe start with that and then look at the agency websites to see what other insurers they can quote. Google the agents and find their competitors and compare. Then pick someone you like with access to multiple options and have them get you some quotes. You don’t really need an “in” or to have someone make an introduction beyond finding a good agent.

Cincinnati and Chubb are not "insurance companies not specializing in auto insurance". They are both very good insurance companies that provide coverage for high value items that a Geico or Statefarm generally will not.
I don't know what you mean by your current auto insurance provider has been extremely lenient and forgiving. Chubb (and others in the same league) are pricey, but will provide absolute no-hassle while glove service when you do need to use insurance.
To answer your question about umbrella coverage, start with whoever you currently have your home/auto insurance with. It may be easier to go that route given some of these high end providers sometimes require you to have two or more lines with them before they can write you an umbrella policy.

Many umbrella policies will require max or near max auto limits as well… which you should also have already.

Prior to 2020, I had Chubb auto insurance along with the umbrella. Tney provide perfectly legitimate auto insurance, if a little bit pricey (it is Chubb after all). It's "gold plated" in the same way their umbrella is (covers / can cover things that like GEICO or State Farm won't consider).

you dont need to worry about small auto claims with these insurers offering large umbrellas- hence no point in comparing to Geico/State Farm- thats not what you are insuring against. At this point you should be self insured to a certain point and carry a large deductible for collistion/comprehensive. I carry a 2K deductible on my autos- highest offered I think. Just worry about and insure the larger vehicle loss, medical, uninsured motorist etc- hence working with Chubb/Cincinatti etc helps

As I understand it, umbrella coverage should kick in if for some reason your auto insurance doesn't cover enough for a really bad situation (say you somehow cause 1million in property damage or completely paralyze someone).
That's not it's primary purpose, but I believe most policies would step in here.

High-income strategies for early retirement
If you're aiming for early retirement and have a high income, there are several strategies and tips that can help you reach your goal faster. Here are some key insights from Redditors who have successfully navigated this journey:
### Maximize Retirement Accounts
* **Take Advantage of Employer Matching**: Many Redditors emphasize the importance of maximizing employer contributions to retirement accounts. ["That 6% match is free money right?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nbhu79/comment/nd1vcrq/)
* **Utilize Mega Backdoor Roth**: This strategy can significantly increase your retirement savings by converting after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA. "Currently, I am maxing out the $23.5k limit for 401k in pre-tax contributions, as well as contributing 20% of my pay in after-tax money to my mega backdoor roth."
### Invest Aggressively
* **High Equity Allocation**: Consider a heavy stock allocation, especially in your younger years, to maximize growth potential. ["100% stocks has a similar SWR to 50% bonds and 50% stocks."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1nxkqmu/comment/nhqil9u/)
* **Diversify Investments**: Real estate, index funds, and tech stocks are popular choices. "Net worth: ~$8M. Core sources: Real estate, index funds and tech stock."
### Optimize Income and Spending
* **Live Below Your Means**: Spending less than you earn and investing the rest is a fundamental principle. ["Spend less than you make and invest the rest."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1nxkqmu/comment/nho81rb/)
* **Automate Savings**: Set up automated transfers to ensure you consistently save a portion of your income. ["Pay yourself first, automated."](https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1iy56tr/comment/meua3e6/)
### Plan for Healthcare
* **Consider Private Health Insurance**: If you retire early, you may need to pay for private health insurance, which can be costly. ["I bought private health care from Blue Cross Blue Shield. I pay 3K per month on that."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1o52yqm/comment/nj6jezv/)
* **Look into ACA Subsidies**: Depending on your income, you might qualify for subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. ["ACA has been no problem since we're showing little income this year."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1mz7kg9/comment/najf1sf/)
### Transition and Mental Adjustments
* **Prepare for Psychological Shifts**: Retiring early can be a significant life change, and it's important to be prepared for the mental adjustments. ["It does feel pretty weird still not to have any paychecks coming in, but it's fading."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1mz7kg9/comment/najf1sf/)
* **Find Meaning and Purpose**: Many early retirees find fulfillment through hobbies, volunteering, or spending time with family. "We both volunteer at various places now."
### Additional Tips
* **Consult Financial Advisors**: For complex financial situations, consider seeking advice from a professional. "Transition all assets to Vanguard Personal Advisor Wealth Management."
* **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with the latest financial news and strategies. "I only learned about capital gains harvesting _last year_."

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.
