_“Our customer-centered approach leads us to measure success in the number of promises kept. The financial strength of each affiliate is critical to our ability to keep those promises, and we will continue to take a state-specific approach in the way in which we operate.”_
Beyond written responses State Farm General executives sent to Commissioner Lara [in a letter](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/download/3867bd51-fce0-4abd-9a96-cf2da05152d5/sfgtolara2.25.25.pdf) the day before the meeting, a transcript of the proceedings that _Carrier Management_ located online shows that executives again stressed the need for individual affiliates to remain financially viable but indicated that the approval of a 22 percent emergency rate increase would help them in taking a request for support to the parent company board.
