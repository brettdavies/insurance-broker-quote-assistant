##  At a glance 
![Arrowhead logo](https://cdn.insurance.redventures.io/images/arrowhead.svg)
Bankrate's take
Arrowhead is an insurance broker that provides specialty solutions to agents seeking coverage for clients, including those in the standard and nonstandard market. While the company’s product line is extensive, personal auto and life are not currently available.
  * Company highlights


  * No longer offers personal auto or life insurance
  * Home insurance currently only offered in NJ
  * Commercial and specialty insurance available
  * Flood and earthquake insurance available for homeowners in certain states
  * Offers personal umbrella and wedding insurance


##  Arrowhead car insurance review 
Founded in 1983, the [Arrowhead General Insurance Agency](https://www.arrowheadgrp.com/contact/?fwp_contacts=personal-auto) began its focus on providing solutions for agents looking to insure hard-to-place risks. While the broker previously offered personal auto insurance through third-party underwriters, you can’t currently get car insurance through Arrowhead. Our insurance editorial team has not assigned Arrowhead a Bankrate Score, as personal auto policies are no longer offered. Existing policies may still be in force in some states.
### Pros and cons of Arrowhead car insurance
If you’re gathering [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), making a list of perks and drawbacks may be a helpful way to [compare companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/). However, Arrowhead car insurance isn’t currently available for personal vehicles, so you’ll need to look elsewhere for coverage.

### Arrowhead car insurance cost
Arrowhead does not currently offer car insurance policies, so average rates are not available. However, you can still get an idea of what your premium might be with other carriers by analyzing [average car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). As of September 2025, the national average cost of car insurance is $2,671 per year for full coverage and $806 for state minimum coverage. Keep in mind that [numerous factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) make up your price, so your rate will be different based on your unique circumstances.
### Arrowhead customer satisfaction
Arrowhead itself doesn’t write insurance; it’s a general agency that facilitates the sale of specialty insurance products. As a result, it’s difficult to find third-party customer satisfaction ratings. Because it isn’t an insurance carrier, Arrowhead doesn’t have any third-party ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/) or the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/). It also lacks financial strength ratings from companies like [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/).
### Arrowhead car insurance discounts
Discounts may be a great way to [save on car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) and get a [cheaper auto insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/). Because personal auto coverage is not currently available through Arrowhead, discount information is also not available.

##  Arrowhead home insurance review 
Arrowhead has not consistently offered home insurance, so like its auto insurance product, the company does not have a Bankrate Score due to the limited data available. While the company previously offered home insurance in nine states, Arrow’s [HO-3 coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/ho3/) is currently only available in New Jersey and is underwritten by DB Insurance Company. Just like with its car insurance product, Arrowhead is not actually a [home insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) but rather a broker.
### Pros and cons of Arrowhead homeowners insurance
[Comparing home insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) and other aspects of each carrier you’re interested in may be an important step in finding the right option for you. However, Arrowhead’s home insurance is currently only available in one state — New Jersey — which means you won’t be able to buy coverage if you live outside the state.

  * Homeowners insurance cost
  * Customer satisfaction
  * Home insurance discounts


### Arrowhead home insurance cost
As Arrowhead’s home insurance offerings and availability have changed over time, average rates for its home policies are unavailable from Quadrant Information Services. If you live in New Jersey where its home coverage is offered, you can request a quote and compare it to other companies and the [national average cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/), which is $2,408 per year for $300,000 of dwelling coverage as of September 2025.
Generally, the more coverage you need, the higher your premium will be. You’ll also pay more for added protections such as [sewer backup coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/sewer-backup-insurance/) or service line coverage.
### Arrowhead customer satisfaction
Because Arrowhead home insurance is currently widely unavailable for a majority of the U.S., it’s impossible to give an accurate estimate of the company’s customer satisfaction based on third-party ratings. However, its home insurance is currently underwritten by DB Insurance Co., Ltd., which has an AM Best financial strength rating of [A+ (Superior)](https://news.ambest.com/PR/PressContent.aspx?refnum=33642&altsrc=9), a boost from its previous A (Excellent) rating.
Previously, coverage was underwritten by Universal North America Insurance Company. Universal North America has an AM Best rating of [B+ (Good)](https://ratings.ambest.com/SearchResults.aspx?AltSrc=9), but an outlook description of negative, indicating that its financial strength may be headed downhill. The NAIC gave Universal North America a [complaint index of 3.13](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=10759&:refresh) for its homeowners insurance product in 2023. The baseline rating is 1.00, which means that the NAIC recorded three times more complaints than average for Universal North America's home insurance.
### Arrowhead home insurance discounts
Neither Arrowhead nor Universal North America Insurance Company lists [home insurance discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-discounts/) online, possibly since new policies aren’t available right now. However, in general, discounts could be a good way to get [cheaper home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/), so it may be worthwhile to look into discounts when researching other companies.

##  Compare Arrowhead to other insurers 
If you’re shopping for a new car insurance carrier and home insurer (if you live outside of NJ), Arrowhead won’t be an option right now. That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck, though. There are plenty of options out there for a variety of different insurance needs.
### Arrowhead vs. Geico
If you’re looking for plenty of car insurance discounts, Geico could be a good choice. The company offers lots of savings opportunities that may help you lower your premium. However, just like Arrowhead, Geico doesn’t underwrite its own home insurance policies.

### Arrowhead vs. SafeAuto
Arrowhead started by offering nonstandard auto insurance coverage to [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), but since it doesn’t currently write personal auto coverage, SafeAuto could be a good choice if you need insurance as a high-risk driver. Coverage is available in 20 states and [SR-22 forms](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) are available if you need one.
**Learn more:**[SafeAuto Insurance review](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/safe-auto/)
### Arrowhead vs. Erie
If Arrowhead’s former array of home insurance endorsements is appealing to you, you might want to check out Erie. The company is only available in 12 states and Washington, D.C., but it offers a long list of add-ons for robust home insurance coverage.

##  Is Arrowhead a good insurance company? 
Arrowhead may be a good insurance company if you’re looking for commercial or specialty insurance products, but it simply isn’t an option for personal auto or home insurance for most customers at this time. If you are shopping for new insurance, you may want to get quotes from several carriers so you can [compare rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/), coverage offerings, discounts and third-party scores from different companies. Doing so might help you find the best company for your needs.
## What are real-life customers saying about Arrowhead?
Because Arrowhead does not currently offer new personal auto policies anywhere or home insurance policies outside of New Jersey, it’s difficult to find reviews online from current customers. Bankrate’s insurance editorial team did find a small number of reviews on Yelp from customers who purchased home and auto insurance through Arrowhead, most of whom reported negative experiences.
### Yelp
On Yelp, we encountered nearly 100 reviews of Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, which trended overwhelmingly negative. Because Arrowhead no longer issues car and home insurance, the majority of both positive and negative reviews were from previous years.

Quick and fair
This is the worst insurance company on the planet! I totally agree with other reviews. They took $1,000 from me and then declined my insurance because I had debris in my front yard? you mean my daughters plants? Now they refuse to even answer my emails and are no longer returning my money and I filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau. Use extreme caution! I can't believe they're affiliated with Geico insurance! Now I'm worried if my Geico insurance is legitimate?

Sent to voicemail
New insurance policy through GEICO. One month later, got a letter in the mail that the policy is "pending cancellation" due to a pending home inspection. The home inspection company (National Insurance Inspection) calls in the middle of the day and leaves a voice mail. There is NO WAY to reach the inspection company back or contact them, it ALWAYS goes to voice mail. There is no way to reach Arrowhead and emailing propertydocs@ returns nothing. Both inspection company and this insurance company has 1 star ratings. GEICO should blacklist both.

### State availability
Arrowhead does not currently offer personal auto or life insurance in any states. Home insurance is currently available in New Jersey.
### Arrowhead tools and benefits
Arrowhead provides solutions for numerous specialty products. These offerings include:
  * [**Personal umbrella**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/umbrella-insurance/)**:** This is one of Arrowhead’s only personal products that is currently being offered. Umbrella policies provide additional liability coverage beyond the underlying limits of your auto, home and other policies.
  * [**Residential earthquake**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/is-earthquake-insurance-worth-it/)**:** Another personal product that is still available is Arrowhead’s earthquake coverage. This could help protect your finances in the aftermath of earthquake damage to your home.
  * [**Workers compensation**](https://www.arrowheadgrp.com/products/workers-compensation/)**:** A common commercial insurance product, this policy helps cover the expenses of job-related injuries sustained by employees.
  * [**Commercial vehicle insurance**](https://www.arrowheadgrp.com/product-search?fwp_national_program_or_ah=arrowhead-product&fwp_national_programs_type=commercial)**:** Arrowhead offers insurance for commercial vehicles, such as tow trucks and ambulances.


Various other business and specialty insurance products are also available. However, remember that Arrowhead isn’t an insurance company, it’s a “general agency.” This means that your insurance won’t be underwritten by Arrowhead itself. Your policy may come from one of several underwriting companies that Arrowhead uses, depending on the product you choose and the state you live in.
## Frequently asked questions about Arrowhead insurance
  * ###  How do I file a claim with Arrowhead?
Caret Down Icon
Visit Arrowhead’s [claims page](https://www.arrowheadgrp.com/claims/) for product-specific information on filing a claim. To contact the company for general inquiries, you can send mail to 701 B. Street Suite 2100, San Diego, CA 92101 or call 1-800-669-1889 or 619-881-8600.
  * ###  Is Arrowhead a good company?
Caret Down Icon
Arrowhead may be a good insurance company if you have commercial or specialized insurance needs. However, it isn’t an option at the moment if you need a personal auto or a home insurance policy outside of New Jersey — it is not currently offering those product lines.
  * ###  What is Arrowhead’s AM Best score?
Caret Down Icon
Arrowhead does not underwrite policies itself, so it does not have an AM Best score. Instead, it helps connect people with other insurance companies that underwrite certain types of policies. If you want to learn about the financial strength of your insurance, you can look into the AM Best score of the company underwriting the policy rather than the broker.
  * ###  Is Arrowhead a sustainable company?
Caret Down Icon
Arrowhead doesn’t publish details about any corporate social responsibility or sustainability practices. If sustainability is important to you, consider researching the practices of the insurance companies that Arrowhead helps match you with.
  * ######  Why doesn’t this company have a Bankrate Score?
Caret Down Icon
Arrowhead General Insurance Agency doesn’t have a Bankrate Score because Bankrate’s insurance editorial team only assigns Bankrate Scores to insurance carriers. Because Arrowhead’s insurance coverage is underwritten by multiple third parties, it’s impossible to give a universal evaluation of how well its underwriters meet customer needs.
