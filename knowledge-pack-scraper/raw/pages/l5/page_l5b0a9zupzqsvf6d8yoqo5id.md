## Best car insurance discounts for seniors
Many car insurance companies offer discounts on senior car insurance that can help you save on your monthly rates. The discounts vary by company, but most offer at least one of them.
  * **Defensive driving discounts:** Most insurance companies limit which courses qualify for these sorts of discounts. Ask your insurance company about defensive driving courses in your area and see how much you could save. 
  * **Bundle discounts:** Many insurance companies offer seniors discounts if you buy more than one policy with them. Consider moving your home insurance to the same company that you use for car insurance if they have a discount for it. 
  * **Safety feature discount:** Your insurance company may give you a discount on coverage if you buy a car that has enhanced safety features like lane departure warning, sideview cameras and impact prevention sensors. 
  * **Accident-free discount:** Your insurance company might lower your premium if you haven't had an accident in several years. If it doesn't, you might be able to get a discount and lower premium with a different company. 


## How to get cheap car insurance for seniors
The best way to get cheap car insurance for seniors is to compare quotes from several companies side by side. Explore the discounts each company offers, too, and consider how they respond to your concerns.
**Remember, the cheapest coverage may not be the best.** Try to choose a policy that meets your needs and a company that makes you feel comfortable.

## Methodology
This analysis used insurance quotes for hundreds of ZIP codes across Florida. We compared rates for three drivers, ages 65, 75 and 85. We also checked how having a clean driving record, one speeding ticket and one at-fault accident would affect a person's rates.
Minimum coverage rates are based on the [required limits in Florida](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/florida/requirements "Florida Car Insurance Laws and Requirements"). The full coverage policy used for this survey included liability, comprehensive and collision insurance. Rates for drivers with prior incidents are for a full coverage policy. Limits and deductibles are listed below.
### Full coverage car insurance limits
  * Bodily injury liability: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident 
  * Property damage liability: $25,000 per accident 
  * Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident 
  * Personal injury protection: $10,000 
  * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
