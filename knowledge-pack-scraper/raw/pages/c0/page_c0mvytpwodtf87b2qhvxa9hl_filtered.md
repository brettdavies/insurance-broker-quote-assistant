## Geico Defensive Driving Course Review

Maybe you had a close call on the road or want all the auto insurance discounts you can get. Regardless of your reason, a defensive driving course can be an excellent way to lower rates and improve your standing with the insurance company.

The Geico driver safety course is an easy way to lower auto insurance rates. The American Safety Council administers the class to any driver who wants to participate, no matter your insurer.  Although the council gears classes toward teens or seniors, the course isn’t intended for any specific group. Whatever your age, classes typically cover the same material. Learn more in our [Geico auto insurance review](https://www.autoinsurance.org/companies/geico-auto-insurance-review/ "Geico Auto Insurance Review (2024)").

### How to Sign Up for Geico Defensive Driving

You can sign up for the Geico defensive driver course online. Just choose your state from the pull-down menu at geico.com/ddc. While the price varies depending on the website you sign up with, it’s generally less than $30 — a small price to pay for significantly lowering your auto insurance rates.

![Geico defensive driving course review](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201364%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Geico defensive driving course review")![Geico defensive driving course review](https://www.autoinsurance.org/images/Screenshot-2024-03-19-7.49.23-PM.png "Geico defensive driving course review")

The course itself is four to six hours long, depending on your state’s requirements, and you can complete it at your own pace. If you work a full-time job, you can split the course into several days to better fit your busy schedule. You have up to 30 days to complete the course once you begin.

> You can complete the Geico defensive driver course online using your computer, tablet, or phone. There is a short quiz after each section you must pass to get your discount.

Once you complete the course, Geico receives a notification automatically. Completion of the course provides a [defensive driver discount](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-to-get-defensive-driver-discount/) for three years, after which point, you can retake the course to renew the discount. All drivers on your policy can take the course for the most savings. 

### Geico Defensive Driving Course Answers

We can’t provide you with the actual Geico defensive driving course test answers, but we can prepare you for what to expect in the class. 

The Geico driver safety course teaches you how to avoid collisions. Topics covered in the Geico safe driving course include:

* Maintaining a safe driving distance
* Limiting the force of impact
* How to drive in bad weather
* How to correct if you lose control of your car
* Road rage and aggressive driving
* How alcohol and drugs affect driving skills

Safe driving skills are essential. Drivers who understand accident avoidance techniques have lower auto insurance rates and are safer drivers. A defensive driving course allows drivers to brush up on skills that keep them safe and lower auto insurance rates.

Whether you’ve been driving for years or got your license recently, the class offers tips and reminders on driving safely and responsibly.

### Removing Points on Your License

Each state determines whether or not a defensive driving course removes points from your license. Although most states accept courses taught by the American Safety Council and the National Safety Council, check with your DMV and read National Safety Council defensive driving course reviews to ensure the Geico course meets state requirements.

[Do points affect auto insurance rates?](https://www.autoinsurance.org/how-will-points-affect-auto-insurance-rates/) If you have points on your license, it’s recommended to remove them as soon as possible.

**While most states automatically remove points every three to five years, your auto insurance rates increase with points.** To keep rates low, avoid acquiring points on your driver’s license and take extra classes, such as a defensive driving course, that remove those points from your license.
