The main Progressive NAIC number is 24260.

With Progressive’s NAIC number, anyone can learn more about the company’s financial data, the kinds of complaints that have been filed by customers, and any enforcement actions taken against the company. Consumers will need Progressive’s NAIC number to report fraud or file an insurance claim, too.

Although the main Progressive NAIC number is 24260, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has assigned an insurance code for each of Progressive’s affiliate companies.

Keep in mind that Progressive's NAIC insurance codes are not the same as the three-digit numbers assigned to Progressive by the department of motor vehicles in each state. These numbers are codes issued by a state’s insurance commissioner to companies that are authorized to sell policies in that state. They aren’t standardized nationwide like NAIC codes.
