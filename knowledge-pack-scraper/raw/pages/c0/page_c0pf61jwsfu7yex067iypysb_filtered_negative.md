Insurance is a pool. Everything is more expensive from raw materials, labor, replacement parts, new/used cars, so now your insurance is more expensive.
Shop around for a new quote.

Rates are rising across all carriers and all lines of business. Homeowner's claims are a financial drain for companies for one thing. Another is the cost of repairing vehicles has soared. Parts are expensive, repair rates are expensive, etc. Insurance fraud is prevalent. The days of having low insurance bc of a clean record are sadly behind us. We are all paying more.

You pay 600 a month and now 900? Is that for several vehicles or due to crappy location? I pay $120 a month on a 40k vehicle with high coverage.

Make a new quote as if you were a brand new customer on the progressive website. For reasons unknown, they allow current customers to re-quote themselves. I did this and saved 40% from my renewal.

Hey. I just went through the online re-quote process and my monthly premium went from 235 to 154 which seems crazy. I set it up to start when my current policy ends next month. Is it legit? I'm worried ill send payment for the new premium and they'll come with some bs. And do i keep all my current discounts etc? Would love more details on your experience please. _^

I do this. The only issue I've run into is that it keeps record of each policy so I have to sift through my list of cancelled policies to find the one that's active. It's annoying, but definitely worth the massive savings. I'm thinking of asking them next time to just make my renewal the same as the new quote and see if I can avoid adding yet another policy to the list.

Yes definitely do this. My price on automatic payments has doubled over the course of a year for no reason. When I look up rates like a new customer they offer the original rates.
They're just trying to charge you more without you noticing or caring. If you notice or care you will save hundreds of dollars just getting a new policy.

If you have excellent credit, have Progressive re-run your credit score. If you make it to the top level, you will see a decrease.

I’d recommend looking at it differently. Sure inflation and all that stuff that people will harp on. Whatever.
Don’t take insurance personally. Progressive may be going up now, it may go down next year, doesn’t matter. Whenever it goes up just shop around. When that next one goes up then shop around. It’d be nice to stay with a company for 49 years and get loyalty discounts or something but it’s just not working out that way for the most part.

Consider your base price...300 is actually not too much😂 660/half year sounds more correct.

Well; on the flip side, my son and my future daughter in law just moved in together. Have a 2022 Honda CR-V. Full coverage. And they are paying like $63/month. I was shocked how low it was. 24 and 25 years old. So, you just have to shop around.

I work for State Farm and we lose customers almost daily to Progressive. They are writing new policies without underwriting in the beginning, so when your renewal comes up you get hit with a big increase. There are other factors as well, like some have mentioned in the comments. Price of material to repair is a big one right now. Almost all of our increases lately on autos has been on Toyotas. Your credit score will also play a role. Having multiline policies can help.
