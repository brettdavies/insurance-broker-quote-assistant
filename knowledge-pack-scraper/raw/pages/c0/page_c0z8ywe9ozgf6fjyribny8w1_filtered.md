GEICO and Foremost are large national insurance companies that write policies in all 50 states and the [**District of Columbia**](/homeowners-insurance/washington-dc/).

GEICO offers lower rates than Foremost in every category reviewed by Insurify, but it’s important to remember that these insurance companies don’t always serve the same driver base.

If you’re considering a policy with GEICO or Foremost, it’s important to examine all factors. In addition to [**premium quotes**](/car-insurance/), look at coverage and discount options as well as customer service ratings and claim handling.

Here’s what you need to know when comparing GEICO and Foremost.

Quick Facts

* [**GEICO**](/car-insurance/companies/geico/) scored an Insurify Quality (IQ) Score of 9.2 out of 5, while [**Foremost**](/car-insurance/companies/foremost/) managed a 7.4.
* GEICO offers lower rates across all driver types and coverages.
* Foremost specializes in high-risk drivers, while GEICO tends to work with more standard drivers.

## Foremost vs. GEICO: The verdict

GEICO has a significantly higher IQ Score of 9.2 compared to 7.4 for Foremost. GEICO also has much lower rates for both [**liability-only**](/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) and [**full-coverage policies**](/car-insurance/knowledge/full-coverage-car-insurance/). In fact, Foremost was significantly more expensive than GEICO for full-coverage and liability-only policies.

GEICO’s premiums are also well below national averages, while Foremost’s rates tend to be higher than national averages.

But Foremost tends to focus on drivers who may have difficulty finding an insurance policy elsewhere due to incidents on their record. Drivers with a DUI, a total loss claim, or another serious incident on their record may find coverage with Foremost to be the better (or possibly only) option.

You can see how these two insurers compare in the table below.

| **Factor**  sort ascsort desc | **Foremost**  sort ascsort desc | **GEICO**  sort ascsort desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IQ Score | 7.4 | 9.2 |
| J.D. Power customer satisfaction score | Not Ranked | 818 out of 1,000 |
| Average quote: liability only | $118 | $91 |
| Number of discounts | 3 | 16 |
| Number of states where it operates | 50 | 50 |

## Foremost

Foremost is part of the Farmers insurance group and focuses mainly on high-risk drivers, who sometimes have difficulty finding coverage. Due to the unique market it serves, its average rates exceed national averages.

Why we picked this company

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.

Pros 

* Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
* Accident forgiveness available
* A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best

Cons

* High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs
* No rideshare or new car replacement coverage available
* Lower customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power

### GEICO DriveEasy telematics program

GEICO offers a telematics program that allows policyholders a chance to earn a discount on their premiums. Foremost doesn’t offer a telematic program to its customers.

DriveEasy, which is GEICO’s free safe-driving program, lets policyholders use the GEICO Mobile app to earn discounts on their premiums. The app logs driving behaviors, including distance driven, speed, braking, and cornering. It then uses the data to calculate a safe-driving score.

The safe-driving score factors into your insurance rate at each policy renewal, and your premium automatically adjusts. This allows most drivers to save money, but if you’re a riskier driver, your rates could increase.

| **Driver Type** | **Foremost** | **GEICO** |
| --- | --- | --- |

### GEICO: Cheapest for teen drivers

[**Young drivers**](/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) are less experienced behind the wheel, which is why they’re more expensive to insure. If you have a teen on your policy, GEICO is by far the best car insurance option.

The chart below shows the average monthly liability-only premiums for teen drivers.

| **Driver Type** | **Foremost** | **GEICO** |

### GEICO: Cheapest for drivers with bad credit

Insurers consider several factors when setting a premium. Statistics show that people with [**bad credit**](/car-insurance/driver/credit/bad-credit/) are involved in more accidents and claims, which is why they pay more for coverage. GEICO is the best policy option for drivers with poor credit, as you can see in the table below.

| **Driver Type** | **Foremost** | **GEICO** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drivers with bad credit | $142 | $111 |

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers and quote estimates from Quadrant Information Services. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.

### GEICO: Cheapest for senior drivers

GEICO offers better rates than Foremost for senior drivers (age 60 or higher) as well. A person’s rates tend to increase around age 70 because reduced faculties make it riskier to drive.

The table below shows how full-coverage rates from GEICO compare with those from Foremost.

| **Driver Type** | **Foremost** | **GEICO** |

| Senior drivers | $209 | $101 |

Collision coverage and comprehensive will pay to repair or replace your vehicle after an accident, fire, flood, or other covered incident.

## Foremost vs. GEICO FAQs

GEICO is certainly the big winner when it comes to price, but if you’re a driver with incidents on your record, Foremost may be the best option for you. As you narrow your decision between these insurers, the answers presented below can help.

## Methodology

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area.

Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).

Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:

* Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
* Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
* No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:

* Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
* Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible

Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.

Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.

We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.

* **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
* **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
* **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
* **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
* **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

GEICO is the third-largest car insurance company in the U.S., according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.[[2]](#cite-2) State Farm is the largest insurance business in the U.S., and Progressive is the second largest, making these two companies GEICO’s biggest competitors.

Allstate and USAA round out the top five largest insurers in the country.

Yes. GEICO is cheaper than Foremost in every driver category. But Foremost specializes in high-risk drivers, so its average rates tend to be higher based on the drivers it insures.

Yes. Foremost Insurance Company is a reputable company that is a partner insurance company of Farmers Casualty Insurance Company. Foremost started out offering coverage for mobile homes but currently offers auto policies to high-risk drivers through its partnership with another affiliated Farmers company, Bristol West Casualty Insurance Company. Foremost enjoys sound financial strength ratings from AM Best.[[3]](#cite-3)

The main difference is that Foremost specializes in high-risk drivers, while GEICO primarily works with more traditional drivers. They both offer experienced agents, a variety of coverages, and discounts for drivers with a good driving record. In addition, GEICO offers a telematics program called DriveEasy, which monitors your driving and offers a discount for good driving.
