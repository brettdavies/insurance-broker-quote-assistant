![All About Insurance Quotes: What Your Provider Needs to Know](https://econosurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SD1FsyLC4D5QQHQkzhf0.webp)

Financial experts recommend that most people have four [different types of insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0212/4-types-of-insurance-everyone-needs.aspx): auto, health, long-term disability, and life. It can be overwhelming trying to shop around for different policies that fit your needs and budget. Figuring out what information and documents you need to get started on insurance quotes can add more stress to the situation.

What information insurance companies need to create a quote depends on the type of policy you need. Knowing what you need to have at the ready beforehand will make the process easier and more streamlined.

This blog will discuss what your insurance company will need when making a quote for an insurance policy. Partner with an experienced insurance agency that’ll help you get the lowest monthly premium possible.

## Auto Insurance

Getting a quote for auto insurance should take around 10 minutes. Some of the personal information you may need to provide includes:

* Gender
* Name
* Date of birth
* Marital status
* Phone number
* Driver’s license number
* Email address
* Address

It’s important to provide an accurate home address for where you primarily live and where your vehicle will be garaged or parked. The insurance company will review public records to look up your previous addresses and vehicle information.

You will need to have information about each vehicle you want covered under the insurance policy. This can include:

* Model
* Make
* Year
* Body style
* Whether you own or lease the car
* Vehicle identification number (VIN)
* Estimated annual mileage

Another thing you’ll need to give to the insurance company is your driving history. This includes any past auto accidents or tickets.

Keep in mind there is a cut-off point as to when you don’t need to disclose things that happened in your past. This varies from insurance company.

## Homeowners Insurance

You may need some more information to get a homeowners insurance quote than you would one for an [auto policy](https://econosurance.com/vehicle-insurance/auto-insurance-coverage-what-it-covers-and-types-of-coverage). One of the things you might need to have prepared is the contact information of anyone who’ll be living in the home. You might also have to let them know whether you own any pets and if you’ll be operating a business on the property.

It’s a good idea to have the information about your existing insurance policy ready if that applies to your situation. This can include:

* Your homeowner’s insurance policy number
* Your mortgage information
* The estimated cost of rebuilding your home
* Details of prior insurance claims (if any)

You’ll have to fill out specifics about your home during the quote process. Some of the details you’ll need to provide are:

* The age and type of the roof
* The year your home was built
* Your home’s style
* Whether you have a garage or not
* The house’s exterior finish
* Square footage
* Number of bathrooms and bedrooms

This information helps determine the coverage type and amount you need for your house. Sharing if you’ve made improvements to your home and if you’ve installed safety devices is important to state when getting a quote.

### Renters Insurance

Renters insurance is essential for individuals who don’t own a home. Your landlord’s homeowners insurance policy won’t cover your belongings in the event of an accident.

Thankfully, you won’t have to provide a lot of information to [get a quote](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/do-you-need-renters-insurance). You will likely need to provide the following info:

* Rental home address
* Number of rooms
* Estimated value of your belongings
* Your name and contact information
* Social security number

## Life Insurance

You may have to provide your insurance agent with some personal information when getting a [life insurance policy](https://econosurance.com/personal-insurance/understanding-whole-life-insurance). One of the main things you’ll need to have ready is your health history. You’ll have to provide the following details:

* Chronic conditions
* Recent surgeries or accidents

The insurance company may require you to consent to release your medical records before they can approve your policy. You could be asked to go through a medical exam. This could include cardiovascular, urine, and blood testing.

You might have to answer questions about what the goal of getting a life insurance policy is. Knowing what you want the policy to pay for will help you figure out the amount and type of life insurance coverage that’s good for you. Your financial information will also help you figure out how much coverage you need and how long the policy needs to be.

## Long-Term Disability

Long-term disability insurance can supplement or replace your income if you get sick or hurt and are unable to work. This coverage can last anywhere from a few years up to 20. You’d have to rely on your savings account and other funds to make up for your loss of income without this insurance policy.

Long-term disability insurance is a great idea if you work in a high-paying career or job that requires a lot of training or schooling. Examples of careers that would benefit from long-term disability policies include:

* Chiropractor
* Accountant
* Consultant
* Doctor
* Lawyer
* CPA
* Nurse

Keep in mind that this type of insurance can be helpful regardless of what career you have. Individual or private long-term disability insurance provides you with more coverage than Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).

Some of the information you’ll need to get started on a quote include:

* Gender
* Age
* Location
* Occupation
* Health history
* Income

You’ll need to provide in-depth details about your occupational duties and your health history when filling out the quote form. This information gives the insurance company a better idea of your risk of illness or injury. These things can affect your coverage rates and the type you purchase.
