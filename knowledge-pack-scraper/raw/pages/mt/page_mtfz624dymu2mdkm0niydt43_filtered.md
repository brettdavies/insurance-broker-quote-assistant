Adding a driver to your insurance policy is a simple process, but it can affect your insurance rates. Whether this is a positive or negative change depends on a variety of factors, including the primary and secondary driver's age, driving history, type of vehicle, and other details. For example, adding a teenage driver with little driving experience can increase your premium, but a good student discount may help offset this difference. On the other hand, adding an older driver with a clean driving record could reduce your premium, especially if the primary driver is under 25 or has infractions on their license. It's important to consider these factors when deciding whether to add a driver to your insurance policy to avoid unexpected consequences in the event of a lending loss.

## **Adding a driver with a clean record**

For example, if you are a driver with a less-than-perfect record, adding a driver with a clean record could result in fair premiums. GEICO, for instance, averages the factors for all the drivers on the policy. So, if you are a driver with a poor record, adding a driver with a clean record could balance out the risk and result in lower premiums.

Additionally, some insurance companies may take into account the total number of miles driven by each driver when calculating premiums. In this case, adding a driver with a clean record could reduce the number of miles driven by the higher-risk driver, resulting in lower premiums. Marital status can also play a role in insurance rates, with married people often considered more stable and less risky. Therefore, adding a spouse with a clean driving record could further reduce your premiums.

It is important to note that insurance companies use driving records to assess a driver's risk profile. A driver with a clean record is perceived as less risky, while a history of accidents or violations indicates a higher risk. This classification impacts the cost of coverage, with drivers typically falling into preferred, standard, or non-standard categories. Each violation or accident on a record can lead to premium adjustments, with more severe incidents resulting in higher premiums.

In summary, adding a driver with a clean record to your insurance policy can potentially lower your premiums, especially if you are a high-risk driver. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as the insurance company's policies, the number of miles driven, and marital status, which can also influence the overall insurance rates.

## **Adding a driver with a poor record**

The increase in premium is due to the added driver's risk profile, which is based on their driving record. A driver with a clean record is considered low-risk and less likely to file claims, resulting in lower premiums. Conversely, a driver with a history of accidents, violations, or traffic incidents is deemed high-risk and more likely to file claims, leading to higher premiums. Each violation or accident on the added driver's record can contribute to higher premiums.

The impact of adding a driver with a poor record can vary depending on other factors such as age, gender, driving experience, and marital status. For example, adding an older driver with a clean driving record may reduce your premium, especially if you are a young driver or have infractions on your license. On the other hand, adding a young or inexperienced driver with a poor record will likely result in a significant increase in your premium.

It is worth noting that some insurance companies, such as GEICO, may still offer competitive rates even when adding a driver with a less-than-perfect record. They were named the best auto insurance company for high-risk drivers in the 2025 Bankrate Awards due to their fair premiums despite tickets or accidents.

Additionally, insurance companies may suggest making changes to your insurance policy when adding a driver with a poor record. Increasing your coverage is often recommended to mitigate the risk associated with the new driver's lack of experience or poor driving history. While this may result in higher premiums, it can provide added financial protection in the event of an accident or claim involving the added driver.

## **When to add a driver**

Adding an additional driver to your insurance policy is important for your financial protection. It ensures that the insurance company will pay for any accidents or claims involving your vehicle. It is also a legal requirement to disclose any licensed drivers in your household or who may be driving your car regularly. Failure to do so could result in a claim being denied.

* Licensed drivers in your household: You should typically include licensed drivers who live in your household and have access to your vehicle on your insurance policy. This is a requirement in many states. It is also a good idea to add any licensed household members who may only drive your car occasionally, as this will ensure they are covered in the event of an accident.
* Regular drivers of your vehicle: If someone outside your household regularly drives your car (more than once per month), you should add them to your insurance policy. This includes spouses, partners, and fiancés who live with you and drive your car.
* Teen and student drivers: If you have a young or student driver in your household, you may want to add them to your policy. While this can increase your premium, there may be discounts available to help offset the cost. For example, State Farm offers discounts for insuring young drivers, and good student discounts may also be available.
* Older drivers: Adding an older driver with a clean driving record to your policy could reduce your premium, especially if you are a driver under 25 or have infractions on your license.
* High-risk drivers: If you are adding a driver with a less-than-perfect record, consider GEICO, which offers fair premiums for high-risk drivers.
* Employees: If someone who works for you starts using your car regularly, you may need to add them to your policy. This includes healthcare workers, housekeepers, and childcare workers.

## **Who to add**

Adding a driver to your insurance policy is a simple process and an important one for your financial protection. The cost of adding a driver varies based on their driving history, type of vehicle, age, gender, and other details. Generally, you should include licensed drivers who live in your household, have a driver's license, and regularly drive your vehicle.

* Spouses are typically required to be on your policy.
* Significant others/partners/fiancés should be added if they live with you and regularly operate your vehicle.
* Teen drivers and college students should be added if they have a learner's permit or a valid driver's license and regularly drive your vehicle.
* Roommates who live in your household and regularly operate your vehicle should be added.
* Friends can be added if they regularly drive your vehicle.
* Health care workers, housekeepers, and childcare workers may need to be added if they regularly drive your vehicle.

It's important to note that insurance companies expect you to add all licensed drivers living in your household to your car insurance policy. However, if you don't want someone you live with to drive your vehicle, you can list them as an excluded driver on your policy.

## **How to add a driver**

Adding a driver to your insurance policy is a straightforward process, but it's important to understand the potential impact on your insurance rates. The cost of adding a driver varies based on their driving history, age, occupation, type of vehicle, and other factors. Typically, you should include licensed drivers who live in your household or regularly drive your vehicle on your policy.

* Contact your insurance provider: Reach out to your insurance provider and inform them of your intention to add a named driver to your policy. They will guide you through the process and provide the necessary forms and information.
* Provide necessary information: Furnish your insurance provider with the named driver's details, such as their name, date of birth, driving history, claims, convictions, and any other relevant information.
* Review and update your policy: Once you've provided the required information, your insurance provider will review and update your policy to include the new driver.
* Pay any additional premiums: Depending on the added driver's risk profile, you may need to pay additional premiums. Factors such as their age, driving experience, and driving record will influence this.
* Understand specific requirements: Different insurance providers may have specific requirements or restrictions for named drivers, so it's essential to review their policies carefully. Some insurers may charge a small administration fee for updating policies.
* Consider temporary insurance: If the added driver will only be using the vehicle occasionally, it might be more cost-effective for them to obtain temporary car insurance when needed.

Remember, adding a driver to your insurance policy can impact your rates, depending on their personal factors and driving history. It's a good idea to review your policy and understand the potential financial implications before making any changes.

Does adding a driver to my insurance policy cost money?

According to CarInsurance.com, there is usually no charge for adding a driver to your insurance policy. However, some insurers may charge a small administration fee to update policies.

Will adding a driver to my insurance policy affect my premium?

Adding a driver to your insurance policy will likely affect your premium. However, this can be a positive or negative change, depending on the additional driver's personal factors. For example, adding an older driver with a clean driving record could reduce your premium, especially if you are a driver under 25 or someone with infractions on your license.

What factors influence the change in premium when adding a driver to my insurance policy?

The change in premium when adding a driver to your insurance policy is influenced by various factors, including the additional driver's driving history, age, experience, marital status, and past claims.

Do I need to add a driver who lives with me but has their own insurance to my policy?

Most auto insurance providers do not require you to add drivers who have their own insurance, even if they live with you. However, if someone crashes your vehicle and your insurer finds out they were not added to your policy, you may face consequences, such as having to pay the extra cost of adding a secondary driver or the insurer refusing to pay for damages.

How do I add a driver to my insurance policy?

Most insurance companies allow you to add another driver to your policy, and some may even require it if the person drives the insured cars regularly or shares the same permanent residence. You can typically add a driver to your policy by calling your provider or agent or by logging into your account online.
