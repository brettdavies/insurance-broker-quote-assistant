As an additional bonus, you can qualify to receive a discount on your car insurance premium. California State Law mandates a 3 year discount for all qualifying drivers.

## **What Will You Learn?**

• The effects of aging on your driving.  
• Driver problem areas such as yielding the right of way, speeding, following distances, sharing the road, road signs, and signals.  
• What effects medications and alcohol can have on your driving.  
• How to limit your distractions.

• How to properly use safety restraints (seat belts, air bags).  
• And much more.
