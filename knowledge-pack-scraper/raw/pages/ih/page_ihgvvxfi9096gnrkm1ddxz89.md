The price of car insurance has accelerated in recent years: In 2025, the average cost of a full coverage policy is $2,638 a year, according to [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/the-true-cost-of-auto-insurance/) data, or about $220 a month.   
  
That’s 12% higher than it was in 2024 and over 50% more than in 2020.
Experts point to a number of culprits, from the rising cost of parts and replacement vehicles to new tariffs and disruptions to the global supply chain that have persisted since the pandemic.

##  Why is car insurance so expensive?
Car insurance premiums have risen due to a number of factors:
  1. **Inflation** : The cost of repairing and replacing vehicles — and paying medical and legal bills — has risen even faster than inflation.
  2. **Rising car prices:** Thanks to pandemic-related shortages, car prices peaked in 2021 at just over $47,000 and are only now [starting to decline](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/new-vehicle-inventory-may-2024/).
  3. **Expensive repairs:** As car technology has advanced, it has made repairing or replacing a car more costly.
  4. **More accidents:** The number and severity of collisions have increased, according to [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot), driven by a rise in distracted driving and higher speed limits. That means larger payouts from insurers, who then charge customers higher premiums.


##  How to lower car insurance rates
Despite sky-high rates, there are several ways [to lower your premiums](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/).
### **1. Look for discounts**
Many insurers offer discounts for [students](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-get-car-insurance-student-discounts/), homeowners, safe drivers and [members of the armed forces](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-military/). Getting [homeowners](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) insurance from the same provider you get car insurance [can save you as much as 25%](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/).
Look for an insurer that offers savings for your situation.
### **2. Pay your premium in full**
Paying your 6-month or 12-month premium in full will help you avoid installment [fees](https://www.cnbc.com/select/5-hidden-insurance-fees-to-avoid/), and many insurers offer a rate discount for upfront payments.
### **3. Don’t buy more insurance than you need**
Add-ons like roadside assistance and rental car reimbursement sound great, but you may already be covered with your credit card, AAA membership or elsewhere.
### **4. Think about dropping coverage**
Full coverage is usually the smarter choice, but if your car is worth less than 10 times your premium, you might be better off with just [liability-only insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/).
### **5. Improve your credit score**
Insurers associate your credit history with your likelihood of filing a claim and, in most states, your credit score [factors into your premiums](https://www.cnbc.com/select/credit-score-save-on-car-insurance/). The higher your credit score, the lower your car insurance cost. Raising your score by paying bills on time and checking your credit report for errors could reduce what you’ll pay.
### **6. Raise your deductible**
Your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) is the dollar amount you need to spend before your insurance company kicks in its share. Increasing a $200 deductible to $500 could reduce collision and comprehensive coverage costs by as much as 30%, according to the [**Insurance Information Institute**](https://www.iii.org/). Raise it to $1,000 and you could save more than 40%. Be sure you can afford to pay the extra out-of-pocket expense, though.
### **7. Comparison shop**
Don’t settle for the first car insurance quote you get — you may be able to find a better price. Getting three to five quotes with the same coverage and deductible can help you ensure you’re getting the best possible deal.
