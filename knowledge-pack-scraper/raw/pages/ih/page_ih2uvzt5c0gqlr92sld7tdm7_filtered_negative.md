## Favorite Features

These agents are assigned to you and dedicated to serving your household and offering personalized guidance when it comes to your insurance needs. They serve as a local touchpoint for service, getting to know you and your family.

### All Insurance Under One Roof
Your State Farm agent can handle all your insurance needs. State Farm offers home and life insurance on top of its auto insurance policies. Having an agent who knows your entire risk profile means personalized, expert advice on what coverages will protect you best. Plus, bundling multiple policies with State Farm can lead to additional discounts.
### First-Month’s Down Payment
State Farm doesn’t ask for a large down payment when you sign up, unlike some of its competitors. Rather, if you don’t want to pay for the policy in full, you can pay monthly, with the first month’s payment due upon signing up. This helps spread out the cost of your coverage if needed.
## Availability
State Farm Insurance offers insurance products in all 50 states; Washington, D.C.; and Canada — however, it is no longer selling new auto insurance policies in [Massachusetts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/massachusetts/best-car-insurance/) or Rhode Island. Your local agent has obtained a license in the state you reside in, so they know the state auto insurance laws that apply to you.
## How to Cancel Your State Farm Policy
You can [cancel your policy](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/how-to-cancel-car-insurance/) at any time with State Farm with no cancellation fee. To cancel, either talk to your personal agent or call 800-782-8332. State Farm will prorate your premium at the time of cancellation and refund you the difference.
## Company Background
George J. Mecherle founded State Farm in June 1922 in [Illinois](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/), where it maintains headquarters. He felt that there wasn’t an insurance company that represented the many Midwest farmers with good driving habits who couldn’t get reasonable rates. Mecherle founded the company as a mutual insurance company, which means that policyholders own it. State Farm remains a mutual insurance company today, accountable to its customers, not Wall Street.
Over the years, State Farm has added other financial services to its line of insurance products. In 1999, State Farm opened State Farm Financial Services, a separate entity to State Farm Insurance, to offer its book of clients banking products that include [auto loans](https://www.autoinsurance.com/loans/), credit cards, and checking accounts.
Today, the State Farm model remains the same: offering customers competitive prices through educated agents in their cities. It continues to innovate, offering technology like its mobile app and the [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) discount program. State Farm is the largest auto insurance provider in the country. As of the end of 2023, it has more than 94 million policies across its lines of insurance.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/#citation-1)
The insurance behemoth sells insurance through its community agents. Each agent is an independent contractor with State Farm, running a small business and employing sales and service staff across the country. This means that service can vary from agent to agent.
If you don’t like your current State Farm agent for any reason, you can transfer your policy to another agent in your state. It’s always your right to work with the agent you feel most comfortable with.
## State Farm Contact Information
For day-to-day servicing, you will contact your local agent from whom you bought the insurance. Each agent has their own phone number, address, and email address. If you need help and can’t reach your agent, call customer service at 800-782-8332, which will take your requests and forward them to your agent for processing.
You may send payments to:
* State Farm Insurance Companies
* Insurance Support Center – East
* P.O. Box 588002
* North Metro, GA 30029
## Conclusion
Overall, we find that State Farm can fit into most budgets, saving many customers money on auto insurance. When you stack up multiple discounts, State Farm prices are reasonable and attractive for many.

Not all insurance companies are able to provide you with a quote. Make sure to compare carrier rates and fees as they can vary between insurance companies and will depend upon the state in which you reside. Additionally, any savings you receive will depend upon your driving history and other factors as determined by the insurance companies giving you quotes. None of the insurance companies with whom you may be matched through the site sponsor, endorse, or are in any way affiliated with AutoInsurance.com or this site.
