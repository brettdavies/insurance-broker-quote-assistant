## The History of GEICO

GEICO Insurance was founded in 1936 in Forth Worth, Texas, by Leo Goodwin Senior and his wife Lillian Goodwin to provide auto insurance for government employees. It’s a little-known fact that GEICO actually stands for Government Employees Insurance Company. In 1937, the company relocated to Washington, D.C., because it had the largest population of federal employees.

David Lloyd Kreeger became president of GEICO in 1964. He is known for leading the decision to make GEICO products more widely available. In 1974, GEICO expanded beyond government employees and began offering products to the general public.

The American multinational conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway purchased GEICO in 1996. Berkshire Hathaway owns several successful American companies, including Fruit of the Loom and Dairy Queen. GEICO is a wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary with strong financial backing from its parent company.

The GEICO gecko is one of the most widely recognized mascots in the United States. It appears in several GEICO print and television ads promising low car insurance rates.

## How Does GEICO Insurance Work in Canada?

GEICO insurance isn’t yet available to Canadians, but GEICO customers in the U.S. are covered while driving in Canada. GEICO coverage extends beyond the United States into Canada.

United States residents driving to Canada will need proof of U.S. citizenship. You and all your passengers must have identification. Those 16 years and older need a passport or other legal travel document. Citizens younger than 16 can present birth certificates, naturalization certificates, or citizenship cards.

You’ll also need proof of your GEICO auto insurance. Present your standard GEICO insurance ID card for proof of coverage. Your vehicle registration is also needed.

GEICO is one of the largest and most successful insurance companies in the United States. However, it’s currently unknown if GEICO plans to extend its offerings into Canada. The Canadian insurance market is extremely competitive, and major GEICO competitors Allstate and State Farm have already established a Canadian presence.

As of this writing, GEICO auto insurance isn’t extending products to Canada, but that could change soon.
