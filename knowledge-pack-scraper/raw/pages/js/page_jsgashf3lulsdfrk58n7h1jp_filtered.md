Progressive does not advertise a defensive driving discount on its website, but you may still be able to get one. Progressive may lower your rates by about 5% if you complete an approved defensive driving course and meet certain qualifications. You may need to be a certain age, have a clean driving record, take the course voluntarily (not by court order), or meet other state-specific criteria to be eligible. You’ll have to speak to a Progressive representative directly to find out the rules where you live.

Most defensive driving courses can be completed online and cost between $15 and $40. Live classes can cost as much as $100. But the cost could be worth it since you’ll get a discount for three years, in most cases. At that time, you should be able to renew the discount by taking the course again.
