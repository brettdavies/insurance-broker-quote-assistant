## Minimum Kansas Auto Insurance Requirements
Kansas is a no-fault insurance state. Drivers turn to their own insurance for medical expenses after an accident, regardless of who is at fault.
To legally drive in Kansas, all motorists are required to carry the following minimum [liability auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/liability-auto-insurance/):
  * $25,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $25,000 property damage liability per accident


Due to the state’s no-fault laws, minimum insurance requirements in Kansas also include $25,000/$50,000 in [personal injury protection](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/personal-injury-protection/ "personal injury protection") and uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM).
These additional requirements protect your out-of-pocket costs after an accident, since each individual driver in Kansas is responsible for their own medical bills and vehicle repairs.
![Uninsured Underinsured Motorist Coverage Definition Card: Best Auto Insurance Companies in Kansas](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
While Kansas minimum insurance coverage requirements do provide some protection, drivers should consider these minimums as only providing minimal coverage and not covering bigger accidents or significant weather-related damage.
Many drivers choose additional car insurance coverage to consider in Kansas, such as collision, comprehensive, gap, and rental reimbursement, for protection against accidents and theft. These options provide greater peace of mind than minimum coverage.

## How to Save on Kansas Auto Insurance
Most Kansas insurers offer a variety of discounts that can help lower the monthly cost of coverage, including savings for bundling policies, insuring multiple vehicles, using anti-theft devices or participating in usage-based programs.
Geico and American Family, among the best home and auto insurance companies in Kansas, offer up to 25% bundling savings, while Liberty Mutual and Nationwide give up to 40% off with usage-based programs.

Beyond traditional discounts, Kansas drivers can further reduce their premiums through practical choices and good financial habits.
Maintaining strong credit often leads to lower rates, as many insurers in the state consider credit-based insurance scores.
  * **Maintain Good Credit** : In Kansas, insurers often use credit history when setting rates. Improving your credit score can lead to lower monthly premiums.
  * **Pay Premiums in Full** : Paying your policy in one annual or semi-annual payment instead of monthly installments can unlock a paid-in-full discount.
  * **Enroll in Paperless Billing or Auto-Pay** : Many insurers offer small but easy savings for opting into electronic documents or automatic payments.
  * **Take a Defensive Driving Course** : Completing a state-approved safety or defensive driving course can qualify drivers, especially teens and seniors, for additional discounts.
  * **Limit Your Annual Mileage** : Driving fewer miles per year can lower your risk profile. Drivers who commute less or work from home may qualify for low-mileage discounts.


Paying premiums in full can remove fees and boost savings. Simple steps like paperless billing or auto-pay also qualify for discounts, as shown in [26 hacks to save money on auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/26-hacks/).
Drivers who take defensive driving courses earn extra savings, and low-mileage drivers may also qualify for discounts.
