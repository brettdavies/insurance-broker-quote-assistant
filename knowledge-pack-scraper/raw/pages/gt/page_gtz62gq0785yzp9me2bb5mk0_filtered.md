# SR-22

Hello, I got into an accident a year ago and my dad never insured me. I got my licenses suspended for 1 year. Immediately after my accident, I got insured. I was unaware that my dad never added me to his policy. I am now trying to reinstate it, however I am so lost. I am currently insured with GEICO. Will filling financial responsibility (sr22) increase my rate or is it simply an add on? I am trying to be responsible about this situation but it’s been really stressful and confusing :(

Update: I talked with an agent!! Since the accident was already on my insurance record, the SR22 will not raise my rate. The agent told me that the accident raised my rate, and the SR22 is just a contract to continue paying my insurance for at least 3 yrs. The only cost is $50 to fill out an SR22 and $150 to the dmv to reinstate my actual license. Will update when I get everything done later this month (California)

Update: I got my license!! I paid $50 for the SR22 and abt $120 to the dmv (safety test n reinstatement fee). I learned my lesson big time, however my insurance rate is the same :))
