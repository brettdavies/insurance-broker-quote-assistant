A license suspension and ensuing SR-22 is absolutely going to affect your rate. A suspended license signals to insurance companies you're a higher risk.

If you're over 18, you should sit down with an independent agent near you and go over the basics of insurance. You don't have to do this regularly but you should do it at least once. Your options for which carriers will accept the SR22 are limited now. A local agent will know exactly which carriers will offer coverage and get you quotes from them. It doesn't cost anything, just some time, but then you'll know you're completely covered properly.
You can look for an agent at [www.trustedchoice.com](http://www.trustedchoice.com)

In California call Every Day Insurance 888-731-9999 they can do non=owners Sr-22 or if you have a car you add the SR-22 to that policy. The SR-22 links DMV to the insurance company so that if you let the insurance cancel DMV gets notified & they will suspend your license. In Calif if you have an accident & are not insured the SR-22 is required for 4 yrs & for a DUI/DWI it is 3 yr requirement. Also don't let your insurance lapse as DMV will charge a $55 re-issue fee every time your insurance lapses while you need an SR-22

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors.
### Home Insurance
* **Coverage Types**: You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Rebuild Cost**: Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
* **Personal Property**: Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
* **Bundling**: Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
* **Deductibles**: Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)
### Life Insurance
* **Mortgage Protection**: This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
* **Policy Types**: Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)
### Health Insurance
* **Premium Stability**: Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
* **Enrollment Periods**: You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
* **Employer Plans**: If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)
### Car Insurance
* **Coverage Considerations**: Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
* **Car Choice**: Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
* **VIN Quotes**: Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)
### Additional Tips
* **Use a Broker**: Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Read the Fine Print**: Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
* **Check Claims Handling**: Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)
