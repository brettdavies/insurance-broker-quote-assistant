## The best home insurance companies in San Francisco
Californians are having a hard time securing [home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/) coverage, and San Francisco is no exception. Some of the largest home insurance providers in the state have either stopped writing or seriously scaled back the number of policies they’re willing to write in [California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/california/). Although San Francisco’s position along a peninsula helps shield it from some of the worst of California’s blazing wildfires, the city still has a high chance of getting hit with a damaging earthquake in the next 30 years. 
Limited provider availability, coupled with added risk, can make finding Bay Area home insurance difficult. But, Bankrate’s insurance editorial team researched which companies are still writing new policies here. According to our research, USAA, Chubb and Mercury offer some of the best home insurance in San Francisco.

## How much is home insurance in San Francisco, California?
The average cost of San Francisco home insurance is $1,567 per year for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. This is about 5 percent less than the California average of $1,641 per year. Both numbers seem low in comparison to the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) of $2,408, especially considering the high level of wildfire risk.
California law prevents insurers from raising rates in excess of 7 percent, which locks premiums in at a lower level. While this may seem like a bonus to homeowners, it contributes to the ongoing [insurance crisis in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/carriers-exit-california-home-insurance/). Since companies can’t always raise rates to a level that accurately reflects the risk of insuring a California home, many insurers (like State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, Nationwide and Travelers) have chosen to drastically limit the number of new policies written in California — or stop writing new policies altogether.
Like [auto](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) and life coverage, not only can you tailor a home insurance policy to suit your needs, but your [personal details](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/factors-that-impact-home-insurance-rates/) can also influence the overall cost of your policy. Insurers consider factors like the age of your home and the deductible you choose, as well as if you've filed claims previously.
### San Francisco rates by home age
San Francisco’s beautiful old Victorian homes are part of what gives the city its charm — but they could also be more expensive to insure. In fact, U.S. Census data shows that [more than half of San Francisco homes](https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/10/06/census-berkeley-san-francisco-and-oakland-have-oldest-housing-stock-in-the-west/) were built before World War II. Older homes typically result in higher home insurance premiums: If a home is built with harder-to-source materials, it could cost an insurer more if the home is deemed a total loss. To account for this potential extra cost, insurers tend to charge higher home insurance rates to older homes.

### San Francisco rates by deductible amount
When considering ways to lower your rates, raising your deductible may be an option, but it might be best to reserve this tactic as a last resort. [Your deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/) is the amount of damage you agree to cover out of pocket in the event of an approved claim. In general, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ######  How can I get home insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
Many home insurance companies offer free online estimates and applications. At the same time, Bankrate provides free web tools to help homeowners [compare rates and policies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-quotes/) from multiple carriers all in one place. Before examining companies, however, it's best to have a clear sense of what you're looking for. Consider the structure and age of your home, as well as whether you may need [additional coverage types](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/). For example, if you have a lot of technology, sports equipment, jewelry or artwork, you may want a carrier that offers higher coverage limits for personal property.
  * ######  How much does home insurance in San Francisco cost?
Caret Down Icon
The average homeowners insurance cost in San Francisco is $1,567 for $300,000 in dwelling coverage, which is slightly lower than the [average cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) statewide ($1,641 per year) and significantly less than the average cost nationwide ($2,408 per year). But the price you’ll pay for home insurance in San Francisco varies based on factors like the size of your home, the crime rate in your ZIP code, the [cost to rebuild your home](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/replacement-cost/) and the coverage you select.
  * ######  Do I need earthquake insurance in San Francisco?
Caret Down Icon
Standard homeowners insurance in San Francisco generally doesn’t cover damage to your home that is caused by earthquakes. This could leave you vulnerable, given that San Francisco is on the active San Andreas Fault, and the Hayward fault and Calaveras fault are also in the greater Bay Area. According to the United States Geological Study, there is a 72 percent chance that the San Francisco area will experience at least one earthquake magnitude 6.7 or higher by 2043. Earthquake insurance, which must be purchased separately, offers financial protection in the event that an earthquake damages your structure or personal property. Most experts agree it’s wise to carry this type of coverage or to make sure your HOA has it if you own a condo.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
