At State Farm, we believe being a good neighbor goes beyond insurance. In 2024, we leaned into that belief—supporting communities, showing up for people in meaningful ways, and doing our part for a more sustainable future.

#### A Place Where People Feel Supported

We’re building a workplace where people feel seen, supported and proud of what they do. That care shows up in how we treat each other—and in the way we show up for you.

* We welcomed over 10,000 new employees this year
* Most of our team works in a flexible or remote setup
* 84% say they’d recommend State Farm as a great place to work
* 86% feel connected to our mission to help people

#### Neighbors Helping Neighbors

Giving back is part of who we are. In 2024, we made significant impacts:

* Gave $7.6 million to help communities recover from disasters
* Donated enough blood to support thousands of patients in need
* Packed over 2.2 million meals for families facing hunger
* Volunteered 1,500+ hours to help kids learn financial skills

#### Doing Our Part for a More Sustainable Future

We’re taking meaningful steps—big and small—to reduce our impact and support resilience in the communities we serve.

* Helped 3.5 million customers go paperless
* Saved enough paper to equal 60,000+ trees
* Cut greenhouse gas emissions by over half since 2019
* Kept 95% of waste out of landfills at our distribution centers
* Gave discounts to 50,000+ customers who chose impact-resistant roofing

#### Keeping Families Safe

Through our Car Seat Safety Program:

* We checked over 5,500 car seats
* We gave out more than 3,000 brand new ones—free of charge

Our customers, employees and agents are at the heart of everything we do. Because being a good neighbor means always finding new ways to show up—and follow through. Learn more in the [2024 Impact Report](https://impact.statefarm.com/data/docs/2024/2024_Impact_Report_accessible.pdf).
