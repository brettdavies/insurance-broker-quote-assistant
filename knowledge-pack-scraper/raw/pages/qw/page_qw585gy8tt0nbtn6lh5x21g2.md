At State Farm, we believe being a good neighbor goes beyond insurance. In 2024, we leaned into that belief—supporting communities, showing up for people in meaningful ways, and doing our part for a more sustainable future.
#### A Place Where People Feel Supported
We’re building a workplace where people feel seen, supported and proud of what they do. That care shows up in how we treat each other—and in the way we show up for you.
  * We welcomed over 10,000 new employees this year
  * Most of our team works in a flexible or remote setup
  * 84% say they’d recommend State Farm as a great place to work
  * 86% feel connected to our mission to help people


#### Neighbors Helping Neighbors
Giving back is part of who we are. In 2024, we made significant impacts:
  * Gave $7.6 million to help communities recover from disasters
  * Donated enough blood to support thousands of patients in need
  * Packed over 2.2 million meals for families facing hunger
  * Volunteered 1,500+ hours to help kids learn financial skills


#### Doing Our Part for a More Sustainable Future
We’re taking meaningful steps—big and small—to reduce our impact and support resilience in the communities we serve.
  * Helped 3.5 million customers go paperless
  * Saved enough paper to equal 60,000+ trees
  * Cut greenhouse gas emissions by over half since 2019
  * Kept 95% of waste out of landfills at our distribution centers
  * Gave discounts to 50,000+ customers who chose impact-resistant roofing


#### Keeping Families Safe
Through our Car Seat Safety Program:
  * We checked over 5,500 car seats
  * We gave out more than 3,000 brand new ones—free of charge


Our customers, employees and agents are at the heart of everything we do. Because being a good neighbor means always finding new ways to show up—and follow through. Learn more in the [2024 Impact Report](https://impact.statefarm.com/data/docs/2024/2024_Impact_Report_accessible.pdf).
