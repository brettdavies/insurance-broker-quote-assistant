# State Farm raised policy $956 month!

We’ve already gotten the typical raise of $200 the past year. Now they’ve raised my policy over $956 per month! We went from $499.98 to $1456.29. They claim it’s due to adding a youthful driver. I have two other children that were added as youthful drivers and our policy went up around $70, yes it was pre-Covid so I expected it to be higher this go round. $956!?! Is anyone else experiencing this?

I don’t even see my son listed on the policy anywhere and the only change I see is the 81 el Camino went from $186 month to $1116 a month.

I used to think Marketplace plans were the only affordable health insurance option. Then I learned private PPOs can cost less + let you keep your doctor. We’re a family-run agency helping people compare plans—no spam calls or call centers. If your premium keeps climbing, let's check your options.
