### Why Is Car Insurance More Expensive In Pennsylvania?

![accident2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/accident_2_vlzgqz.svg)

Choice No-Fault Insurance System

[Pennsylvania operates a unique](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pennsylvania-no-fault-car-insurance.html) "choice no-fault" insurance system, allowing drivers to choose between "limited tort" and "full tort" coverage options. Under limited tort coverage, drivers give up most rights to sue for pain and suffering damages in exchange for lower premiums. Full tort coverage preserves all legal rights to seek compensation, including non-economic damages, but comes with higher premiums. This choice directly impacts pricing as insurers must account for different claim scenarios and legal exposures based on the coverage option selected.

![uninsured icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/uninsured_jck1df.svg)

Low Uninsured Motorist Rates

Pennsylvania has one of the lower uninsured motorist rates in the nation, though urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have higher concentrations of uninsured drivers. While the state overall performs well compared to national averages, many drivers carry only minimum coverage, which is often insufficient to cover serious injuries. Pennsylvania requires insurers to offer uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, though drivers can reject it in writing.

![hurricane icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/hurricane_oc1qon.svg)

Moderate Vehicle Theft Rates

Pennsylvania experiences moderate car theft rates compared to national averages, with State College ranking among the cities with the lowest motor car theft rates in the state. However, urban areas higher theft risks, and Pennsylvania operates the Auto Theft Prevention Authority to combat car theft statewide.

Above-Average Insurance Costs

Pennsylvania drivers pay higher rates for full coverage and minimum coverage insurance compared to many other states, with monthly averages reflecting the state's unique insurance requirements. These rates reflect the state's unique insurance requirements, including mandatory medical benefits coverage and the choice no-fault system. Urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh see higher rates due to increased traffic density, higher crime rates and more frequent claims.

![handcuffs2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/handcuffs_2_mug1xe.svg)

Credit Score Impact Restrictions

Pennsylvania doesn't allow insurance companies to use gender as an auto insurance rating factor, which distinguishes it from many other states. However, credit scores still impact rates, with drivers with poor credit paying substantially more than those with excellent credit. This regulatory approach means demographics have less impact on pricing compared to driving history and credit factors.

![travel icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/travel_sqsivm.svg)

Complex Legal Framework

Pennsylvania's insurance system creates unique legal complexities that affect pricing. The state operates under both no-fault and fault-based systems simultaneously, with medical benefits paid regardless of fault while property damage follows traditional fault-based rules. Pennsylvania law states that insurance rates can't increase if you file a claim under uninsured motorist coverage when you're not at fault, providing additional consumer protection.

![theftSecurity icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/theftSecurity_hpdsaw.svg)

While Pennsylvania doesn't mandate comprehensive coverage, the state's varied geography and weather conditions make it valuable protection. The state experiences winter weather, hailstorms and other natural events that can damage cars. Pennsylvania's Division of Motor Cars emphasizes the importance of adequate coverage given the state's insurance requirements and legal framework. The choice no-fault system also means drivers need to consider how different coverage options affect their ability to recover damages.

![bank icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/bank_xefjcz.svg)

Mandatory Medical Benefits Coverage

Pennsylvania requires all drivers to carry at least $5,000 in medical benefits coverage, which pays for medical expenses regardless of fault. This no-fault medical coverage ensures immediate payment for medical bills without determining fault first. [The state has been](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance) a no-fault state since 1990, making this coverage mandatory for all drivers. This requirement adds to the base cost of insurance but provides immediate medical protection for policyholders and their passengers.

### How We Determined Pennsylvania Car Insurance Costs

Pennsylvania drivers face complex insurance requirements with the state's unique choice between full tort and limited tort options, making it critical to understand what coverage actually costs before you choose your policy structure. We built this analysis to show you what you'll pay based on your location, coverage choices, and driving profile across Pennsylvania's diverse insurance markets.

We collected rate data across all available ZIP codes and cities in Pennsylvania, ensuring our analysis reflects the significant pricing differences between urban Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and rural counties where accident frequency and repair costs vary dramatically.

We used a 40-year-old driver with a clean driving record and good credit operating a 2012 Toyota Camry LE. From there, we adjusted variables to show how age, driving history, credit score, and vehicle type affect premiums across Pennsylvania's diverse communities.

We analyzed two coverage scenarios:

* **Minimum Coverage:** Pennsylvania's required liability limits that satisfy legal requirements but provide minimal financial protection
* **Full Coverage:** **100/300/100 liability limits** plus comprehensive and collision with **$1,000 deductibles**, which protects both your financial liability and your vehicle itself

Why this methodology works: Pennsylvania's tort system choice affects your premiums significantly, with limited tort policies costing less but restricting your ability to sue for pain and suffering after accidents. Our analysis shows you baseline costs for standard coverage, helping you understand what you'll pay before making the tort election decision that impacts both your premiums and your legal rights after a crash.

This approach prioritizes real-world accuracy for Pennsylvania drivers navigating one of the country's more complex auto insurance systems, where ZIP code location and coverage structure choices create substantial rate variations even for identical drivers.
