Your home and auto insurance offer financial protection if you injure someone or damage their property. However, in some cases, you may want umbrella insurance to protect your assets in the event of a large liability claim or a legal judgment.

## **Key Takeaways**
  * [Umbrella insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/umbrella-insurance#what-is-it) extends your bodily injury and property damage liability coverage beyond your standard policy limits. 
  * These policies can offer $1 million to $10 million in coverage or more. 
  * Having an umbrella insurance policy [may be worth](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/umbrella-insurance#who-needs-it) it if you have a high net worth, regularly entertain guests at your home, or have a swimming pool, among other things.


## What Is Umbrella Insurance?
Pros:
  * Additional financial protection against liabilities
  * Cost is low compared to the coverage


Cons:
  * Limits may not be high enough to cover certain events


Umbrella insurance is an optional policy that adds additional financial protection beyond your personal liability coverage on your home, car, or other insurance policy.
You may purchase up to $1 million or more of umbrella coverage, depending on the insurance company. For example, [Travelers](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/travelers) offers up to $10 million and [Chubb](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/chubb) offers up to $100 million in coverage.
## How Does Umbrella Insurance Work?
If you’re liable for more damages than your bodily injury and property damage liability insurance covers, then your umbrella insurance can take care of the balance.
Here’s an example. Let’s say your friend visits your home, trips on your front steps, and sues you for $500,000 due to their injuries. You only have $300,000 in liability coverage.
If you don’t have umbrella insurance, you’re on the hook for the remaining $200,000 in damages. However, if you have umbrella insurance, it will pay the $200,000 damage, leaving you with no out-of-pocket expenses other than your policy deductible.
## What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?
Umbrella insurance covers the same items that your liability insurance would cover under a standard policy; it just provides higher limits.  

  * **Bodily injury:** It covers bodily injuries if a guest is injured in your home. 
  * **Property damage:** It covers damages you or those on your policy cause.
  * **Legal expenses:** It covers expenses from a lawsuit related to bodily injury or property damage liability. 
  * **Slander, libel, and personal defamation:** It covers costs if you’re sued for making statements that fall under these categories.


## What Doesn’t Umbrella Insurance Cover?
Umbrella insurance covers many damages, but here’s what it excludes:  

  * **Intentional damages:** Insurance is intended to cover accidents only, so any damage you cause intentionally won’t be covered. 
  * **Business or occupation-related damages:** You’ll need a [business liability insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/business-liability-insurance) policy to cover business-related damages. 
  * **Damage to your property:** Your umbrella policy will only cover damages to others’ property, not your own. Your standard homeowners insurance should cover that. 
  * **Injuries you sustain:** You’ll need health insurance or another part of your insurance policy (such as [personal injury protection](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-coverage-options)) to cover your injuries or those of another member of your household. 


## Who Needs Umbrella Insurance?
While your standard policy limits are enough in many situations, for some, having an umbrella policy offers the peace of mind you need. Here are some reasons you may want this additional coverage:  

  * You have a rental property
  * You have a high net worth
  * You regularly entertain guests at your home
  * You participate in extreme sports or dangerous hobbies
  * You’re a public figure
  * You have a swimming pool or trampoline
  * You own a dog or other large or exotic animal


## How Much Umbrella Insurance Do I Need?
When determining how much umbrella insurance you need, calculate the value of your property and assets. These may include jewelry, antiques, art, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, cash, and savings accounts.
Once you have this amount, your insurance agent can advise you about selecting the right amount of coverage. Keep in mind that the assets that are at risk if you’re sued can vary by state, so having this information can help you better estimate your insurance needs.
## How Much Does Umbrella Insurance Cost?
The cost of an umbrella insurance policy will vary based on many factors. The primary factor is your coverage amount.
For example, a $1 million umbrella policy will cost less than a $100 million policy. With that in mind, the best way to know how much you’ll pay is to get quotes from different insurers.
## FAQ
Does umbrella insurance cover dog bites?
Yes, an umbrella insurance policy can cover dog bites. It’s commonly recommended that those with dogs maintain an umbrella insurance policy in case their dog bites someone and the damages exceed standard policy limits.
Should I buy umbrella coverage if my home has a swimming pool?
Yes, you should consider having umbrella coverage if you own a pool because having one is a major liability that could lead to costly damages if someone is injured.
Can I get umbrella coverage for my business?
Yes, you can get a commercial umbrella policy for your business. Your policy may extend your general liability or commercial automobile limits. It works similarly to a regular umbrella policy that you’d have for your home or car.
Is umbrella insurance worth it?
Having an umbrella insurance policy may be worth it because it provides higher limits that protect you against large claims and lawsuits. If you have a high net worth, significant assets, or a high-risk lifestyle (e.g., own aggressive dog breeds or have a swimming pool), you may want to secure a policy.
What's the best umbrella policy?
The best umbrella policy for you will depend on many factors. Start by determining your coverage needs and ensuring the company can meet them. Next, compare quotes from companies that offer your required coverage, and be sure it fits your budget. Finally, look into the companies further, considering the claims process, policy exclusions, customer service availability, along with other aspects that are important to you. 
Completing this process should help you determine the best umbrella policy that fits your needs.
