# What Is Full Coverage in New York?
Full coverage in New York refers to an [auto insurance policy](https://www.cohenjaffe.com/lawyer-auto-insurance) with limits beyond the mandated minimums. Maximum auto insurance coverage in New York generally includes:
  * No-fault coverage (personal injury protection)
  * Liability coverage
  * [Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist](https://www.cohenjaffe.com/blog/accidents-uninsured-drivers/) coverage (UM/UIM coverage)
  * Property damage coverage
  * Comprehensive coverage


New York state does not require you to have all these insurance types. However, those who have “full coverage” may pay for each of these coverage types.
![what is full coverage ny 300x200 1](https://www.cohenjaffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/what-is-full-coverage-ny-300x200-1.jpeg)
## Understanding New York’s Mandatory Auto Insurance Requirements
[New York follows a **no-fault insurance system**](https://www.cohenjaffe.com/faqs/is-new-york-a-no-fault-state/) , meaning your insurance pays for medical expenses and other losses, regardless of who caused the accident. The required PIP coverage ensures quick access to funds for:
  * Medical costs.
  * Lost wages (up to a capped amount).
  * Essential services (e.g., transportation, household help).


In addition to PIP, liability coverage protects you if you’re at fault for someone else’s injury or property damage. For drivers in Nassau County, where traffic congestion can lead to frequent accidents, carrying only the minimum can leave you financially vulnerable.
To address the question, **what is the minimum auto insurance coverage in New York?** —It’s the state’s base-level requirement, but not necessarily adequate for all accident scenarios.
## What is the Minimum Auto Insurance Coverage in New York? 2025 Update
New York requires all registered vehicles to carry at least the following minimum [auto insurance coverage](https://dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-requirements) to operate on public roads legally:
  * **$25,000** for bodily injury per person and **$50,000** per accident.
  * **$50,000** for death per person and **$100,000** per accident.
  * **$10,000** for property damage per accident.
  * **$50,000** in personal injury protection (PIP), regardless of fault.
  * Uninsured motorist coverage equal to bodily injury minimums.


While these limits satisfy state law, they may not provide sufficient protection if you’re involved in a serious car accident. Many drivers in Nassau County opt for additional liability, collision, and comprehensive policies to protect themselves and their families better.
## Penalties for Driving Without Minimum Auto Insurance in New York
Driving without at least the minimum required auto insurance violates New York law and can lead to severe penalties. According to the[ New York State DMV](https://dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-lapses), penalties may include:
  * Suspension of your vehicle registration.
  * Suspension of your driver’s license.
  * Daily fines of $8 for each day your insurance lapses (up to 90 days).
  * A civil penalty of $750 to reinstate your license after a revocation.
  * Possible vehicle impoundment or legal action in the event of an uninsured accident.


If you’re caught driving without coverage in Nassau County, you can expect law enforcement to enforce these consequences strictly. This is another reason why it’s crucial to understand **what is the minimum auto insurance coverage in New York** and ensure you’re always in compliance—not just for legal protection, but to shield yourself financially if you’re involved in a crash.
## How to File an Insurance Claim After an Accident in New York
**To file an insurance claim after a car accident in New York, follow these steps to protect your rights and ensure timely compensation:**
  1. **Report the accident immediately** to law enforcement if injuries or significant property damage occur.
  2. **Notify your insurance provider** within 24 hours or as soon as reasonably possible.
  3. **File a No-Fault application (Form NF-2)** within 30 days of the accident to receive PIP benefits.
  4. **Retain medical and expense documentation** , including records of lost wages.
  5. [**Consult a car accident attorney**](https://www.cohenjaffe.com/long-island-car-accident-lawyer/) if injuries exceed the no-fault threshold or involve third-party liability.


New York’s insurance process can be especially complex when serious injuries are involved. Residents of Nassau County dealing with disputed claims, underinsured drivers, or extensive damages often benefit from legal guidance to protect their right to compensation.
## What Are the Optional Auto Insurance Coverages in New York?
Comprehensive coverage, collision coverage, and gap coverage are all optional coverages in New York. You may also purchase additional coverage specifically for:
  * Medical care
  * Funeral expenses
  * Rental car expenses
  * Roadside automotive services
  * Personal injury costs
  * Optional basic economic losses (OBEL)


Full coverage in New York can refer to any coverage beyond minimum limits. However, those who want the greatest possible protection may purchase a combination of these coverages.
New York has a no-fault auto insurance model. In this model, motorists’ own PIP coverage pays for their losses. [New York State’s Department of Financial Services (DFS)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements) explains that PIP coverage may pay for:
  * Healthcare expenses
  * Lost earnings
  * “Certain other reasonable and necessary expenses related to injuries sustained”


Your coverage limits will determine how much PIP coverage your insurer provides. You may also speak with your insurer about how it distributes coverage between each covered loss.
You may file a lawsuit if your PIP coverage does not fully cover your economic losses. The other driver generally must be at fault for the accident for you to file a lawsuit. When you file a lawsuit, you may seek coverage of:
  * Property damage beyond your policy’s coverage limits
  * Economic costs like lost income and medical care
  * Pain and suffering caused by “serious injury”


Insurance coverage has monetary limits. When you sue a liable party for damages, there is no defined limit. You may receive compensation to match your losses.
Your lawyer’s primary role may be dealing with insurance companies. Challenges may arise during the insurance process, and your lawyer will address them. Insurance companies may:
  * Try to void your claim
  * Accuse you of being at fault for your accident, even if you are not
  * Withhold certain portions of your coverage
  * Delay paying your claim
  * Employ other tactics that are against your interests


Your lawyer will represent you with the insurance companies. By shielding you from insurers, they may resolve your claim while defending your rights.
If you need to file a lawsuit for additional coverage, we can handle the legal process for you. We can:
  * Gather the police report from your accident
  * Obtain witness accounts of your accident
  * Obtain other evidence from your accident
  * Draft and file your lawsuit
  * Value your damages
  * Negotiate a settlement


You may recover compensation from both an insurance claim and a lawsuit. Our firm will review your case and identify the appropriate strategy.
A lawyer on our team can be a great help regardless of your final course of action. We can review your case promptly and help you with your claim or lawsuit.
