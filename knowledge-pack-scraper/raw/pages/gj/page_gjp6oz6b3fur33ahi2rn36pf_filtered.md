# Minimum car insurance requirements in Texas

Texas laws require drivers to carry minimum car insurance coverage of 30/60/25. It is important for all Texas drivers to have at least the minimum coverage to comply with state law and drive legally. Skip to article

Car insurance is required in almost every state, but the minimum amount drivers must purchase varies.

In Texas, drivers must carry a minimum of 30/60/25 of auto insurance to legally drive a vehicle.

State minimum car insurance is the minimum liability coverage your state requires. It covers the accidental bodily injury and property damage you cause to others. It doesn’t, however, cover damage to your car or your injuries.

“Liability coverages will help protect you in the event you cause injury or damage to another person or other property,” says Rick Kautzer, director of product management at insurer Dairyland Insurance.

While meeting the minimum requirements in Texas is a legal obligation, it is worth considering getting more than just bare-bones coverage. The state minimum is rarely enough to protect your finances in case of a costly accident. Paying for additional coverage can offer better protection and can help safeguard your finances.

## What is the minimum amount of car insurance required in Texas?

See the minimum liability insurance requirements for Texas in the table below:

| Insurance coverage required | Coverage limits |
| --- | --- |
| Bodily injury liability | $30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident |
| Property damage liability | $25,000 per accident |

This is the minimum coverage that drivers must purchase in Texas to meet the state’s financial responsibility laws.

However, this is rarely sufficient protection in case of an accident, which is why Texas drivers should consider getting more coverage than the state-mandated coverage limits.

CarInsurance.com editors recommend liability limits of 100/300/100 with full coverage for most drivers. These limits mean you’re protected within the following amounts:

* Up to $100,000 for the medical bills of those you injure.
* Bodily injury liability of up to $300,000 per accident.
* Up to $100,000 to repair other drivers’ cars and property that you damage.

## Is the state minimum enough car insurance in Texas?

[State minimum car insurance](/Articles/minimum-liability-car-insurance-requirements-by-state.aspx) is the minimum level of coverage required by Texas law. While it may be sufficient to meet Texas’s legal requirements, it won’t necessarily provide adequate protection if you are involved in an accident.

Texas minimum car insurance includes liability coverage, which helps cover damages caused to others in an accident for which you are at fault – up to the policy’s limits.

However, it does not cover damages to your own vehicle or injuries you sustain in an accident.

“You should carefully review the amount of coverage you’re being quoted and determine whether it offers the protection you need,” Kautzer says.

## What other car insurance coverage is available in Texas?

Make sure you consider the value of your vehicle, your driving habits and your financial situation before you decide on a policy.

## Why must drivers purchase Texas’s car insurance minimums?

Texas drivers are required to purchase minimum liability car insurance of 30/60/25. Failing to meet these minimum requirements can result in fines, license suspension or other legal consequences.

Minimum liability car insurance provides some financial protection to drivers and others who drive the policyholder’s vehicle, but only up to the policy’s limits. This type of insurance covers the cost of repairing or replacing someone else’s vehicle, as well as covering the cost of their medical expenses up to the policy’s limits. It even covers legal fees that may arise from accidents.

However, it’s minimum coverage. Texas drivers will face significant out-of-pocket expenses after an at-fault accident if their limits are low and damages exceed them.
