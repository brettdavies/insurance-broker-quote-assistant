# Driving veterans’ lives forward

## See the impact of the Keys to Progress® program

Since it started in 2013, we've continued to grow and expand our reach through the Keys to Progress program. Whether it's going on The Today Show, adding new sponsors to support our veterans, or adding events in new cities, we are committed to supporting our military veterans and the work it takes to live out our purpose.

This program is a way for us to come together as a company to give back to people who have given so much. Across the country our employees are volunteering to select vehicles to be gifted, organizing fundraising activities for recipient families, and planning memorable moments for our annual event.

LEAH:

Life is hard. You've all had loss. And sometimes we just need a hand up. And so thank you.

SPEAKER 1:

As a company, we recognize the critical need within our communities to support our military men and women who are confronting challenging circumstances. One of Progressive's foundational values is the Golden Rule, and Keys to Progress® provides a meaningful opportunity to put this principle into practice.

SPEAKER 2:

After today's event, Progressive will have gifted more than 1,100 vehicles since 2013. This is to help our veterans and their families get back out on the road and move forward in life.

BRANDON:

I've never been awarded or won anything really in my life. And especially for people to recognize what I've done is overwhelming.

GAIL:

It's just fabulous. It's so nice to have people out there who are looking out for those who have served. There's no words that can state how beneficial that is.

SPEAKER 3:

Thank you. Thank you.

LEAH:

My old car, we had had for 15 years, and it becomes a part of the family, all the memories you make in it. And so this is the next chapter in our lives. I think maybe I'll take the long way home today.

Taking care of veterans is a value, one that extends beyond our Keys to Progress events and into our work culture. From veterans that are co-workers, friends, family members, or customers, we're proud to have so many connections to our country's great service people.

Our employees put in hundreds of hours to make our Keys to Progress event successful, but they also contribute to other military causes within our walls. MILNET (Progressive's Military Network) is just one example of that. They're an employee resource group, founded and run by our employees that work to support our country's veterans and active military beyond our annual event.

SHANITA:

For a long time, I didn't know if I was coming or going.

SPEAKER 1:

Keys to Progress is an annual event to honor and give back to our veterans communities, their families. And we're honored today as Progressive to be giving away our thousandth vehicle since the program began in 2013, so a real huge milestone.

JOHN MURPHY:

What feels so good about this program is truly giving back to those who have sacrificed so much for us. And this is a chance for us to make things a little bit easier.

And then, to hear the stories afterwards about how they have put this new transportation to good use, now they have this opportunity truly to move forward.

CHRIS:

What went through my head is, this is for me? No maintenance, a year's warranty, six months of insurance, it is a measure of hope for me.

ISAAC:

This is going to mean stability for me and my kids. I feel good. I feel like it's a new beginning.

RICK:

It means independence now. It's the perfect vehicle for my family.

SHANITA:

Can I do a little dance?
That's what it means. To have someone actually see you is amazing.

It's the greatest gift. It's better than winning the lottery. It's more than just the car. Everything's looking up. Everything's really looking up right now.

SPEAKER 2:

We love it.

SPEAKER 3:

Thank you all so much.
