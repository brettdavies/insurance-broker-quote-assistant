# Progressive Defensive Driving Discount: What It Is + How To Get It

Driving is an essential part of modern life; it provides convenience, mobility, and independence. However, it also comes with its risks. Car accidents can lead to serious injuries, financial burdens, and skyrocketing insurance premiums. As a result, insurance companies continuously seek ways to promote safer driving habits. One effective strategy they use is the idea of defensive driving, which focuses on proactive behaviors to reduce the likelihood of accidents and injuries. In this context, Progressive Insurance offers a valuable program known as the Defensive Driving Discount, enabling policyholders to save money while encouraging safer driving.

## What Is the Progressive Defensive Driving Discount?

The Progressive Defensive Driving Discount is a financial incentive available to customers who have completed an approved defensive driving course. This program is designed not only to lower insurance premiums but also to foster safer driving habits among policyholders. Insurance companies, including Progressive, recognize that drivers who take the initiative to educate themselves about safe driving techniques are generally less likely to be involved in accidents, resulting in fewer claims.

By opting for a defensive driving course, policyholders can save a percentage on their insurance premium, effectively rewarding them for their commitment to safe driving practices. The specifics of the discount can vary based on several factors, including location, course completion, and individual driving history.

## The Importance of Defensive Driving

Defensive driving is a set of skills that promotes safe driving habits. It involves anticipating potential hazards, making quick decisions, and employing techniques designed to prevent accidents. Defensive drivers are trained to:

1. **Stay Alert:** Remain focused and avoid distractions.
2. **Maintain Safe Distances:** Allow adequate space between their vehicle and others to react effectively to changing road conditions.
3. **Observe Traffic Rules:** Comply with speed limits, traffic signals, and road signage.
4. **Be Prepared for the Unexpected:** Anticipate the actions of other drivers and pedestrians.
5. **Use Turn Signals and Mirrors:** Communicate intentions clearly to other road users.

Defensive driving courses typically cover these principles and many more. Enrolling in such a program can enhance drivers’ skills and preparedness on the road, ultimately benefiting everyone.

The Defensive Driving Discount is not just an avenue for savings; it comes with a host of other advantages:

1. **Lower Premiums:** The primary benefit of the discount is reduced insurance premiums, which can result in significant annual savings.
2. **Enhanced Driver Safety:** Completing a defensive driving course makes drivers more vigilant and skilled behind the wheel, contributing to overall road safety.
3. **Potential for Additional Discounts:** Some states offer additional discounts for completing defensive driving courses, which can combine with the Progressive discount.
4. **Improved Driving Record:** With enhanced skills and techniques, drivers may become less likely to receive traffic violations, leading to further savings over time.
