# Geico Auto Insurance different rates

We currently have 2 cars with geico insurance for the past 8 years. Geico always been the the lowest for us. I got my 6 month renewal for july and it was quoted for 1400.00. Highest ever been so I decided to shop around and progressive came out to 1000 for same policy which I will or plan to switch.

I decided to try something with geico. I went to a geico agent website to get a auto quote, it took me to the same geico webpage. I put in the exact info and names choosing the same policy I current got the renewal for. the new rate geico gave me was 908.00.

Anybody experience this or done it this way before? Is this some geico trick hoping people will be lazy and automatically assume the renewal rate is the lowest?
