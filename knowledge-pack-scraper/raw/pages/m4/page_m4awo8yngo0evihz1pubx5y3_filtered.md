In the latest expansion of the State Farm and U.S. Bank alliance, State Farm customers can now apply for U.S. Bank personal loans for up to $50,000 working directly with their agent. The new offering joins the existing suite of U.S. Bank products accessible through State Farm agents that includes deposits, co-branded credit cards and a full suite of business banking products and services.  

“Together, we have already helped more than 900,000 State Farm customers access the financial products they need through their agent relationships,” Arijit Roy, head of consumer and business banking products at U.S. Bank.  “Our strategy around alliances and collaborations is one we continue to invest in to reach new customers and help grow our business.”

The opportunity to offer U.S. Bank personal loans will be available to all State Farm agents and is the latest expansion of the collaboration between the two dating back to early 2020.

For qualified borrowers, U.S. Bank personal loans can provide one-time funding for any major purchase or project, including home improvements, debt consolidation or a vehicle purchase. U.S. Bank recently expanded its availability of personal loans to include all 50 states.

“At State Farm, we are committed to providing financial products that help meet the needs of our customers. Adding U.S. Bank unsecured personal lending to an already robust banking suite enhances our ability to add value and help meet the evolving financial needs of the State Farm customer,” said Luke Kasten, head of Corporate & Business Development for State Farm. “We’re excited about the opportunity for State Farm agents to help more people in more ways by expanding the alliance with U.S. Bank.”
