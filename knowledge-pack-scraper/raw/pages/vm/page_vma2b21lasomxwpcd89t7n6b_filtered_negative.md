The table below shows how average [insurance rates vary by company after one DUI](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/dui-and-car-insurance-common-questions.html). Insurance rates do increase after a DUI, but the rise isn't as steep as it is for multiple violations.

The cheapest company for SR-22 insurance after a reckless driving conviction is **GEICO**, with an average rate of **$3,466** per year.

No matter the cause, reckless driving in California leads to fines, an SR-22 requirement and higher car insurance rates.

California might require you to file an SR-22 form even if you don't own a car as a prerequisite to get your license back. If you borrow or rent a car occasionally, you can get [non-owner SR-22](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/non-owner-car-insurance/non-owner-sr22-insurance) insurance, which meets legal requirements, and the SR-22 can be filed with that policy.
It is important to note that [non-owner car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/faq/insurance-for-non-car-owner.aspx) only provides extra liability coverage when you drive someone else's car. If you buy a car, you will require the right insurance to legally drive it in California.
* **Taking a defensive driving course.** Some insurers offer a [discount for completing the course](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/saving-money/defensive-driving-classes-save-on-car-insurance.html), and some states remove points from your license, which can help lower your insurance rates.
