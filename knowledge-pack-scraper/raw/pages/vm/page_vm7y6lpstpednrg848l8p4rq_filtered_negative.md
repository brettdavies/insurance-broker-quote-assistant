It also incentives the insurance company to fight the suit.

Yes. Private insurance umbrellas will even let you pick counsel. I have Cincinnati private client and it’s a part of the umbrella policy.
Also at a certain point everything goes into a trust. On paper you should be as broke as broke can be. Irrevocable trusts everywhere.

Defined contribution pension plans like 401K and 403B plans are protected by federal law. Protections for IRAs are very heavily state- dependent.

I think your umbrella insurance should be based on how risky your behaviors and property are and should have little to do with your net worth.
If you have a 2 million dollar umbrella and your net worth is 1 million or 10 million, having an above policy judgement will likely hurt the person with lower net worth more than the person with more. I find it highly unlikely you would ever have a judgement above 5 million.

Lawyer here (not your lawyer). Imagine you blinked while driving, ran a red light and killed somebody while driving a reasonably nice car (Mercedes, Lexus, BWM, Audi, Tesla.. Not a Ferrari, Bentley etc). Imagine for purposes of this hypotetical that you have a $250k/person $500k policy with GEICO.
The widow of the person you killed, walks into any random law firm. The law firm send a demand letter to GEICO and GEICO settles the case for your $250k limit. The lawyer makes $83,333.33 (33.3% of $250,000) for few hours work and says, sorry that was all the coverage that was available.
Now imagine you have a $5M umbrella. The lawyer demands the full $5M. The umbrella offers only $1M to settle has the dead guy was only making $50,000 a year. The case goes to trial and there is a verdict for $20M and now that lawyer wants to go after you for the excess veridct (after collecting $5M from the excess umbrella carrier).
You can have to much insurance.
An umbrella could very easily back fire and I have seen umbrellas back fire.
If you lose sleep over getting sued, you should sit down with a lawyer not a financial planner. For 40 basis points or less (4 tenths of 1%), you could put $1M into a Fidelity variable annuity that in most states would be exempt from the claims of creditors.
You can also put assets into a trust that is asset protected.
If you are in Florida (where I practice) you can take other steps to avoid joint creditors.. i.e, wife drives a car owned only be the wife and husband drives car owned only by husband so you don't have both husband and wife as Defendants because both names were on title to the car or wife was driver and husband was the owner.
If you have 5M of not retirement stock, a few million in retirement accounts and own a home, if over the next 20 years those assets double twice, you may also be looking at significant estate taxes, if your estate is $30M plus in 20 years. Setting up a trust before the end of 2025, could save on estate taxes down the road.
Most financial planners just sell financial products (insurance, annuities) and collect Assets under Management at 1% of assets a year but lack real world experience with many of these issues.
DO NOT buy an annuity from your financial planner. Some annuities are laden with sales loads, fees, and surrender charges. If you get an annuity Fidelity or Vanguard on a self-managed basis is the way to go.

The current tax plan is set to expire and the estate tax exemption drops by ~60%
But the current plan is going to get extended so it's not that big of a deal

That’s because most people offering advice about insurance are not attorneys. First thing a litigator is going to do to see whether it’s worth pursuing a potential claim is determine how deep the pockets are. Being over-insured makes you a very attractive target.
ETA: It appears there are a lot of insurance salesmen in here who are pretty mad about the attorneys stepping on their toes in this thread and potentially undercutting their commissions. One of them PM’d me. Folks, get your asset protection and risk management advice from licensed and qualified professionals who are liable for the advice they give you.

This is awful advice. If the OP has 10mm that is accessible in a lawsuit and kills a breadwinner earning 500k+/year with 20 years left to work, they're getting sued for everything whether the umbrella is there or not.
OP. Umbrellas are pennies for dollars. Get the bigger umbrella, get it from a quality carrier and don't look back

That was my reaction as well. Terrible advice from someone claiming to be a lawyer.
I’m not sure how someone would be better off not having additional coverage in that example or worse off with an umbrella coverage.

I am a personal injury attorney and this is horrible advice. I have turned down a policy limit offer before when I know the person has more money and gone after assets. The cost of umbrella coverage for someone in op's position is low compared to the risk. A person can be over insured, but having liability insurance that covers value of reachable assets is exactly the level of insurance someone should have.
Also, your scenario does not make sense. Florida like most other jurisdictions has laws that hold the insurance company responsible if they reject a policy limits demand and then their insured gets hit with a verdict in excess of limits.

Was about to come here to say this. This scenario is unlikely because most plaintiffs attorneys will make a policy limit demand and the insurer not the policy holder takes on the risk of a bad faith action and becoming liable above policy limits if they refuse the demand.

Yeah this advice is terrible. My dad is an outside counsel for various large insurance companies (rarely auto, but if it's a high 6 figure or 7 figure auto case he could get called) he carries a large personal umbrella policy.
Just because some terrible ambulance chasers might be too lazy to go after more than the policy limit doesn't mean a good lawyer won't go after OPs assets in a serious accident.

I am shocked you are a lawyer and giving this advice. You should understand that they can still go after a high net worth person personally above their policy limits if they only have a few hundred thousand in coverage and a very serious claim.

I spent a few years defending insurance carriers and a few decades suing them in Florida. Most lawyers would rather have 1/3 of a $250k settlement, working 4 hours and making $20,000 an hour and be done in a month or two, then taking the alternative. The alternative is turn down GEICO's $250,000 tender, spend a few years getting the case to trial, spend a week or two your life in trial, get a judgment and hope that you can collect. The lawyer has to spend those years hoping that the 98% of the Defendant's money is not in a Trust, retirement accounts, off-shore trusts, and homestead exempt property (in Florida the homestead exemption for asset protection has no dollar limit).
What they can do and what they actually do are very different things. There are plenty of cases where if the limit was big enough to be juicy (250K) the case settles but if the insurance is to much the plaintiff lawyers wants all of it and carrier on a medium injury rolls the dice with a trial.
This is a multi-millionaire not a billionaire. For a billionaire, I would suggest the excess. For somebody who could simply put most of their money where it is safe, have reasonable coverage. It would be a mistake a person in this situation to have a statutory minimum policy of $10,000, $50,000 or in some states no bodily injury coverage at all, but 99% of clients if they hear tender policy limits today and get 2/3rd of $250,000 vs. fight for 3 years and perhaps be able to collect more want money now and most lawyers would prefer to pick the low hanging fruit. This is not legal advice because nobody has retained my services and the amount of insurance coverage to carry depends widely on what state a person lives in, that states asset protection laws, and what tools are available.
I recall full well a trial in Florida where a claimant sustained a knewe injury that required minor knee surgery (debridement with scope). At mediation the case did not settle because the carrier wanted to pay only $100,000 and the Plaintiff wanted the full $250k of coverage. The case went to trial, the defense lawyer did a horrible job. The claimant did not miss a day or work, was young and had a nearly full recovery. The jury hated the defense lawyer and came back with a million dollar verdict. If this Defendant had only a $100k policy instead of a $250k policy the case would have settled at mediation for the policy limit. Having more insurance is not always better.

Or a much more reasonable and likely scenario is that the lawyer will get the $250k limit from the auto insurance and then pursue the individual personally for additional money because whether they have insurance or not they still have additional assets.

The carrier will not payout the $250k limit without a release of their insured the policy holder.

This is very helpful, but I have a couple of questions about the scenario you painted:
* if I kill someone with my car, and have $5 million in exposed assets (but have only $250k liability insurance), isn’t the plaintiff’s attorney highly motivated to go over my $5 million (even if getting the $250k payout from the insurance company is easier than going trial to get my $5 million)?
* If I have $5 million in exposed assets AND a $5 million liability policy, I’d expect my insurer to pay out the full policy amount to protect my assets. Am I naive to think that my insurer won’t protect my $5 million? The plaintiff COULD sue me for $20 million, but if $5 is all I have, it’s hard to imagine how they’d get more than the $5 million.
What am I missing?

The plaintiff’s lawyer does not know what assets you have and what portion of your assets are exposed. If your carrier thinks the claim is not worth 5M they will not offer $5m to settle they are just on the hook for the first $5m of any judgment. If there is a $10m judgment you are liable for the excess but might have a claim against your carrier for bad faith if they could have settled for policy limit and failed to do so in bad faith.

If the insurer rejected an offer to settle for policy limits, and then lost the case for more than policy limits, the insurer would be on the hook for the full judgement for negotiating in bad faith.

In your scenario I imagine the insurer on the hook for 5 million would appeal? Higher limits incentive the carrier to protect the policy limits no? I can understand the underlying carrier like geico just saying fuck it not worth it here’s 250k. But with 5mm on the line the game changes (this is also why it’s best to have your umbrella and auto policy with the same carrier)

Umbrella’s are cost effective. Most attorneys do not want to chase you, but will demand the policy so the carrier faces a possible “Bad faith” suit in the event of an excess verdict in a serious case.

"Have enough in the bank to do what you want." This is a place for people who have reached or are interested in reaching the milestone of Coast Financial Independence / Retire Early (aka Coast FIRE). Coast FIRE is when you have enough saved and invested that with no additional contributions, your net worth will increase with compounding growth to support a traditional retirement. Coast FIRE is all about using your savings to unlock freedom before hitting regular FIRE.

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.

This sub is for those who fall between r/FIRE and r/FatFIRE. We are focused on the financial side of early retirement at an asset level that allows an upper middle class lifestyle. That level will vary by location, household size and other variables, but a general guideline is $2.5M - $6M in your retirement portfolio. If you plan to retire with a leaner lifestyle in spite of a Chubby portfolio, r/FIRE might be a better fit.

Bogleheads are passive investors who follow Jack Bogle's simple but powerful message to diversify with low-cost index funds and let compounding grow wealth. Jack founded Vanguard and pioneered indexed mutual funds. His work has since inspired others to get the most out of their long-term investments. Active managers want your money - our advice: keep it! How? Investing in broad-market low-cost indexes, diversified between equities and fixed income. Buy, hold, pay low fees, and stay the course!
