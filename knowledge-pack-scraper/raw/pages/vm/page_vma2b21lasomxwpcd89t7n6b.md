## Understanding SR-22 insurance in California
SR-22 insurance isn't a type of insurance. It's a form your insurance company files with the state to prove you have the minimum car insurance required to drive in California. SR-22 insurance generally refers to auto insurance coverage that requires an SR-22 filed by your insurance company for you.
Most drivers in California don't need SR-22 insurance. Drivers who do need an SR-22 have been convicted of serious violations like reckless driving, DUIs, or multiple offenses in a short time. If you are required to file an SR-22, you will be informed of how long you need to keep it.
"Certain things trigger the requirement for an SR-22 filing, such as a DUI, having a lot of points on your license, getting into an accident without insurance, or having your license suspended or revoked. But in every case, the driver is notified by the DMV that they are required to have this form. You would have to check the box that you are required to have an SR 22 filing. The insurance company typically charges a fee to file or maintain that filing, which varies by insurance company," says Dorothy Cato with Skyway Insurance Services LLC in Monroe, North Carolina.
## How much does SR-22 insurance cost in California?
Filing an SR-22 form is inexpensive, but the fines and higher insurance rates will be pricey. On average, SR-22 insurance in California costs $2,403, but rates depend on the driver and the violation.
Insurance rates vary from company to company, so it's best to shop around to find the cheapest SR-22 insurance available.
## Average SR-22 insurance cost in California by violation
