# Umbrella insurance coverage for high net worth

[Insurance](/r/personalfinance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Insurance%22)

Several years ago as our non retirement liquid assets were approaching $5 mil on the advise of our financial adviser we increased our umbrella insurance coverage from $1 mil to $5 mil.

Last year our non retirement liquid assets crossed $5 mil threshold and in the future they may cross $10 mil. The question is do we increase our umbrella coverage to match our non retirement (as far as I understand, retirement assets and our home are protected against litigation) assets? I am not even sure our regular insurance company (we have auto + home + umbrella bundle) offers umbrella coverage over $5 mil.

We are not in any litigious professions, are both salaried employees and do not own any business or anything outside of stock market investments.

EDIT: My advisor who suggested upping insurance to $5mil does not sell insurance and had nothing to gain from this advise. He is also fiduciary. WE upped our insurance limit from $1 mil to $5 mil. The insurance grilled my quite substantially why I am increasing this limit and then did increase it.

We currently have about $1.5 mil in 401(k), $500k in IRA and $250k in Roth IRA and $7 mil in taxable accounts. We also have house worth around $700k paid off.

My understand that even 4019K) has protection limit around $1.5 mil so we may have exceeded it already.
