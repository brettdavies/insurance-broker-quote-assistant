## Full coverage vs. liability: Which is right for you?

Throughout this article, we refer to two kinds of car insurance: full coverage and liability coverage, also known as minimum coverage. Here's the difference.

### Full coverage

* **What it is.** [Full coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/full-coverage-insurance) is typically a combination of comprehensive, collision and liability coverage.
* **What it does.** It will help pay for repairs in most events, including damage caused by weather, an at-fault accident, hitting an animal or vandalism.
* **Do you need it?** If you have a car loan or lease, you may be required to have full coverage. You may also want it if you own a new car, drive a car you couldn’t afford to replace or live in a place with extreme weather.

### Liability coverage

* **What it is.** [Liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) is usually the cheapest car insurance available, but it can leave you open to major expenses.
* **What it does.** It pays for injuries and damage you cause to other drivers and their property, but not your own.
* **Do you need it?** Every state requires liability insurance, but it’s not enough for most people. Consider buying full coverage if you can afford it. Our list of companies with [cheap full coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/cheap-full-coverage-insurance) can help.

* ### Should you get the cheapest car insurance?

  Just because a company has cheap rates doesn’t mean that it’s short on quality. We’ve reviewed plenty of great car insurance companies that have cheap rates and high-quality service.

  But how can you tell if the great deal you found is from a legit company? Or that an insurer with affordable rates will actually be there for you after an accident?

  These three factors can help you decide whether a cheap insurance company may be a fit:

  + **It has the coverage you need.** If an insurer has affordable rates but doesn’t offer the type of coverage you need, it’s likely not the best option for you.
  + **It has great customer service.** Some cheap insurance companies have earned our highest ratings for customer service, but others haven’t. If you can, try to balance service with affordability.
  + **It has a reliable reputation.** You want to have peace of mind that an insurer will still be in business if you need it one day. Look for a car insurance company that combines cheap rates with long-term stability.

GEICO is the cheapest large auto insurance company in the nation for liability coverage, with an average rate of $41 a month and $489 a year, according to NerdWallet's November 2025 analysis.

## Cheapest car insurance rates in your state

Location is one of many factors that affect the [cost of car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance). For example, the average car insurance rate for full coverage is $262 per month in Florida, but drivers might only pay $141 per month, on average, for the same coverage in Nebraska.

To help you get an idea of what you might pay, we found the cheapest car insurance company for full coverage in each state.

🤓Nerdy Tip

If you're looking for the cheapest insurance after a traffic violation, you may want to compare quotes from smaller insurance companies. We’re showing rates for some of the nation’s [biggest car insurance companies](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/largest-auto-insurance-companies) because they’re available to most people across the U.S., but drivers with violations like an at-fault accident or a recent DUI can often find the cheapest auto insurance rates with midsize or regional insurers.

## Cheapest car insurance for drivers with poor credit: GEICO

GEICO is the cheapest large auto insurance company for drivers with poor credit, with an average rate of $233 a month and $2,799 a year for full coverage, according to NerdWallet's November 2025 analysis.

Many insurers use [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/credit-based-insurance-score) to help calculate car insurance rates. However, California, Hawaii and Massachusetts don't allow insurers to use credit when determining car insurance rates.

Poor credit can have a big impact on auto insurance costs in most other states. Our analysis shows that drivers with poor credit can expect to pay an average of 67% more for full coverage than those with good credit.

## More Nerdy Perspective

I saved nearly $200 a year by choosing the cheapest way to pay my auto insurance premiums. By signing up for autopay, I got a discount on my policy and avoided a $5 monthly service charge. The savings added up to about 14%. That’s like skipping more than 1½ monthly payments!

Don’t forget to factor discounts into your price comparisons. Insurance companies may not include every possible discount into a quote, so see which discounts are available and ask an agent how much you could save with them.

Switching from full coverage to minimum coverage isn’t the only way to lower your premium. Last year, I interviewed a woman who cut her car insurance premium by almost 40% by switching insurers and increasing her deductible. If you have a solid emergency fund and could afford to pay more in the event of a claim, this strategy might help you save.

## How to get the cheapest car insurance quotes

1. **Think about your needs.** One person might prioritize a company with strong customer service and a great mobile app while someone else prefers a company with a lot of available discounts. Only you know which details mean the most to you.
2. **Do your research.** We recommend [comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance) from at least three insurers once a year. Insurers adjust rates regularly, so a company that gave you a cheap rate last year might not be as much of a bargain this year.
3. ****Ask for discounts.**** You may be able to save money with discounts you’re not currently getting. Common [car insurance discounts](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-discounts) are given for insuring multiple cars on the same policy and having a student driver with good grades.
4. **Raise your deductibles.** The higher your [car insurance deductibles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-deductible), the more you pay out of pocket before insurance pays for a claim. By raising your deductibles, you may be able to lower your premium, which is the amount you pay for your policy. Just make sure you have enough money set aside to cover the deductibles if you ever get in an accident.
5. **Improve driving habits.** Most traffic violations impact your insurance for at least three to five years, whether it was an accident, speeding ticket or DUI. Taking a defensive driving course could earn you a discount on your car insurance policy — and it’ll help you develop safer driving skills to reduce the risk of future violations.
6. **Reconsider your vehicle.** The type of car you drive affects how much you pay for insurance. Check out NerdWallet’s analysis of the [cheapest cars to insure](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/cars-cheapest-auto-insurance-rates) to compare rates for the most popular vehicles.

* ### Ask Reddit: How do other drivers find cheap insurance?

  *Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like auto insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to see what steps drivers are using to find cheap insurance.*

  *People post anonymously on Reddit, so we can’t confirm anyone’s individual experiences or circumstances.* *After reading through many conversations, we found a few common themes:*

  + Some drivers prefer to work with local, independent agents, because these agents are experts who can shop around and compare quotes for you. You can search in your area or use Trusted Choice, a network of independent insurance agents, to browse a directory of agents and find a good match.
  + Some drivers found that going to an insurer’s website helped them find cheaper quotes than what an independent agent gave them.
  + Some drivers recommend looking at smaller insurers, since these companies tend to offer better customer service and possibly even cheaper rates than a national company.

* ### See characteristics for other driver profiles

  For all other driver profiles, we used the same assumptions, with the following exceptions:

  + We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for drivers with poor credit. These rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.
  + For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
  + For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.
  + For drivers with a ticket, we added a single speeding violation for driving 16 mph over the speed limit.
  + For young drivers, we considered 20-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For millennial drivers, we considered 40-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For senior drivers, we considered 70-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.

These are median rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider. Sample drivers had the minimum required coverage by law in each state. Some policies include additional coverage at the insurer’s discretion.

Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.
