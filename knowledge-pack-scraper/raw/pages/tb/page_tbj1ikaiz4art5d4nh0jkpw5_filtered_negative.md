The average cost of [full coverage](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/full-coverage.html) car insurance in California is **$2,416** per year. But these rates can differ depending on factors like your age, the coverage you choose, your driving record and the type of car you drive.
California drivers who choose to carry only the minimum car insurance will pay $551 on average. But this doesn't include [collision or comprehensive coverage](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-and-collision-auto-insurance.html), so if you cause an accident, you'd have to pay for damage to your own car yourself.

1. Provisional License. No passengers under 20 for the first 12 months unless an adult is present. No driving between 12 p.m. and 5 a.m. for the first 12 months with exceptions. No alcohol in the vehicle.
1. Full License. Must be 18, at which time restrictions are lifted, although alcohol is still not permitted in the vehicle.
Which [car insurance discounts](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/car-insurance-discounts.html) are available and how much savings drivers can expect depend on the state and the company. So, savings may vary considerably from company to company in California.

[ Read our methodology ](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/california-car-insurance-guide/#Methodology)
1. Request quotes at your desired coverage levels. Make sure you are requesting the same coverage levels on each quote. If you're looking to change your coverage, ask your current insurance company to provide a quote with those limits as well.
1. Review the quotes and note any added benefits. Some [car insurance companies](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/carriers.aspx) include extras at no additional charge. Is [roadside assistance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-basics/can-roadside-assistance-sabotage-your-car-insurance.aspx) included? Are there other perks like a diminishing deductible program?
1. Research the car insurance companies you're considering. [Cheap car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-rates-by-state) isn't everything. Make sure you are also looking at each insurance provider's reputation to make sure you find not just the cheapest car insurance but also the [best car insurance companies in California](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california.html).
