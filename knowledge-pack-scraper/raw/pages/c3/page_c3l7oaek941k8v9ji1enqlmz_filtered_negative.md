> Illinois car insurance policies usually include uninsured motorist coverage at the same minimums that exist for liability coverage.
Uninsured motorist insurance covers your accident-related losses if you're in a crash with an at-fault driver who is uninsured. Depending on how much uninsured motorist coverage you decide to carry, Illinois law may also require that your policy include _under_ insured motorist coverage too.
