[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is the cheapest major car insurance company for drivers with an accident or speeding ticket on their record.
**You may be able to get even cheaper rates from Erie, NJM or USAA.** However, both  Erie and  NJM only sell insurance in a handful of states. And USAA is only available for military members, veterans and their families.

However, car insurance rates can go up by more than 40% after a serious driving issue such as a DUI or [reckless driving](https://www.valuepenguin.com/reckless-driving-deaths-study "Reckless Driving Deaths Most Common in Montana, Colorado, West Virginia"). That's an average increase of $77 per month for a full coverage policy.
Violation | Monthly cost |  % increase
---|---|---
[Speeding](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost "Car Insurance Rate Increases With a Speeding Ticket") | $218 | 13%

If you have a bad driving record, you may have to spend more time shopping around to find affordable car insurance. Some insurance companies give bad drivers very high rates, so [compare online quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies to find the best deal for you.

If your bad driving record means you need a form to show the state you have car insurance, called an [SR-22](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance") or sometimes an FR-44, you may not be able to get insurance from some major companies.
Instead, you may have to consider [nonstandard auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/nonstandard-auto-insurance "Non-Standard Auto Insurance") companies that specialize in bad driver car insurance. Two good nonstandard car insurance companies are [The General](https://www.valuepenguin.com/the-general-insurance-review "The General Insurance Review") and [SafeAuto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/safe-auto-insurance-review "SafeAuto Insurance Review").
* * *
Try to [find as many discounts as possible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to make insurance more affordable. Many companies offer discounts that are easy to get. You can usually save by buying a policy online, setting up automatic payments, bundling multiple insurance policies or paying in full.
You can also take a [defensive driving course](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount") to save around 10% to 15%.
* * *
If your poor driving record is because of bad luck or you're committed to driving safer, you could lower your rates by as much as 30% or 40% by letting your insurance track your driving habits. This is called a [usage-based discount program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies").
The [best usage-based car insurance programs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"), like State Farm Drive Safe & Save, won't raise your rates for bad driving habits.

No, nearly every insurance company considers your driving record when setting insurance rates. However, some companies are more forgiving than others when it comes to driving history, like [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") and Erie.
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is the best national insurance company for drivers with an accident or speeding ticket, while [Progressive](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-insurance-review "/progressive-insurance-review") has the best rates after a DUI. However, midsize companies like Erie, NJM, Auto-Owners and Farm Bureau tend to have more affordable rates after a ticket or accident.
