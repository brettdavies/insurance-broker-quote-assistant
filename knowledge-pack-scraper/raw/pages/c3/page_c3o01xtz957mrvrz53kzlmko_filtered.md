## Tips for getting cheaper car insurance in California

Your rates depend on personal details, like your age, driving record and ZIP code. This means that the cheapest insurer in California for you might not be the cheapest for someone else.

Because of this, it’s important to [compare prices](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance) from a few insurance companies. These other tips may also help you lower your insurance rates.

* **Shop for car insurance at least once a year.** Everybody’s rates change over time. Check that you still get your best deal before renewing your coverage.
* **Commit to covering more of a future claim.** You can raise your [auto insurance deductible](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-insurance-deductible), which is the part of a future claim that your insurance *won’t* cover. Taking more responsibility later can get you lower rates now.
* **Drop coverage you don’t need anymore.** You might be able to carry less insurance, and pay less for your coverage, if you own a car that would cost more to insure than it’s worth.
* **Consider usage-based car insurance.** You could pay less for [car insurance that’s priced on driving habits](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/pay-per-mile-car-insurance) like your speed, turning, braking and the miles you drive.

## Cheapest car insurance companies by coverage type

“Minimum coverage” — which is the lowest amount of insurance you need to legally drive — is the cheapest car insurance available because you get less coverage. But minimum coverage could leave you unprotected after a serious accident.

Carrying only minimum coverage also means missing out on optional types of coverage you might want or need. For example, minimum coverage won’t help pay for your injuries if you’re at fault for an accident, but [medical payments coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medical-payments) would.

And if your car is damaged in an accident you caused or if you’re involved in a hit-and-run, you'd need [full coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/full-coverage-insurance) to help pay for repairs.

### Cheapest car insurance in California for full coverage: GEICO

GEICO is the cheapest auto insurer for full coverage in California, with an average rate of $108 a month and $1,291 a year.

Full coverage insurance helps pay for repairs to your vehicle after an at-fault accident, as well as the damage and injuries you cause to others. It’s possible for many drivers to find [cheap rates for full coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/cheap-full-coverage-insurance) from more than one company.

If you have a car loan or lease, your lender will require you to carry full coverage, which includes [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/comprehensive-and-collision-insurance). These types of insurance cover your car if it’s stolen or damaged in an accident you cause, as well as most other scenarios.

  | Grange Insurance Association | $1,507 | $126 |

  *Rates refreshed November 2025. These rates are based on a 35-year-old driver with a clean driving history.*

### Cheapest car insurance in California for liability coverage: GEICO

GEICO is the cheapest auto insurer for liability coverage in California, with an average rate of $24 a month and $286 a year.

Every driver in California is required to carry liability insurance. Your policy’s [bodily liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) and [property damage liability coverage](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/property-damage-liability) only pay for injuries and damage you cause to others. After an accident that you cause, you’d have to pay for your car’s repairs yourself.

**The minimum amount of insurance isn’t enough on its own for most Californians**

Many drivers with auto loans will be required to carry more than liability insurance. That said, the minimum amount of insurance — which is just $60,000 per accident in California — isn’t enough to cover all of the medical-related and legal costs that a serious accident could cause.

* ### More cheap rates for liability coverage

  | Company | Median annual rate | Median monthly rate |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | [GEICO](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/geico-auto-insurance-review) | $286 | $24 |
  | Grange Insurance Association | $401 | $33 |

  | [Mercury](https://www.nerdwallet.com/insurance/auto/mercury-auto-insurance-review) | $444 | $37 |

  *Rates refreshed November 2025. These rates are based on a 35-year-old driver with a clean driving history.*
* ### Minimum auto insurance limits in California

  California drivers must carry liability insurance in the following amounts:

  + $30,000 bodily injury liability per person.
  + $60,000 bodily injury liability per accident.
  + $15,000 property damage liability per accident.

  [Liability car insurance](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance) covers the cost of any damage, injuries or deaths you cause in a car accident, up to your policy’s predefined limits. Experts recommend getting more than the bare minimum if you want to avoid dipping into your own savings to cover expenses.

  For instance, if you have only minimum coverage but cause an accident that totals another driver's $20,000 car, you would have to pay $5,000 out of pocket because the total exceeds your policy's $15,000 limit for property damage.

  Check out NerdWallet’s guide to [state car insurance requirements](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/minimum-car-insurance-requirements) for more details on how the required and optional parts of your California policy work.

## Cheap car insurance in California from top companies

## Cheapest car insurance in large California cities

Car insurance often costs more in cities than in other parts of California. That’s partly because cities can see more vandalism, car theft and accidents than smaller, less crowded areas. Some parts of California also face natural disasters — like earthquakes and wildfires — that can affect car insurance prices.

NerdWallet analyzed rates for 35-year-old drivers and a variety of driving histories in some of the largest cities in California to give you an idea of the average cost in your area.

🤓Nerdy Tip

Some insurers offer a senior discount if you complete a defensive driving course from an approved provider. Courses are easy to find online through groups like AAA, AARP and The National Safety Council. Some classes can be completed 100% online.

## More Nerdy Perspective

If you recently moved to California, don't just stay with your current insurer from your previous state. Be sure to get new quotes for car insurance. When my dad moved, he was surprised to find rates were cheaper overall in his new location, and he saved even more by switching to a different company.

At face value, California's program for low-cost insurance seems like an easy way to get cheap car insurance. But after interviewing multiple insurance experts in California, I learned that almost every driver in this program is underinsured and at risk of being sued for an insurance claim. You should steer clear of this program if you have any other insurance options.

Consider using an independent insurance agent to help you shop around for cheap car insurance. The first time I worked with an agent, she was able to save me more than $600 a year on insurance for two cars and my house. Better yet, I didn't have to spend hours getting quotes myself.

## Low-income car insurance in California

If you can’t afford car insurance premiums, you might qualify for [California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance program](https://www.mylowcostauto.com/), which has several payment plans and no broker fees. To be eligible, you'll need:

* A current California driver’s license.
* An automobile worth $25,000 or less.
* A household income that meets the program requirements.
* A clean or new driving record.

The California Department of Insurance sets household income limits based on the federal poverty level, which is used to determine eligibility for certain government programs. The federal poverty level (and program income requirement) depends on the year and the number of people in your household. For example, the program income limit was $39,125 for one person in 2025.

The program’s website has a calculator to determine income cutoffs for larger households, a rate calculator and a tool to find participating insurance agents. You’ll have to provide documentation of income, as well as other requirements, to qualify.

## How AAA car insurance works in California

AAA, the automobile club best known for its roadside assistance memberships, also sells insurance in many states, including California. But just like the clubs themselves, AAA insurance companies are separate companies that operate independently. If you use a AAA webpage, it will ask for your ZIP code in order to ensure you're looking at information for your local AAA club.

**» MORE:** [Is AAA worth it?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/is-aaa-worth-it)

The Auto Club of Southern California serves the following counties: Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura. CSAA serves other counties in California, plus several other states.

If you’re a AAA member and move within California, or to a different state entirely, you may need to transfer membership to another club. However, AAA’s roadside assistance will take care of you even if you need help while traveling outside of your home club’s region.

#### Methodology

NerdWallet averaged rates based on public filings obtained by pricing analytics company Quadrant Information Services. We examined rates for 35-year-old men and women for all ZIP codes in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

* ### See characteristics for other driver profiles

  For all other driver profiles, we used the same assumptions, with the following exceptions:

  + We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor,” as reported to the insurer, to see rates for drivers with poor credit. These rates are based on credit score approximations and do not account for proprietary scoring criteria used by insurance providers.
  + For drivers with one at-fault crash, we added a single at-fault crash that happened six months ago, resulting in $10,000 in property damage and no bodily injury claim.
  + For drivers with a DUI, we added a single drunken driving violation that happened six months ago.
  + For drivers with a ticket, we added a single speeding violation for driving 16 mph over the speed limit.
  + For young drivers, we considered 20-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For millennial drivers, we considered 40-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.
  + For senior drivers, we considered 70-year-olds with good credit and no driving violations.

These are median rates, and your rate will vary based on your personal details, state and insurance provider. Sample drivers had the minimum required coverage by law in each state. Some policies include additional coverage at the insurer’s discretion.

Although it’s one of the largest insurers in the country, Liberty Mutual is not included in our rates analysis due to a lack of publicly available information.
