Average Cost of Car Insurance in New York State

| --- | --- | --- |

| Minimum coverage | $2,841 | $237 |

[Full coverage car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) is usually required if your car is [financed](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-get-a-car-loan/) or [leased](/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-lease-a-vehicle-or-buy/). Full coverage adds [collision and comprehensive coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/), which protects the vehicle from damage. If your car isn't financed or leased, you could opt for minimum coverage insurance instead.

New York State law requires drivers to carry [minimum liability insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) of $10,000 per accident for property damage; $25,000 for bodily injury and $50,000 for death for a person involved in an accident; and $50,000 for bodily injury and $100,000 for death for two or more people in an accident; and the same amounts of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage of $50,000 per accident is also required.

Keep in mind that minimum coverage alone may not offer enough protection in case of an accident. In general, insurance experts recommend buying coverage of at least $100,000 per accident for property damage and $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident for bodily injuries, which will increase the cost of car insurance in New York state.

The actual cost of your auto insurance is determined by factors such as:

* **Age** (younger drivers usually pay more)
* **Gender** (women often pay less than men)
* **Where you live** (rates may be higher in areas with lots of accidents or vehicle theft)
* **Your driving record** (incidents and violations typically drive your premiums up)
* **The vehicle you're insuring** (new cars cost more to insure than used cars)

As a result, while these average rates can be good general guidelines, the price you pay for car insurance in New York state may differ. Before you buy car insurance, take some time to [compare insurance quotes](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/new-york/) from several different insurers.

## How Are Car Insurance Costs Trending?

Car insurance costs have risen steeply across the U.S. in the past few years. The increasing cost of vehicles, parts and repairs is partly to blame. Increasingly severe auto accidents have caused medical claims costs to rise.

Insurance carriers have also raised their rates to make up for higher claims costs due to natural disasters and severe weather events. New York City is one of the top three U.S. metro areas at highest risk for severe storms and hurricane winds, according to the Insurance Information Institute. It's also in the top 10 states with the highest rate of auto theft, according to 2023 data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau. All of these risk factors can lead to [comprehensive car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-comprehensive-car-insurance/) claims for damage or theft.

### Average Annual Auto Insurance Premiums, 2023-2025

If you think you're paying too much for car insurance in New York state, you might find the same coverage for a lower price by shopping around with other providers. Consider using Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/)—it offers an easy way to get quotes from dozens of top insurance carriers at one time.

## Average New York State Car Insurance Rates by City

Within New York state, the [specific location](/blogs/ask-experian/will-car-insurance-change-when-you-move/) where you live affects how much your car insurance will cost. There are different risks to your car in different areas of New York state. For instance, crowded urban areas may have longer average commutes, a higher rate of auto theft or more congested traffic, all of which could increase the odds you'll need to file a claim. The cost of medical care and automotive repair can also differ in various parts of New York state, impacting the cost of your car insurance.

The average cost of auto insurance in some of New York state's most populous cities can vary widely from one location to another, as the chart below shows.

Average Auto Insurance Cost by City in New York State

| City | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Rochester | $2,395 |
| Syracuse | $2,642 |
| Buffalo | $3,252 |
| Bronx | $5,947 |
| Brooklyn | $6,186 |

## Average New York State Car Insurance Rates by Age & Gender

[Gender](/blogs/ask-experian/does-gender-impact-car-insurance-premiums/) is another factor that can influence how much you pay for car insurance. Not all states allow insurance companies to consider gender when setting auto insurance rates, but New York state does. Because women are statistically less likely to be involved in major car accidents or DUIs, they may pay less for car insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

In New York state, women pay an average of $3,086 annually or $257 per month for car insurance and men pay $3,525 annually or $294 per month.

Average Auto Insurance Cost by Gender in New York State

| Gender | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Male | $3,525 | $294 |
| Female | $3,086 | $257 |

Gender isn't the only factor in auto insurance costs: Age matters too. In general, [younger drivers](/blogs/ask-experian/does-car-insurance-go-down-at-25/) tend to pay more than older drivers for car insurance. Young drivers, especially men, are less experienced behind the wheel and statistically more likely to be involved in car accidents.

As you get older, your auto insurance premiums generally decrease—sometimes considerably. As the chart below indicates, insurance rates usually drop gradually with age until ticking upwards again when you reach your mid-70s.

Average Car Insurance Cost by Age and Gender in the U.S.

| Age | Female | Male |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Under 20 | $3,246 | $3,450 |
| 20-29 | $2,684 | $2,762 |
| 30-39 | $2,395 | $2,271 |
| 40-49 | $2,293 | $2,161 |
| 50-59 | $2,022 | $1,968 |
| 60-69 | $1,746 | $1,721 |
| 70-79 | $1,720 | $1,862 |
| 80 or above | $1,810 | $2,007 |

## How Your Driving Record Impacts Your Insurance Costs in New York State

Safe drivers are typically less likely to be involved in accidents or get traffic citations, so a clean driving record generally pays off in lower insurance rates. New York state drivers with a "clean" driving record that shows no incidents or violations pay an average of $2,942 annually for car insurance. However, violations or accidents on your driving record can have a serious impact on the cost of car insurance.

One [moving violation](/blogs/ask-experian/which-traffic-violations-increase-your-insurance-rates/) on your New York state driving history brings your premiums to an average of $3,632 annually. New York state uses a point system for driving records, and violations, convictions and points typically stay on your driving record for up to four years. If drugs or alcohol are involved, the violation or conviction stays on your record for 10 or 15 years, depending on the violation or conviction.

A record of moving violations or accidents on your driving history can lead insurance carriers to consider you a high-risk driver, even if you weren't at fault in the accidents. High-risk drivers pay more for car insurance. The chart below shows how the number and severity of infractions could affect your auto insurance costs in New York state. *Incidents* include things like traffic accidents or insurance claims; *violations* include moving violations, such as speeding tickets.

Average Car Insurance Cost by Driving Record in New York State

| Driving Record | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Clean Record | $2,942 |
| 1 Incident | $3,249 |
| 1 Violation | $3,632 |
| 2 Incidents | $3,422 |
| 2 Violations | $3,224 |
| 3+ Incidents | $4,805 |
| 3+ Violations | $4,265 |

## Cheapest Car Insurance in New York State

Factors such as your driving record, vehicle and age are key to how much you'll pay for car insurance, but they aren't the only elements affecting your costs. Since each insurance company uses its own formula to set rates, the price you're quoted can differ widely from one insurance company to another.

Shopping around and comparing quotes from several different insurance carriers can help you find the most affordable car insurance for your situation. New York state has a limited amount of coverage options, but even so, the prices may vary quite a bit depending on the carrier you choose. The table below shows the cheapest full coverage auto insurance among the insurance carriers that sell the most policies in New York state.

Cheapest Full Coverage Car Insurance Carriers in New York

| Carrier | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Progressive | $6,309 | $526 |
| GEICO | $6,583 | $549 |

Source: Experian data as of September 2025  
Note: Costs above represent insurance quotes, not policy premiums

Of course, those figures are averages, so your rates could vary. There's no way to know exactly how each insurance company determines its rates. However, considerations such as the carrier's projected operating costs, risk tolerance, estimated claims payouts and profitability goals typically figure into the calculations. For instance, a carrier that has higher overhead expenses might charge more than one with lower overhead.

## How to Save on Car Insurance in New York State

If your New York state car insurance premiums are below average, that's good news. But if they're average or above, take these steps to see if you can [save on car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs-now/).

### Look for Discounts

See if your existing car insurance provider offers any discounts that you aren't taking advantage of. Also visit other providers' websites to see what discounts they feature—you might be surprised at the savings available to you. For example, many providers offer discounts for [bundling home and auto insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/should-you-bundle-your-home-and-auto-insurance/), setting up autopayments, paying your premiums upfront or eliminating paper communications.

Other companies give you a price break for getting insurance quotes online or signing documents online. Your high school or college-age driver could earn discounts for maintaining a good grade point average or being away at school without a car. Finally, check to see if your workplace or any membership organizations you're a part of offer discounts on auto insurance.

### Increase Your Deductible

When you file a car insurance claim, you're usually responsible for paying a deductible before your insurance coverage kicks in. Most insurance companies allow you to select a deductible between $250 and $2,000. A higher [deductible](/blogs/ask-experian/how-does-car-insurance-deductible-work/) usually translates to lower insurance premiums, because you're assuming a greater amount of risk. Before you raise your deductible, however, make sure you could afford to cover the higher amount if you had to. Assess your [emergency fund](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-an-emergency-fund/) and other financial resources. By asking your insurance carrier how different deductibles would impact your premiums, you can find the right balance between savings and risk.

### Drop Unnecessary Coverage

There are several add-on auto insurance options that are nice to have, but not always essential. These include things like rental car reimbursement, windshield replacement or roadside assistance coverage. Eliminating these extras could save you money on your car insurance. Before doing so, weigh how much the coverage would save you in the event of a claim compared to how much it costs you. For example, if you're a one-car family, coverage that pays for a rental car while your vehicle is in the shop could be worth the cost.

If you own a paid-off car that's not worth much money, you might consider dropping [collision and comprehensive coverage](/blogs/ask-experian/comprehensive-vs-collision-insurance/). This insurance won't pay out more than the vehicle's value, so it may not be worthwhile if the car is only worth a few thousand dollars. Just make sure you could afford to replace or repair your car if it's totaled.

### Reduce Your Mileage

Insurance companies typically ask you to estimate your [annual mileage](/blogs/ask-experian/does-mileage-affect-car-insurance/) because the more you drive, the more likely you are to be involved in an accident. Conversely, driving fewer than 12,000 miles per year could earn you a discount on your insurance bill. Look for ways to [cut your mileage](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-drive-less-and-lower-car-insurance-costs/), such as carpooling, biking, taking public transportation or switching to remote work if your employer allows.

Companies that offer low-mileage car insurance discounts usually monitor your mileage through self-reported or third-party odometer readings or devices installed in your vehicle. Another option is [pay-per-mile car insurance](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-pay-per-mile-auto-insurance/). This type of coverage charges a monthly base rate plus a per-mile charge for each additional mile.

### Practice Safe Driving

A driving record that's clear of accidents or moving violations indicates to insurance companies that you're a low-risk driver, which can mean paying less for car insurance. If you do have a violation on your driving history, completing the New York state Department of Motor Vehicles' [Point and Insurance Reduction Program (PIRP)](https://dmv.ny.gov/points-and-penalties/point-and-insurance-reduction-program) could help. Completing a PIRP course reduces your auto insurance base rate by 10% annually for three years.

### Improve Your Credit

New York state allows insurance companies to check your [credit-based insurance score](/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-credit-based-insurance-score/) when setting your premiums. A poor score could mean paying more for auto insurance. Taking steps to [improve your consumer credit score](/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/improving-credit/improve-credit-score/) may positively impact your credit-based insurance score, which could reduce your car insurance premiums.

### Compare Prices

It's a good idea to shop around and [compare quotes](/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-compare-car-insurance-rates/) from several different insurance providers at least once a year. Even if you're happy with your current insurance company, shopping around could uncover lower rates and save you money.

You can obtain car insurance quotes at insurance company websites or by contacting insurance companies directly. For a convenient way to investigate your options, try using Experian's free [car insurance comparison tool](/insurance/car-insurance-quotes/). It gathers car insurance quotes from the top insurance companies in New York state, making it easy to see which provider offers the lowest rates.
