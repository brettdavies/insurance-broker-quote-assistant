Bad drivers pay more for car insurance. But you can save by choosing a company with cheap rates for bad drivers, like State Farm or Progressive. You may find even cheaper rates from midsize companies like Erie, Auto-Owners and NJM.
You can also get insurance from a company that specializes in high-risk drivers, such as The General. However, these companies tend to be more expensive.
Methodology: How we pick the best companies
To help you find the best auto insurance for a bad driving record, ValuePenguin collected rates from ZIP codes across the U.S. Our experts also considered how much insurance companies raise rates after a ticket, accident or DUI.
[Full methodology #methodology ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record#methodology "#methodology"). 
## Cheapest car insurance companies for bad drivers
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-insurance-review "State Farm Insurance Review") is the cheapest major car insurance company for drivers with an accident or speeding ticket on their record.

## How does a bad driving record affect car insurance?
Typically, the more severe the driving incident, the more your car insurance rates go up.
Minor issues usually cause a small rate increase. The average cost of full coverage car insurance increases by 13% after a speeding ticket or texting while driving.
However, car insurance rates can go up by more than 40% after a serious driving issue such as a DUI or [reckless driving](https://www.valuepenguin.com/reckless-driving-deaths-study "Reckless Driving Deaths Most Common in Montana, Colorado, West Virginia"). That's an average increase of $77 per month for a full coverage policy.
### Average full coverage rates by driving incident
Violation | Monthly cost |  % increase  
---|---|---  
None | $193 | 0%  
Texting while driving | $217 | 13%  
[Speeding](https://www.valuepenguin.com/speeding-ticket-car-insurance-cost "Car Insurance Rate Increases With a Speeding Ticket") | $218 | 13%  
Accident | $257 | 33%  
Racing or reckless driving | $270 | 40%  
[DUI](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-dui-affect-your-auto-insurance-rates "How Does a DUI Affect Your Auto Insurance Rates?") | $283 | 41%  
[Compare rates](https://quotes.valuepenguin.com?c=C20049&key=%2Fbest-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record&product=auto&v=vp "https://quotes.valuepenguin.com?c=C20049&key=%2Fbest-cheap-car-insurance-bad-driving-record&product=auto&v=vp")
Insurance companies believe that people with a bad driving record are more likely to cause an accident in the future. So they raise your rates to help pay for potential claims.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/calendar)
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,w_70,dpr_1.0,q_auto/icons/calendar)
Incidents that happened more than three years ago usually won't affect your rates.
A bad driving history won't impact your auto insurance rates forever. Insurance companies typically only consider accidents and traffic tickets from the past three years. However, DUIs could affect your car insurance rates for up to five years because they're a more serious violation.
## How to get auto insurance for bad drivers
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/compare-2)
**Start by comparing rates from several companies.**
If you have a bad driving record, you may have to spend more time shopping around to find affordable car insurance. Some insurance companies give bad drivers very high rates, so [compare online quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free, Cheap Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple companies to find the best deal for you.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/law-penalties2)
**If you need an SR-22, you might need to use a specialized company.**
If your bad driving record means you need a form to show the state you have car insurance, called an [SR-22](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance") or sometimes an FR-44, you may not be able to get insurance from some major companies.
Instead, you may have to consider [nonstandard auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/nonstandard-auto-insurance "Non-Standard Auto Insurance") companies that specialize in bad driver car insurance. Two good nonstandard car insurance companies are [The General](https://www.valuepenguin.com/the-general-insurance-review "The General Insurance Review") and [SafeAuto](https://www.valuepenguin.com/safe-auto-insurance-review "SafeAuto Insurance Review").
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/piggy-bank)
**Look for car insurance discounts.**
Try to [find as many discounts as possible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") to make insurance more affordable. Many companies offer discounts that are easy to get. You can usually save by buying a policy online, setting up automatic payments, bundling multiple insurance policies or paying in full.
You can also take a [defensive driving course](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount") to save around 10% to 15%.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/mobile)
**Consider getting insurance based on your actual driving habits.**
If your poor driving record is because of bad luck or you're committed to driving safer, you could lower your rates by as much as 30% or 40% by letting your insurance track your driving habits. This is called a [usage-based discount program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies").
Using a phone app or a device that plugs into your car, insurance companies will use your actual driving habits when setting rates, rather than relying only on your driving record. The details of these programs vary, but most companies are looking for issues such as speeding and hard braking.
The [best usage-based car insurance programs](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies"), like State Farm Drive Safe & Save, won't raise your rates for bad driving habits.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/desktop)
**Shop around at each policy renewal.**
Be sure to shop around for insurance regularly to make sure you are getting the most affordable rates. The impact of a bad driving record on your car insurance rates changes over time, so the cheapest company for you may also change over time.
