Progressive and Allstate are two of America’s largest insurance companies, and for good reason. Both companies have strong reputations — Allstate ranks as the fourth-largest insurer by market share, while Progressive holds the second spot.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/allstate-vs-progressive#cite-1) But the two insurers differ in several notable ways.
