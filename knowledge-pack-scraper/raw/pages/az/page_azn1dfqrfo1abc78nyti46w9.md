## How long is the State Farm Steer Clear program?
The State Farm Steer Clear program must be completed within six months, but most participants finish the program in less than 12 weeks. The modules may take you a long time to complete if you are learning a lot of new information. Once you’ve finished the modules, you are required to log a specific number of hours behind the wheel.
Driving requirements for the State Farm Steer Clear program vary based on the person’s age. If you are under 19 years old, you must complete 20 driving trips under the supervision of a fully licensed driver who is over the age of 25. If you are 19-24 years old, you must complete five driving trips, and these trips can be with or without another licensed driver in the car.
The State Farm website does not specify whether each driving trip needs to be a certain distance or last a certain amount of time. You will need to speak with a State Farm representative to get more information if you have any questions.
Once you have completed the required modules and trips behind the wheel, you will be eligible to earn your State Farm Steer Clear certificate. This certificate will then be submitted to a State Farm representative who will apply the State Farm Steer Clear program discount to your car insurance policy.
## How much can I save on car insurance with the Steer Clear program?
You will never know how much you can save on your car insurance with a discount until you speak to a company representative to get more information. Most discounts can help policyholders save anywhere from five to 20% on their monthly rates.
The table below shows some standard discount options available with certain car insurance companies.

## Does the Steer Clear program have good reviews?
The State Farm Steer Clear program reviews online are mixed. Many people state that the program is easy to follow and does not require a lot of work to earn a significant discount on their insurance rates. But some find the layout of the modules and the use of the app confusing.
In a few cases, members of the program state that they lost the work they had completed on the course and the hours they had logged behind the wheel and had to start the program over again. Others were upset that they had completed the course and had not yet been granted any discounts on their car insurance coverage.
## Should I do the State Farm Steer Clear program?
If you are under 25, have a valid driver’s license, have a clean driving record, and are looking to save some money on your car insurance coverage, you may want to look into participating in the Steer Clear program. Overall, it can be a great way to save on your insurance coverage while learning to be safer behind the wheel.
The biggest downside to the program is that it forces you to purchase a car insurance policy with State Farm. So, before you decide to go with State Farm for your car insurance needs, it’s a good idea to shop around with other companies and see what other options are available.
If you have any questions about the State Farm Steer Clear program, you can get them answered by calling and speaking to a State Farm representative. They will help you learn more about the program to decide whether it’s something you would benefit from.
