### Is Massachusetts a no-fault state?

Yes, Massachusetts has been a no-fault state since 1971, [according to the Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance). As a no-fault state, Massachusetts requires drivers to carry PIP coverage so that their own insurance covers some or all of their medical expenses after a car accident, regardless of who's at fault. No-fault car insurance also restricts the right to sue to only lawsuits that involve severe injuries.

## Additional car insurance coverages to consider

If you get a car loan or lease, lenders usually require [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Massachusetts' state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay for a totaled or damaged vehicle due to an accident or other covered incident like theft or weather damage. It can make sense to add these physical damage coverages even if you don't have a car loan or lease, especially if you don't want the cost of major repairs or a new car after an accident.
