## The best car insurance companies in San Francisco
Car insurance providers are in the business of assessing risk, and historically, San Francisco drivers have had to pay high premiums partially due to the frequency of car break-ins here. However, per the [S.F. Car Break-In Tracker](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/sf-car-breakins/), the number of break-ins in 2025 is shaping up to be the fewest since tracking began in 2018.
This improvement is largely attributed to Proposition E, which authorized the city to deploy increased [surveillance tools](https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/sf-takes-historic-step-to-solve-crime-with-400-lpr-cameras) like license plate readers and cameras in high-crime neighborhoods. As a result, the San Francisco Police Department reports an [81 percent](https://abc7news.com/post/san-francisco-car-break-ins-historic-22-year-low-heres-look-police-data/16112998/) year-to-date increase in arrests related to car break-ins, which deters future attempts.
As the city’s risk landscape shifts, many car insurance providers have started lowering rates to reflect the reduced likelihood of claims. Bankrate’s insurance editorial team has identified insurers that align with this trend, as well as those that are highly rated by third parties like J.D. Power and those offering unique policyholder benefits. Based on our research, Progressive, Geico, State Farm, Nationwide and Mercury stand out as some of the [best auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in San Francisco.

Overview 
**Why Geico made our list** : Geico has responded most notably to the city’s lowered risk by providing, on average, some of the cheapest car insurance in San Francisco. And its affordable rates do not come at the expense of service, as Geico ranked highest of the providers we analyzed for overall satisfaction in the California region of the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.
**Why Geico may be best for discounts** : What Geico lacks in policy endorsements it makes up for with cheap rates and discount opportunities that could help you save even more. Geico advertises more than 20 different savings opportunities on its website. These include good driver discounts, safety discounts and affinity discounts for military, federal employees and more.

**Why State Farm made our list** : As the [largest auto insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the country, State Farm is one of the most prominent names in insurance. State Farm is also one of the few carriers offering products like rideshare coverage, life insurance and landlord insurance — but not home insurance. Last year, State Farm [announced](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/carriers-exit-california-home-insurance/) it would no longer write new home insurance policies for California homeowners. So, if you’re looking to bundle your home and auto policies together, State Farm would not be a viable option.
**Why State Farm may be best for safe drivers:** State Farm rates are closer to the San Francisco average, but policyholders have the opportunity to reduce their premium by enrolling in the [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) telematics program. The generous discounts this program offers for responsible and courteous driving helped State Farm take home the [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for Safe Drivers. If you want to learn more about this savings opportunity, there are multiple agent offices throughout the city that would be happy to assist.

**Why Nationwide made our list** : Nationwide has a lengthy discount list and two different telematics programs for even more potential savings. With SmartRide, you can earn a discount for safe driving habits, and with SmartMiles, your monthly rate will depend on how much you drive. According to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, these telematics programs helped Nationwide earn the honor of best usage-based insurance provider.
**Why Nationwide may best for policy add-ons** : Not only does Nationwide offer an impressive list of discounts, but its coverage options are also impressive. Endorsement options include vanishing deductible, a total loss deductible waiver and roadside assistance.

**Why Mercury made our list** : Mercury offers home and car insurance in the state of California, which could make it a good option for homeowners looking to bundle their policies. Roadside assistance and ride-hailing insurance are available as add-ons — the latter may be especially appealing to drivers working for Uber or Lyft.
**Why Mercury may be the best regional company** : National insurance companies are not a good fit for all drivers. For San Franciscans looking to work with a regional company, there is Mercury. Mercury only writes insurance policies in 11 states, including California. Mercury has four different insurance offices in San Francisco in the Cow Hollow, Outer Sunset, Duboce Triangle and SoMa neighborhoods. Local agents may help to provide insight into insurance needs that are specific to San Francisco.

What’s considered a [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) in San Francisco may be wildly expensive compared to another city, but comparing quotes could help keep money in your pocket.

## How much is car insurance in San Francisco, California?
Car insurance, like mostly everything in San Francisco, is expensive compared to the national average. The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) in San Francisco is $3,515 per year for full coverage and $980 for minimum coverage. This is well above the national average cost of car insurance, which is $2,671 for full coverage and $806 for minimum coverage per year. San Francisco car insurance costs are also higher than the [California statewide average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/), which is $3,102 for full coverage and $915 for minimum.
However, a significant drop in car break-ins has prompted some insurers to reduce premiums after updating their risk algorithms with the latest crime data. Additionally, large metropolitan areas generally face higher insurance costs due to population density and the resulting traffic jams. That said, the San Francisco Bay Area population has [decreased by 109,000 residents](https://vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/indicators/population) since 2020, potentially lowering the overall risk of traffic-related accidents compared to previous years.
### San Francisco rates for teens
Teen drivers generally pay more for car insurance than older drivers. Their lack of experience behind the wheel and proclivity for speeding make teenagers a higher risk for an insurance company. And with car insurance, higher risk typically means higher rates. If you’re a teen driver who lives at home with your parents, you are likely better off [staying on your parents’ insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/can-i-be-on-my-parents-car-insurance/) for as long as you can, as that might help you get a cheaper premium.

### San Francisco rates for young drivers
The cost of car insurance in San Francisco usually starts to dip once you hit your early 20s and decreases significantly by age 25 — so long as you've avoided accidents and tickets. The rates below represent drivers on their own car insurance policies. But to save even more cash, young adults may want to consider staying on their parents' policy if they're still living under the same roof.

### San Francisco rates for seniors
Once a driver ages into their 60s and 70s, it’s possible for rates to begin to climb once again. Changes in vision and reaction time may raise the risk of an accident, which in turn could raise rates. But, if your car insurance company offers a senior or retirement discount, that could be a good way to balance out any premium surcharges.

## The cheapest car insurance company in San Francisco by driving record
Your motor vehicle report (MVR) is used by your insurance company to help set your rate. The MVR comes from your state’s Department or Bureau of Insurance and details your driving history. By looking at your MVR, a potential insurance company will know if you’ve ever gotten a speeding ticket, been in an accident, had a DUI or been dinged with another kind of driving infraction. Expectedly, a driver with a checkered motor vehicle report will likely pay more for their insurance policy than someone with a clean record. But not all driving infractions are equal in the eyes of an insurance company. If you find a carrier that’s more generous about speeding tickets, for instance, you could wind up paying closer to the average cost of insurance.
### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in San Francisco
The San Francisco Police Department regularly dishes out [over 200 speeding tickets](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/stay-safe/crime-data/traffic-violation-reports) a month. If you were caught driving heavy-footed recently, you can generally expect your insurance premium to increase when your policy renews. Bankrate's analysis shows that drivers with a speeding ticket pay 38 percent more more on average compared to drivers with a clean record for minimum coverage. Bankrate’s insurance editorial team compiled average rates for the five cheapest car insurance companies in San Francisco for drivers with a speeding ticket in the table below.

### Car insurance after a DUI in San Francisco
A DUI is one of the most serious driving infractions you can have on your motor vehicle record. Some insurers, like State Farm, have blanket policies about not writing insurance for drivers with a DUI. Depending on your situation, you may also need your insurance company to file an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-california/) on your behalf. Expectedly, car insurance with a DUI will cost you more; our research shows that a full coverage car insurance policy in San Francisco costs 146 percent more on average for a driver with a DUI than it would with a clean driving record.

Minimum coverage requirements in San Francisco
In California, [drivers are required](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) to either have a car insurance policy, pay a $75,000 cash deposit to the DMV, carry a self-insurance certificate from the DMV or obtain a $75,000 surety bond from a licensed company. If you choose to go the route of a traditional car insurance policy, it must have at least the following liability limits:
  * $30,000 bodily injury or death liability per person
  * $60,000 bodily injury or death liability per accident
  * $15,000 property damage per accident


While minimum coverage car insurance is cheaper than full coverage, San Francisco drivers may want to consider a full coverage policy. A full coverage car insurance policy can financially protect against vehicle theft and other damage, like the kind your car may endure after a smash-and-grab. Although these incidents have been less common in recent years, they can still happen, and minimum coverage insurance will not pay for repairing or replacing your car in these instances.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How much car insurance do I need in San Francisco?
Caret Down Icon
In general, insurance experts recommend you purchase car insurance in San Francisco with as high coverage limits as you can reasonably afford for the greatest amount of financial protection. [California car insurance laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/) require having at least minimum coverage, which provides financial protection for damages caused to other vehicles and drivers if you cause a wreck. But having just minimum liability may leave you exposed to financial devastation in the event of a major collision. Minimum coverage also does not provide coverage for damages sustained to your vehicle, which is why leased and financed vehicles typically require having both [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/) on your policy.
  * ######  How much does car insurance in San Francisco cost?
Caret Down Icon
The average cost of car insurance in San Francisco is $980 per year for minimum coverage and $3,515 per year for full coverage (which includes collision and comprehensive coverage). Comparatively, California car insurance averages $3,102 per year for full coverage and $915 per year for minimum coverage. Compared to [other states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) and cities, auto insurance in San Francisco is pretty expensive.
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in San Francisco?
Caret Down Icon
Although accident forgiveness isn’t available in California, there are still other options to help lower your rate. One effective strategy is to contact a licensed agent and discuss your coverage and discount options. If you’ve paid off your car loan, for instance, you may be able to remove gap insurance. Or, maybe you’ve been claim-free long enough to earn a discount from your provider.

Quoted rates for our base profile are based on the following characteristics and full coverage limits with bundling and paperless billing discounts applied:

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
