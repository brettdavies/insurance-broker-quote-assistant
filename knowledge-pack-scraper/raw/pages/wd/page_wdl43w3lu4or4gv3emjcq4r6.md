## How to Get a Good Student Car Insurance Discount
Students can save up to 35% on their premiums with this discount, but they must meet certain requirements, which we explain below. To save even more on your premiums you should pay your annual insurance upfront and qualify for [pay-in-full insurance discounts](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-pay-in-full-insurance-discounts). 
### Maintain Good Grades
According to most insurance companies, students must keep a minimum B average of 3.0 GPA or higher to meet the good student discount GPA requirement. However, Allstate’s insurance company requires a 2.7 GPA. The student must also remain among the highest 20% in their academic class to qualify. 
![blog image 11](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-good-student-car-insurance-discounts?cache=false)
Students who take the SAT, ACT, or PSAT also qualify for insurance discounts under specific conditions. See what other discounts are available at the [cheapest car insurance companies for 18-year-olds](https://clearsurance.com/blog/cheap-car-insurance-companies-for-18-year-olds).
### Be a Full-Time Student
To receive a good student discount, drivers must enrolled in high school, college, or university. Good grades show responsibility, which is why students who do well in school qualify for lower-risk driver discounts.
![blog image 12](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-good-student-car-insurance-discounts?cache=false)
Students taking part-time courses or online programs are not eligible for good student insurance discounts. Students uncertain whether their school qualifies should check with their providers.

### Meet the Age Requirement
Young drivers can get cheaper rates from insurance companies with good student discounts as long as they maintain good grades and are between 16 and 25. The good student discount ends automatically at age 26, regardless of academic performance. 
![blog image 13](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-good-student-car-insurance-discounts?cache=false)
State Farm offers an exclusive discount to students under 25 who complete its Steer Clear program, regardless of their GPA. The program encourages safe driving through training modules and driving tests. 
Also, Progressive discounts good students under 24, while it’s 25 with most providers. For Geico, there is a Geico good student discount verification where you can check if you qualify.

### Provide Proof of Academic Performance
Insurance companies require students to submit proof of their academic achievements to get discounts. Some insurers accept standardized test score reports. USAA good student discount requirements include showing these records. If you meet the criteria, you may get a USAA good student discount.
![blog image 14](https://clearsurance.com/blog/best-good-student-car-insurance-discounts?cache=false)
You don’t need to worry if your grades are not the best. Companies like Geico offer [cheap car insurance for college students](https://clearsurance.com/blog/cheapest-car-insurance-companies-for-college-students), so you can still save on your premiums. 
### Maintain Eligibility Every Policy Period
Eligible drivers must keep up their good grades to maintain good student auto insurance discounts. Your insurer may request to see your grades every six or 12 months when your policy renews.
