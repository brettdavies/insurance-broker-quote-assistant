## The best car insurance companies in San Francisco

Car insurance providers are in the business of assessing risk, and historically, San Francisco drivers have had to pay high premiums partially due to the frequency of car break-ins here. However, per the [S.F. Car Break-In Tracker](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/sf-car-breakins/), the number of break-ins in 2025 is shaping up to be the fewest since tracking began in 2018.

This improvement is largely attributed to Proposition E, which authorized the city to deploy increased [surveillance tools](https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/sf-takes-historic-step-to-solve-crime-with-400-lpr-cameras) like license plate readers and cameras in high-crime neighborhoods. As a result, the San Francisco Police Department reports an [81 percent](https://abc7news.com/post/san-francisco-car-break-ins-historic-22-year-low-heres-look-police-data/16112998/) year-to-date increase in arrests related to car break-ins, which deters future attempts.

As the city’s risk landscape shifts, many car insurance providers have started lowering rates to reflect the reduced likelihood of claims. Bankrate’s insurance editorial team has identified insurers that align with this trend, as well as those that are highly rated by third parties like J.D. Power and those offering unique policyholder benefits. Based on our research, Progressive, Geico, State Farm, Nationwide and Mercury stand out as some of the [best auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in San Francisco.

**Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive scored above average in [J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-auto-insurance-study) for the California region, due in part to its coverage availability and numerous savings opportunities. Roadside assistance, trip interruption, custom parts coverage and pet injury coverage are all available from Progressive. Plus, its rates are competitive for San Francisco.

**Why Progressive may be best for online and mobile policy management:** Progressive was ranked well above average in both the service and shopping categories in the [J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-insurance-digital-experience-study). Its mobile app also has 4.6 and 4.8 star ratings on Google Play and the App Store, respectively. If you’re looking to manage your car insurance policy entirely online, it may be worth getting a quote from Progressive.

**Why Geico made our list**: Geico has responded most notably to the city’s lowered risk by providing, on average, some of the cheapest car insurance in San Francisco. And its affordable rates do not come at the expense of service, as Geico ranked highest of the providers we analyzed for overall satisfaction in the California region of the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study.

**Why Geico may be best for discounts**: What Geico lacks in policy endorsements it makes up for with cheap rates and discount opportunities that could help you save even more. Geico advertises more than 20 different savings opportunities on its website. These include good driver discounts, safety discounts and affinity discounts for military, federal employees and more.

**Why State Farm made our list**: As the [largest auto insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the country, State Farm is one of the most prominent names in insurance. State Farm is also one of the few carriers offering products like rideshare coverage, life insurance and landlord insurance — but not home insurance. Last year, State Farm [announced](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/carriers-exit-california-home-insurance/) it would no longer write new home insurance policies for California homeowners. So, if you’re looking to bundle your home and auto policies together, State Farm would not be a viable option.

**Why State Farm may be best for safe drivers:** State Farm rates are closer to the San Francisco average, but policyholders have the opportunity to reduce their premium by enrolling in the [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) telematics program. The generous discounts this program offers for responsible and courteous driving helped State Farm take home the [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company for Safe Drivers. If you want to learn more about this savings opportunity, there are multiple agent offices throughout the city that would be happy to assist.

**Why Nationwide made our list**: Nationwide has a lengthy discount list and two different telematics programs for even more potential savings. With SmartRide, you can earn a discount for safe driving habits, and with SmartMiles, your monthly rate will depend on how much you drive. According to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, these telematics programs helped Nationwide earn the honor of best usage-based insurance provider.

**Why Nationwide may best for policy add-ons**: Not only does Nationwide offer an impressive list of discounts, but its coverage options are also impressive. Endorsement options include vanishing deductible, a total loss deductible waiver and roadside assistance.

**Why Mercury made our list**: Mercury offers home and car insurance in the state of California, which could make it a good option for homeowners looking to bundle their policies. Roadside assistance and ride-hailing insurance are available as add-ons — the latter may be especially appealing to drivers working for Uber or Lyft.

**Why Mercury may be the best regional company**: National insurance companies are not a good fit for all drivers. For San Franciscans looking to work with a regional company, there is Mercury. Mercury only writes insurance policies in 11 states, including California. Mercury has four different insurance offices in San Francisco in the Cow Hollow, Outer Sunset, Duboce Triangle and SoMa neighborhoods. Local agents may help to provide insight into insurance needs that are specific to San Francisco.

What’s considered a [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-california/) in San Francisco may be wildly expensive compared to another city, but comparing quotes could help keep money in your pocket. Based on our research, Geico, Progressive and Mercury offer the cheapest rates on average for minimum coverage.

## How much is car insurance in San Francisco, California?

Car insurance, like mostly everything in San Francisco, is expensive compared to the national average. The [average cost of car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) in San Francisco is $3,515 per year for full coverage and $980 for minimum coverage. This is well above the national average cost of car insurance, which is $2,671 for full coverage and $806 for minimum coverage per year. San Francisco car insurance costs are also higher than the [California statewide average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/), which is $3,102 for full coverage and $915 for minimum.

However, a significant drop in car break-ins has prompted some insurers to reduce premiums after updating their risk algorithms with the latest crime data. Additionally, large metropolitan areas generally face higher insurance costs due to population density and the resulting traffic jams. That said, the San Francisco Bay Area population has [decreased by 109,000 residents](https://vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/indicators/population) since 2020, potentially lowering the overall risk of traffic-related accidents compared to previous years.

### San Francisco rates for teens

Teen drivers generally pay more for car insurance than older drivers. Their lack of experience behind the wheel and proclivity for speeding make teenagers a higher risk for an insurance company. And with car insurance, higher risk typically means higher rates. If you’re a teen driver who lives at home with your parents, you are likely better off [staying on your parents’ insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/can-i-be-on-my-parents-car-insurance/) for as long as you can, as that might help you get a cheaper premium.

### San Francisco rates for young drivers

The cost of car insurance in San Francisco usually starts to dip once you hit your early 20s and decreases significantly by age 25 — so long as you've avoided accidents and tickets. The rates below represent drivers on their own car insurance policies. But to save even more cash, young adults may want to consider staying on their parents' policy if they're still living under the same roof.

### San Francisco rates for seniors

Once a driver ages into their 60s and 70s, it’s possible for rates to begin to climb once again. Changes in vision and reaction time may raise the risk of an accident, which in turn could raise rates. But, if your car insurance company offers a senior or retirement discount, that could be a good way to balance out any premium surcharges.

## The cheapest car insurance company in San Francisco by driving record

Your motor vehicle report (MVR) is used by your insurance company to help set your rate. The MVR comes from your state’s Department or Bureau of Insurance and details your driving history. By looking at your MVR, a potential insurance company will know if you’ve ever gotten a speeding ticket, been in an accident, had a DUI or been dinged with another kind of driving infraction. Expectedly, a driver with a checkered motor vehicle report will likely pay more for their insurance policy than someone with a clean record. But not all driving infractions are equal in the eyes of an insurance company. If you find a carrier that’s more generous about speeding tickets, for instance, you could wind up paying closer to the average cost of insurance.

Minimum coverage requirements in San Francisco

In California, [drivers are required](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) to either have a car insurance policy, pay a $75,000 cash deposit to the DMV, carry a self-insurance certificate from the DMV or obtain a $75,000 surety bond from a licensed company. If you choose to go the route of a traditional car insurance policy, it must have at least the following liability limits:

* $30,000 bodily injury or death liability per person
* $60,000 bodily injury or death liability per accident
* $15,000 property damage per accident

While minimum coverage car insurance is cheaper than full coverage, San Francisco drivers may want to consider a full coverage policy. A full coverage car insurance policy can financially protect against vehicle theft and other damage, like the kind your car may endure after a smash-and-grab. Although these incidents have been less common in recent years, they can still happen, and minimum coverage insurance will not pay for repairing or replacing your car in these instances.

## Frequently asked questions

* ### How much car insurance do I need in San Francisco?

  Caret Down Icon

### Bankrate Score

Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.

Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

* **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
* **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings):** We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
* **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
