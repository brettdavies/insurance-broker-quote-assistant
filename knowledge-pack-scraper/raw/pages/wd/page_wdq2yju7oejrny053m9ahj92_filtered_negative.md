![ A female rideshare passenger checks her app after securing her seatbelt.](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/common-rideshare-insurance-misconceptions.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
**_Overview:_**_Navigating insurance for rideshare driving can be confusing, and there are many common misconceptions about insurance coverage. Some drivers mistakenly believe their personal auto policies will cover all rideshare activities, while others think that rideshare companies provide full coverage for their drivers. By understanding these misconceptions, drivers can better protect themselves throughout their rideshare journey. Because rideshare driving comes with different types of risks, securing appropriate insurance across all periods of the rideshare process can help offer protection._
As [rideshare apps](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/are-uber-and-lyft-safe) continue to grow in popularity, there are many misconceptions about how [rideshare insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rideshare-insurance-what-to-know) works. These rideshare myths could leave drivers financially vulnerable in the [event of an accident](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rideshare-accident-what-to-do). Understanding the truth about [rideshare insurance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/rideshare-coverage) is about helping to protect yourself when driving for a rideshare company.

Most [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) policies specifically exclude coverage if you’re driving for hire, classifying this as commercial use. Without a rideshare-specific endorsement, [a claim](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/auto/how-to-handle-an-accident) from a rideshare accident could be denied.
The[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage)[liability limits](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage) provided by rideshare companies during Period one can be relatively low compared to potential accident costs. These amounts may be insufficient for an expensive accident, especially if multiple vehicles are involved. Rideshare endorsements may offer higher, more protective limits during this period.
* **High deductibles** — rideshare company insurance covers certain damages during Periods two and three (when you have accepted a ride and are en route to pick-up a passenger or a customer is occupying your car). However, these [deductibles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) often range between $1,000 — $2,500, and you will likely be responsible for paying that amount upfront for repairs to your auto.
* **Explore rideshare coverage options** — explore multiple options online to see how much rideshare coverage and [car insurance you will need](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need).
* **Ask about specific rideshare coverage**[](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options)— familiarize yourself with the "periods" of rideshare driving and when each coverage would apply.
When you understand how rideshare insurance coverage works, you can help protect yourself and your finances.
