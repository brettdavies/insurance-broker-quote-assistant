[Home insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/insurance/) rates have skyrocketed nearly 70% in the past five years, according to [ICE Mortgage Technology](https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-september-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-5Bbzsj9QEEEa.pdf). For single-family households with a mortgage, premiums are averaging around $2,370 per year.
Areas impacted by natural disasters have seen steep increases in just the past year: Parts of North and South Carolina hit by severe flooding are facing rate increases of more than 7%. Premiums rose nearly 20% in Los Angeles, which saw more than 15,500 acres destroyed by wildfire in 2024.
Regardless of high prices, home insurance is required for most people with a mortgage,
Fortunately, there are ways to lower your premiums. [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) has rounded up nine smart and simple ways to save on homeowners insurance.

##  1. Bundle home and auto insurance
If you also own a car, [bundling your home and auto insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) can save you money and make it easier to manage your policies.
Many brands offer multi-policy rate reduction, but [American Family](https://secure.money.com/pr/e9d33b37a961) stands out with a bundling discount of up to 40%.

Many brands reduce rates for going paperless, setting up autopay, staying claims-free, installing protective devices and more.
##  3. Raise your deductible
Your [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) is the amount you pay for a repair before your insurer reimburses you for any expenses. Typically, a deductible is a fixed dollar amount, like $500 or $1,000, or a percentage of the home's insured value.
Upping your deductible generally lowers your premiums. According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/12-ways-to-lower-your-homeowners-insurance-costs), increasing your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can lower your rates by approximately 25%.  
  
If you go this route, make sure you have the funds for the additional out-of-pocket expense.
##  4. Make your home safer
Whether you're installing a water leak detection system or a security alarm, you can save money by protecting your home and reducing the likelihood of needing to file a claim.
These discounts range from 5% for a simple burglar alarm or smoke detector to upwards of 20% for more sophisticated sprinkler systems.
Protect your property and possessions from fire, theft, and other unexpected perils.

##  5. Skip small claims
Filing a claim on your home insurance can cause your rates to rise. If you have a small issue that's not much higher than your deductible, it's probably worth just footing the bill yourself.
The average premium goes up 6% after a claim relating to theft, liability or fire, according to data from [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-go-up-after-a-claim/).
If you have a $1,000 deductible, for example, it probably doesn't make sense to file a claim if your $1,200 laptop is stolen. Not only would your insurer deduct for depreciation, but it could also raise your annual rates for filing the claim.
##  6. Get rid of "attractive nuisances"
That trampoline you bought for the kids or the small pond you dug out in the backyard could be costing you. Because they attract children and can lead to accidents, they're considered attractive nuisances by insurance companies, who charge homeowners accordingly.
While the amount varies by item and insurer, it may be worth getting rid of these features, especially if your family is not using them much.
##  7. Improve your credit score
In most states, your credit history can be used by insurance companies [when deciding on approval and rates](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/).
If your [credit score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/easy-tips-to-help-raise-your-credit-score/) could use some work, paying of debts on time and in full is the best way to get your number up. It also lowers the amount of available credit you're using, which accounts for 30% of your score.   
  
For more help, services like [*Experian Boost®](https://www.moneylion.com/network/cnbc/credit-builders-bridge/explore?bridge_partner=experian-boost&tag.subid=) will send proof of on-time payments of rent, utility bills, and streaming services to the [credit bureaus](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-are-the-three-credit-bureaus/). That can help you get more positive marks and raise your score over time.
##  8. Make sure you're not over insured
When considering t[he amount of coverage you need](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/), don't focus on how much you paid for your house or its current market value. After all, you don't have to buy the land again.
You should base it on the cost to rebuild, by multiplying your area's building costs per square foot by your home's square footage. Check with local contractors for their rates or use [Angi](https://www.angi.com/articles/calculate-rebuild-costs-house.htm)'s online calculator to estimate construction cost by ZIP code. For a more specific figure, you can get a replacement cost estimate from an appraiser or contractor.  
  
You may also want to take a new home inventory if you've unloaded any assets since your last one, like a Peloton or some expensive jewelry.
If you're really tapped out, you can reconsider optional coverages. If you live in a low-risk area, for example, you may be able to forego separate [flood insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/).
##  9. Shop around
The insurance company that once offered you an excellent rate may have increased your premiums significantly in the past few years. So, it's worth comparing rates with at least two or three other competitors to find the best price.   
  
Be sure to obtain quotes with the same coverage amounts and deductibles for a fair comparison. Insurance marketplaces like [The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/) and [Policygenius](https://www.policygenius.com/) make it easy to get multiple quotes at once.
## Homeowners insurance FAQs
### Are my home insurance rates affected by my credit history?
Yes, in most U.S. states, your credit history plays a significant role in determining your [insurance score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/), which is then used to calculate your rates. Only California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Utah prohibit or greatly restrict the use of credit-based insurance scores.
### How much homeowners insurance do I need?
You should have enough coverage to rebuild your home, replace your belongings, cover your liability and pay for living expenses if you need to temporarily relocate. The cost of rebuilding is known as your dwelling limit — you can calculate it by looking up per-square-foot building costs in your area and then multiplying it by your home's square footage.
### How much does homeowners insurance cost?
The price of homeowners insurance varies greatly across the U.S, depending on where you live, the age and condition of your home, your claims history and other factors. According to [ICE Mortgage Technology](https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-september-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-5Bbzsj9QEEEa.pdf), homeowners with a mortgage pay an average of $2,370 per year for insurance, or about $197.50 per month.
