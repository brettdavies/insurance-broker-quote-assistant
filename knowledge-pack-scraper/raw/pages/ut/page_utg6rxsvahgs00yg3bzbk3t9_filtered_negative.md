##  3. Raise your deductible
##  4. Make your home safer
##  5. Skip small claims
##  6. Get rid of "attractive nuisances"
##  7. Improve your credit score
For more help, services like [*Experian Boost®](https://www.moneylion.com/network/cnbc/credit-builders-bridge/explore?bridge_partner=experian-boost&tag.subid=) will send proof of on-time payments of rent, utility bills, and streaming services to the [credit bureaus](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-are-the-three-credit-bureaus/). That can help you get more positive marks and raise your score over time.
##  8. Make sure you're not over insured
You should base it on the cost to rebuild, by multiplying your area's building costs per square foot by your home's square footage. Check with local contractors for their rates or use [Angi](https://www.angi.com/articles/calculate-rebuild-costs-house.htm)'s online calculator to estimate construction cost by ZIP code. For a more specific figure, you can get a replacement cost estimate from an appraiser or contractor.
##  9. Shop around
Yes, in most U.S. states, your credit history plays a significant role in determining your [insurance score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/), which is then used to calculate your rates. Only California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Utah prohibit or greatly restrict the use of credit-based insurance scores.
