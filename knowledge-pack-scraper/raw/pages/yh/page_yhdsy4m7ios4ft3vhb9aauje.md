Reading Time: 5 minute(s)
Citizens Property Insurance Corporation is a state-run insurance company in Florida. It was created to help Florida residents who cannot get insurance from private companies. Citizens Insurance is meant to be a safety net. However, many policyholders have problems with their claims. Some wait too long for payments. Others do not get the full amount or are denied completely. If this happens to you, there are things you can do.
## What is Citizens Property Insurance?
Citizens was started in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Property_Insurance_Corporation) by the Florida government as a non-profit insurance company. It mostly provides coverage for Florida residents in risky areas, like places that get a lot of hurricanes or flooding. Many private insurance companies are leaving Florida. Because of this, more people must use Citizens homeowners' insurance. 
Because Citizens has grown so much, it now handles hundreds of thousands of policies. However, with more policies come more problems, and many homeowners have reported delays, low payouts, or claim denials.
## Citizens Insurance Changes and Rate Adjustments
CBS News reported that Governor [Ron DeSantis](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/gov-desantis-announces-rate-cuts-for-many-south-florida-citizens-insurance-customers/) made an announcement. He said some South Florida Citizens Insurance customers will get lower rates. These cuts are meant to help homeowners who have been struggling with rising insurance costs.
The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation wanted to raise rates for Citizen's policyholders. However, many people are worried about the high cost of insurance. The governor stepped in and lowered rates for many South Florida homeowners. This change is an attempt to make property insurance more affordable.
Florida regulators approved a new plan. Private insurance companies will take over more than [300,000 policies](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/citizens-property-insurance-to-shed-policies-in-december/#:~:text=TALLAHASSEE%20%2D%20Florida%20regulators%20have%20approved,its%20insurer%20of%20last%20resort.) from Citizens. This is meant to reduce the number of policies Citizens manage and strengthen the private insurance market.
## Finding the Right Home Insurance in Florida
The right home insurance is important. It helps protect your home from unexpected damage. Citizens insurance may be an option, but homeowners should carefully compare different providers to find the best fit. Citizens offers insurance coverage. But many people prefer private companies. Private insurers often have better customer service, faster claims, and more coverage.

## Is Citizens a Good Insurance Company?
Citizens Insurance is for people who can't get another coverage. But some policyholders have problems. Claims take too long, and payments are too low. Citizens also have strict rules that may not always be in favor of the homeowner.
However, if you can’t find coverage anywhere else, Citizens homeowners' insurance might be your only option. Florida residents should weigh the pros and cons before deciding.
## Understanding Citizen Home Insurance Cost
Citizen policy cost varies based on location, property type, and coverage level. Since it is a state-backed insurer, rates are set based on risk factors, such as hurricane exposure and flood zones. Homeowners should compare Citizens insurance rates with private insurers to determine the most cost-effective option. To compare the citizens insurance cost and other private insurance, visit the [Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.](https://floir.com/consumers/choices-rate-comparison-search)
## Common Problems Homeowners Face
Even though Citizens is supposed to help homeowners, many people have issues with their claims. Some of the most common problems include:
**Slow Payments** : Homeowners wait a long time to get their money after filing a claim.
**Claim Denials** : Many claims get denied. Some are rejected for technical reasons. Others are denied for pre-existing damage or small details in the policy.
**Underpaid Claims** : Even when Citizens pay, it might not be enough to cover the damage.
**Disagreements with Adjusters** : Citizens may say the damage is not as bad as the homeowner claims.
## How to Make Sure Your Claim is Investigated Properly
To increase the chances of getting a fair payout, policyholders should take these steps:
  1. **Take Pictures and Videos:** Take clear pictures and videos of the damage as soon as possible. Keep records of any repairs and costs.
  2. **Know Your Policy:** Make sure you understand what your insurance covers and what it does not.
  3. **Follow Up Often:** Check on your claim status. If Citizens is taking too long, ask for updates in writing. 
  4. **Ask for Another Review:** If your claim is denied or underpaid, you can ask Citizens to take another look. Give them more proof if needed.
  5. **Get a Second Opinion:** Hire an independent adjuster or contractor to check the damage. You can find one through the [National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters](https://www.napia.com/).
  6. **Talk to a Lawyer:** If you think your claim is being handled unfairly, an insurance attorney can help you.
