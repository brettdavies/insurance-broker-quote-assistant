Companies consider young drivers — especially teenagers — at high risk of getting into an accident. Young people should always [compare rates from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") to find the best and cheapest policy.
Young drivers should also consider joining a parent's auto insurance policy. Their rates will go up after adding a teen driver, but the price of a combined policy is usually a lot lower than separate policies.
