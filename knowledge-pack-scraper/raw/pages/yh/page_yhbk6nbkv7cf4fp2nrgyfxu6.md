## Rating Agency
When you purchase something important, you probably look at ratings first. To save you time digging through dozens of reviews, we’ve collected ratings from important review sites.
Keep reading to learn about Progressive’s financial ratings and customer satisfaction ratings. This way, you can get a clear picture of what others think of the company.
The first financial rating we want to look at is[ A.M. Best’s](https://web.ambest.com/ratings-services). This rating website looks at a company’s financial strength and rates companies on a [letter grade scale](https://web.ambest.com/ratings-services/guide-to-best-s-credit-ratings).
So what did Progressive earn?
> A.M. Best gave Progressive Group an A+ rating.
Only an A++ rating is higher, so Progressive has a great rating from A.M. Best. What does an A+ rating mean? Progressive has a superior ability to meet its financial obligations. In other words, Progressive won’t bankrupt itself while paying claims and employees.
You may have seen the [Better Business Bureau (BBB)](https://www.bbb.org/) symbol on a business before, such as an auto repair shop. BBB creates its ratings from [multiple factors](https://www.bbb.org/overview-of-bbb-ratings), including customer complaint data.
Because BBB’s focus is on promoting ethical business practices, it is a great rating to look at. Like A.M. Best, BBB grades on a letter scale.
Because BBB asks for a state when searching for a rating, we looked at Progressive’s rating in Pennsylvania.
> In Pennsylvania, BBB gave Progressive Insurance a B- rating.
You can certainly check BBB’s rating in your state, but a B- rating is indicative that Progressive is mediocre. While a B- is okay, it shows that Progressive may have some issues with its business practices.
[Moody’s](https://www.moodys.com/) is a well-known rating agency that looks at the ability of companies to meet their financial obligations (creditworthiness).
> Progressive has an A2 rating from Moody’s.
This is a strong rating, as it means Progressive has a low level of credit risk. While an A2 rating isn’t the [highest rating possible](https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/ProductAttachments/AP075378_1_1408_KI.pdf), it is a decent rating that shows Progressive is financially strong.
[Standard and Poor (S&P)](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/) is another major site that rates companies’ creditworthiness. Like the other credit score ratings we’ve covered, S&P uses a[ letter scale ](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)(AAA is the highest score).
> S&P gave Progressive an A rating.
This is a decent rating. It means S&P believes Progressive has strong creditworthiness. However, an A rating also means Progressive is more susceptible to poor economic conditions, so a drop in the economy could prove detrimental to the company.
The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/) (NAIC) collects complaint data on major companies. By comparing the number of complaints to the number of total customers, NAIC formulates a complaint index.
> In 2017, Progressive Group received 120 complaints, resulting in a 0.75 complaint ratio.
This complaint index is decent. It is lower than the national complaint index of one.
It is also important to remember that it’s not just the number of complaints that matter. A company’s handling of complaints is an equally important part of dealing with customers.
[J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/) is another rating website that looks at how Progressive serves its customers. In 2019, J.D. Power conducted an [extensive study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2019-us-auto-insurance-study) that surveyed car insurance customers’ satisfaction levels with major companies.
The rating scale is as follows (circles are assigned based on score):
  * Five Power Circles: “Among the best”
  * Four Power Circles: “Better than most”
  * Three Power Circles: “About average”
  * Two Power Circles: “The rest”


Below is the power circle rating that Progressive received in each U.S. region.
Region  | JD Power Circle Rating  | Score (out of 1,000)   
---|---|---  
California Region  | About average | 821  
Central Region  | About average | 823  
Florida Region  | The rest | 809  
Mid-Atlantic Region  | The rest  | 828  
New England Region  | About average | 825  
New York Region  | The rest | 815  
North Central Region  | About average | 828  
Northwest Region  | The rest | 797  
Southeast Region  | The rest | 824  
Southwest Region  | The rest | 807  
Texas Region  | The rest  | 816

Unfortunately, Progressive didn’t score well at J.D. Power. Progressive only has two or three power circles in all U.S. regions, which isn’t great. J.D. Power’s ratings suggest that Progressive isn’t the best company for great customer service.
Before we dismiss Progressive’s customer service, we want to look at a few other customer satisfaction reviews. One of these review sites is Consumer Reports.
Consumer Reports 2017 study surveyed 23,609 consumers. Progressive earned the following scores.
Claim Process  | Satisfaction Rating   
---|---  
Reader Score  | 87  
Ease of Reaching an Agent  | Very Good   
Simplicity of the Process | Very Good   
Promptness of the Response  | Very Good  
Damage Amount  | Very Good   
Agent Courtesy  | Very Good   
Timely Payment  | Excellent  
Freedom to Select  | Very Good   
Being Kept Informed of Claim Status  | Very Good   
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive received decent ratings, even earning an excellent in the category _timely payments_. Consumer Reports’s rating of Progressive is definitely more encouraging than J.D. Power’s rating.
One last customer satisfaction review that we want to look at is Consumer Affairs.
> Currently, Progressive has almost four stars out of five on Consumer Affairs.
This is a good rating, and it’s based on over 2,700 reviews. Because Consumer Reports and Consumer Affairs’s ratings of Progressive are decent, they help balance out J.D. Power’s mostly negative region ratings.

## Company History
In 1937, a pair of young lawyers, Joseph Lewis and Jack Green, decided to found a car insurance company. Little did the founders imagine that their company would grow far beyond auto insurance.
Part of the reason for Progressive’s growth is that it is an innovative company. Progressive was one of the first insurers to create a website after the invention of the Internet. Today, Progressive uses its innovative improvements to promote its auto, life, and home insurance.
Wondering why we are sharing facts about Progressive’s history?
Looking at a company’s history is an important part of determining a company’s future. So stick with us as we look at Progressive’s market shares, awards, and more, so we can create an informed picture of how Progressive will fare.
Let’s jump in.
As an insurer that has been around for almost a century, Progressive controls a significant portion of the insurance market. Below is the NAIC’s data on Progressive’s market shares over the years.
Progressive Market Shares | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018  
---|---|---|---|---  
Percentage of Market | 8.7 | 9.15 | 9.84 | 10.97  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s market growth is impressive. Since 2015, Progressive has managed to increase its share in the market by over 2 percent. This is quite a large amount to secure in the market. It shows that Progressive is a major contender.
Progressive became a major insurer for a reason. It has great financial ratings from multiple review sites, which tells us Progressive has a stable future.
While Progressive has some below-average customer satisfaction ratings, it has still managed to increase its market shares and attract new customers. So while Progressive may struggle with customer satisfaction, there is little chance of Progressive going bankrupt anytime soon.
Want to find out more about Progressive? The company has multiple outreach methods that consumers can use.
  * Online — Visit Progressive’s website to find information and get free quotes.
  * Agents — Find and talk to an independent agent in your area.
  * Phone — Call 1-866-407-4844 to talk to Progressive customer service.
  * Email/Mail — Email Progressive or send mail to its headquarters.


Progressive offers independent agents, which is useful if you want to meet someone in-person to discuss car insurance policies. The company also has a strong online presence with its website, although consumers can also call or email the company for information.
Progressive’s spokesperson, Flo, has been cropping up on commercial breaks for years. Having a spokesperson is useful, as it helps a company’s commercials stick in the viewer’s mind.
(For example, Geico’s commercials use the same tactic as Progressive — think: Geico’s memorable “mascots,” the gecko and the caveman. But we aren’t here to discuss Geico versus Progressive.)
We want to see how effective Progressive is at advertising its wares, as marketing is an important part of attracting customers.
The interesting thing about Progressive is that it doesn’t have a catchy jingle or phrase like other insurers. Instead, Progressive relies on humor and Flo to make its commercials stick.
There are dozens of more commercials like this, using humor to promote Progressive’s home and auto insurance. If you think of Flo when you think of Progressive, Progressive’s marketing technique has been successful.
When consumers [shop for car insurance](https://www.insurantly.com/buying-car-insurance-top-tips-and-trick-to-save/ "shop for car insurance"), a company that is actively involved in the community is more attractive to the majority of consumers.
So what does Progressive do to help the community?
  * **The Progressive Insurance Foundation** — Progressive will match employees’ donations.
  * **Volunteer Website** — Progressive’s employee website lets employees find volunteer opportunities.
  * **STEM Progress Program** — Progressive’s program has employees visit schools and use insurance concepts to teach students skills.
  * **Keys to Progress** — Progressive gifts vehicles to veterans and their families.


Progressive takes an active role in the community, not just donating money but also volunteering.
We know Progressive’s employees are active volunteers, but how happy they at their job? Our goal in this section is to discover what Progressive employees think about the company they work at because a company with happy employees is doing something right. If employees hate a company, it’s likely customers are also less than satisfied.
Progressive is rated by a[ Great Place to Work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1000270), which gives detailed information about employees’ ages, tenures, and opinions about Progressive.

Employees gave Progressive great ratings on a Great Place to Work. To make sure we are getting a complete picture of Progressive’s workplace, though, we want to look at [Glassdoor’s rating](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Progressive-Insurance-Reviews-E546.htm).
  * Progressive has 3.7 stars out of five on Glassdoor (from over 2,000 reviews)
  * 70 percent of Progressive employees would recommend the company to a friend
  * 91 percent of Progressive employees approve of the CEO


These ratings are a little less positive than on a Great Place to Work. The negative reviews about working at Progressive mention long hours and poor work/life balance. Reviews also talk about the difficulty of working at Progressive’s call center.
However, positive reviews talk about how Progressive has a great work environment and benefits.
Finally, before we end the discussion on Progressive’s employees, we want to look at [Payscale’s ratings](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Progressive_Casualty_Insurance_Company/Reviews).

You now know what Progressive charges by state, but how good are Progressive rates when compared to other providers’?

Progressive rates, while generally lower than the state averages, are not the cheapest. Other providers, such as Geico, have cheaper rates than Progressive.
If you are looking for the cheapest rates in your state, Progressive may not be the best choice.
It may surprise you to learn that [car insurance companies](https://www.insurantly.com/companies/ "car insurance companies") use your gender as a price factor. However, some states have banned this practice.
> States that prohibit gender as price factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and parts of Michigan.
Basing rates on gender is only outlawed in a handful of states, so let’s take a look at what Progressive charges based on gender and age.
Progressive Demographic Rates |   
---|---  
Married 60-year-old female | $1,991.49  
Married 60-year-old male | $2,048.63  
Married 35-year-old female | $2,296.90  
Married 35-year-old male | $2,175.27  
Single 25-year-old female | $2,697.73  
Single 25-year-old male | $2,758.66  
Single 17-year-old female | $8,689.95  
Single 17-year-old male | $9,625.49  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Surprisingly, Progressive charges 35-year-old females more than males. Normally, males pay more than females in all age categories because insurers believe males to be riskier drivers based on accident data. As a result, most insurers charge male drivers more, especially those under age 25.
When you get a new car, you may be surprised to see your insurance rates drop slightly. Cars with safety features generally have a lower premium, while high-risk vehicles (sports cars) with poor crash ratings will cost more to insure.
Below are Progressive’s rates for different vehicle makes and models.
Make and Model | Progressive Average Rate  
---|---  
2018 Honda Civic Sedan  
LX with 2.0L 4cyl and CVT | $4,528.90  
2015 Honda Civic Sedan  
LX with 2.0L 4cyl and CVT | $4,429.56  
2018 Ford F-150  
Lariat SuperCab with 2WD 6.5 foot bed and 2.7L V6 | $3,962.58  
2015 Ford F-150

At Progressive, the most expensive car to insure is a Honda Civic Sedan. On the other hand, a Toyota RAV4 will cost about $1,000 less to insure.
Some companies will charge customers more for longer commutes. While it’s generally around $100 more, these small increases can add up to a pricy insurance bill at the end of the year.
Group | 10 Miles Commute / 6,000 Annual Mileage | 25 Miles Commute / 12,000 Annual Mileage  
---|---|---  
Progressive | $4,030.02 | $4,041.01  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s average increase for commute distance is small. An $11 price increase is low compared to other companies and is great for those with long commutes.
Thinking of upgrading your coverage level? Let’s take a look at Progressive’s price increases for different coverage levels.
Coverage Level | Low | Medium | High  
---|---|---|---  
Progressive Average Rate | $3,737.13 | $4,018.46 | $4,350.96  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s rates are fairly normal. It costs about $281 to go from low to medium coverage and $613 to upgrade from low to high coverage. This is a good rate, as some insurers can charge over $1,000 for upgrades.
While it’s not the lowest upgrade cost, it is reasonable.
The law permits insurers to base rates on consumers’ credit scores. If drivers have a poor or fair credit score, they will have higher rates.
> The average credit score in the [U.S. is 675](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/consumer-credit-review/).
If your credit score is lower than 675, your insurer may charge you more. Let’s see what Progressive charges based on credit score.
Credit Score | Good | Fair | Poor  
---|---|---|---  
Progressive Average Rate | $3,628.85 | $3,956.31 | $4,737.64  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s rate increase from good to poor credit may seem high, but it is normal. Most insurers charge about $1,000 for poor credit.
Equally as important as a credit score is a driver’s driving record.
Driving Record | Clean Record | With 1 DUI | With 1 Speeding Violation | With 1 Accident  
---|---|---|---|---  
Progressive Average Rate | $3,393.09 | $3,969.65 | $4,002.28 | $4,777.04  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
At Progressive, a DUI costs less than a speeding ticket. Still, each offense will cost a hefty sum. For example, an accident will cost drivers over $1,000.
The average rates shown above are for a first offense. If drivers have multiple offenses on their record, they will have higher rates and may have to purchase high-risk insurance.
## Coverages Offered
Now that we’ve covered Progressive’s prices, we want to see if Progressive’s coverages are worth the price. While it can be tempting to go with the cheapest insurer, a lower price could mean poor coverage.
So let’s see what Progressive has to offer.
Stick with us as we go through coverages and programs at Progressive.
Progressive offers a wide range of car insurance coverages.
**Progressive Auto Insurance Coverage**
Coverage  | Purpose  | Example of Coverage Use

Collision  | Pays for repairs to your vehicle in accidents with another vehicle or object.  | You hydroplane and crash into a tree.   
Commercial  | Covers vehicles used for business.  | You own a flower shop and have a delivery van used for your business.

Rideshare | Covers rideshare drivers.  | You want to work for Uber or Lyft as a rideshare driver.   
Umbrella  | Provides extra liability coverage.  | You were in an accident the other parties are suing you.   
Underinsured Motorist  | Helps you if you are in an accident with an underinsured motorist.  | A driver hits you, but has such poor insurance that the driver can't cover your medical and property damage bills.   
Uninsured Motorist  | Helps in hit-and-run accidents or an accident with an uninsured motorist.  | You come out of the store and someone has run into your car before fleeing the scene.

As the table above shows, Progressive has all the [basic car insurance](https://www.insurantly.com/coverage/ "basic car insurance") coverages, plus a few extras.
We’ve gone through some factors such as driving records. However, there are other ways to reduce rates. Because Progressive offers insurance other than car insurance, customers can bundle policies to save money.

While having a clean record and bundling policies can help lower rates, [discounts](https://www.insurantly.com/discounts/ "discounts") are also important. Progressive has one of the highest numbers of discounts among its competitors.
Below, you can see which discounts Progressive offers, as well as the percentage saved (when known).

Progressive has 36 discounts, making it easy to save. Simply getting paperless billing can save customers $50. So make sure to take advantage of Progressive’s discounts, as it can help lower costs significantly.
Progressive also has a wide range of programs intended to help customers out.
  * Accident Forgiveness — Progressive offers accident forgiveness to customers, which means rates won’t go up for a customer’s first accident.
  * Car Buying Service — Progressive partnered with TruCar to help customers shop for cars.
  * Custom Parts and Equipment Value — Covers anything not installed by the original manufacturer, such as a new stereo.
  * Roadside Assistance — Helps customers with flat tires, lock-outs, gas refueling, and towing.
  * Usage-Based Insurance — Progressive’s Snapshot app measures how well customers drive and adjusts rates accordingly.


Progressive has several programs, more so than most providers. A majority of them are meant to save customers money, such as accident forgiveness.
We’ve gone through Progressive’s rates and coverages, so let’s take a moment to reflect on what stands out and what’s missing.
  * What Stands Out — Progressive has a large number of discounts. It also has coverages and programs that go beyond the basics.
  * What’s Missing — Progressive lacks a military discount, which is usually common.


Progressive offers more than it lacks, although Progressive’s prices are higher than average. So while you’ll get a wide range of coverages, you’ll also be paying more.
So make sure to use Progressive’s discounts.

## Canceling Your Policy
Thinking of breaking up with Progressive? We want to see if Progressive will maturely handle the breakup, or if the company will demand fees and complicated paperwork in retribution.
So stick with us as we go through the aspects of canceling a policy at Progressive.
From fees to when you can cancel, it is all covered here.
Progressive isn’t clear on if it charges a fee for cancellation. However, there may be a fee for canceling before the end of a renewal cycle. This fee shouldn’t be more than $100, and customers shouldn’t be charged a fee at all if they cancel at the end of a renewal cycle.
To see what Progressive will charge you, give customer service a call.
Once again, Progressive doesn’t mention this on their website. If you paid for three months of coverage and cancel in the second month, though, Progressive should refund you for a month. However, this refund could be minus a possible cancellation fee.
You’ve decided to cancel, so now what? We are going to go through the must-know steps of canceling a policy at Progressive.
If you are switching providers, you need to have a new provider before canceling. Otherwise, you’ll have a lapse in coverage. Insurers will see this lapse and charge you more. (For more information, read our “[Auto Insurance Companies That Accept Lapses in Coverage](https://www.Insurantly.com/auto-insurance-companies-that-accept-lapses-in-coverage/)“).
Most insurers also require proof of a new insurer if you are canceling, so have the policy number of your new insurer ready. If you aren’t switching providers because you no longer need insurance (such as selling your car), then you need proof (such as a bill of sale).
Progressive requires customers to call **1-800-776-4737** to cancel a policy. The agent you speak to will probably try to convince you to stay with Progressive. They may try to help you get discounts to lower coverages or offer a new service.
Unless you can change your Progressive policy to your satisfaction, be firm and stick to canceling your policy. You can also ask your new insurer for help canceling at Progressive.
You can cancel at any time. However, canceling before a renewal cycle may result in a cancellation fee. If you want to avoid hidden fees, cancel at the end of a renewal cycle. Your cancellation should go into effect immediately, no matter when you cancel.
Are you on automatic billing? Check to make sure Progressive stopped your payments after cancellation.

## How to Make a Claim
Unfortunately, most drivers will make a claim at some point in their driving career. This is why it’s important to make sure you are with a company that has a fast claim process and is reliable.
Stick with us as we look at Progressive’s claims process, from how to file a claim to how many claims are paid out.
Let’s get started.
Progressive makes it easy to file a claim. Keep reading to see the different methods, from online to app filing.
Progressive customers can file a claim online. Progressive claims it takes about five to eight minutes to complete the online claim form. Customers will need answers to the following to file a claim online (and for all other methods of filing):
  * Type of claim you’re filing (auto, home, etc.)
  * The date of the accident
  * The location of the accident
  * Your policy information
  * The vehicles involved
  * The people involved


If you file online, you can periodically sign in and check your claim status.
Have Progressive’s mobile app? If you don’t feel like opening up a laptop, you can file a claim on Progressive’s app. This is a convenient method, especially because you can take pictures of the accident damage and instantly upload them to your claim form.
It also means you can file on the scene of the accident, rather than waiting until you get home and have access to a computer.
Progressive customers can also file a claim by calling **1-800-776-4737** (claim hotline). If you have an agent, you can also call your agent directly to file a claim. (For more information, read our “[Can You Get Cheaper Car Insurance Over the Phone?](https://www.Insurantly.com/general/can-you-get-cheaper-car-insurance-over-the-phone/)“).
How do premiums written relate to claims? Well, the higher the number of premiums written, the less customers have to pay. For example, a company with few written premiums will have to charge customers more to cover the cost of accident claims.
So let’s take a look at the NAIC’s data on Progressive’s written premiums.
Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018  
---|---|---|---|---  
Written Premiums  | $16,566,932,000 | $19,634,834,000 | $22,786,034,000 | $27,058,768,000  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive has nearly doubled its written premiums since 2015. This is impressive and should help keep rates lower at Progressive.
Loss ratio ties directly into written premiums and claims. So what exactly is a loss ratio?
> A loss ratio calculates the number of written premiums compared to the number of claims. A company with a 60 percent loss ratio is paying $60 on claims for every $100 earned from written premiums.
A high loss ratio may seem good, but anything over 100 percent means a company is risking bankruptcy. On the other hand, too low of a loss ratio means a company isn’t paying out a good number of claims.
So let’s take a look at Progressive’s loss ratios to see how many claims the company pays out.
Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018  
---|---|---|---|---  
Loss Ratio | 64.23% | 66.74% | 63.32% | 62%  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s loss ratio took a small dip in 2017 and 2018. However, it is still above 60 percent, which is a good loss ratio.
## How to Get a Quote Online
Getting a quote is a great way to compare prices between insurers. Most insurers offer free quotes, and Progressive is one of them.
Since the last thing you want is to sign up with an insurer outside your price range, keep reading to learn how to get a free quote from Progressive.
Let’s begin.
The first thing to do is to visit Progressive’s website. On the homepage, you’ll see the option to get a quote filling up most of the screen.
**![Progressive Home Webpage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201348%20637'%3E%3C/svg%3E)**
Once you select an auto insurance quote and enter your ZIP code, you’ll be asked to enter basic information about yourself.
![Progressive Auto Quote Basic Information](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201347%20637'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
You’ll be asked for your name, address, and date of birth.
Next, you’ll have to enter information about your vehicles. If you know your vehicle identification number (VIN), you can enter that.
Otherwise, fill in what you know about your vehicle’s year, make, and model. ![Progressive Quote Vehicle Information](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20943%20606'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
You will also be asked about the use of your car, as this can help calculate commute distance rates.
One of the last sets of information you’ll need to fill out is driver history.
![Progressive Quote Driver History](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20728%20586'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Progressive will ask you about past accidents, tickets, and violations. If you recall, these violations are an important factor in determining insurers’ rates.
You will also need to fill out basic details, such as your gender, past license revocations, and primary residence.
Finally, Progressive will ask for a few details about your insurance history.
![Progressive Quote Final Details](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20642%20623'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Once you’re done filling out the information, you will immediately be given a quote.
![Progressive Final Quote Options](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20868%20529'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
There are options to choose a basic package, a choice package, or a recommended package. While Progressive gives you the option to immediately purchase a plan, you are not obligated to purchase a plan at the end of the quote.
We know we just threw a lot of information at you, so as a reminder, you need the following information for a Progressive quote.
Information  | Required?   
---|---  
Social Security Number  | Yes (used to check credit scores)  
Driver's License  | No   
Vehicle Identification Number  | No   
Contact Information (email, address, etc.)  | Yes   
Driver's History  | Yes   
Vehicle Information  | Yes

## Design of Website and App
Websites and apps need to be clutter-free these days. Nobody wants to spend time slogging through articles to find information. Nor do people have the patience for apps riddled with bugs.
To see how Progressive has kept up with the times, we are going to go through Progressive’s website and app designs.
Progressive has a simple website design, which is great. There are no annoying pop-ups or banners when you scroll through the site, and answers are easy to find.
On the left side of the screen, there are four drop-down menus: insurance, claims, about, and answers.
![Progressive Home Webpage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201348%20637'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
On the right side of the screen, there is Progressive’s phone number and a log in option.
You may have noticed there is no search bar on the top of the screen. This is one flaw with Progressive’s website design. If you want to search manually instead of looking through Progressive’s dropdown menus, you will need to scroll to the bottom of the home page. **![Progressive_Search_Bar_-medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201279%20426'%3E%3C/svg%3E)**
If visitors don’t know the search bar is at the bottom, they may become irritated while trying to find information.
In other areas, though, Progressive’s website is well designed and has clear information categories.
Progressive’s main mobile app has good[ reviews on Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/progressive/id349731802). The app has 3.4 stars out of five (based on over 1,600 reviews).
![Progressive_Main_App_](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20875%20783'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Customer’s complaints with the app were normal, as they had to do with bugs. For example, customers complained about trouble signing in and using autopay. For the most part, though, customers seem satisfied with Progressive’s app.
So what can you do on the app?
  * View coverages, discounts, ID cards, documents, and policy details
  * File claims and add pictures
  * Pay bills and view billing history
  * See Snapshot data
  * Get a quote or make a policy change
  * Request roadside assistance
  * Contact an agent


The range of services from the app means customers can manage their accounts from their phones.
As for Progressive’s Snapshot app, it did less well on [Apple reviews](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapshot-mobile/id1228705679).
**![Progressive_Snapshot_Mobile_App_](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20878%20816'%3E%3C/svg%3E)**
Snapshot only has two out of five stars (based on over 400 reviews).
This is typical of most driving apps. Unfortunately, insurers haven’t yet created technology that perfectly records driving data. As a result, drivers find themselves overly penalized for hard braking and other things outside their control.
There are also issues with the app draining users’ batteries and users forgetting to mark that they aren’t driving when in a car (resulting in distracted driving points).
Hopefully, Progressive will work on correcting these issues with their app.
## Pros and Cons
We are nearly done with our guide. So let’s take a moment to look at Progressive’s pros and cons.
Pros  | Cons   
---|---  
Wide range of coverages and add-ons  | More expensive than other providers   
Higher than average number of discounts  | Doesn't have a military discount   
Website easy to use  | Search bar isn't easily accessible   
Stable financial future, pays out good amount of claims  | Driving app has poor reviews   
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/progressive-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
Progressive’s rates are higher than the norm, but Progressive’s amount of discounts should help keep costs down.
## The Bottom Line
Progressive has multiple programs and discounts that can help lower costs, which could make Progressive an affordable provider. If you have a clean driving record and good credit history, Progressive’s rates will be even lower.
Customer satisfaction with Progressive isn’t as good as it could be, but Progressive’s stable financial ratings show Progressive is still attracting and keeping customers.
If you are considering Progressive, make sure to get a quote to see if Progressive is within your budget.
## FAQ
Before we end our guide, we want to look at what others are asking about Progressive. Keep reading to find answers to commonly asked questions.
There are two types of accident forgiveness at Progressive. The first type is small accident forgiveness. With this type, your first claim won’t raise your rates as long as the total claim amount is less than $500.
The second type, large accident forgiveness, makes sure your rates won’t increase after an accident (no matter the amount). To qualify for the second type, you need to have been a Progressive customer for at least five years.
You also need to have been accident-free for the last three years.
At the end of Progressive’s free quote form, Progressive gives customers the option to buy a policy online. This means that you don’t need to visit a site in-person or call to buy a Progressive policy.
Unfortunately, Progressive will raise rates if the app shows drivers to be high-risk. While Progressive says only two out every 10 drivers receive a rate increase from the app, if you aren’t a good driver, don’t get the app.
If you find the app is raising your rates, it’s a good idea to discontinue it. However, while you can cancel it at any time, in some states you may be charged a surcharge if you cancel within 45 days of getting the app.
Insurance lapses are not good for your record. However, Progressive does have a short grace period if you miss a payment. Depending on what state you live in, you’ll have 10 – 20 days after the missed payment before Progressive cancels your insurance.
Worried about forgetting a payment? Progressive offers autopayment for its customers.
It depends. If you have comprehensive or [collision coverage](https://www.insurantly.com/coverage/collision/ "collision coverage"), you may not have to purchase rental insurance. However, Progressive recommends that drivers buy rental coverage because if you get in a rental car accident, Progressive won’t raise your rates because you won’t be filing with Progressive. Instead, everything will be handled through the rental car insurance.
Congratulations. You’ve completed our intensive review of Progressive insurance. We hope you are now ready to make the critical decision on which provider you trust to insure your vehicle.
