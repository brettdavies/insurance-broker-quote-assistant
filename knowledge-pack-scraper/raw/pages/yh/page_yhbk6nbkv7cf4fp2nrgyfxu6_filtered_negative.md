Coverage  | Purpose  | Example of Coverage Use
---|---|---
Bodily Injury Liability  | This coverage pays for another driver's medical bills/loss of income in an accident you caused.  | You glance down to check the GPS instructions and rear-end another car, injuring the driver.
Classic Car  | Covers classic cars for less than regular auto insurance policies.  | Vintage cars used just for pleasure -- driving around on a sunny day.
Collision  | Pays for repairs to your vehicle in accidents with another vehicle or object.  | You hydroplane and crash into a tree.
Commercial  | Covers vehicles used for business.  | You own a flower shop and have a delivery van used for your business.
Comprehensive  | Pays for repairs in accidents not caused by another vehicle. These accidents include theft, natural disasters and animal collisions.  | Your car is parked outside when heavy winds knock a tree onto your car.
Gap Coverage  | Pays the difference between your vehicle's actual value and what you still owe on your loan/lease.  | You total your car. Your car is worth 10,000, but you still owe 15,000 on your car loan.
Medical Payments  | Pays for your and your passenger's medical costs in an accident.  | An accident gave you a mild concussion, and you need to be treated at a hospital.
Personal Injury Protection  | Pays for your medical bills and other accident costs (such as lost income).  | Your concussion from an accident leaves you unable to work for a month, resulting in medical bills and lost income.
Property Damage Liability  | Pays for damages to another person's vehicle/property in an accident you caused.  | You accidentally scrape another person's car pulling into a tight parking spot.
Rental Reimbursement  | Provides access to a rental car if your car is in shop after a covered accident.  | Your car will be in the repair shop for at least a few days, so you need another vehicle to get around.
Rideshare | Covers rideshare drivers.  | You want to work for Uber or Lyft as a rideshare driver.
Umbrella  | Provides extra liability coverage.  | You were in an accident the other parties are suing you.
Underinsured Motorist  | Helps you if you are in an accident with an underinsured motorist.  | A driver hits you, but has such poor insurance that the driver can't cover your medical and property damage bills.
Uninsured Motorist  | Helps in hit-and-run accidents or an accident with an uninsured motorist.  | You come out of the store and someone has run into your car before fleeing the scene.
