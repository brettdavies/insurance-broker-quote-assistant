Progressive Advantage Agency, Inc. refers consumers seeking Mexican auto insurance to a surplus lines broker (International Insurance Group, Inc. or IIG) for placement with certain Mexican insurers. IIG and the insurers are not affiliated with Progressive. The insurers are surplus lines carriers and are not backed by any state insurance guaranty fund if they become insolvent.
PAA and Progressive are not responsible for insurer or coverage selections, policies issued, claims, the content or operation of others' websites, or how others handle or use your information. Information you provide to others is subject to their privacy policies and website terms of use, and may be shared with us.
PAA receives compensation from IIG that may vary based on the policy, and how, you buy. [Contact us](https://www.progressive.com/contact-us/) for more details.
Price, coverage, and coverage terms and conditions may vary between insurers. Availability may vary by state. The Mexico insurance offered through IIG does not cover rental vehicles in Mexico.
Note for Progressive policyholders in Texas: Coverage for physical damage to insured vehicles is available for Progressive's Texas policyholders who make occasional trips into Mexico within 25 miles of the border. Ask a Progressive representative or your Progressive agent for more details.
