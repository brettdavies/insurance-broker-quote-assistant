* How Much Renters Insurance Do I Need?
![Young man playing a ukelele thinking about how much renters insurance he needs. ](https://www.statefarm.com/content/dam/sf-library/en-us/secure/legacy/simple-insights/how-much-renter-insurance-do-i-need.jpg)
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
You've followed your [rental guide](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/tips-for-renting-an-apartment-or-a-house) and it's time to move in! Your furniture is in place, the utilities are hooked up and your rental unit is starting to look like a home. And now you might be asking yourself — do I need renters insurance?
A renters policy is more important, accessible, and affordable than you might think, and in some cases, [renters insurance is required by landlords](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/is-renters-insurance-required). But renters are often unclear about what renters insurance is, what it covers and how much they need.
In short, [renters insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/renters) covers what you own. Most [landlord's insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/questions-to-ask-your-landlord-about-maintenance) covers only the building and damages due to negligence. Getting coverage for some of the most common causes of property damage and loss — such as theft, vandalism and fire — is entirely up to you. Without renters insurance, you may have to bear the financial burden of a loss on your own, including the [cost of a hotel stay](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/does-renters-insurance-cover-hotel-stay) if you cannot live in your apartment while repairs are made due to an insured event.

Personal property coverage is probably the main reason most purchase a renters policy. The coverage will reimburse you for covered loss, damage or theft of your possessions up to a certain dollar amount. [Completing a home inventory](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-inventory-how-to-create-one) is a good way to determine how much property coverage you need. This inventory lists your possessions, along with details about their age, purchase price or current value and other identifying information. While you’re at it, take pictures or a video of your property.
Many insurers offer significant discounts if you buy and [bundle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/bundle-insurance) more than one policy with their company. For renters, this usually means purchasing [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) with a renter’s policy. But [life](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/life), business and other plans may also qualify.
Your renters policy's liability coverage may protect you if someone injures themselves in your home. It may also protect you in case you accidentally cause damage to others' property. Some policies will pay for defense and court costs in addition to settlement costs. The typical renter’s insurance policy offers $100,000 in liability coverage. For renters, this amount is often sufficient. However, [if you entertain company frequently at your home](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/insurance-for-a-house-party) or if your assets exceed your limit, you should consider a coverage amount equal to at least the total value of your assets.
Keep in mind that your policy will exclude certain perils (such as [earthquake](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/do-you-need-earthquake-insurance) and [flood losses](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/do-i-need-flood-insurance)), limit coverage on some items (such as computers, firearms and silverware) and [might not cover a business in your home](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/small-business/choosing-coverage-to-protect-your-homebased-business). If you have special insurance needs, talk to your [agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) about extending limits or adding separate policies.
And finally, where your apartment is located will play an important role in determining your renter’s insurance rates. Prices will vary based on your state, city and neighborhood. Safer locations might mean lower rates, so renting in a low-crime area near a fire station might save you money. Your rates will also reflect the [safety of the rental property itself](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/rental-property-viewing-checklist). For example, an older, unrenovated building might have a higher risk of electrical and [plumbing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/preventative-plumbing-maintenance-for-your-home) issues, and that can mean higher rates. Fortunately, steps as simple as having [fire safety equipment](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/fire-safety-equipment-for-home) like a smoke detector or a fire extinguisher in your apartment may mean real savings, even if you rent an older property.
