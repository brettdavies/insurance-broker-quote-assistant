## Choosing the Right Policy
When deciding on an umbrella insurance policy, consider your total net worth to ensure you're adequately covered. This includes assets like vehicles, property, retirement accounts, and investments.

You should also think about your future income, as your umbrella policy should cover the value of all your assets, including any potential future earnings. This is especially important if someone sues you for damages, as your future wages might be garnished.
To find the best umbrella insurance, ask questions like, "What **excess coverage does the policy provide** for claims involving uninsured or under-insured drivers?" This will help you understand the policy's limitations and ensure you're getting the right protection for your assets.

Choose coverage limits that match your assets and account for future income. Consider your total net worth, as your assets and income could be at risk if someone sues you for damages. Your umbrella policy should cover the value of all your assets, including vehicles, property, retirement accounts, and investments.
Even if you don't have many assets at the moment, purchase umbrella insurance if you _anticipate reaching a higher net worth_ in the near future. This will ensure you're protected against potential lawsuits or judgments.

## Understanding Umbrella Insurance

An umbrella policy kicks in to provide more coverage when your primary insurance reaches its payout limits, giving you extra protection for your home, car, boat, or recreational vehicle.
Umbrella insurance covers excess liability costs after your auto, home, or other insurance limits have been exhausted. It can also cover things not covered under your other liability policies, such as libel or slander.
Most auto insurance policies only provide up to $500,000 in liability coverage. This is a good reason to consider an umbrella policy if you have more than $500,000 in assets.
