New York Central Mutual, or NYCM, not only offers some of the cheapest average homeowners insurance rates in Brooklyn, but it also offers a few handy add-ons for policies. For homeowners who want to customize their coverage, they may be able to purchase endorsements for [equipment and appliance breakdown coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/equipment-breakdown-coverage/), valued possession coverage and utility line expense coverage. In addition to cheap rates, NYCM offers fairly unique home insurance discounts with potential savings for homeowners who work from home, retired homeowners and renovated homes. However, NYCM is not scored by J.D. Power for customer satisfaction (likely because it is a regional carrier) so you may want to speak with existing policyholders about their customer service experience.

## How much is home insurance in Brooklyn, New York?
The [average cost of home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) in Brooklyn for $300,000 in dwelling coverage is $2,331 per year. When compared to the state average, Brooklyn's rates are typically 25 percent more than the rest of New York. These variations in cost might be due to factors like the higher property crime rates in the city, the age and construction style of homes and the increased risk of weather-related events. Homeowners in Brooklyn should consider these aspects when budgeting for home insurance.
### Brooklyn rates by credit tier
Home insurance premiums in Brooklyn can be significantly influenced by the [homeowner's credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-credit-score-affect-home-insurance/). Insurers often use credit-based insurance scores to help determine the likelihood of a policyholder filing a claim. Generally, better credit could result in lower premiums, as it may indicate a lower risk to the insurer. Conversely, lower credit might lead to higher insurance costs. Brooklyn homeowners should be aware of how their credit history can impact their insurance rates and take steps to improve their credit if necessary to potentially lower their premiums. Here is a breakdown of how having poor to excellent credit could affect your premium.

### Brooklyn rates by home age
The age of a home can play a significant role in determining home insurance rates in Brooklyn. Older homes may have outdated electrical, plumbing and heating systems, which could increase the risk of damage or loss and, consequently, result in higher premiums. On the other hand, newer homes often come with modern construction standards and updated systems, typically leading to lower insurance costs. Brooklyn homeowners should consider the age of their home when shopping for insurance, as well as the potential benefits of [making updates or renovations](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-and-renovations/) to reduce their premiums.

### Brooklyn rates by deductible
The [deductible amount](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/) you choose for your home insurance policy can significantly impact your premium in Brooklyn. A higher deductible usually means lower monthly or annual premiums, as the homeowner agrees to pay more out of pocket in the event of a claim. Conversely, a lower deductible often results in higher premiums since the insurer would cover a larger portion of covered claims. Brooklyn homeowners should carefully consider how much they can afford to pay upfront in the event of a loss when selecting a deductible, balancing immediate savings on premiums with potential future expenses.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
