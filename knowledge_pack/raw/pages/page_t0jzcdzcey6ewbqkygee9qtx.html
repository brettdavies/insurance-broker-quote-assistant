Adding a <a href="/car-insurance/driver/age/under-25/"><strong>young driver</strong></a> to the family policy will raise the premium — but whether you or your parents pay for your coverage — that increase will be cheaper than paying for a separate policy.</p><p>More than just the cost matters, too. For example, these are a few situations when you can be on your parents’ policy:</p><ul><li><p>You’re a college student who only drives your parents’ car when you’re home during breaks, and your parents’ address is still your primary residence.</p></li><li><p>You live with your parents and drive a car they own or lease.</p></li><li><p>You co-own a car with your parents or live in a property they own or rent.</p></li></ul><p>And these are times when you’ll probably have to buy separate coverage:</p><ul><li><p>You don’t live with your parents or in a property they own. Most insurers make exceptions for temporary housing like dorms, so this is typically only if you move out and change your primary residence.</p></li><li><p>You own or lease your own car. But some insurers may let you stay on a family policy if you still live with your parents.</p></li></ul><p>The rates in this table show you could save about $90 per month, on average, if your parents add you to their policy versus buying a full-coverage policy of your own.</p><div><div class="bB_hr bB_hl bB_hk"><table><thead><tr><th class=""><div class="bB_hn bB_hv"><div><span><strong>Drivers</strong></span></div><div class="lt-vstack bB_hp"><img alt="sort asc" class="bB_hw" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"><img alt="sort desc" class="" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"></div></div></th><th class=""><div class="bB_hn bB_hv"><div><span><strong>Liability Only</strong></span></div><div class="lt-vstack bB_hp"><img alt="sort asc" class="bB_hw" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"><img alt="sort desc" class="" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"></div></div></th><th class=""><div class="bB_hn bB_hv"><div><span><strong>Full Coverage</strong></span></div><div class="lt-vstack bB_hp"><img alt="sort asc" class="bB_hw" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"><img alt="sort desc" class="" width="16" height="16" src="https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg"></div></div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=""><th class="">Two parents + a teen driver</th><td class="">$296</td><td class="">$599</td></tr><tr class=""><th class="">Two parents</th><td class="">$157</td><td class="">$316</td></tr><tr class=""><th class="">Teen driver on their own policy</th><td class="">$184</td><td class="">$372</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="container cj_cf bB_cf">Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers.

It might even be expensive to park a car nearby.</p><p>If you’re leaving the car at home and only driving it during school breaks, you’ll stay on your parents’ insurance.

Depending on when you get your license, your state may not require you to take driver’s ed, but it’s still a good idea to learn safe driving techniques and save money on premiums.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintain good grades.</strong> Most insurance companies offer discounts to students who achieve good grades since data shows those students exhibit less risky driving behavior. An insurer may require a certain GPA or class ranking to qualify.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drive a safe vehicle.</strong> Insuring a safer vehicle is cheaper than insuring a more specialized, luxury, or classic car.<sup><a href="#cite-6">[6]</a></sup> The IIHS rates vehicle safety and publishes a list every year that you can reference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compare car insurance.</strong> It pays to shop around. Comparing auto insurance quotes is one of the best ways to save on premium costs because it’ll help you find the best price for your ideal coverage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduce your coverage.</strong> If you’re driving an older car and paying more for insurance than it would cost to replace the car, buying just liability-only insurance instead of <a href="/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/"><strong>full coverage</strong></a> will help you save on premiums.</p></li></ul></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="standard-coverages" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"><h2>Standard car insurance coverages</h2><p>No matter where you go to college, you’ll need at least your home state’s minimum liability coverage to drive. (Only New Hampshire doesn’t require car insurance.) Here’s what liability insurance typically includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bodily injury liability coverage:</strong> <a href="/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/"><strong>Bodily injury liability</strong></a> pays for injuries to someone else in an accident you cause.</p></li><li><p><strong>Property damage liability coverage:</strong> This pays for damage you cause to someone else’s property in an accident.</p></li></ul><p>Triple-I recommends buying the highest limits you can afford to ensure greater financial protection if someone sues you following an accident. Since crash rates are highest for teen drivers, Triple-I recommends buying more coverage for less experienced drivers.</p><p>Unlike liability coverage, a full-coverage car insurance policy pays to repair your vehicle following an accident or covered event. It typically includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Collision coverage:</strong> <a href="/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/"><strong>Collision insurance</strong></a> pays for damage to your car from a crash with another car or object, like a tree or telephone pole.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive coverage: </strong><a href="/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/"><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong></a> reimburses you for damage from vehicle theft, vandalism, fire, falling objects, earthquakes, floods, riots, and more.</p></li></ul><div><div><div class="bc_bn bc_fK"><div class="lt-row lt-gutter-y-0"><div class="lt-col lt-span-10 lt-span--pull-1 lt-span-4-sm lt-span--pull-0-sm bc_d9"><h3 class="lt-align-center">Compare Quotes and Save</h3><p class="lt-align-center">Cut your car insurance bill by up to $1,100 when you compare through Insurify</p><form class="ct_mk" data-cy="zipcodeFormMoneybox"><fieldset><label><span class="ct_ml" data-percy="hidden">Enter your ZIP code</span><input data-percy="hidden" name="zipcode" id="zipcodeInputMoneybox" data-cy="zipcodeInputMoneybox" type="tel" maxlength="5" value=""></label><button class="r_bH r_bR r_bD">Get My Quotes Now</button></fieldset></form></div><div class="lt-col lt-span-12 bc_br"><div><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><path fill="none" d="M0 0H24V24H0z"></path><path d="M12 1l8.217 1.826c.457.102.783.507.783.976v9.987c0 2.006-1.003 3.88-2.672 4.992L12 23l-6.328-4.219C4.002 17.668 3 15.795 3 13.79V3.802c0-.469.326-.874.783-.976L12 1zm0 2.049L5 4.604v9.185c0 1.337.668 2.586 1.781 3.328L12 20.597l5.219-3.48C18.332 16.375 19 15.127 19 13.79V4.604L12 3.05zm4.452 5.173l1.415 1.414L11.503 16 7.26 11.757l1.414-1.414 2.828 2.828 4.95-4.95z"></path></g></svg>Secure.

deductible</li> <li>Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible</li> </ul> <p>Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database
