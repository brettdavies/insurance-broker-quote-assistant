Did you know that 27 percent of fatal crashes in Virginia in 2022 involved alcohol-impaired driving? Forty percent involved speeding, 17 percent involved distracted driving, and 2.5 percent involved hit-and-runs, according to data from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/high-risk-auto-insurance/#citation-1)
These dangerous behaviors not only put lives at risk, but can also lead to fines and penalties. If these violations end up on your driving record, insurance companies will label you as a high-risk driver, resulting in significantly higher premiums compared to someone with a clean record. Let’s explore how much you can expect to pay for car insurance as a high-risk driver in Virginia.
## Insurance Rates for High-Risk Category Drivers in Virginia
On average, a minor violation like a speeding ticket will increase your [Virginia car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/best-car-insurance/) premiums by less than 10 percent, while a violation that requires an FR-44 will double your rates.
Driver profile | Avg. cost full coverage in Virginia | Premium increase  
---|---|---  
Clean record | $1,808 | N/A  
[Speeding ticket](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/how-speeding-ticket-impacts-insurance/) | $1,952 | 8%  
DUI | $2,298 | 27%  
[SR-22](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/sr-22/) | $2,531 | 40%  
FR-44 | $3,832 | 112%  
SR-22s require you to carry the state’s minimum coverage, while [FR-44s](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/fr-44-insurance/), which are for more serious violations, require limits double the minimum.
Not every high-risk driver is someone who was caught speeding or driving under the influence. Other high-risk categories include young drivers, drivers with poor credit, and drivers with an at-fault accident on their record. The average cost of auto insurance for high-risk drivers across all companies is always going to be more than it would be for someone with a clean driving record. 
## Options for High-Risk Drivers Who Can’t Find Coverage 
A single speeding ticket or at-fault accident will raise your rates, but won’t prevent you from finding coverage with most standard insurers. However, standard carriers may reject drivers with SR-22s, FR-44s, or other serious violations, making it difficult to find coverage. [High-risk auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/) cater to nonstandard drivers and will accept customers with serious violations. Because these companies specialize in high-risk insurance, their average rates are higher than standard providers.
Previously, [Virginia’s car insurance laws](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/car-insurance/laws/) allowed drivers to pay a $500 uninsured motor vehicle (UMV) fee in lieu of having auto insurance. As of July 1, 2024, all drivers in Virginia must carry minimum liability coverage, with required limits increasing on January 1, 2025. New Hampshire is now the only state that doesn’t require drivers to have car insurance.
When looking for an insurance company that accepts high-risk customers, compare quotes from at least three providers. The cheapest insurance company for high-risk drivers varies based on factors like ZIP code, gender, and marital status.
The following nonstandard insurance companies sell policies in Virginia:
  * [Direct Auto](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/direct/reviews/) (which recently acquired SafeAuto)
  * [The General](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/the-general/reviews/)
  * Acceptance Insurance
  * [GAINSCO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/gainsco/reviews/)
  * Good2Go


Additionally, Progressive, [State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/), Travelers, and [USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/) are standard insurers that may take on nonstandard drivers.
## How to Lower Your Premium
Even when you’re considered a high-risk driver, there are ways to find cheap auto insurance in Virginia.
  1. **Bundle home and auto insurance.** If you’re one of the 69 percent of Virginia residents who own their home, [bundling home and auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/home/) can earn you a discount on both policies.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/high-risk-auto-insurance/#citation-2)
  2. **Pay-per-mile insurance.** If you’re retired, work from home, or your household has a second car that is driven less frequently, you could save money with pay-per-mile insurance. USAA Noblr and Nationwide SmartMiles are both available in Virginia. Additionally, some companies, like State Farm offer low mileage discounts.
  3. **Take a defensive driving course.** [Senior drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/seniors/) age 55 and older can take a defensive driving course every two years to get five points removed from their driving record. These eight-hour courses cost $100 but could save you even more on your car insurance premium by getting points removed from your record. Find a course near you via https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#clinics.asp.
  4. **Get minimum coverage.** Since Virginia requires insurance for all drivers, you must meet certain minimum liability limits. Buying [minimum coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/minimum/) with the limits below is your cheapest option.


Policy effective date | Bodily injury per person | Bodily injury per accident | Property damage per accident  
---|---|---|---  
Jan. 1, 2022-Dec. 31, 2024 | $30,000 | $60,000 | $20,000  
On or after Jan. 1, 2025 | $50,000 | $100,000 | $25,000  
## Will You Stay High-Risk Forever?
You will stay a high-risk driver in the eyes of insurance companies if you continue to have points on your driving record. The number of points you get and how long they stay on your record depend on the severity of the violation.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/virginia/high-risk-auto-insurance/#citation-3) See a list of all non-commercial violations in Virginia below.
