If you get into an accident as a New York resident, no fault insurance pays for medical expenses, loss of income and other miscellaneous expenses regardless of fault. Here’s what you need to know about no fault insurance in [New York](https://www.plymouthrock.com/insurance/auto/ny), how you’re covered and what is covered.
## Is New York a no fault state?
New York is one of twelve states in the US with no fault insurance laws. This is why NY is known as a “no fault state”.
## What is “No Fault”? What is PIP?
In a no fault state like New York, you’re [required to carry](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-is-the-minimum-auto-insurance-coverage-in-new-york) Personal Injury Protection, or PIP, as part of your insurance policy. This provides medical coverage for you and your passengers if there’s an accident, no matter who was at fault. PIP can also be referred to as No Fault coverage. Keep in mind that in New York, PIP coverage follows the vehicle and not the driver. In New York, the minimum limit for PIP is $50,000. You can only pursue a claim against an at-fault driver for further damages if you’ve suffered a serious injury as defined by the state’s Insurance Law. This is why it’s important to carry more than just the minimum coverage.
**Required Coverage** | **Minimum Limit**  
---|---  
Bodily Injury Liability | $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident  
Property Damage Liability | $10,000 per accident  
Personal Injury Protection | $10,000 per accident  
Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists | $25,00 per person / $50,000 per accident  
If you get into an [accident with another vehicle](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident), your medical benefits coverage will help pay your injuries and medical expenses. Your liability coverages will help protect you if you are responsible for injuries to others or damages to their vehicles.

Filing a claim can be stressful, but Plymouth Rock [makes it easy](https://www.plymouthrock.com/claims/auto-claims). We send you all the documents and forms you need. Our friendly specialists will guide you every step of the way and ensure you’re taken care of. 
## What does no fault insurance cover?
Personal Injury Protection helps pay for medical expenses, loss of income and other miscellaneous expenses regardless of fault after an accident. Your PIP can cover all occupants of your vehicle. It also covers any pedestrians injured by the operation of your vehicle within the state.
Keep in mind that mandatory PIP coverage does not cover your passengers in out-of-state claims unless they are also New York residents.
You can purchase Additional PIP with limits up to $150,000, which covers you, your household relatives and passengers in any car you or your household relatives drive in the US, US Territories and Canada.
PIP does not cover physical damage to your car, the other driver’s car or any other personal property. To protect your own vehicle, you’ll need [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-does-car-insurance-cover). Your property damage liability helps pay for damages to another person’s property.
