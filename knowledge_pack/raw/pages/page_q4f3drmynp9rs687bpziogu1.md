##  Car insurance costs for parents with teens 
**If you’re a parent, the cost of adding a teen driver to your car insurance varies by the child’s gender and age.**
A teen’s crash risks go down as they age and gain experience behind the wheel. At any age, though, male teens have higher crash risks than female teens. 
These are some of the reasons why adding a teenage girl to your car insurance costs 7% less than adding a teenage boy. Regardless of gender, 19-year-olds cost 22% less to insure than 16-year-olds. 
###  Insurance rates for parents and teens 
Age of teen | Male monthly rate | Female monthly rate  
---|---|---  
[16](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-for-16-year-olds/) | $477 | $444  
17 | $433 | $401  
18 | $392 | $362  
19 | $374 | $345  
Full coverage rates are for a 50-year-old parent and teenage child on one policy.

##  States with the costliest teen drivers 
It’s exciting to be a teenage driver. The experience isn’t always so positive for parents. 
Parents who add teen children to their car insurance policies usually see their premiums skyrocket. Parents who buy a separate policy for their teen pay even more. Even worse, traffic accidents are a leading cause of death for teenagers in the U.S. 
###  **Key findings**
  * **Montana is the deadliest state for teen drivers.** Of the 1,283 drivers involved in fatal crashes in Montana from 2019 to 2023, 112 (9.5%) of them were teens. Utah is next, with 8.4% of drivers involved in fatal crashes being teens. 
  * **Between May and October is the deadliest period for teen drivers.**
  * **Delaware is the most expensive state to insure a teen driver.** The average annual auto insurance rate for a teen driver in Delaware is $5,461, nearly $3,000 more than the national average of $2,673. The next most expensive state is Nevada, with an average annual rate of $5,218. 


###  Deadliest states for teen drivers 
Between 2019 and 2023, teen drivers accounted for just over 6% of all drivers involved in fatal crashes. Those crashes resulted in 17,887 teen driver fatalities across the U.S. 
Montana, Utah and Alaska had the highest percentages of teen drivers in fatal accidents, which suggests there are regional differences in teen driving safety. Washington, D.C., Hawaii and New Hampshire have the lowest percentage of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents.

###  Most expensive states for insuring a teen driver

##  Car insurance discounts for teen drivers 
**It’s important to take advantage of[car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/) for you and your teen.** Make sure to ask about these discounts from the companies you contact for a quote. 
###  Good student 
Teens can often get a good student discount by having a B average or better in school. You don’t need to provide school transcripts to get quotes. However, you will probably have to send a copy of them to the company you choose. 
###  Safe driving apps 
Most large car insurance companies offer a discount to drivers of any age who enroll in their safe driver program. 
These programs often use a smartphone app to monitor your driving. You usually get an initial discount just for signing up and downloading the app. And if you drive safely enough, you get another discount each time you renew your policy. 
Some aspects of these programs will vary by company. For example, Travelers raises your rates if its app detects bad driving. State Farm does not. 
###  Driver’s education and training 
Many insurance companies offer a discount to teens who complete an approved driver’s education or training program. The programs that qualify vary by insurance company. 
###  Away-at-school discounts 
Several companies offer discounts to parents with teens who are [away at college](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-college-students/) without a car. These programs save parents money while keeping the teen insured when they borrow cars at school or back at home. 
###  Dropping full coverage 
A teen with an older car can save money by removing [full coverage](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) from their vehicle. Your car’s resale value is the most your insurance company pays if your car is destroyed or stolen. If your car is worth less than a few thousand dollars, the potential benefits of full coverage are usually not worth the cost. 
##  Why car insurance is so expensive for teens 
**High crash rates are the main reason why car insurance is so expensive for teens.** Drivers ages 16 to 20 have higher crash rates than other age groups. This is blamed largely on their lack of driving experience. 
Teens usually get lower car insurance rates as they age, as long as they avoid tickets and accidents. 
##  When to get car insurance quotes for a teen driver 
**It’s good to start shopping for car insurance a few months before your teen gets their driver’s license.** Their coverage needs to take effect on the day they get their license. 
Let your current insurance company know when your teen gets his or her learner’s permit. Most insurance companies cover a teen with a permit at no extra cost when they drive under your supervision. However, you should check with your company for restrictions and ask for a quote, too. 
Each company uses a different system to set your rates. Your current company may not be as affordable with a teen as it was before your child started driving. Comparing car insurance quotes from multiple companies helps you find the best rate for your new situation. 
##  Reasons to add a teen to a parent’s car insurance 
**For a family, the advantages of adding a teenager to a parent’s car insurance go beyond price.** Here are a few other reasons to keep a teen on the same policy as their parents: 
  * You may not have a choice. Many insurance companies require you to keep every family member in your home on the same policy. 
  * A single policy for parents and teens covers each driver in any household vehicle. This reduces some of the worries a parent may have about letting their teen borrow their car. 
  * Teens under 18 are usually barred from legal contracts like car insurance. If a minor needs their own car insurance, they often need a parent or guardian to cosign their application. 


A teen can usually remain on a parent’s car insurance while they live at home or are away at school. A teen who moves out can usually only stay on a parent’s car insurance if the parent owns or co-owns their vehicle. Otherwise, they need their own car insurance. 
## Frequently asked questions
###  What is the youngest age to get car insurance?
Parents can add a newly licensed driver to their car insurance at age 16. You usually have to be at least 18 years old to get your own car insurance. You may get it at a younger age if a parent or guardian cosigns your application. 
###  Are teens with a learner’s permit covered by car insurance?
Yes, but usually only when the teen is driving a parent’s vehicle under parental supervision. 
###  Does a teen need separate insurance for their own car?
A teen who lives with a parent doesn’t need separate insurance for their own car. A teen who moves out on their own usually does need their own car insurance, unless a parent is on the vehicle’s title. The rules vary by state and insurance company.

LendingTree researchers analyzed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data on teen drivers. Researchers divided the number of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes from 2019 to 2023 by the total number of drivers from 2019 to 2023 to find the percentage of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes in every state and month. 
Rates for teens are based on quotes from every state and Washington, D.C., for 18-year-old males driving Honda Civic EXs with good credit and clean driving records. Rates shown are for minimum liability coverage.
