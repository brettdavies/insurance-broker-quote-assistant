# Does your insurance provide coverage for home repairs?
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Upkeep is a typical part of homeownership, but are there times that insurance could be used? 
Homeownership can be exciting, but many homeowners will likely experience the need for home repairs and maintenance at some point. Whether it’s from a [leaking roof](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/roof-maintenance-for-your-home), broken furnace or HVAC system issue, the cost for repairs can quickly add up. It’s important to know what your [homeowners insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-homeowners-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) might cover when the unexpected happens.
## When could insurance apply for home repairs?
Homeowners insurance isn't used for your typical household maintenance. Instead, it's there for unforeseen or accidental damages. Below are a few examples where homeowner's insurance could apply for covered losses:
  * **Fire or smoke** — if your kitchen sustains damage due to a fire.
  * **Hail damage** — if your roof or home sustains damage from a hailstorm.
  * **Windstorm** — if there's a storm and a tree limb or other debris causes damage to your home.
  * **Frozen pipes** — winter weather sometimes results in frozen pipes that can burst. This can cause water damage and the need for [plumbing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/preventative-plumbing-maintenance-for-your-home) repairs.


  
If you have doubts whether a repair could potentially be covered by your insurance, discuss with your insurance agent.
## What do home warranty plans typically cover?
Home warranty plans, sometimes referred to as home repair insurance, typically cover:
  * Appliances
  * Electrical systems
  * Plumbing
  * Air conditioning
  * Furnaces


## What is considered home maintenance?
Homeowners insurance typically does not provide coverage for damages due to lack of maintenance from wear and tear. For example, if you have a roof that has been deteriorating throughout the years and your roof starts to leak, the roof repair would most likely not be covered. This is why regular home repairs and maintenance of your residence is important.
Whether its painting, caulking or cleaning gutters, maintaining a home can be a lot of work. You can tackle some projects yourself, but others might require a professional. [Do your research](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-to-diy-home-renovations-and-when-to-go-pro) to help you make that decision. Remember to document any maintenance or repairs you’ve made. This could be beneficial if you find yourself navigating the claim process.
The following are examples of home maintenance:
  * Replacing [doorknobs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-pick-a-door-lock-and-be-sure-its-secure)
  * Repainting walls
  * Changing the carpet
  * Cleaning [gutters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/stepbystep-guide-to-gutter-cleaning)
  * Maintaining the [washing machine](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/steps-for-maintaining-your-washing-machine)
  * Cleaning the [dryer vent](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-care-for-your-clothes-dryer)
  * Caulking [windows](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-make-windows-more-energy-efficient)
  * Staining decks
  * Sweeping the [chimney](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/why-chimney-cleaning-is-important)
  * Maintaining the garage door
  * Cleaning the septic tank
  * Replacing a [sump pump](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/sump-pump-basics)
  * Cleaning furnace filters, air ducts and vents


  
As large [appliances and home systems](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/appliance-maintenance) get older or wear out, it's not unusual to replace them. These items may include:
  * Refrigerator
  * Dishwasher
  * Stove/cooktop/oven
  * Air conditioner
  * Furnace
  * Water heater


  
Worn out or obsolete appliances are typically not covered by insurance. However, you can contact your local [State Farm® agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) for information on Home Systems Protection which may offer insurance protection for certain perils typically not covered by a homeowners policy.
