#  State Farm Discount/ADT rate reduction? 
I have had ADT for 5 years (contract just ended) cameras are paid off and now I just pay the monthly monitor fee. Just found out state farm offers a discount for having home monitor system. However after looking at ADT and their monthly price for monitoring, I am considering switching to something cheaper or calling ADT and threatening to cancel if they don't reduce my monthly rate. Anyone had success in getting rate lowered? or is there another cheaper company that state farm will also accept and give me the discount for? 
UPDATE: I called ADT and threatened to cancel. Was told they could reduce it to $50 a month +taxes. They said state farm gives a discount of $500-$600 a year for having ADT but having state farm doesnt lower their price so still $50 a month. Still looking at simplisafe and they are running a 50% off everything and first month free. Current equipment is 5 years old. By switching id cut the monthly price currently from $73 to about $35 (I estimate $35 with tax) for the core monitoring plan. After doing some more research on SS, apparently their cameras are shit. Probably wont be going with their cameras. I am gonna get back in touch with ADT to see if they will throw in a camera or two possibly.

Go with a local company. As long as the system is monitored. State Farm will give you the discount. ADT will lower your rate if you threaten. Problem is when Service is needed and tech arrives for 160$ and wipes out what you thought you were saving monthly😁

I haven’t had any issues with it other than 1 camera I had to reset to factory and then reattach to the network. I’ll look into a local company possibly but I’d rather not buy a bunch of new equipment.

If you’ve had the system for 5 years then you probably have the control system. Easiest thing to do is just call 800-238-2727 as close to 7am EST and play the imma gonna cancel unless I get a lower rate game. I think cancel service is option 6. Other companies use the alarm.com platform but I understand it can be very difficult to transfer the devices to a new company. Essentially you can have the same alarm.com log in/account but all the devices would have to be new.  
Someone with better knowledge can shed better light on that part. 
State Farm discount is just customer facing meaning that it’s a discount on new installs for new customers. Has nothing to do with any rate reduction your insurance company would give you for having a monitored service. State Farm don’t care who you use as long as the service checks its boxes for acceptability.

My State Farm rep said there’s a discount even though I’m not new. If adt doesn’t give me better rate I’ll just cancel, wait till Black Friday or prime day and get 60% off implicate stuff. They only charge $32 a month instead of $75

I could have written this post myself! I have the same monthly fee (went up $10 over the course of 3 year contract) and it’s way too much. I have StateFarm too and saw the 19.99 package. StateFarm owns 15% of ADT. I didn’t know this when I called to cancel Monday at 830am EST and was on the phone for 40 minutes. They have an account service department who will try to retain you as a customer - they offered 45.99 monthly with a “free” smoke detector. Another promotional item was a free nest doorbell if I didn’t want a smoke detector. I already have these and she “got approved” a self install outdoor nest camera. I told her send me paperwork to see this offer etc and she added 16.50 a month for monitoring the camera or something - 45+16 is back up to 62 a month which is wild! I called back yesterday morning to decline their office especially because I saw the 19.99 package online. In order to get the StateFarm/adt package you have to spend 45 minutes with ANOTHER department specific to that partnership, not account services. My experience yesterday was “you qualify but there is a national downtime and I can’t process that package for you right now. Can I call you later today to discuss a final quote?” I told them I was free 12pm on and she agreed to call at 12pm. Never got a call. Probably just going to cancel when I call again today unless they agree to locked in 19.99 x 3 years on the spot. Also a few small additional things I learned - I called StateFarm to get info on homeowner insurance discount too- so you’re aware it’s 1-6%. My plan is 5% which saves me $75/YEAR. Also be aware of your ADT contract. Mine says it will auto renew if I don’t cancel at least 30 days prior.

So I called this morning. They did offer 19.99 x 6 months with rate increase to 54.99 for 2.5 years after. Not good enough for me. I asked to place my account on “do not renew” but they said they won’t and can’t do that. If I want to cancel for July 6 I have to call June 6th, otherwise there is a cancelation fee. So fees are associated with 29 days or 31 days. More than 30 days there is a cancelation fee of $135 plus paying out the rest of your contracted month fees. Canceling between 1-29 days before contract ends you pay a prorated daily fee because they require at least 30 day notice to cancel.
