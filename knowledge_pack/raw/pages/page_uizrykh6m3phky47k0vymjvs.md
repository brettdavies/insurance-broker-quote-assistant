Editor's Rating
Is Progressive insurance good?
**Progressive's range of features and discounts make it a good company to consider for auto and motorcycle insurance.**
On the other hand, Progressive's home and renters insurance coverage is lacking. Other companies tend to offer more coverage options and cheaper rates.
**Overall, Progressive's customer service could be better.** You'll likely experience a lot of back and forth before Progressive pays your claim.

### Progressive auto insurance coverage options
Progressive offers several coverage options you can add to your policy for an extra fee.
Rental car reimbursement
Progressive [rental reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") pays for a rental vehicle after a  covered accident. Progressive will typically pay between $40 and $60 per day for a rental car similar to yours. 
Roadside assistance
[Roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") from Progressive pays for towing, a locksmith, gas and fluid delivery, flat tire changes and other emergency services if you're stuck on the side of the road. 
Rideshare coverage
[Rideshare insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-ridesharing-affects-your-auto-insurance "Rideshare Insurance: Why You Need It and What It Costs") is an essential add-on if you drive for a rideshare or delivery company like Uber or Lyft. It covers any gaps between your auto insurance coverage and the protection offered by the rideshare company.
Progressive offers rideshare insurance in  39 states and Washington, D.C. 
Gap insurance
Progressive [gap insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works "Gap Insurance: How Does It Work and Do I Need It?") pays the difference between your balance on a loan or a lease and your car's value if it's totaled in an accident.
Progressive calls this coverage loan/lease payoff, and it's important if you have a new car. Your collision coverage will typically only cover the cost of your car up to its actual cash value. That means it factors in depreciation, wear and tear, which usually affects new cars the most.
**Without gap insurance, your insurance payout for a new car will likely be less than what you owe on a loan or lease.**
Progressive limits its gap insurance coverage to 25% over your vehicle's actual cash value. [Not all companies have this limit](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gap-auto-insurance-works#companies "Where can you buy gap insurance?"). 
Custom parts and equipment coverage
Custom parts and equipment coverage from Progressive are a good idea if [your car has after-market parts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/special-auto-insurance-coverage-for-car-modifications "Do I Need Special Auto Insurance to Modify My Car?"). This can include stereos, navigation systems, wheels, grilles and other custom parts you've added to your car.
Progressive custom parts coverage typically has a $5,000 limit. 
Deductible savings bank
Progressive deductible savings bank lowers your deductible by $50 for every six months you don't make a claim. Other car insurance companies call this a [vanishing or diminishing deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/vanishing-deductibles-what-it-and-should-you-get-it "Vanishing Deductibles: What Is It and Should You Get It?"). 
Mexico insurance
Progressive [Mexico insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/mexican-car-insurance "What Is Mexican Car Insurance, and Why Do You Need It?") protects people driving across the border. You'll need special insurance to drive legally in Mexico. This is the case whether you go there regularly for business or take a short vacation. 
Progressive also offers all the standard auto insurance coverages you need to drive legally in your state. You can choose [full coverage insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?") with comprehensive and collision to protect your car against damage.
Progressive customers now have access to a free accident response feature through the company's app. If you get in a crash, Progressive will automatically contact you to offer help. You can request emergency services or a tow through the app or by speaking to an agent, and Progressive will automatically file a claim on your behalf.
This service isn't available in California.
#### Does Progressive have accident forgiveness?
Progressive has a unique [accident forgiveness program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/accident-forgiveness-what-it-and-who-offers-it "How Does Accident Forgiveness Work?"). It breaks accidents into two categories:
  1. Progressive includes **small accident forgiveness** for most new customers. Progressive considers an accident small if the claim is less than $500. 
  2. Progressive includes **large accident forgiveness** for customers who have had insurance with the company for more than five years. It only applies to drivers without a claim in five years or more. Large accident forgiveness will keep your rates the same even if the claim is more than $500. 


Some drivers can also buy accident forgiveness from Progressive when they get a policy.
**Progressive's accident forgiveness program can be very helpful if you cause a crash.** Without accident forgiveness, full coverage rates from Progressive go up by 49% after an at-fault accident. That's an average increase of $83 per month.
### Progressive auto insurance discounts
Progressive offers lots of discounts to drivers. Many of Progressive's discounts are easy to get, like a discount for getting a quote or buying your policy online.
Online quote discount
Save around 7% when you get a quote online and then buy on the phone.

Paperless discount

  * **Teen driver discount:** Add a child under 18-year-old to your policy. 
  * **Good student discount:** Save around 10% if you have a student on your policy with a "B" average or better. 
  * **Distant student discount:** Get a discount if you have a child on your policy who is away at college and doesn't have a car at school. 


**Progressive Snapshot discount**
[Progressive Snapshot](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review "Progressive Snapshot") is a program that helps good drivers save money by tracking their driving habits using a device or mobile app and rewarding safe driving behavior.
If you sign up when you buy a new Progressive policy, you'll get a discount of around $25. Drivers who show safe habits over six months will get a discount. Progressive says drivers save an average of $146 per year with Snapshot.
**However, your rate can also go up if you have unsafe habits, like hard braking or driving late at night.** Progressive says that two out of every ten drivers end up with a higher rate rather than a discount.
Toyota and Progressive data sharing lawsuit
![penalties icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/law-penalties2)
**Toyota owners recently filed a lawsuit accusing the manufacturer of sharing their driving data with Progressive without permission.**
This data was used by the Progressive Snapshot program, and includes location data and info about their driving habits, like speeding or hard braking.
Built-in technology can be useful if you're planning to use the Snapshot program. But make sure you're comfortable with [the data Progressive is gathering about you](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review#track "What does Snapshot track?") before signing up. 
### Progressive car and motorcycle insurance reviews and ratings
Progressive auto insurance has mixed customer service reviews.
The company gets 22% fewer customer complaints than similar companies, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). **Most complaints are about Progressive insurance claims taking longer than customers expect.**
In addition, J.D. Power ranked Progressive 19th out of 25 top insurance companies on its claims satisfaction survey. That indicates Progressive customers aren't typically happy with Progressive's customer service after an accident.
On a positive note, Progressive has an A+ financial strength rating from AM Best. That means Progressive should be able to pay out customer claims, even in tough economic times.
## Progressive home insurance reviews
Progressive's home insurance rates are average, and most major insurance companies offer better service.
In addition, Progressive only offers a few ways to increase the protection for your home and belongings.

*USAA is only available to military members, veterans and their families.
**Progressive's online quote tool makes it difficult to compare its rates for specific coverage levels.** That's because it doesn't allow you to customize your policy limits.
Before Progressive gives you a quote, it asks if you'd prefer to spend less or get more coverage. This is the only way to customize your quote.
**You have to speak to an agent to make any changes to the quote.** That includes changing your liability and medical payments coverage limits or deductible.
### Progressive home insurance coverage
Progressive doesn't offer many ways to customize your coverage.
It only offers a few coverage add-ons: water backup protection and personal injury liability.
  * **Water backup protection** helps pay for damage caused by backed-up pipes or sewers or a broken sump pump. 
  * **Personal injury liability** covers lawsuits involving slander or libel, wrongful eviction and false arrest. 


Progressive doesn't offer other typical coverage options like identity theft protection or extra coverage for valuable items.
But, its homeowners insurance provides standard protection for your home's structure and your personal property.
Progressive has partnered with [Loggerhead](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loggerhead-insurance-review "Loggerhead Insurance Review: Replacement for Florida Progressive Customers") to offer coverage to Florida residents who've recently lost their home insurance.
### Progressive home insurance discounts
Progressive's homeowners insurance discounts will be different depending on your location and which partners operate in your area. Along with [bundling auto and home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"), you may be able to save money by:
  * Installing alarms in your home 
  * Buying a home 
  * Buying a newly constructed home 
  * Paying your annual bill upfront 
  * Getting a quote 10 days before your new policy starts 
  * Getting your policy documents by email 


### Progressive home and renters insurance reviews and ratings
Progressive home insurance customers may have a difficult time making claims with the company.
It gets 21% more customer complaints than an average company its size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). **Many customers complain that the claims process needs to be shorter.** Progressive customers also mentioned low settlement offers. That means you could pay more to fix your home or replace your things after an emergency.
In addition, J.D. Power ranked Progressive 19th out of 22 of the largest home insurance companies on its customer satisfaction survey. And it earned last place on the J.D. Power renters insurance customer satisfaction survey. **That means Progressive customers aren't thrilled with the service they get from the company overall.**
