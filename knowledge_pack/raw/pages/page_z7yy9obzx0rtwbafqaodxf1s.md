  * Umbrella insurance is additional coverage to your home or auto insurance policy.
  * Umbrella insurance offers extra liability coverage if your insurance is not enough to cover costs.
  * Umbrella insurance won't cover you, just at-fault property damages and bodily injuries of other parties.


Liability coverage in your homeowners and auto insurance will protect you from a lawsuit if you're found responsible for property damages or bodily injuries. However, for some people, liability limits in a standard policy aren't enough. Umbrella insurance offers extra liability coverage in addition to your standard policy
## What is Umbrella Insurance?
Umbrella insurance is extra liability insurance that protects you from losses beyond your standard liability insurance. Liability insurance covers the policyholder if someone is injured on their property and sues for damage.
Umbrella insurance is standard for those with increased concerns that another party will sue them and jeopardize their [net worth](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/what-is-net-worth). "In our litigious society, when a lawsuit settlement could very well wipe out your financial assets, you may want the extra protection for your assets that a personal umbrella liability policy provides," says Loretta Worters, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute (III).
### How Umbrella Insurance Works
Umbrella insurance can be added to your homeowners and auto insurance policy. Umbrella insurance is meant to protect you from financial losses if you are served with a lawsuit from another party. Think of an umbrella policy as backup insurance for your other insurance products like your homeowners, auto, and renters coverage.
Providers will typically offer a minimum of $100,000 for liability coverage, but experts at the III recommend that homeowners purchase between $300,000 and $500,000 of liability coverage. For some homeowners, $500,000 isn't enough coverage. In that case, consider purchasing an umbrella policy.
According to Allstate, personal umbrella policies are usually available in million-dollar increments, from $1 million to $5 million. According to the III, most insurers will require you to have at least $300,000 worth of liability coverage on their homeowners insurance policy and $250,000 on your auto insurance policy before they will sell you an umbrella policy.
### What an Umbrella Insurance Policy Covers
Unlike a standard liability policy, which only covers injuries and damages, an umbrella policy also covers legal cases and damage related to libel, vandalism, slander, invasion of privacy, and other hazards.
Here's what umbrella insurance covers:
  * Bodily injury: Will help you pay for someone else's medical bills if you're at fault
  * Personal injury: Will protect you from lawsuits related to libel and slander,
  * Property damage: Will protect you if you're at fault for a car accident
  * Landlord liability: Will protect you if you're a landlord and someone is injured on your property


### What’s Not Covered by Umbrella Insurance
What umbrella insurance doesn't cover:
  * Your property: If your property is damaged by someone else
  * Your medical expenses: If you are hurt or injured on your property
  * Business losses: Liability losses will not be covered if you operate from home.
  * Intentional crime or actions: This policy won't financially protect you from illicit behavior.
  * Lawsuits from breach of contract: If you're facing a lawsuit for a contract breach, umbrella insurance will most likely not cover you.


According to Emily Grant, vice president of Travelers Insurance, umbrella insurance covers you, your dependents, and relatives who reside with you. If you are a landlord, umbrella insurance will cover you against a lawsuit from your tenants.
## Do I Need Umbrella Insurance?
### Who Should Consider an Umbrella Policy?
You can be liable for almost anything, so you want to ensure your assets are protected in the worst-case scenario.
"Most everyone could benefit from umbrella insurance. Think of umbrella insurance as peace of mind insurance if you are found liable for damages that exceed the liability limits of your car, home, boat, or other personal insurance policies," says Grant.
Here are just a few of the people that may consider umbrella insurance.
  * Landlords: If you have rental units, umbrella insurance is an excellent investment to protect yourself from lawsuits from your tenants, mainly if injuries occur in a common area like the lobby or gym.
  * Pet owners: Your homeowners or renters insurance will usually cover pet bites under your policy's liability coverage. However, some insurance companies will not offer pet liability coverage for certain dog breeds and exotic pets; therefore, umbrella insurance may come in handy.
  * Homeowners with "attractive nuisances": Pools or trampolines— also known as "attractive nuisances," can be appealing additions to your home. However, the likelihood of someone getting injured on your property may increase with these features. Some homeowner insurance may exclude "attractive nuisances" in their policy.
  * Household with teenage drivers: Driving on their own can be an exciting milestone for a teen. However, parents of teen drivers may be concerned about dangers on the road, mainly because younger drivers have less experience behind the wheel than adult drivers, increasing the likelihood of an accident.


### How Umbrella Insurance Protects Against Lawsuits
Umbrella insurance is an excellent investment for those at increased risk of at-fault accidents on the road or on your property. Paying thousands or even millions of dollars in medical, property replacement, or legal fees can leave a dent in many people's finances, which can be challenging to recover from. So, you should speak to your insurance representative to see if umbrella insurance is right for you.
"When it comes to talking about umbrella insurance, we like to say that 'you don't have to be a millionaire to be sued like one," says Grant. "An umbrella policy can also help with defense costs if you are sued for these events.”
## How Much Umbrella Insurance Do I Need?
### Determining the Right Coverage Amount
Generally, you can determine the amount of umbrella insurance you need by calculating your total net worth. You want to have enough coverage to at least cover your assets. Common assets that should be included are:
  * Savings accounts
  * Checking accounts
  * Home equity
  * Stocks or mutual funds
  * Jewelry
  * Art
  * Collectibles
  * Clothing
  * Furniture


Also, don’t forget to take into account the liability coverage you already have from your existing policies.
### Minimum Liability Requirements for Umbrella Policies
Before an insurer will let you purchase an umbrella policy, you’ll need to have a certain amount of liability coverage from your existing policies. For instance, many insurance companies will require you to have at least $250,000 in auto insurance liability coverage and at least $300,000 in home insurance liability coverage before you can buy umbrella insurance.
### How Net Worth & Assets Affect Coverage Needs
The more your net worth and the more valuable your assets are, the more coverage you’ll need. This is where an umbrella insurance policy comes in.
An umbrella insurance policy will offer you liability coverage beyond what your standard home or auto insurance policy can offer. This protects your assets and safeguards your net worth if you’re found liable for injuries to someone else or damage to someone else’s property.
## How Much Does Umbrella Insurance Cost?
### Average Cost of Umbrella Insurance Policies
Umbrella insurance is relatively inexpensive. Your first $1 million of umbrella insurance coverage will cost around $150 to $300 per year. After that, insurance will cost about $100 to $150 per million dollars of coverage.
Trusted Choice estimates the average cost for $1 million to $2 million of coverage to be $380 per year. The exact amount varies based on the number of homes, cars, and boats you insure, according to Worters.
An umbrella policy is an additional coverage and not a standalone policy. You must purchase homeowners insurance and auto insurance before you get umbrella insurance.
### Factors That Affect Umbrella Insurance Rates
The biggest factor that determines how much you'll pay for umbrella insurance is the amount of coverage you need. Other factors that may impact the rates you pay include:
  * Location
  * [Credit history](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/what-is-credit-report)
  * Claims history
  * Number of homes
  * Number of vehicles
  * Your driving record


### How to Lower the Cost of an Umbrella Insurance Policy
Here are a few ways to reduce the cost of an umbrella insurance policy:
  * Keep a clean driving record: This shows the insurer that there’s less of a risk that you’ll file a claim.
  * Increase coverage on your existing policies: More coverage on your existing policies means you can afford to lower the coverage you need from an umbrella policy, which can lead to a lower premium.
  * Maintain a good credit score: This lets the insurer know that you consistently pay bills on time.
  * Bundle your umbrella policy: Bundling your policy with other insurance, such as home or auto insurance, can save you money. Many insurance providers give out multi-policy discounts when you [bundle insurance](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-insurance-bundling).


## How to Get an Umbrella Insurance Policy
### Top Insurance Providers for Umbrella Coverage
Here are the best umbrella insurance providers and the coverage limits for each company.
Insurance company | Coverage limits  
---|---  
**Amica Insurance** | $1 million to $5 million  
**USAA Insurance** | $1 million to $5 million  
**State Farm Insurance** | $1 million to $10 million

**Auto-Owners car insurance** | $1 million to $5 million  
**Progressive Auto Insurance** | $1 million to $5 million  
**Chubb** | $1 million to $100 million  
### How to Compare Umbrella Insurance Quotes
Most major insurance companies that provide home or auto insurance also offer umbrella insurance. You can request quotes on your own by visiting an insurance company’s website or visiting an online insurance marketplace, such as Policygenius.
Another option is to work with an [insurance broker](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-insurance-broker). An insurance broker will request quotes from multiple companies for you. It’s smart to request quotes from at least three different insurers. Make sure you request the same amount of coverage and share the same details with each insurer to conduct an even comparison.
### How to Bundle Umbrella Insurance with Home & Auto Policies
Most insurers that allow you to bundle insurance will give you a multi-policy discount for doing so. To bundle your umbrella insurance with your home and auto policies, contact your current insurance provider. Ask your insurer about what insurance bundling options are available and potential discounts for bundling.
It’s also a good idea to shop around and compare quotes from other insurers for bundled insurance. You can do so by contacting insurance companies on your own, using an online comparison tool such as Zebra or Insurify, or by reaching out to an insurance broker.
## Pros and Cons of Umbrella Insurance
### Benefits of Having Extra Liability Coverage
Here are the main advantages of having umbrella insurance:
  * Added layer of protection. Umbrella policies provide you with additional coverage beyond what your existing home or auto insurance policies will cover.
  * Affordable. Umbrella policies will cost you an average of $380 for $1 million of coverage annually.
  * Coverage for major claims. Umbrella insurance covers lawsuits, legal fees, medical bills, property damage, and more.


### When Umbrella Insurance May Not Be Necessary
An umbrella insurance policy might not be necessary for you if your assets do not exceed the liability coverage amounts of your underlying home or auto insurance policies. Additionally, you are not legally required to purchase umbrella insurance.
### How to Decide If an Umbrella Policy is Worth It
While an umbrella policy can protect you from losing $1 million or more and other assets, an umbrella policy might not make sense for everyone. If the liability coverage in your existing policies is enough to cover your assets, then an umbrella policy might not be worth it.
However, if you have many valuable assets and are at a higher risk of being sued, then umbrella insurance is likely a good idea. Umbrella policies are generally inexpensive, and the peace of mind knowing your assets are protected in case someone files a liability claim against you is worth it.
