If you’re a driver in the Lone Star State, it’s important to understand the nuances of [**Texas car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/) laws. Read on to learn about the state’s mandatory bodily injury and property damage liability coverage so you can hit the road with confidence.
## Texas car insurance requirements
To drive legally in Texas, you must carry these minimum coverage amounts:[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/minimum-requirements/#cite-1)
**Coverage** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Minimum Requirements** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---  
Bodily injury liability | $30,000 per person / $60,000 per accident  
Property damage liability | $25,000  
Texas also requires insurance companies to offer [**uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/uninsured-motorist-coverage-texas/) and $2,500 in [**personal injury protection (PIP)**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/personal-injury-protection-texas/) to policyholders who purchase liability insurance. But you can opt out of both coverages by notifying your car insurance company in writing that you don’t want UIM or PIP.
UM/UIM pays medical and car repair bills if you’re in an accident with an underinsured or uninsured motorist. PIP covers medical expenses and lost wages for you and your passengers. You can opt out of both coverages with your insurer, but PIP and UIM protect you in different ways than the required liability coverage.
### Bodily injury liability
Your insurance policy’s [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) pays for medical bills, loss of income due to injury, emotional and physical pain and suffering, and funeral expenses after an accident. If you’re responsible for a car accident, this type of coverage pays for injury-related costs for the driver and passengers in the other vehicle.
Texas requires $30,000 in bodily injury coverage for each injured person. Passengers often sustain injuries in accidents, so Texas drivers need to carry $60,000 in bodily injury insurance per accident to cover more than two parties. In the state’s 30/60/25 insurance requirements, bodily injury coverage makes up the “30/60” part.
### Property damage liability
Property damage liability accounts for the “25” in the 30/60/25 Texas insurance requirements. Texas drivers must carry $25,000 in property damage coverage. If you, or another driver operating your car, are at fault for an accident, property damage liability helps pay for the other driver’s car repairs or replacement.
Damage you cause to other property, like a fence, utility pole, or guardrail, also falls under property damage liability. It’s important to note this coverage type doesn’t apply to damage to your vehicle, which [**collision and comprehensive insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) typically covers.

## Texas Automobile Insurance Plan Association
[**High-risk drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/high-risk/), meaning people with severe violations such as DWIs and reckless driving, coverage lapses, and multiple at-fault [**accidents**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), often have difficulty securing coverage because insurance companies view them as too risky to insure. The Texas Automobile Insurance Plan Association (TAIPA) is a state-run system that provides insurance for drivers who can’t find coverage through standard insurers.
TAIPA assigns high-risk drivers to insurance companies participating in the association, but its premiums are typically more expensive than standard policies. TAIPA also provides only the state minimum 30/60/25 liability coverage. Drivers are eligible if two traditional insurance companies have rejected them within 60 days.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/minimum-requirements/#cite-2)
## Do you need more than state-minimum coverage in Texas?
The 30/60/25 liability coverage required by Texas law pays for medical bills, injury-related expenses, and repair costs incurred by the other driver and their passengers if you’re at fault for an accident. But the minimum coverage might not be enough to cover the other driver’s costs, and it doesn’t cover your vehicle at all, which could leave you at risk of a substantial financial loss.
Texas is an [**at-fault state**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/is-texas-a-no-fault-state/), meaning if an injured party’s damages exceed your liability limits, they may be able to sue you for the difference.
If you have the minimum required liability insurance in Texas, a serious car accident could easily exceed your coverage and become an immense financial burden. Increasing your liability limits can help prevent this.
A [**full-coverage car insurance policy**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/full-coverage/) also increases your financial protection. Full-coverage policies generally include collision and comprehensive coverages, which pay for repair and replacement costs for your vehicle.
If your monthly budget is tight or you’re an infrequent driver, liability-only coverage could best suit your needs. But insurance professionals generally recommend coverage that goes beyond the minimum. If you can’t manage an unplanned expense, have a new car, live in an area with frequent severe weather, or drive in dense traffic, a full-coverage policy is a good idea, and most insurance professionals recommend carrying full coverage.
## Penalties for driving without proof of insurance in Texas
Driving a motor vehicle without the mandatory 30/60/25 liability coverage is illegal in Texas and comes with strict penalties. If you drive without proof of insurance, you could face:
  * A misdemeanor charge, which stays on your record unless you successfully petition for expungement
  * A fine of $175 to $300 for your first offense and $350 to $1,000 for a second offense
  * Vehicle impoundment
  * License suspension for up to two years after a second offense


The consequences are even more severe if you cause an injury or accident without proof of insurance. In that situation, you could be fined up to $500 and sentenced to a maximum of six months in jail.
## Cheapest liability-only car insurance in Texas
The average monthly cost of [**liability-only insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) in Texas is $120. This is only slightly more expensive than the national average of $106. Liability-only insurance meets the state’s minimum bodily injury and property damage coverage requirements. 
Many car insurance companies offer monthly rates less than $120, especially if you have a clean driving record, so comparison shopping could help you find a cheaper quote.

## Optional car insurance coverages to consider
The minimum requirements for Texas car insurance focus on your financial responsibility to the other drivers if you’re at fault in a traffic accident. But sticking to the minimum coverage could leave you with significant out-of-pocket expenses. If you want to increase your financial protection, consider adding the following coverages:[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/texas/minimum-requirements/#cite-3)

## Texas car insurance requirements FAQs
If you’re shopping for car insurance in Texas, the answers below can help you make sense of coverage requirements and avoid hefty fines or license suspension.
  * ### Is car insurance required in Texas?
Texas requires drivers to carry 30/60/25 coverage. This means all drivers must have at least $30,000 in bodily injury coverage per person, $60,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident, and $25,000 in property damage coverage. Texas drivers can purchase additional coverages if they want more than the minimum level of financial protection.
  * ### Do you need car insurance to register a car in Texas?
You need [**proof of auto liability insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/proof-of-insurance/) to register a vehicle and get license plates in Texas. In addition to your insurance card, you’ll need proof that you own the vehicle and your vehicle inspection report. Texas law requires annual vehicle inspections from an approved auto shop. In 2025, new legislation will take effect and an annual $7.50 fee will replace inspections.
  * ### Which company has the cheapest rates in Texas?
State Farm has the cheapest liability-only rates in Texas, averaging $59 per month.
  * ### Does insurance follow the car or the driver in Texas?
When you lend your car to a friend or babysitter in Texas, you’re also lending them your insurance coverage. The required liability insurance covers costs associated with injuries, death, and property damage after an accident. If you let someone borrow your car and that person causes an accident, you would file a claim through your insurance.
  * ### Does Texas require collision insurance?
Texas doesn’t require collision insurance, but it could be smart to add this optional coverage if you’re a frequent driver or want to avoid unexpected repair costs down the road. The $25,000 of property damage liability coverage required by state law covers repairs for the other driver’s car or damaged property. Collision coverage pays to repair or replace your vehicle after an accident.
  * ### How long do you have to insure a car in Texas?
If you get a new car in Texas, your current insurance will typically cover it for about 20 days. But the length of coverage depends on your insurance policy, so you should always check with your insurer to avoid a lapse in coverage.
Texas also has a grace period of 31 days if a policyholder fails to pay after the first premium. During that time, coverage continues until the policyholder gives the insurer written notice to discontinue the policy before the grace period ends. The grace period ensures Texas drivers who experience financial hardships have time to get back on their feet before losing coverage.
  * ### Do you have to add your teenager to your car insurance in Texas?
Most likely. Texas requires licensed teen drivers to have auto insurance to drive legally. While you can put your teen on their own policy, it’s usually cheaper to add your teen driver to your existing policy.


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible


Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.
