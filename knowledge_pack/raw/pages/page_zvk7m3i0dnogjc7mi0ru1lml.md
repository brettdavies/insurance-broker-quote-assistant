#  How can you tell the difference between a structural brick building and a brick veneer? 
[ Brick  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/masonry/?f=flair_name%3A%22Brick%22)
I live in a town with a lot of brick buildings that were built between 1890 and 1910. Are those buildings all structural brick primarily? These buildings now tend to have drywall would there be a 2x4 frame inside to support the drywall or lathe and plaster? 
These buildings appear to have very wide exterior walls are there multiple layers of brick? 
Apologies if my terminology is not correct.

look at the courses. If there are alternating sizes of bricks, either every other brick or every few courses being square vs rectangular, then it is more than likely structural. If all the bricks are the same rectangular width, then the wall is only one brick thick, and more than likely a veneer. These are called different types of brick bonding, if you want to google it for an image.

yes and also brick used for veneer tend to be harder brick. the change was slow, and happened over time, but the idea of what a wall was supposed to do changed over time, and a brick veneer is supposed to be harder and less permeable. brick now are fired so hard they are closer to a glass than a soft-fired clay. look at new malls and chain restaurants built from brick and it tends to be harder with a shinier finish. the joints also tend to be larger, closer to a 3/8” joint rather than under 1/4”. mortar also tends to be different, sand was frequently an irregular sifted pit sand and not a round washed sand.

Veneers didn’t become popular till like 50’s-60’s. 1900’s absolutely structural bricks.

Structural will have headers to bond the wythes together. 
Proper structural will also have short runs of straight walls, as a straight wall is inherently weak. Lots of engaged corners, right-angles, engaged piers, maybe 3,4 or 5 wythe on the ground. Arches instead of lintels is a good indicator of structural. Voussoirs in the arches instead of big V's of mortar is a sign of quality structural masonry work.

One other thing to point out....I worked for many years in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where there are lots of old brick buildings. When we would build an addition on one,we would often make a veneer look like old work by using half bricks every 5th course, which looks like a header course. Or you can give the appearance of Flemish bond using a half brick every other brick in each course. 
We would just hit the bricks once in the middle of it's wide side to break it in half, then lay them with the end facing out, the broken end facing in and not seen.

My house is structural brick with a decorative brick facade on the front. So look at the sides and back for structural bonds not just the front.

Any building built before 1950 is almost certainly brick or brick and concrete block.

Larger, taller buildings from the 19th and early 20th century may have an iron frame _and_ have structural walls. There was a building partially collapsed around 2021-22, in Iowa or nearby state, where a building engineer had apparently _assumed_ that a building with an iron inner frame did not have structural walls. While part of the external ground floor wall was being replaced, without adequate shoring, the side of the building collapsed! 
I'm not even an engineer but it was obvious, even to me, that the exterior walls were structural.

Solid brick versus brick veneer comparison 
**Solid brick and brick veneer** are both popular choices for home exteriors, each with distinct characteristics, costs, and benefits. Redditors share insights on how to differentiate them, their durability, and aesthetic appeal. 
### What is Solid Brick?
Solid brick, also known as double brick, is a traditional construction method where the load-bearing structure of the house is made entirely of bricks. This means there are multiple layers of bricks forming the exterior walls, providing significant structural integrity. 
  * **Historical Context** : ["Veneers didn’t become popular till like 50’s-60’s. 1900’s absolutely structural bricks."](https://www.reddit.com/r/masonry/comments/1h2brx7/comment/lziclip/)
  * **Structural Integrity** : ["Solid masonry. These are two or more bricks deep and are solid masonry."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/1bm1juv/comment/kwaw51u/)
  * **Durability** : ["If your internal walls are plastered brick, then you have a double brick house."](https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/150a45s/comment/js24kas/)


### What is Brick Veneer?
Brick veneer is a single layer of bricks applied to the exterior of a house, typically over a timber or steel frame. This layer is primarily for aesthetic and weather resistance purposes, not for structural support. 
  * **Construction Method** : ["Brick veneer means single layer of full bricks on outside, timber frame and plasterboard in the inside."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/mid3nyq/)
  * **Aesthetic and Weather Resistance** : ["The bricks are essentially there for aesthetics and weather resistance."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/midhmnt/)
  * **Cost and Popularity** : ["Most brick houses built after the 1950s are brick veneer. It is really cheap construction."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/mif5v04/)


### How to Tell the Difference
It can be challenging to differentiate between solid brick and brick veneer from the exterior alone, but there are a few methods: 
  * **Courses and Bonding** : ["Look at the courses. If there are alternating sizes of bricks, either every other brick or every few courses being square vs rectangular, then it is more than likely structural."](https://www.reddit.com/r/masonry/comments/1h2brx7/comment/lzi4cq1/)
  * **Knock Test** : "Simply knock on the internal wall. If it sounds hollow, it's likely brick veneer. If it sounds solid, it's double brick." 
  * **Wall Thickness** : ["A brick veneer wall is around 270mm thick. A double brick wall is around 240mm thick (assuming 10mm of plaster)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/midhmnt/)


### Pros and Cons
####  Solid Brick 
  * **Pros** : 
    * **Durability** : ["If the installation is done right, brick siding should last 75-100 years without problems."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1kpjvek/comment/msyat12/)
    * **Thermal Insulation** : ["Brick is like wood, it takes moisture when it is humid and releases when it is dry."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/1bm1juv/comment/kwbgjt9/)
    * **Timeless Appeal** : ["Brick is timeless and tested."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1kpjvek/brick_siding_veneer_is_it_really_that_great/)
  * **Cons** : 
    * **Cost** : ["It's going to be significantly more expensive to build full walls out of anything that isn't locally mined."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/n6s0rn/comment/gxdf9if/)
    * **Weight** : ["Brick is heavy, it needs to start at ground level on solid foundations."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/n6s0rn/comment/gxdf9if/)


####  Brick Veneer 
  * **Pros** : 
    * **Cost-Effective** : ["Most brick houses built after the 1950s are brick veneer. It is really cheap construction."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/mif5v04/)
    * **Aesthetic Flexibility** : ["You can use fake materials to create really nice effect on regular size homes though."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/1bm1juv/comment/kw8zyq9/)
    * **Lighter** : ["A single layer of bricks attached to a timber or steel frame."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1jdszf0/comment/midhmnt/)
  * **Cons** : 
    * **Durability Concerns** : ["I keep finding rotted exterior walls during renovations where the home's exterior is brick (veneer)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1kpjvek/brick_siding_veneer_is_it_really_that_great/)
    * **Installation Risks** : ["A bad install can put you back in time."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1kpjvek/comment/msyc6tw/)
    * **Maintenance** : ["The brick ties corrode in harsh weather."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1kpjvek/comment/msycknm/)


### Faux Brick Veneer
Faux brick veneer, also known as fake brick or thin brick veneer, is a lightweight cladding that mimics the look of real bricks. It is often made from thin slices of actual bricks, clay, or other materials like cast concrete, plastics, or foam. 
  * **Types** : ["Thin brick is a brick that is only about half an inch thick and is glued into the wall."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/1bm1juv/comment/kwaw51u/)
  * **Aesthetic Appeal** : ["That looks lovely and agree they do look great. I've installed them before."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDecorating/comments/tiqocj/comment/i1fwhtq/)
  * **Cost and Installation** : ["Engineered products offer a good look, usually for a fraction of the price."](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMansionHell/comments/1bm1juv/comment/kw9w0ws/)
