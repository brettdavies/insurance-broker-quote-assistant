There are a lot of other factors to consider before they decide your discount for one thing

State Farm has already applied the discount. It’s a line item on my policy. But there is no dollar ampunt next to it. Simply says I received a discount.

They hide a lot of information. Your state farm agent makes a boat load of money off of you, don't hesitate to ask ANY questions you have to their office staff

It’s BS and I dropped a car on my plan (3 cars and house) and my premium went way up. They told me with 0 claims in 30 years that I was paying for California. What? Dropping them.

*AMERICAN MOTORS CORPORATION*— A place for any owners (hobbyists and collectors alike) as well as anybody with general interest (long time fans or just curious onlookers) to come and discuss, share, and inquire freely about anything related to the strong line of American Motors vehicles. The world of AMCs is often seen as a rather niche topic, so in effect we’re a very small and friendly community, and we leave this sub open for users to use as they see fit. -*"AMC.

This sub was created after I had 5 RTCs in 2 years. persons involved were quick to blame me, most were driving dangerously or without due care, unfortunately for them I had a dashcam. I also believe that the government has been lacking in enforcement and the behaviour of drivers reflects this, it’s practically lawless out on our roads. Warning heavy moderation due to the subject.

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.
