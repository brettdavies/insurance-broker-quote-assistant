## Key Takeaways
  * Renters insurance [helps protect your rental property ](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-does-renters-insurance-work#how-it-works)from perils such as fire, smoke, lightning, vandalism, and more.
  * Your rental insurer will pay your claim in the event of a covered loss, minus the deductible. Note that you must [choose between](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-does-renters-insurance-work#need) actual cash value coverage and replacement cost coverage.
  * Your landlord should cover the structure of your home and water damage.


## What Is Renters Insurance?
Renters insurance protects you and your belongings in your rented property. Coverages can vary per policy, so it's important to review your policy details.
A [renters insurance policy](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance) covers your personal property, such as clothes, furniture, and electronics. However, it doesn't cover the rental unit's property, like built-in appliances. It also covers liability, medical payments, and loss of use.
## How Does Renters Insurance Work?
Your[ landlord](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-landlord-insurance) doesn't cover your belongings when disaster strikes. That's why it's essential to purchase renters insurance, whether you’re renting an apartment, condo, townhouse, other attached dwelling, or a single-family home.
Renters insurance protects your rental property from covered perils, which can include:  

  * Fire
  * Smoke
  * Lightning
  * Vandalism
  * Break-ins
  * Explosions
  * Windstorms
  * Some types of water damage, such as broken pipes


Keep in mind that renters insurance doesn't typically include earthquake and flood damage, but you can purchase both as additional coverage.
### **Buying coverage**
Insurance professionals recommend getting at least three quotes from different providers to find the best rate. Insurers offer some common discounts, but you can[ bundle your renters insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-bundle-renters-and-auto-insurance) with a car or life insurance policy to save on your premium.
Before purchasing a policy, review its details to ensure you're properly covered. After you've purchased a policy, keep your policy active by paying your premiums on time.
### **Filing a claim**
If a covered incident occurs, document as much as possible, including pictures and videos of the damage, police reports, and receipts. You also need to[ file a claim](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-file-a-renters-insurance-claim) with your insurer immediately. You'll be reimbursed if your insurance company approves your claim.
### **Paying the deductible**
Your deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance policy pays for covered claims. That said, after you file a claim and it's approved, your insurer will reimburse you, minus your deductible.
For example, if your insurer approves a $5,000 claim, and your deductible is $500, then you'll be reimbursed for $4,500.
## What Does Renters Insurance Cover?
Renters insurance policies can vary, but typically cover the following:  

Personal possessions
This coverage protects your personal belongings if they are damaged or stolen due to a covered event.
Depending on [your coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/what-does-renters-insurance-cover), your policy may cover the following:  

  * Furniture
  * Clothing and shoes
  * Electronics
  * Small appliances
  * Bedding and bath items
  * Sports and hobby equipment


Keep in mind that high-value items, such as jewelry, artwork, and collectibles, may require additional coverage.  

Loss of use
This coverage reimburses your living expenses, such as meals, lodging, and parking fees, if you're displaced from your rental due to a covered event.
Liability
This provides coverage for other people (non-tenants) visiting your rental property and their belongings. It protects you from legal fees as well. It can cover accidental injuries or damages, as well as pet bites.
Medical payments
This helps pay for medical expenses if a guest is injured in your rental property, regardless of fault.
## Is Renters Insurance Required by Law?
Renters insurance isn't mandated by law. However, landlords can typically require it as a condition of a lease. In this case, you must provide [proof of renters insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-give-proof-of-renters-insurance).
Landlords usually require tenants to carry renters insurance to protect themselves against lawsuits resulting from damages or incidents occurring on the property.
## Do I Need Renters Insurance?
Renters insurance can be a wise investment for tenants because it's relatively affordable and can protect you from various perils.
In addition to a landlord’s requirement, we recommend purchasing a renters insurance policy if:  

  * You have many belongings or high-value possessions.
  * You don't have a separate policy protecting you if someone is injured on your property. 


## How Do I Buy Renters Insurance?
Consider these steps to[ get the right coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-to-buy-renters-insurance) at the best price when purchasing renters insurance:  

  1. **Shop around:** Review quotes from multiple insurers to find the best price and coverage. Also, speak with your auto or life insurer to see about a bundling discount.
  2. **Assess the value of your belongings:** Determine the value of your possessions, including high-value items that may require additional coverage.
  3. **Check state availability:** Not all company policies are available nationwide, so ensure the company you're considering operates in your state. 


## How Much Does Renters Insurance Cost?
According to our study of the [cheapest renters insurance companies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/cheapest-renters-insurance-companies), the average sample premium is $20.81 per month. However, the [cost of your policy](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/renters-insurance/how-much-is-renters-insurance) can vary based on several factors, including:
  * **Your location:** If you live in an area prone to natural disasters, then you'll likely pay more.
  * **Deductible:** Typically, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium and vice versa. However, ensure you can pay the out-of-pocket costs if you file a claim.
  * **Coverage limits:** The higher your coverage limits, the more expensive your premium will be. It's important to get adequate coverage to ensure you're fully protected.
  * **Claims history:** Some insurers may check your claims history, and the more claims you've filed, the higher your rate may be. 


## How Much Renters Insurance Do I Need?
The amount of renters insurance you need depends on the value of your personal belongings. Review your possessions and their approximate values. Include receipts if you have them, and note especially valuable items. High-value items will likely require additional coverage.
Next, determine whether to purchase an[ actual cash value policy](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost)
Replacement cost coverage is typically more expensive, but it pays to replace your damaged items with new ones of comparable value, without considering depreciation. For instance, using the same example as above, you would be reimbursed appropriately to purchase the current version of your old couch.
## What Should I Look for in a Renters Insurance Policy?
Price isn't the only essential factor when looking for renters insurance. Here are other factors to consider when shopping for a policy:
Coverage amounts
It's essential to ensure you purchase the proper amount of coverage to protect your belongings. Review all of your possessions and assess their value. Consider purchasing additional coverage for high-value items.
Company reputation
Research companies to determine if you want to work with them. Read customer reviews and check their financial strength score with AM Best.
Premium costs
Get multiple quotes from different insurers to find the best price. However, don't sacrifice coverage for a cheaper premium. It's essential to balance coverage and cost.
Claims process
Consider how insurers handle claims. Determine if it's straightforward to navigate, and if it's online or through a mobile app. Reading customer reviews can help you understand an insurer's claim process.
Policy details
Read through your policy details to ensure you have a good understanding. Note if it allows you to adjust coverage limits, raise or lower deductibles, and add additional coverage options like umbrella insurance.
Discounts
When shopping around, look for potential discount opportunities that can lower your premium. Common discounts include security systems, smoke detectors, or automatic payments. Also, bundling multiple policies with the same company, such as auto, life, or umbrella insurance, can help you save.

## FAQ
Is renters insurance tax deductible?
Renters insurance is generally considered a personal expense and isn't tax deductible. An exception is if you run a business from your home. In that case, your renters insurance premiums could count as business expenses, following the [IRS guidelines for home office deductions](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/home-office-deduction). If you have specific questions about what is and is not permissible as a tax deduction, always consult a tax professional.
Does renters insurance cover flood damage?
Renters insurance typically does not cover flood damage, although it may cover other water damage. For instance, if a pipe bursts and water damages your belongings, you may be able to file a claim on your renters insurance, but not if the damage is due to storm flooding. Check your policy to see whether flood damage is excluded. If it is, you may be able to buy separate flood coverage.
Does renters insurance cover damage to the exterior of my rental property?
Usually, the exterior of your rental home isn’t covered by your renters insurance. Rather, it would be covered by your [landlord’s insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-landlord-insurance), along with the rest of the physical structure. Your renters insurance policy only covers what’s inside your rental.
Can I add my roommate to my renters insurance policy?
Your roommate is not automatically covered by your renters insurance policy, but you may be able to add them as an additional insured person. Check whether your insurance company allows this. Keep in mind that some insurers won’t add someone to your renters insurance if you aren’t married or related to them. It’s often advised for all tenants of the rental to have their own renters insurance coverage.
