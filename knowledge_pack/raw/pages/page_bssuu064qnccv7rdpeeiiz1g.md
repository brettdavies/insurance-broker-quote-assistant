A defensive driving course can help Maryland drivers save on their car insurance.
**Some people are required to take a defensive driving course — or driver improvement course — after a serious traffic violation or multiple small violations.** Taking a Maryland defensive driver course can help you avoid having your driver's license suspended.
Many companies in Maryland offer defensive driving classes. These classes typically take between four to eight hours to complete in person.

## Benefits of taking defensive driving courses in Maryland
There are two benefits to taking a Maryland defensive driving course, also called a driving improvement course.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,w_60,dpr_1.0,q_auto/icons/law-penalties2)
### Keeping your license after a traffic violation
You must take a defensive driver course in Maryland if you get a letter from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) telling you that you need to.
The most common reasons you may be required to take a defensive driving class are:
  * You were referred by a judge. This typically happens when you have multiple traffic violations in a short amount of time. 
  * You have five to seven [points on your driving record](https://www.valuepenguin.com/driving-points-increase-auto-insurance#work "How license point systems work"). This could be from one serious incident, like a DUI, or many smaller incidents over a short time period. 
  * You were convicted or granted probation for a moving violation when driving with a  provisional license


**You must complete your MD driver improvement course by a certain date, or you will lose your driver's license.**
The course can also help you avoid a fine, ticket or points, depending on the situation and district court ruling.

### 2. Getting a discount on auto insurance
Another potential benefit of taking a driver improvement course is saving on your [auto insurance in Maryland](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-maryland "/best-cheap-car-insurance-maryland").
However, not all companies offer a [defensive driving discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How to Get an Insurance Discount"). And some companies only offer a discount to teens or seniors.
For example, Geico offers drivers above the age of 50 up to 10% off their car insurance after completing defensive driving classes in Maryland.
On the other hand, Travelers offers a driver training discount for people under the age of 21.
Talk to your agent or auto insurance company to see if you qualify for a discount before registering for a class.
## Driver Improvement Program (DIP) in Maryland
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//static/icons/ticket)
**Driver improvement courses are designed for people with poor driving records.** Courses generally cover how to drive and react on the road.
People who have a Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) referral letter must take it to their driver improvement class and complete the class before the due date.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/student)
**Driver improvement classes are offered both in person and online.** In-person classes typically take between four and eight hours to complete, which online courses can be completed on your own timeline.

**Driver improvement courses generally cost between $50 to $95.** Prices vary by school and location.
However, you should check with your insurance company. They may offer special rates for certain defensive driving programs they’re partnered with.
For example, Geico partners with  three companies, which offer classes starting at just $12.50. That's much cheaper than the typical cost for a defensive driving class.
