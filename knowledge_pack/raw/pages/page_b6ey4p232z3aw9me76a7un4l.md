## State Farm rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars
State Farm car insurance is an affordable option if you’re looking for solid coverage without all the bells and whistles. The company also has over 19,000 local agents across the U.S. if you prefer working with someone face-to-face instead of via an app.
That said, State Farm is lacking many perks other insurers have (like accident forgiveness). But between affordable rates, strong customer service, and coverage for things like rideshare driving, State Farm auto insurance is a reliable pick for everyday drivers who want good coverage at a fair price.

  * Delivery of fuel, oil, battery, or a spare tire (you cover the cost of materials)
  * Locksmith services if you're locked out (up to one hour)
  * Mechanical labor at the breakdown site (up to one hour)
  * Towing from ditches or off-road areas next to public roads

## Methodology
We researched the coverage details and prices for 13 auto insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each auto insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best auto insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated.
**Coverage types: 20% of score.** We examined all the coverage options available and assessed whether each insurer offered the following: new car replacement (5%), GAP insurance (5%), accident forgiveness (5%), and diminishing deductible (5%).
**Average cost: 40% of score.** The average cost was generated by Trellis’ in-house machine learning models based on over 3 million data points, and includes more than 15 of the largest insurance companies in Trellis’ nationwide data set. These estimates are for policies with full coverage for the average policyholder who owns one car. Average policyholder here is defined as a 48-year-old driver, driving a 13-year-old car, in an average-income ZIP code with full coverage.
**Customer satisfaction: 30% of score.** We factored in information from three major sources: 1) National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaints (10%), in which we took the total number of complaints each company had over a three-year period (2022-2024), 2) CRASH scores (10%) from the Crash Network which share how well each company ensures quality repairs and customer service, and 3) J.D. Power scores (10%) from the J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study and the U.S. Auto Insurance Study.
**Discounts: 10% of score.** We gave points for each type of discount that each auto insurer offers.
All app ratings were accurate at the time of publication.
