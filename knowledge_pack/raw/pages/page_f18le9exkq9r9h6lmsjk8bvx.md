# Do I need comprehensive car insurance?
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Learn how to decide if comprehensive auto insurance is right for you. Consider vehicle value, risks, deductibles and your budget to choose the right coverage. 
**_Overview:_**_Deciding whether you need comprehensive car insurance means looking beyond what’s required by law. Comprehensive coverage helps pay for damage to your car caused by non-collision events like theft, vandalism, weather damage or animal strikes. Whether this extra protection is worth it depends on your vehicle’s value, local risks, budget and your comfort with unexpected expenses. Considering these factors can help you determine if comprehensive coverage is a valuable addition to your auto insurance._
## What comprehensive car insurance covers
Depending on your state, certain coverages may be required by state law, such as [liability](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage), personal injury protection (PIP) and [uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM)](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/uninsured-and-underinsured-coverage). Adding [collision insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/collision-coverage) helps cover repairs to your car in a crash. But what about everything else that can happen to your vehicle?
[Comprehensive car insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/comprehensive-coverage) steps in when your car is damaged by non-collision events, including:
  * [Theft of your vehicle](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft)
  * Vandalism (like broken windows or slashed tires)
  * Damage from severe weather (such as [hail](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/hail-damage-car), [floods](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-has-flood-damage), [tornadoes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-in-a-tornado) or [hurricanes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-after-a-hurricane))
  * [Fire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-fire-what-to-do-if-it-happens-to-you)
  * Falling objects (tree branches or debris)
  * [Hitting an animal](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/immediate-steps-to-take-if-you-hit-a-deer-with-your-car) (for example, a deer crossing the road)


These situations could leave you with expensive repair bills or a stolen car. Comprehensive auto insurance helps pay for these losses, up to your car’s current market value, minus your deductible. It’s an optional coverage, but can be required by lenders or leasing companies to protect their financial interest in your vehicle if you have an auto loan or lease agreement.

## Deciding if you need comprehensive coverage
Should you get comprehensive car insurance? The answer depends on your situation. Ask yourself the following questions before adding comprehensive coverage:
Factor to consider
Key questions to ask yourself
Vehicle value and repair costs
What is my car’s current value? Could I afford [repairs or even replace my car](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/should-you-repair-or-replace-your-car) if it was stolen or [totaled](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-happens-if-your-car-is-totaled) by a non-collision event?
Local risks and parking
Where do I usually park (on street, garage or driveway)?
Financial situation and risk tolerance
What deductible amount could I comfortably afford if I file a claim? What insurance premium fits my budget? Would I rather pay a regular premium or risk a large, unexpected out-of-pocket expense?
Let’s break these points down:
  * **Vehicle value and repair costs**. Insurance companies typically use [your car’s actual cash value](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/calculate-your-vehicle-depreciation) (ACV) to pay [claims](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/auto). If you drive a newer or higher-value car, the potential loss from theft or severe damage could be significant. On the other hand, if your car is older and not worth as much, compare the total cost of comprehensive insurance (premiums plus your deductible) with your car’s payout value. For lower-value vehicles, the potential insurance payout might not be much higher than the cost of the premium itself.
  * **Local risks and your parking routine**. Do you live in an area where car theft, vandalism or severe weather is common? For example, some cities have higher rates of auto theft or storm damage. Cars parked on the street are often at higher risk than those parked in a garage or private driveway. Knowing your neighborhood’s risks can help you decide if the value of comprehensive car insurance is right for you. Additionally, taking proactive steps to mitigate risks, such as parking in a secure garage, installing anti-theft devices or using weather protection covers can help lower the chances of damage or loss. 
  * **Your personal finances and risk tolerance**. Your deductible is what you pay first before insurance pays a claim. Higher deductibles usually mean lower premiums, but a larger sum to pay if your car is stolen or badly damaged. If unexpected costs could strain your budget, comprehensive insurance can help cover expenses for a manageable premium.


## What if you’re financing or leasing a vehicle?
Almost all lenders and leasing companies require comprehensive insurance (and collision coverage) for the duration of your loan or lease. This protects their investment in the vehicle if something goes wrong. Once you fully own your car, you can decide whether to keep the coverage.
## Is comprehensive insurance worth it for you?
Deciding if comprehensive auto insurance is worth it depends on how you answer the following:
  * Do you want to protect your car from storms, theft or vandalism?
  * Would replacing your car or paying for repairs after a fire or flood be difficult financially?
  * Do you live in a place with higher possibilities of natural disasters, car thefts or [animal collisions](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-likely-are-you-to-have-an-animal-collision)?


If you answered “yes” to any of these, comprehensive coverage might make sense for your circumstances. For older cars with a lower value, you may choose to skip comprehensive insurance and rely on your savings if you face a loss.
## Finding the right balance for your budget
Remember, you can usually choose your deductible for comprehensive claims. A higher deductible can lower your premium, but it increases what you pay if you have a claim. Getting [quotes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-read-auto-insurance-quotes) for different deductible amounts helps you find an option that [fits your needs and budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown). If you want more guidance, an insurance agent can help explain options for your situation.
## Weighing the risks and your comfort level
Even though it is not required, comprehensive car insurance isn’t just about meeting legal requirements – it’s about feeling secure. Protecting your vehicle means safeguarding your investment and preventing a major disruption in your daily life.
