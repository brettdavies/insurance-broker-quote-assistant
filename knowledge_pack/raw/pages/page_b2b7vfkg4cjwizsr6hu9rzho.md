## How Progressive compares to other insurance companies
Progressive’s average rates and customer service ratings are on par with its competitors, Allstate, GEICO, Liberty Mutual, and State Farm. The insurer isn’t among the cheapest car insurance companies, but it doesn’t charge the highest rates either.
While its customer reviews are better in some markets than others, the insurer generally comes in just below average in terms of customer satisfaction in J.D. Power studies.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1) Progressive does have a fairly positive National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index score of 0.89, which signals a lower-than-average number of complaints for a company of its size.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-2)

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent 350 hours developing the [**Insurify Quality (IQ) Score**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. Criteria are weighted by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1-to-5 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. We update ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** We use data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 28,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also considered third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer’s transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify identified the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share to score availability and reach.

## Average cost of Progressive auto insurance
No matter the insurer, drivers with [**clean records**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/clean-driving-record/) typically secure the cheapest rates. Drivers with an incident on their record, such as a [**speeding ticket**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/), an [**at-fault accident**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/after-accident/), or a [**DUI**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/dui-insurance/), experience higher rates. Insurance companies consider high-risk drivers to be more likely to file a claim and charge higher rates to make up for the possible financial loss.
Similarly, [**teen drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/teenagers/) pay high rates because they’re more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors and they have less experience behind the wheel. [**Senior drivers**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/age/seniors/) pay the lowest rates because they have the most experience.
The table below illustrates how Progressive’s monthly liability rates compare to the national average liability rates for various driver profiles.

### Progressive car insurance cost by state
Every state sets insurance minimums, which vary in coverage types and limits. Each state has a diverse population, and accident risks differ from location to location. As a result, insurance premiums often differ by geographic area, even among the biggest insurance companies.

### Progressive car insurance discounts
[**Insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) reduce costs and allow drivers to get lower rates and save on coverage. Comparing discounts is as important as comparing rates. An insurer that offers more discounts may end up providing lower premiums overall than one that charges a lower base rate but offers fewer opportunities to save.
Progressive offers many great discounts and is very transparent about how much drivers can save with each option. The table below shows the company’s discounts and the amount most drivers can save.

## How customers feel about Progressive
In J.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, Progressive was below the industry average in every region, receiving strong ratings on only usage-based insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
Progressive’s Trustpilot rating is 1.8 of 5 stars, and the insurer has an A rating from the Better Business Bureau but 1.07 out of 5 stars.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-4)[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-5)
Customers often cite difficulty with claims and a lack of communication from the insurer.
### Progressive ratings
Progressive’s overall ratings from various organizations show a company with solid financial strength but imperfect customer service.
Its A+ AM Best Rating — assigned by a leading credit-rating agency operating within the insurance industry — demonstrates Progressive’s financial stability.[[6]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-6) But customer service issues are revealed when reviewing ratings from J.D. Power, a consumer intelligence company.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-1)
Progressive has a decent score from the NAIC, which indicates a lower number of complaints than the average.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/#cite-2)

## Progressive car insurance coverage options
Every state sets minimum auto insurance requirements, which typically include bodily injury and property damage liability insurance. Some states also require other coverages, including [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) (PIP) and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/).
Like most auto insurance companies, Progressive offers policies that meet state minimums and full-coverage policies. The insurer also offers add-on coverage options that not all auto insurers offer. These include a deductible savings bank, coverage for pet injuries, and multiple accident forgiveness programs.
Here are Progressive’s coverage options:

#### Rideshare coverage
Motorists using their cars to drive for [**Uber, Lyft, or similar services**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/rideshare-drivers/) need this add-on, as personal car insurance policies won’t usually cover business use of a vehicle.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/b85ef2d0e5/banking-96x96-blue_015-dollar.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/b85ef2d0e5/banking-96x96-blue_015-dollar.svg)

#### Accident forgiveness
Small [**accident forgiveness**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/accident-forgiveness/) is available immediately and protects against premium increases for claims under $500.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible
