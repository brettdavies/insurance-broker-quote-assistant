The application ends up in File 13. Or locked in someone's desk drawer. Now if we knew SSA accepts faxes via electronic means that feeds into a system for processing then that would be a different story.

This can take forever as its sent to the national Social Security headquarters and then rerouted to the Local Social Security office. Find it easier and faster to directly fax it to the local social security office.

I did not think about a filing method possibly causing delays in processing of forms.  
  
The thought that immediately flashed into my mind was Somarco is suggesting the agent does not want to do anything that suggests the agent is saying to SSA the employer coverage is creditable for Part B and Part D purposes because if something goes wrong, the agent becomes a convenient party for all to attack in the "search for the guilty" phase of the problem aftermath.

I have been instructing clients to use the online submission since the COVID lockdown and have never heard of this. This doesn't make sense to reroute to the local office. There is nothing online that I can find where rerouting is mentioned.  
  
Where did you see this? Is this something special just for Part B only?  
  
Why would SSA send an online application for B only to a local office and process A only or A & B internally before forwarding to Medicare?

If you're 65 or older, you can enroll online for**Parts A and B, or Part A only.** You can delay Part B if you're already covered through an employer group health plan.

Not if you have NAPA. I looked into this extensively, and then I had two calls with them to be certain I was right.   
  
Same thing with giving information about plans to which you're not appointed, assisting with customer service issues (like faxing an important paper for a member), and so forth.   
  
If it's a professional service provided in the furtherance of either marketing or selling insurance, it's a covered activity with NAPA. Helping someone sign up for their Medicare entitlement goes hand in hand with trying to sell them a Medicare plan.   
  
Helping them sign up for social security cash retirement benefits? Not the same.

Sorry i never help with the forms . I outline exactly how to do it .I'll direct them the exact forms to fill out . If they need help on lines they don't understand I'll guid them .Middle income and above are almost always comfortable with Computer online now hitting age 65 . It's very easy . 95% of lower income get their Medicare card without applying as they're on SS. As i said I'm more than happy to explain exactly how to do it . My job as an agent is to match the best plan for them and contact them yearly about changes . Also to answer questions throughout the yr such as claims and pre authorization issues .

Why do you think the local social security office will have a fax number on there website?I have been told by a SS rep that yes they process faxed apps the same as they process paper apps mailed or dropped off.This risk of it piling up on their to do list is the same either way including online submission.  
  
Alway keep or have the client keep a copy of paper application that was submitted in case it has to be resent or refaxed- i was also told by a SS rep that a duplicate will not muck up the process and have personally faxed more than once and the second one worked.  
  
These is my flow chart for submitting apps in order fastest processing time:  
  
1.in person because it gets processed in real time but not as easy and flexible anymore since they require appointments  
  
2.online- takes a bit of tech savvy to create an ID Me Account for SSA.gov log in and if a person can't figure it own on their own it's hard to help them if you are not with them in person.Also with special enrollments it can still take a long time to process.  
  
3.drop off paper application at local SS office-but with some lazy,people with no transportation or extremely busy people not always feasible.  
  
4.Mail application to local SS office.  
  
5.Fax if near end of the month and time is of the essence  
  
  
surprised more agents don't help with this because once you help with this they are your clients for life usually
