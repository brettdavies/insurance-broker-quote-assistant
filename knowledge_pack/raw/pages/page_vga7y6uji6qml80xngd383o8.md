#  State Farm homeowners claims 
[ Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Insurance%22)
In January 3 pipes busted in my home causing major damage to my homes foundation to where contractor says it's not liveable. State Farm denied the claim as their loophole states if water goes into the ground they are not responsible. This makes no sense to me I've been with them over 40 years never filed a claim. How can they deny my claim I'm pretty much homeless now as I don't have the money to fix I thought that's why we pay gir insurance???

I appreciate the pragmatic response. But seems like 75% of posters don't even know what interest rate their credit cards are at. Those insurance policies have a lot of complex words. 
My Dad's advice was pretty simple ... "Understand what you're getting into before deciding to do it"

It’s actually not that pragmatic of a response. Last time I “shopped” for insurance, no agency would provide a copy of the policy until AFTER purchasing the insurance. They would give you highlights but not the fine print.

I don't remember what my cards interest rates are because I've never in my life paid credit card interest and just use them for cash back. Idk that I would assume that 3/4s of the people here that study personal finance in their free time are idiots.

Banks require borrowers to get home insurance. It's not something people are going out of their way to buy.

Yes and if the denial letter did not include the policy exclusion they are citing then definitely file a complaint with the department of insurance

Call your state's Department of Insurance and file a complaint. That's your best course of action.

I usually just sort of low-key threaten something like this. "I'm just so frustrated by this, all I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of this and I feel like you're not helping. I almost feel like I'm going to have to go to the Dept of Finance about this since this is ridiculous." 
Not a direct threat, but implications are there. The insurance company usually caves and you don't have to actually file a report (which may or may not actually get ruled on your favor). 
Can't hurt.

There is not enough information here to tell you why the denied it. The adjuster should be able to explain this to you. Sounds like maybe you didn't have Service Line coverage but impossible to say based on your post. 
What caused the pipes to burst? Where were the pipes located? How long before you noticed the damage?

I suspect the info provided to the claims agent was not properly worded. Last time I dealt with a State Farm water damage claim, their agent explained to me if the damage resulted from water entering the house from above, the event was a covered loss. If the water rose from below, then it was considered flood damage. 
My guess is the loss is being treated as flood damage as the water aggregated and rose to cause the foundation damage. Yeah, its flimsy, but claims agents are evaluated on how much money they save an insurer, not their use of valid scientific analysis. 
I would first contact the state insurance commissioner's office or whatever agency in your state deals with these predators. If that does not gain any traction, then contact an attorney.

My brother lives in Altadena. While his house survived there was damage. State farm immediately denied the first claim. He hired a public adjuster. They refused to communicate with the adjuster or him. After a couple of letters and wantings he contacted the state insurance agency. Within a week state farm was returning calls.

Look I have no love for Statefarm but the are not wrong. If there is no water damage inside your home there is nothing to trigger coverage. The policy only pay to access the pipe if their is damage inside of the house but even if that were the case the actual plumbing repair would be excluded any way. If you happen to have a separate home warranty policy that would be a different story

What state are you in? What does your policy itself say? Ultimately you need to read the policy and, if you don't understand what part of what's written there means you're not covered, you should talk to an attorney (or your agent, but I can see how trust there might be strained) until either someone can show you why you aren't covered, or if they are wrong about the policy and your damage should be covered, someone who can fight to get you covered

Talk to a Public Adjuster. They were only going to pay 10k for my 25k roof and siding replacement and a Public Adjuster got the whole thing covered.

Don't just threaten, file the complaint. We have State Farm. A tornado passed our house withing 100 feet. A 100 foot sycamore fell on the house and uprooted 9 other trees in the yard. Took out the porch, the roof, the garage doors, the guttering. State farm sent a claims adjuster out and they said it was only 8k worth of damage. Then they quit answering or returning calls. I had to file a complaint to get a response. The damage was finally reassessed, at 32k. 
File the complaint.

State Farm is a scam company pretending to be an insurer. I personally got fucked over by them when I had their auto insurance. In 2020 a derecho devastated my town and they were one of the most malicious, predatory, and dishonest insurers. The 2nd largest city in my state now despises State Farm, for a good reason too.
