## USAA vs. State Farm
USAA and State Farm both offer high-quality coverage and low rates, making them excellent insurance options for most homeowners. 
**Membership Requirements:** While the companies have many similarities, the biggest difference between the two is that USAA is only available to military members and their families, while State Farm is available to anyone who applies for coverage. 
**State Availability:** Additionally, USAA is available in all 50 states, while State Farm is available in 47 states and does not provide coverage in California, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island.
**Policy Add-Ons:** Both companies offer several endorsements for their customers. USAA stands out by offering coverages catered to the military community, like covering military uniforms and equipment for deployed active duty members. State Farm's options are designed to appeal to a wider audience, including inflation protection, high-value items coverage, and ordinance or law coverage. State Farm and USAA both offer [flood insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-flood-insurance) policies through the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) (NFIP).
**Average Cost:** Below are the average annual rates for State Farm and USAA for several different levels of coverage:  

### Do USAA and State Farm cover mold damage or removal?
Both companies offer at least some coverage for [mold damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold) or removal, but whether or not it is covered (and the amount of coverage available) varies based on what caused the mold issue. If the mold growth was caused by a covered peril, like a burst pipe, the removal is more likely to be covered by your policy; however, mold resulting from poor maintenance or neglect is probably not covered.
### Do USAA and State Farm cover roof leaks?
Both USAA and State Farm cover [roof leaks](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-damage) if they're caused by a covered peril like wind, hail, or lightning. If a leak is caused by wear and tear or inadequate maintenance, it is likely excluded from your coverage. Check with your insurer to find out whether or not your specific roof leak is covered by your policy.
### Do USAA and State Farm cover termite damage?
Neither USAA nor State Farm covers damage caused by pests, including [termites](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage), insects, mice, or other animals. Because there is no coverage for this type of damage, the best way to protect yourself is to stay on top of pest control and call an exterminator if necessary.
### Do USAA and State Farm cover water damage?
State Farm and USAA both cover [water damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) that is caused by a covered peril, but the damage must be considered both sudden and accidental, like a burst pipe. Water damage caused by neglect, wear and tear, flooding, and slow leaks is not covered. Contact your insurer directly to find out whether or not a specific issue is covered under your policy.
Flood damage is separate from other types of water damage and is not covered under any standard homeowners insurance policy. The best way to be protected from flood damage is to purchase a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
### Do USAA and State Farm offer homeowners insurance bundling?
Both State Farm and USAA offer discounts for [bundling your home and auto](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-and-auto-insurance-bundles) insurance. According to the company website, State Farm customers can save up to $1,273 per year by bundling your auto insurance with your homeowners, condo, or renters insurance. USAA offers a discount of up to 10% for bundling home and auto.

While USAA is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., it is only available to members of the military, veterans, and their spouses and children. Some coverages come standard with a USAA homeowners insurance policy that many companies would consider add-ons. For example, both identity theft and replacement cost coverage are standard, and coverage for military uniforms and equipment for active duty members is also included in your policy.
USAA offers several types of homeowners insurance discounts, including lower rates for bundling, having protective devices, and remaining claim-free, among others. USAA also offers other benefits for their members, including discounts for other products and services, like Goodyear tires and Disneyland vacation packages. The average monthly premium was $129.66 for our sample policy, which is on par with State Farm and makes USAA one of the cheapest companies in our rating.

State Farm comes in third in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies, in large part because its sample rate of $129 per month makes it one of the cheapest home insurance options available. Because State Farm’s rates are so low, the company only offers a few discounts, like a new home credit, autopay, or military discount. State Farm also offers several endorsements and add-ons, including personal articles coverage, pet insurance, landlord coverage, and umbrella insurance.
State Farm offers the option of getting a quote online through the company website, but all policies are sold through State Farm agents. The company’s customer service department can be reached directly at 800-782-8332.
State Farm received an A++ rating from AM Best, which is the highest possible score and a sign that the company will be able to pay out claims in the future. State Farm's policies are available in 47 U.S. states, but certain endorsements may not be offered in every state, so it's important to check availability based on your location.
