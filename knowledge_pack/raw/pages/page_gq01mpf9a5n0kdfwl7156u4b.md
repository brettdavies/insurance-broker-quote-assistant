[7 What Can Consumers Do Now?](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/california-insurance-bill-sb-354/8562132/#What_Can_Consumers_Do_Now)
California is once again putting privacy front and center with Senate Bill 354, the [Insurance Consumer Privacy Protection Act](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/jjs-cracks-liability-insurance/8561996/) (ICPPA) of 2025. Introduced by Senator Monique Limón and supported by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, the bill seeks to enhance transparency and provide consumers with greater rights over their personal data within the insurance market. However, before these measures can become law, SB 354 must still pass through the California Senate and Assembly and receive the governor’s approval. This legislative milestone has sparked spirited debate, highlighting both the potential upsides and challenges.
### Why SB 354 Matters in a Data-Driven Insurance Landscape
The insurance industry has long relied on consumer data to assess risk and offer coverage. However, as data collection grows increasingly sophisticated, so do concerns about how sensitive details are used and shared. California’s SB 354 builds on broader privacy initiatives, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its 2020 expansion through the Privacy Rights Act.
Proponents of the bill argue it closes critical gaps in existing regulations. Current insurance privacy laws date back decades, making them woefully outdated in an era where companies can track everything from shopping habits to geolocation data. Commissioner Lara likened SB 354 to a “modern privacy framework,” emphasizing its necessity in safeguarding individuals from potential misuse while giving them control over personal information like Social Security numbers, biometric data, and digital activity records.
![Ezoic](https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png)
### Key Provisions Explained
SB 354 introduces several sweeping measures meant to empower consumers:
  * **Opt-In Consent** : Insurers must obtain explicit consent before sharing data for purposes unrelated to an insurance transaction.
  * **Data Accuracy** : Consumers gain the right to correct or delete inaccuracies in their records, preventing long-term consequences from outdated information.
  * **Enhanced Disclosures** : Clear privacy notices will explain how data is collected, shared, and stored.
  * **Stronger Penalties** : Companies face fines reaching up to $1 million for flouting privacy rules or failing to protect consumer data adequately.


If passed, these rules would apply to over 400,000 insurance licensees statewide, creating what some are calling the most comprehensive insurance-privacy law in the nation.
![Ezoic](https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png)
### The Case For and Against SB 354
Supporters highlight the bill as a long-overdue protection for Californians whose sensitive insurance-related information has frequently been vulnerable to breaches and overcollection. For example, a 2025 report revealed that 59% of recent data breaches in the insurance sector stemmed from third-party vendors, underscoring an urgent need for tighter regulations.![Data breaches in the insurance sector](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Data-breaches-in-the-insurance-sector.jpg)
Tracy Rosenberg of Oakland Privacy applauded SB 354 as a game-changer, arguing that existing protections “do not go far enough given the data-intense nature of the modern insurance industry.” [She pointed out](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release032-2025.cfm) real-world scenarios where misinformation in underwriting files had led to unjust policy denials or inflated premiums, demonstrating the tangible impact of lax oversight.
Still, SB 354 has raised eyebrows among some insurers concerned about its costs and complexity. Industry groups fear that compliance expenses could lead to heightened costs that trickle down to consumers. Small or mid-sized firms, which lack the extensive infrastructure of larger competitors, may struggle to meet the bill’s rigorous requirements, potentially consolidating market power in the hands of large corporations. Others argue that too much disclosure could overwhelm rather than empower policyholders, making privacy rights harder to exercise effectively.
### A Privacy Breach That Highlights the Need
California’s efforts to improve privacy are not theoretical. Back in 2022, headlines were dominated by the fallout from a breach affecting an insurance company, where hackers leaked detailed customer data, including health information and credit history, after exploiting weak vendor controls. For affected individuals, the financial and emotional repercussions included years of credit monitoring and lost trust. SB 354 aspires to prevent such incidents by imposing stricter safeguards and outlining clear responses for handling breaches.
### Broader Implications for Consumers and Insurers
If enacted, SB 354 could reshape the insurance sector in California and beyond. Consumers might finally feel equipped with the tools to own their data, challenging opaque industry practices. That said, insurers may find themselves reevaluating their data collection models, which could influence coverage availability, premiums, or underwriting speed.
For consumers, however, the benefits are easier to see. No longer would unclear cancellation decisions or misleading marketing practices thrive in fine-print disclosures. But skeptics caution that privacy empowerment must be balanced against unintended consequences, like costlier premiums or reduced innovation as insurers prioritize compliance over customer-focused tech investments.
### What Can Consumers Do Now?
While SB 354’s future remains uncertain, consumers can start protecting themselves by reading privacy notices from insurers, opting out of unnecessary data-sharing agreements where allowed, and monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity. After all, whether or not SB 354 becomes law, a proactive approach to privacy is more crucial than ever in today’s interconnected world.
California’s legislative decision on SB 354 may carry national implications, sparking a dialogue about where the line between consumer rights and [corporate responsibility](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/term-life-policies-farmers/8561929/) should be drawn. For now, lawmakers must weigh these complex trade-offs carefully as they prepare to bring this ambitious bill to a vote.
