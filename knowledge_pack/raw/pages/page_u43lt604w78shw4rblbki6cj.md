# Our Insurer Relationships and Broker Compensation
##  As your independent insurance broker, we purchase insurance products and services from Canada’s leading insurance companies on your behalf. 
As broker, our role is to provide you with the best insurance value combining coverage, service, and price. 
We also provide personalized, quality service, including professional insurance advice, ongoing policy maintenance, and claims support. When any insurance coverage issues arise, we are your advocate, using our professional experience to best represent your business’s interests. Our independence enables us to provide these services in an unbiased way, with your best interests in mind.
Brokerage compensation is part of your insurance premium. For your benefit, we’re including a list of the more prominent insurers we represent and the range of compensation each insurer provides as a percentage of overall premium, paid annually for new business and renewals. Should there be any changes in the commission schedule we receive from your insurer or another material change that affects compensation arrangements, we will notify you.
We maintain long-standing relationships with quality insurers to ensure the best match for a client’s business type and needs. The insurance companies, as indicated on the list, recognize our efforts through a Contingent Profit Commission contract. Payment generally depends on a combination of growth, loss ratio, volume, retention and provided services on behalf of the insurer. It is based upon our entire portfolio with that insurer, not on individual policies. Contingent Profit Commission is not guaranteed. For detailed information on Contingent Commission, please go to the individual insurer’s website.
Our disclosure commitments are made in the best interest of consumers. We encourage you to also consult the commitments made by the insurance industry and individual companies by consulting their websites or other available information.
