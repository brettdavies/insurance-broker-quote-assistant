# What Happens If I Don't Add My Teenager To My Car Insurance?
If your teenager drives your car without being added to your insurance, your policy might not cover them in an accident. This can lead to denied claims, legal issues, and out-of-pocket costs for damages or injuries. Most insurers require you to list all household drivers, including teens, or risk policy cancellation.
We’ve saved shoppers an average of $600 per year on their car insurance.

## Key Takeaways
  * Teens over [18](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-18-year-old) (or 19 in three states) can get their own policy but otherwise, they need to be added to a parental policy or be emancipated.
  * Adding a teen to an existing policy is cheaper than them taking out a new policy.
  * Adding a teen driver to your policy can increase premiums between 50% and 100%.


## Do I Have To Add My Teen To My Car Insurance?
Yes, in nearly every state, once your teen gets their driver’s license, they must be insured before they get behind the wheel. That’s true whether they’re driving your car or their own.
**Tip** : In most states, your teen must be listed on your policy or get their own insurance once they’re licensed, even if they only drive occasionally.
There are two ways to make sure they’re properly covered:
  * Add them to your existing family policy.
  * Get them their own individual policy.


However, most states don’t allow minors to purchase their own car insurance policy unless they’re legally emancipated. Teens typically need to be at least 18 to buy a policy on their own, except in states with special exceptions. If your child is under 18 and not legally independent, you’ll need to add them to your policy.
## Adding A Teen Driver To Your Policy
When your teenager gets their driver’s license, they’re not automatically covered by your existing [policy](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/definition/196/standard-auto-insurance-policy) — even if they live at home and drive your car. To ensure they’re legally allowed to drive, you must notify your insurance company and [have them added](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-to-add-a-driver-to-your-car-insurance).
Fortunately, the process is usually quick and straightforward.
Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of adding a teen to your existing policy:
Pros | Cons  
---|---  
Easier and faster than taking out a new policy | Their driving behavior can raise your entire family’s premium  
Cheaper than a separate policy — often 50–60% less | Teens aren’t financially responsible for their own policy  
Eligible for discounts (e.g. good student, driver’s ed, multi-car) | Less flexibility to customize coverage just for your teen  
## Getting Your Teen Their Own Policy
If your teenager meets the age or legal requirements, getting their own car insurance policy can be a good way to promote independence and teach financial responsibility. It also separates your insurance risk from theirs — but it’s not available to everyone, and it often comes at a much higher cost.
The table below offers some basic pros and cons to this option:
Pros | Cons  
---|---  
Parents are financially protected from teen driving incidents | Often unavailable unless teen is over 18 or legally emancipated  
Helps teens learn how insurance works and gain responsibility | Not eligible for multi-car or family discounts  
May help build credit (if payments are in their name) | Can be significantly more expensive — up to 2–3× the cost of being on a family policy  
Teens are motivated to drive safely since their premiums are affected | Harder to set up and maintain, especially for minors  
## The Cost Of Teen Car Insurance
The [cost of teen car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance) depends on whether teens are included on the family policy or whether they’re on their own policy.
**Consider this** : in most states, prices for a 17-year-old male average 9% higher than prices for a 17-year-old female even if they are added to a policy.
This means the average car insurance rates for a [17-year-old](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/can-a-17-year-old-get-their-own-car-insurance) male are over $7,000 annually but only $6,402 for a female.
Insurance companies calculate the cost of premiums based on the risk analysis for each driver which includes the likelihood of the insurance company having to pay a claim. The risk of having to pay a claim goes up when a driver has:
  * A long commute
  * A history of accidents
  * Is young
  * Has a poor credit score
  * Is in a big city


All of these things can influence the premiums on any policy whether a teen is added to your policy or they take out their own. But given that [teenagers have statistically high rates of accidents](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/teen-driving-statistics) and limited other metrics that would otherwise counter the high rates of accidents, their premiums will be at the highest point when a teenager is 16 and slowly decrease until they reach 25.
Some of this cost can be modified with things like multi-person or multi-vehicle discounts, as well as insurance-company-specific discounts on safe driving habits for your teen or good grades.
### Cost To Add Your Teen To Your Insurance Policy
According to the Insurance Information Institute, adding a teen driver to your policy can increase premiums between 50% and 100%.
The cost of adding a teen depends on several factors. For example: If you add a teen to your family policy, with full coverage for one year averages $3in Colorado but only $2,810 in Idaho.
The cost of adding your teen to your policy depends on several factors such as:
  * Their driving history (if any)
  * Their age
  * The type of coverage you want
  * The state in which you live
  * Their gender
  * Their grades


Below is a table showing some average costs of a adding a teen to your policy based on age and state:
Age/State | Annual Cost of Adding to a Parent Policy  
---|---  
16/Florida | $3,483  
17/Florida | $3,169  
18/Florida | $2,752  
19/Florida | $2,149  
16/California | $3,141  
17/California | $2,837  
18/California | $2,432  
19/California | $1,624  
16/Texas | $2,346  
17/Texas | $2,073  
18/Texas | $1,797  
19/Texas | $1,528  
**Tip** : Ask your [insurance agent](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/definition/2389/insurance-agent) for quotes before adding your teen driver. Compare it to other companies. It might be cheaper to get a new family plan altogether.
### Cost To Getting Your Teen A Separate Policy
[Car insurance for teenagers](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-teens) is notoriously expensive — and the cost depends heavily on whether they’re added to your family policy or get their own.
Gender, age, driving experience, and even your ZIP code can all affect the final premium. For example, a 17-year-old male typically pays about 9% more than a 17-year-old female, with average annual rates exceeding $7,000 in some states.
That’s because insurers calculate premiums based on risk — and teenagers rank among the highest-risk drivers on the road.
### What Impacts the Cost of Teen Car Insurance?
Factors that influence teen car insurance costs include:
  * Driving history (accidents or tickets)
  * Age and gender
  * Type of coverage selected
  * Your location
  * Credit score (in applicable states)
  * Grades (many insurers offer good student discounts)
  * Commute distance or annual mileage


### Cost to Add Your Teen to Your Insurance Policy
According to the Insurance Information Institute, adding a teen driver to your existing policy can increase your premium by 50% to 100%.
Costs vary widely depending on your state, the driver’s age, and the coverage you choose. For example, adding a 16-year-old in Florida is more expensive than adding one in Texas or Idaho.
Below is a breakdown of average annual costs to add a teen to a parent’s policy in three different states:
Age/State | Annual Cost  
---|---  
16/Florida | $3,483  
17/Florida | $3,69  
18/Florida | $2,752  
19/Florida | $2,149  
16/California | $3,141  
17/California | $2,837  
18/California | $2,432  
19/California | $1,624  
16/Texas | $2,346  
17/Texas | $2,073  
18/Texas | $1,797  
19/Texas | $1,528  
## Why Is Teen Car Insurance So Expensive?
Teen car insurance is expensive because insurers see young drivers as high-risk. Teens are statistically more likely to be involved in accidents, get speeding tickets, and engage in risky behaviors like distracted or impaired driving. All of these factors increase the likelihood that the insurer will need to pay out a claim.
### Accidents
Teens are new drivers, and with that inexperience comes more mistakes.
  * According to the Insurance Information Institute, teenagers make up just 5% of licensed drivers but account for nearly 9% of fatal car accidents.


**Tip** : Check with your insurance on discounts for “low mileage” for students who don’t drive often or when they go to college.
### Alcohol
Even though teens are under the legal drinking age, alcohol remains a major concern.
  * Drivers between 16 and 25 account for 43% of alcohol-impaired fatal crashes, making underage drinking a factor in higher premiums.


### Gender
Male teens tend to take more driving risks than female teens — and insurance rates reflect that.
  * Male teenagers account for 66% of fatal teen crashes, compared to females.


These risk factors make insuring teens significantly more costly than older, more experienced drivers.

## How To Save Money On Car Insurance For A Teen
Teen car insurance is expensive, but there are several ways to reduce the cost if you know what to ask for. Here are some of the most effective strategies:
### Good Student Discounts
Most insurers reward teens who get good grades in high school or college.
  * Teens with a B average (3.0 GPA) or higher can often save 10% to 20% on premiums.
  * You’ll typically need to provide a report card or transcript every 6–12 months.


### Safe Driving Programs
Many insurers offer telematics programs that track driving habits in exchange for savings. These programs usually involve a mobile app or plug-in device that monitors behaviors like speed, braking, and time of day.
Here are a few examples:
  * Nationwide SmartRide 
    * Instant 10% discount
    * Up to 25% more based on driving behavior
    * Bonus: Teens who drive less frequently may qualify for larger savings
  * Progressive Snapshot 
    * Rewards safe driving
    * Extra savings for avoiding risky hours (e.g., 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. on weekends)
  * State Farm Steer Clear 
    * For drivers under 25
    * Requires completion of driver training modules
    * No moving violations or at-fault accidents for 3 years = discount


**Expert Tip** : Many insurers offer multiple discounts that stack, ask your agent about combining good student and safe driver savings.
## What Happens If I Don’t Add My Teenager To My Car Insurance?
If your teenager lives in your household and drives your vehicle, even occasionally, they must be listed on your auto insurance policy. Failing to do so can result in serious legal and financial consequences.
Here’s what can happen if they’re not:
  * Your insurance company may deny claims if your unlisted teen is involved in an accident.
  * Your policy could be canceled entirely, and you might struggle to get coverage elsewhere.
  * In some cases, it may be considered insurance fraud, especially if the omission appears intentional.
  * Your teen could face license suspension for driving without proper coverage.
  * They may be labeled a high-risk driver, making future insurance much more expensive or harder to obtain.


In short, skipping this step isn’t worth the risk — for either of you.
## FAQs
### How long do you have to add a new driver to your insurance policy?
A new driver cannot drive your car until they are added to your policy. Your teenager cannot drive a car of their own until they are insured either.
### Who has the cheapest car insurance for teens?
State Farm is considered one of the top car insurance companies for teens, with rates 30% below the national premiums. But Geico has several discounts too.
### Can an insurance company force me to be added to an insurance policy?
Each state has minimum age requirements for teenagers, at which point they can legally take out their own policy. Below that age, teens must be legally emancipated. However, you won’t be forced to be added but without insurance you cannot legally drive.
