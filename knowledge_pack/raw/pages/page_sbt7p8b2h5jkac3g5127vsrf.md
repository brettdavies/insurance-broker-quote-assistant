Your location affects your car insurance rates significantly, but costs have been increasing across the country. Full-coverage premiums rose by 24% in 2023 and have increased by 15% so far in 2024, according to [**Insurify’s latest report**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/report/). Insurify’s data science team predicts a 22% total increase by the end of the year.
Insurers continue to record billions in underwriting losses, largely stemming from unprecedented climate catastrophes and the rising costs of repairs and new cars.
Insurify turned to its database of more than 90 million [**car insurance quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) to find out where coverage is the most and least expensive and which drivers face the largest auto insurance rate increases by state.
Quick Facts
  * Michigan has the highest minimum liability requirements, while Florida has the lowest, but both are among the 10 most expensive states for car insurance.
  * New Hampshire is the only state that doesn’t require car insurance, but drivers who lease or finance their cars will need to buy it anyway. If you don’t get coverage, you’ll have to prove financial responsibility to the state.
  * Your age, driving record, and credit history all affect your insurance rates. Insurers review multiple factors to calculate your unique risk profile and likelihood of filing a claim.


## Car insurance rates by state
Car insurance companies consider local factors when setting rates, so the cost of coverage varies by state and by areas within each state. Insurify’s data scientists determined the average monthly cost of car insurance policies in every state except Alaska, which didn’t have sufficient data.

## States with the most expensive car insurance rates
An area’s vehicle crime and accident rates, population density, severe weather risk, and incidence of insurance fraud can drive up insurance costs. For example, Connecticut’s higher median income could contribute to its higher car insurance rates since residents may have more expensive cars to insure. Severe accidents can result in costly claims that increase insurance costs, and Nevada and Kentucky have high traffic fatality rates.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-1) [[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-2)
These are the average monthly liability-only quotes in the 10 most expensive states for car insurance.

## States with the cheapest car insurance rates
North Carolina and Iowa — the two states with the [**least expensive car insurance rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) — have more rural populations as well as state regulations limiting auto coverage costs. North Carolina’s insurance commissioner can approve or deny rate increase requests from insurance companies, which helps keep rates lower. Iowa has lower liability requirements than many states, so without high accident or crime rates, insurers may charge Iowans less since they’re taking on less risk.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-1) [[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-2)
These are the average monthly liability-only quotes in the 10 states with the cheapest car insurance costs.

## Types of required car insurance coverage
You can check with your state’s insurance department for local requirements or ask your insurer, but here are the basic components of a car insurance policy.
### Bodily injury liability coverage
This coverage protects you or family members on your policy if you cause injuries to someone else. If someone sues you, your [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) insurance may cover the cost of your court defense or a settlement. It also goes toward the injured person’s medical costs. You can buy more coverage than your state minimum to have greater financial protection.
### Property damage liability coverage
This coverage pays for damage you or someone who’s driving your car with permission causes to someone else’s property, including another vehicle or stationary objects like poles, fences, lampposts, and buildings.
### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
Not every state requires this coverage, but it’s an important protection. [**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) reimburses you if an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or damages your vehicle. If the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough liability coverage to pay for the damage, this coverage will kick in to make up the difference. This also applies in a hit-and-run accident.
### Personal injury protection coverage
[**Personal injury protection (PIP)**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/) pays for your and your passengers’ medical and non-medical expenses after an accident. It can cover medical bills, lost wages, replacing services the injured people usually perform, and funeral costs.
Important Information
All states with car insurance requirements mandate bodily injury and property damage coverage. States with no-fault insurance laws typically require PIP coverage, although it’s also an optional coverage in some at-fault states. Currently, 21 states — both at-fault and no-fault states — require drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage, and it’s an optional coverage in some other states.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-3)
## Minimum car insurance requirements by state
Every state except New Hampshire requires a certain amount of liability insurance to register and drive a motor vehicle. But New Hampshire drivers must prove financial responsibility by either depositing money with the state treasurer or buying a specific amount of liability coverage.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-4)
Coverage requirements vary, but many states require around $25,000 per person for bodily injury liability, $50,000 per accident for bodily injury liability, and $25,000 per accident for property damage liability, with varying levels of personal injury protection or uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.
Michigan has the highest liability requirements: $50,000 per person for bodily injury liability, $100,000 per accident for bodily injury liability, $10,000 per accident outside Michigan for property damage liability, and $1 million per accident inside Michigan for property damage liability, with varying levels of personal injury protection. 
Florida has the lowest limits, at just $10,000 per accident for property damage liability and $10,000 for personal injury protection.

## Do you have to change your car insurance when you move states?
When you move, you’ll have to change your insurance to meet requirements in your new home state. But whether you have to change car insurance companies will depend on your current company.
If your current insurer provides coverage in your new state, you can stay with the same company. You’ll also have to determine whether your current coverage is sufficient since every state has its own [**minimum insurance requirements**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/state-minimum-requirements/). In some cases, that might require increasing your bodily injury and property damage liability coverages.
Finally, you’ll have to learn if your new state has any additional requirements your former state didn’t have. Several states require uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. And a handful of states have [**no-fault insurance laws**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/no-fault-insurance/), which require drivers to carry personal injury protection (PIP).
Your new state may have the same minimum requirements as your old one, in which case you won’t have to change your coverage. But you should still inform your insurance company about the move. Location is an important rating factor in your driver profile, so relocating could change your premium too.
Keep in Mind
Even if you had the cheapest insurance available in your previous state, it’s always a good idea to shop around when moving. The cheapest insurer in your previous state may not be the cheapest in your new state, so get quotes from at least three companies to compare rates.

## Other factors that affect your car insurance rates
Location — all the way down to your ZIP code in many states — affects your car insurance rates significantly. But it’s just one of many factors auto insurers consider, including:
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/44e1f0972e/insurify-icons-auto-blue-96x96_033-computer.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/44e1f0972e/insurify-icons-auto-blue-96x96_033-computer.svg)
#### Coverage types, amount, and discounts
Having [**full coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/full-coverage/) or liability only, increasing your liability limits, and qualifying for auto insurance discounts will all change your premium.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/4da605a1ec/teen-driver.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/100x100/4da605a1ec/teen-driver.svg)
#### Age
Your driving experience matters. Teens pay about 73% more than average for car insurance, while drivers in their 60s pay 27% less, according to Insurify data.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/17ba1d30a5/contact-us-96x96-blue_031-newspaper.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/17ba1d30a5/contact-us-96x96-blue_031-newspaper.svg)
#### Driving record
Having a [**speeding ticket**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/driver/driving-record/speeding-ticket/), at-fault accident, or DUI on your record will increase your rates, so maintaining a clean driving record could save you money.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c766092b3a/banking-96x96-yellow_031-credit-card.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c766092b3a/banking-96x96-yellow_031-credit-card.svg)
#### Credit history
Insurers use your credit profile to generate a credit-based insurance score that helps them predict your likelihood of filing a claim. Drivers with excellent credit pay about 17% less than average, according to Insurify data.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/62b3f650a4/car-and-driving-96x96-blue_004-fleet.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/62b3f650a4/car-and-driving-96x96-blue_004-fleet.svg)
#### Car make and model
Cars with high safety ratings are often cheaper to insure, while cars with high-tech or outdated parts may be more expensive.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/208875ecd9/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_041-steering-wheel.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/208875ecd9/car-and-driving-96x96-orange_041-steering-wheel.svg)
#### How much you drive your car
If you commute regularly or long distances, you’ll likely pay more than someone who drives only occasionally, which some companies call “pleasure use,” according to Triple-I.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/789c6c481b/car-and-driving-96x96-green_007-driver.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/789c6c481b/car-and-driving-96x96-green_007-driver.svg)
#### Gender
Generally, men pay more than women for car insurance. Data shows that men are more likely to engage in reckless driving behaviors like speeding.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/states/#cite-5) Some states restrict insurers from considering gender when setting rates.


## Car insurance rates by state FAQs
For more information about how your state affects your car insurance rates, here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.
  * ### What state has the highest car insurance rates?
Connecticut has the most expensive average car insurance rates in the U.S., according to Insurify data. Its average monthly full-coverage rate is $248, and its average liability-only rate is $168.
  * ### Which state has the cheapest car insurance rates?
North Carolina has the cheapest car insurance rates, with average monthly rates of $91 for full coverage and $64 for liability only.
  * ### Does your car insurance cover you in all 50 states?
Yes, your auto insurance policy will cover you within the U.S. Your coverage may change slightly: For example, Michigan covers property damage from accidents inside the state differently from accidents outside the state. But your insurance likely won’t cover you outside the U.S., so check with your insurer if you’re driving to Canada or Mexico.
  * ### What is a tort state?
A tort or tort liability state is an at-fault state. That means the state doesn’t restrict lawsuits against at-fault drivers, so the driver who didn’t cause the incident can sue the at-fault driver for damages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering, according to Triple-I.
  * ### Is car insurance required in my state?
Most likely, yes. New Hampshire is the only state that doesn’t require car insurance, and drivers still have to prove financial responsibility. All other states and Washington, D.C., have minimum liability requirements.
  * ### What is a no-fault state?
In no-fault states, each insurance company compensates its own policyholder for minor injuries following an accident, no matter who caused it. Drivers can sue for severe injuries or death.
