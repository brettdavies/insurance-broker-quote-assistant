A car accident is often a scary and stressful experience. You may have property damage or, worse, bodily injuries, not to mention psychological trauma. In addition to damages and injuries, you might also face increased auto insurance rates.
It’s not only accidents that can increase insurance rates, either. Events completely out of your control, such as natural disasters, can bump up your premiums as well. We’ve reviewed how much claims may move the needle on your car insurance costs.

## Auto Insurance Claims That Affect Your Premiums 
In general, the more [auto insurance claims](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/) you file, the more your car insurance will cost, even if the losses were not your fault.
### No-Fault vs. At-Fault Accidents
The most expensive rate hike would be after an [at-fault accident](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident-your-fault/) as insurance companies will see you as a high-risk driver.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/auto-claims-increase-insurance-rates/#citation-1) However, you can still see a rate increase following an accident you didn’t cause, such as someone hitting your parked car. The only time you wouldn’t see an increase is if you had accident forgiveness protection, which we’ll explain more about below.
### Comprehensive Claims
[Comprehensive insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive/) covers property damage from events other than collisions, such as vandalism, car theft, inclement weather, or hitting an animal. Surprisingly, insurers can increase your rates following comprehensive claims, although much less than for at-fault accidents. Even other people in your area making comprehensive claims can raise your rates as it implies a greater chance of car theft, vandalism, and more.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/auto-claims-increase-insurance-rates/#citation-2)
## Cheapest Auto Insurance After a Claim
**Our Top Picks:**
  *     * **USAA** offers the lowest average monthly rate after an at-fault claim at $183. It’s available to military members, veterans, and their families.
    * **Nationwide** is the cheapest widely available option for drivers with a claim, averaging $226 per month.
    * **American Family** and **Travelers** both offer competitive rates post-claim, at $235 and $236 per month, respectively. Travelers also has one of the biggest drops from a clean record, making it a good choice for savings if you’re switching after an incident.
    * **GEICO** and **State Farm** also stay under $250 per month after a claim, with GEICO offering better savings for those with clean records and State Farm offering more stable rates overall.
    * **Progressive** remains reasonably priced at $264 and may be worth considering for drivers looking for flexible policy options.


**Company** | **Monthly Average after At-Fault Claim** | **Monthly Average with Clean Record**  
---|---|---  
[USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/) | $183 | $117  
[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $226 | $151  
[American Family](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/american-family/reviews/) | $235 | $161  
[Travelers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/travelers/reviews/) | $236 | $133  
[GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/reviews/) | $241 | $144  
[State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/) | $243 | $181  
[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/) | $264 | $163  
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/reviews/) | $354 | $217  
## Factors That Impact Premiums After Insurance Claims 
Wondering why the [cost of your auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/) is so high following an insurance claim? Take these factors into account.
### Accident Severity and Claim Cost
The more severe the accident, the higher your premiums will go. Generally, your car insurance rates will increase less if an accident only involves property damage and no bodily injury, as insurance companies view accidents with injuries as a higher risk. Similarly, more expensive claims will cause higher rate increases, too.
### Driving Record
Someone with a [bad driving record](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/bad-record/) could be more affected financially affected than someone with a good driving record.
### Fault
You’ll pay more if you are found to be at fault in an accident. The higher your percentage of fault, the higher your rate increase will be.
## The Cost of Car Insurance With Accidents By State 
You can expect the most elevated car insurance rates post-accident in Colorado and Washington state, where the average increase is 63 percent in both states. Increases are less than 10 percent in [Georgia](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/georgia/), in contrast.
*Indicates USAA has cheaper rates — however, the company’s availability is limited to military members, veterans, and their families.

Not all insurance companies accept high-risk drivers. If you’re having trouble getting covered because of your driving history, check out our picks for the [best high-risk auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/).
## Should I Report a Car Accident?
To avoid inflated insurance rates, some people choose not to report a car accident and don’t file claims for them. They prefer to pay for their losses out of pocket and avoid dealing with premium increases and [insurance deductibles](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/deductibles/). However, if someone sues you over an accident, you’ll want your insurance company to be able to defend you using evidence, so keeping your insurer in the dark is a poor choice. Plus, if you don’t submit claims in time, your company may not be required to cover you, depending on your state’s statute of limitations.
State | How long you have to file property damage claims in years | How long you have to file personal injury claims in years[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/auto-claims-increase-insurance-rates/#citation-3)

You’ll want a [police report for your claim](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/can-you-file-a-car-insurance-claim-without-a-police-report/), too. Although it may seem easier to leave both the cops and your insurer out of the situation, it’s best to submit claims for any incidents you have — except those where the expected repairs will cost less than your remaining deductible.
## Accident Forgiveness
You may have heard about “accident forgiveness” in car insurance ads, but what does it mean?
### What is Accident Forgiveness?
Accident forgiveness is a policy where an insurance company promises it won’t increase the insured’s premium following their first at-fault accident within a given period, typically a few years. Every state except California allows accident forgiveness.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/auto-claims-increase-insurance-rates/#citation-4) In [California, where car insurance is expensive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/why-car-insurance-expensive/) enough as is, offering accident forgiveness would increase prices too much, breaking Proposition 103, which made insurance companies decrease rates by 20 percent.
### Companies That Offer Accident Forgiveness
Does your current insurance provider offer accident forgiveness? The following is a list of companies with accident forgiveness policies; other insurers we mentioned above, like State Farm and Travelers, do not have these policies.
It’s probably not worth [switching auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/how-to-switch-car-insurance/) just to get accident forgiveness, as these policies will be more expensive, but if you are already at a provider with this policy, take advantage.
Company name | Accident forgiveness policy | States available | Extras  
---|---|---|---  
Allstate | Rate won’t go up even if it was an at-fault accident. | Not listed | Safe driving bonus for every accident-free six-month period.Get $100 off your collision deductible, plus another $100 each year you drive without having an accident, up to $500 total.  
American Family | Rates won’t increase after the first at-fault accident, but only eligible for purchased accident forgiveness if you’ve had no at-fault accidents in the past year and no more than one in the past three years. | Not listed | Not listed  
Erie | Won’t be surcharged for the first at-fault accident as long as you’ve been a customer for three or more years. | New York and North Carolina; ask an agent about availability in other states | N/A  
Farmers | Won’t raise premiums due to at-fault accidents; allows one every three years. | All except California, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina | N/A  
GEICO | Rates won’t increase following the first at-fault accident; allows one per policy. | All except California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts | Regular accident forgiveness is free for those with good driving records.  
Liberty Mutual | Price won’t increase following the first accident, but only people with five accident-free and violation-free years of driving are eligible. | Not listed | N/A  
Nationwide | Could help avoid a rate increase after the first at-fault accident; allows one per policy | Not listed | N/A  
Progressive | Small accidents: Forgives claims under $500 (automatically included for new customers).Large accidents: Forgiveness automatically included for customers with at least five violation-free years with Progressive. Accident forgiveness: Paid add-on that allows one at-fault accident per policy period. | Not listed | N/A  
The Hartford (AARP) | Won’t increase rates after one at-fault accident if all drivers on policy have clean driving records for five consecutive years with The Hartford | All except California | N/A  
USAA | Won’t increase rates after first at-fault accident for drivers with five accident-free years. | Not listed | N/A  
## How Long an Accident Stays on Your Record 
Accidents will stay on your record for anywhere from three to five years, depending on your state and the severity of the accident.
## How to Lower Car Insurance Rates After an Accident
Although rates usually go up after an accident, there are ways to [lower auto insurance costs](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/lower/):
  1. **Switch carriers:** Another provider may offer you a better deal. Don’t be afraid to shop around and compare quotes.
  2. **Adjust insurance coverage:** Dropping unnecessary coverage will decrease your rates.
  3. **Raise your deductible:** Similarly, raising your deductible will also reduce premiums.
  4. **Check for discounts:** Ask your [insurance agent](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agents/) what discounts you qualify for or could qualify for. Something as simple as enrolling in paperless billing could save you money.
  5. **Improve your credit:** In every state except Massachusetts, Hawaii, Michigan and California, insurance companies give higher rates to drivers with bad credit as they’re more likely to file claims. Improving your credit score could help you get lower rates.


Taking a [defensive driving course](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/defensive-driving/) is often a win-win, getting you a car insurance discount _and_ making you a safer driver. Having no traffic violations for a specific amount of time will result in lower rates as well.
## Conclusion
Unfortunately, filing an auto insurance claim often increases rates. However, the entire point of having car insurance is to ensure you have coverage in the event of any losses, so if you never submit claims, what is the point of paying for it at all? Let your policy do what you signed up for and protect your finances by submitting claims when they arise.
## Frequently Asked Questions 
How many car insurance claims are too many? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
There is no legal limit on how many insurance claims you can submit. However, having multiple claims in a short period may make insurance companies view you as a high-risk driver, and they may not renew your policy at the end of the term. Additionally, you’ll see higher rates with other insurance companies if you have several claims, although there’s no specific threshold.
Why do car insurance companies raise rates after claims? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Car insurance companies often raise rates after a claim because they see the driver as a higher risk, which increases the likelihood of future claims. Rate increases help offset the cost of payouts and protect the insurance pool from potential future losses.
Why does my insurance go up if someone hits me?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Many factors may contribute to premium hikes if the other driver is at fault. If you live in a no-fault state, your insurer may still increase your rates since they’re responsible for covering your damages. Additionally, if the other party was uninsured or underinsured, your provider may charge more in the future if they can’t get the at-fault party’s insurance to pay for damages.
What are the costliest car insurance claims? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
The costliest insurance claims are bodily injury claims, according to 2021 data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That year, the average bodily injury claim cost $22,734 while the second-most expensive type of claim, property damage, cost only $5,314.
Claim type | Number of claims per 100 earned car years (frequency) | Incurred losses in 2021  
---|---|---  
Bodily injury | 0.78 | $22,734  
Property damage | 2.28 | $5,314  
Collision | 4.2 | $5,010  
Comprehensive | 3.15 | $2,042

If you want the dent to be fixed, it could be worth filing a car insurance claim. If another party caused the damage, you can make a third-party claim with their insurance provider so that it’s covered under their property damage coverage.
If the damage was your fault or the fault of a non-collision event like hail, you can make a collision or comprehensive claim. However, you’ll have to pay your deductible, so if the repairs cost less than your deductible, it’s probably not worth it to make a claim, as it’ll most likely make your rates increase.
