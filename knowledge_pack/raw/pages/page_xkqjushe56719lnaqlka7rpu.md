#  Progressive 1 time online e-sign discount 
I’m shopping insurance and I was talking to a rep about the discounts and how they apply. They said that they can’t see how much I’m getting off for this particular discount and that I will find out once I pay. 
Given that it’s one time I don’t mind at all, but what about after? Is this discount 50% off for the first 6 months then afterwards I need to pay 50% more? I have no idea.🤷‍♂️ 
Just wondering if anyone knows how much this discount is and what your experience with progressive auto insurance has been. 
Decision: I went with progressive. In MA they allow 1 year payments although janky.

I think you are confusing 2 different discounts. 
  1. paperless. this one is like nothing like it's a few bucks a year. 
  2. 1 time Paid in full discount. This discount is quite heftier and is typically 10% off total premium. 


Also i would consider how "helpful" they are being and you can always find another agent who writes for progressive lol. or if you are getting progressive direct quotes you can find someone who isn't 1800 call center to service you.

never seen that one before. My assumption is it's a couple dollars. They aren't going to give you a significant discount for esign.

I am literally currently on the phone with Progressive regarding this... They say it's a discount applied to your first term ONLY and then you lose it. So they are saying the discount for my policy was $53 per 6-month term, so now my premium is $106 more for the year. It doesn't make any sense but arguing with them isn't getting me anywhere :(

It was $150 off the 6 month premium payment for me. I was furious once I saw the renewal.

This just happened to me as well. It went up 20%. This is extremely deceptive.

Same with me in Washington state. I bought a house and moved to a "better" area, immediately got an additional 10% discount midway through my policy. Completed the "Snapshot" at 5 months and was told I would be getting another 10% discount on my renewal. My 6 month renewal, with no incidents, was a 20% rate increase over the end of my previous policy. So I guess with my 20% in discounts it actually went up 40%? WTF. When I called to complain, they said it was the end of the "eSign" one time discount and cost of doing business (inflation). I absolutely call BS on that. It's just a good way to lure customers from other companies, that's how they got me; the "introductory rate" was significantly lower than I was paying at the time. 
But even with the increase, It's around the lowest rate I could get; not amazing, within literally dollars from most others...so it is what it is. I have like 7 or 8 discounts, but they are very clear....that they AREN'T very clear...about what the actual discount is. I checked out Statefarm, my home insurance, home page and for the same rate I would supposedly be getting $1,700 dollars worth of discounts. Exactly what is that supposed to mean besides pulling an impressive number out of their ass. What does it mater if you get a 20% discount but then they can just raise the rate 40% with no explanation. It's like fake sales where they just raise the price 50% and then offer customers a fake 50% discount.

Looks like mine may have been around 10% for that particular discount. This insurance stuff is so riduculous especially for those of us that haven't had an at fault claim ever and probably wouldn't file one unless it's something major. We're literally paying for everyone else's carelessness at this point :(

OP did you ever find out? I just noticed the same thing and they said they on the phone that they don’t know how much the discount is. Im reluctant to switch because I don’t want them coming back with a huge increase in 6 months

That’s about the same the same thing I heard but the discount is worth it and if you live in Massachusetts they will do the 1 year policy . 
When I had to do it they had me purchase the policy for 6 months, call back afterwards and then over the phone they were able to extend it another 6 months at the same rate to make it a year.

Oh good to know! I decided to go ahead and do it so maybe I’ll give them a call and see if they’ll extend for a year
