# 5 common rideshare insurance misconceptions debunked
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Are you insured while driving for rideshare services? Learn the truth about common rideshare insurance misconceptions and how to recognize your rideshare insurance options. 
**_Overview:_**_Navigating insurance for rideshare driving can be confusing, and there are many common misconceptions about insurance coverage. Some drivers mistakenly believe their personal auto policies will cover all rideshare activities, while others think that rideshare companies provide full coverage for their drivers. By understanding these misconceptions, drivers can better protect themselves throughout their rideshare journey. Because rideshare driving comes with different types of risks, securing appropriate insurance across all periods of the rideshare process can help offer protection._
As [rideshare apps](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/are-uber-and-lyft-safe) continue to grow in popularity, there are many misconceptions about how [rideshare insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rideshare-insurance-what-to-know) works. These rideshare myths could leave drivers financially vulnerable in the [event of an accident](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/rideshare-accident-what-to-do). Understanding the truth about [rideshare insurance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/rideshare-coverage) is about helping to protect yourself when driving for a rideshare company.

## Understanding the three periods of rideshare services
The rideshare process often occurs in three periods:
  * **Period one (app on, waiting for match)** — you’re available for rides but haven’t been matched with a passenger.
  * **Period two (matched with a rider)** — you’ve accepted the ride request and are en route to pick up your passenger.
  * **Period three (passenger occupying vehicle)** — you’ve picked up your passenger and they are occupying your car.


The coverage offered by your rideshare company and personal insurance company varies throughout all three periods. Because of this, it is easy to be confused about how insurance works for rideshare drivers.
## Debunking five common rideshare insurance misconceptions
**Common misconception**
**Reality**
**Scenario**
1. My personal auto policy covers ridesharing.
Most [auto insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto) policies specifically exclude coverage if you’re driving for hire, classifying this as commercial use. Without a rideshare-specific endorsement, [a claim](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/auto/how-to-handle-an-accident) from a rideshare accident could be denied.
You are rear-ended at a stoplight driving a passenger to their destination as part of a rideshare arrangement. Your personal auto insurer denies your claim because you were in Period three.
2. The rideshare company's insurance covers everything.
The insurance provided by rideshare companies could come with gaps, especially when your app is on but no passenger ride request has been accepted. The rideshare company coverage normally offers limited liability protection and usually doesn’t pay for physical damage to your vehicle.
You get hit by another car while driving to pick up a passenger as part of a ridesharing arrangement. The rideshare company's insurance only covers liability for damage you caused but won’t help with repairs for your car.
3. I only need special insurance when passengers are in the car.
There is also a risk of no coverage during Period one or Period two. There, your personal policy likely doesn’t apply and rideshare insurance could be limited. You could be financially exposed even before a passenger enters your car.
After activating your rideshare app and waiting for a ride request, an uninsured motorist backs into your parked and unoccupied car. You discover that neither your personal insurance nor the rideshare company’s limited Period one coverage will fully apply to the accident.
4. Rideshare insurance is the same as commercial insurance.
Rideshare insurance isn’t the same as commercial insurance. Typically offered as an add-on (or endorsement) to a personal auto policy, rideshare insurance provides coverage tailored specifically for rideshare drivers. It’s often more affordable than standard commercial auto insurance, making it a practical choice for those who drive part-time.
You’re researching coverage options and find full commercial auto insurance. You realize that this is what taxis might carry. The high-cost alarms you, and you call your insurance agent to explore other options.
5. The basic company insurance during Period one is always enough.
The[ ](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage)[liability limits](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage) provided by rideshare companies during Period one can be relatively low compared to potential accident costs. These amounts may be insufficient for an expensive accident, especially if multiple vehicles are involved. Rideshare endorsements may offer higher, more protective limits during this period.
You’re in a multi-vehicle accident during Period one, with damages totaling $75,000. The rideshare company’s liability coverage during this period might only extend up to $50,000. If you lack additional applicable insurance, you’d be on the hook for the remaining $25,000 — an expense that could devastate your finances.
## Why understanding rideshare insurance matters
Believing the common myths listed above could put rideshare drivers at financial risk. Here’s how:
  * **Denied claims** — relying fully on personal auto insurance or your rideshare company’s coverage can lead to coverage issues, leaving you with out-of-pocket costs.
  * **High deductibles** — rideshare company insurance covers certain damages during Periods two and three (when you have accepted a ride and are en route to pick-up a passenger or a customer is occupying your car). However, these [deductibles](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-insurance-deductibles-and-coverages-choosing-well) often range between $1,000 — $2,500, and you will likely be responsible for paying that amount upfront for repairs to your auto.
  * **Policy cancellation** — if your personal insurer realizes that you’re ridesharing without notifying them or obtaining the proper endorsement, they might cancel your policy altogether.


Helping protect yourself means knowing how different insurance coverages apply across all rideshare periods.
## Recognizing your rideshare coverage options
Relying on assumptions when it comes to rideshare insurance can impact your finances. As you are looking for rideshare coverage, it is helpful to:
  * **Explore rideshare coverage options** — explore multiple options online to see how much rideshare coverage and [car insurance you will need](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need).
  * **Talk to your insurance provider** ­— let your provider know when you are ridesharing and ask about policy options and rideshare endorsements.
  * **Ask about specific rideshare coverage**[](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options)— familiarize yourself with the "periods" of rideshare driving and when each coverage would apply.
  * **Review policy details carefully** — pay close attention to liability limits, deductibles and exclusions when comparing coverage options.


## Safeguarding your ridesharing career
Rideshare driving can be a rewarding profession or side hustle, but navigating insurance can be confusing. It’s important to understand rideshare insurance misconceptions, which could lead to financial hardship.
