## California SR-22 Insurance Requirements
An SR-22, also called an SR-22 bond or certificate of financial responsibility, isn't insurance but a form your insurer files to confirm you meet California's Financial Responsibility law for license reinstatement. To comply with California laws, you must carry these [minimum liability limits](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/):
  * $15,000 personal injury liability per person
  * $30,000 personal injury liability per accident
  * $5,000 property damage liability per accident


In the state, SR-22 certificates are usually required for three years. The duration can extend beyond three years based on the violation type and if there is noncompliance with requirements or repeated offenses.
![mglogo icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/mg-logo_wxc8wu.svg)
TYPES OF SR-22 FILINGS
SR-22 insurance filings in California come in different forms. A standard SR-22 Owners Certificate only provides coverage when driving your own vehicle. In contrast, [non-owner SR-22 insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/non-owner-sr-22-insurance/) in California, known as an SR-22 Operators Certificate, protects you while driving other people's vehicles.
California offers a comprehensive option called the SR-22 Operators-Owner Certificate. This combined filing protects whether you're driving your own or someone else's vehicle.
### Other California SR-22 Insurance Laws and Regulations
California drivers need to understand various insurance laws and regulations beyond just filing an SR-22 to meet the state's minimum coverage requirements.
![money2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/money_c8wtrb.svg)
SR-22 Filing and Reinstatement Fees
SR-22 filing fees in California range from $25 to $35, while license reinstatement fees cost between $55 and $125, based on your violation type. California offers payment plans if your total fees exceed $250.
![uninsured icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/uninsured_jck1df.svg)
Coverage Lapses and Cancellations
If your SR-22 insurance lapses or gets canceled, your insurance company must notify the California DMV right away. Your license will be suspended again until you file a new SR-22 and pay additional reinstatement fees.
![clock icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/clock_klyche.svg)
SR-22 Requirement Length
California requires SR-22 insurance for three years in most cases, but this can extend to 10 years for serious violations involving injuries, death, or major property damage. 
For non-driving violations: 
    * **First offense:** requires three years of SR-22 coverage.
    * **Second offense within five years:** leads to a five-year license suspension with continued SR-22 requirement.
    * **Third offense within five years:** results in indefinite license suspension with mandatory SR-22 coverage.
![insurance2 icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/insurance_2_iixd7m.svg)
SR-22 Filing Process
To get SR-22 insurance in California, contact an insurance company licensed in the state and purchase a policy that meets California's minimum requirements. Your insurance company files the SR-22 electronically with the California DMV, typically processing within 72 hours.


![mglogo icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/mg-logo_wxc8wu.svg)
WHAT TO DO IF PROVIDERS DENY YOU COVERAGE
California drivers who can't get standard auto insurance due to an SR-22 requirement have access to coverage through the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan (CAARP). This state-backed program guarantees insurance coverage for eligible drivers who have been rejected by at least three insurance companies. The program works by assigning high-risk drivers to insurance companies that participate in the state's assigned risk pool, ensuring that even drivers with serious violations can maintain legal coverage.
## Cheap SR-22 Insurance in California: Bottom Line
In California, drivers with severe violations must file an SR-22 to prove they have minimum coverage. This requirement lasts 3 to 10 years, depending on the offense. While an SR-22 costs more, [cheap car insurance options](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) are available for these drivers.
