# Joisted Masonry vs. Non-Combustible: Choose Right Construction
[ ![Picture of Alec Serowatka](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/hubfs/Color%20APS%20Masonry%20Contracting%20blog%20Logo.webp) Alec Serowatka ](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/author/alec) :  Dec 14, 2023 8:47:08 AM 
[Masonry](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/tag/masonry) [Masonry Techniques and Tools](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/tag/masonry-techniques-and-tools)
![Joisted Masonry vs. Non-Combustible: Choose Right Construction](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/hubfs/Blog%20Images/Joisted%20Masonry%20vs.%20Masonry%20Non-Combustible%20Buildings.png)
When you are constructing a commercial building, it's important to choose the right type of construction based on your needs. Joisted Masonry, which uses durable masonry walls and wood or steel for floors and roofs, offers cost efficiency and moderate fire resistance. This makes it suitable for a range of buildings like schools and shops.
On the other hand, Masonry Non-Combustible construction uses materials like concrete and metal throughout, providing higher fire resistance and greater durability. This is a very good option if you prioritize safety and long-term savings on maintenance and insurance. Understanding these differences helps you make a strategic decision that aligns with your business needs and improves the safety and longevity of your property.
  

## Joisted Masonry Construction
Joisted Masonry construction is defined by its use of masonry materials such as:
  * Adobe
  * [Brick](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/masonry/brickwork/philadelphia/)
  * [Concrete](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/concrete/philadelphia/)
  * Gypsum block
  * Hollow concrete block
  * Stone
  * Tile


A notable feature of this construction type is the combination of masonry elements with combustible materials for exterior walls of masonry and floors and roofs made of combustible materials like wood. Adding a degree of fire resistance also introduces combustible elements into the structure.
Although masonry elements enhance fire resistance and structural stability, combustible materials can accelerate the spread of fire and heat during an incident, which may lead to building instability. Hence, it is crucial to comprehend the effects of these combustible elements when contemplating Joisted Masonry construction for your commercial property.

## Masonry Non-Combustible Construction
On the other hand, Masonry Non-Combustible construction is characterized by using slow-burning or non-combustible materials for floors and roofs supported by load-bearing masonry exterior walls. This makes masonry non-Combustible buildings particularly resilient, offering enhanced protection against fires and ensuring overall safety for structures and inhabitants.
Buildings with exterior walls classified as Type 2 and Type 3 require non-combustible exterior walls constructed of:
  * Brick
  * [Masonry](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/masonry/philadelphia/)
  * Concrete block
  * Precast panels


This style of construction, marked by its exceptional fire resistance and structural stability, provides a sturdy solution for commercial properties across diverse sectors.
## Comparing Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible Buildings
Choosing between Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible construction types comes down to understanding their differences in fire resistance, structural stability, and insurance implications.
#### **Fire Resistance and Structural Stability**
Joisted Masonry buildings feature exterior masonry walls with floors and roofs made of combustible materials, offering moderate fire resistance, typically around one hour. In contrast, Masonry Non-Combustible constructions use non-combustible materials like concrete and metal throughout, resulting in higher fire resistance and increased safety. This makes Masonry Non-Combustible a better choice for businesses that prioritize fire safety and structural durability.
#### **Insurance Implications**
The construction type of a building significantly impacts insurance rates and coverage. Masonry Non-Combustible buildings often benefit from lower insurance premiums due to their reduced fire risk and greater durability. On the other hand, Joisted Masonry buildings, with their mixed use of materials, may face higher premiums depending on factors like building use, location, and implemented safety measures.
#### **Summary of Insurance Coverage**
While both construction types offer various insurance options, Masonry Non-Combustible buildings align well with policies such as property and business interruption insurance due to their high safety profile. Joisted Masonry buildings might require broader insurance coverage due to their use of combustible materials.

## Joisted Masonry vs. Masonry Non-Combustible in Practice
To illustrate the practical implications of choosing between Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible constructions, let's consider real-world applications of these construction types.
Joisted Masonry buildings are commonly found in:
  * Shopping centers
  * Office buildings
  * Warehouses
  * Schools
  * High-rise office buildings


In contrast, examples of Masonry Non-Combustible buildings include:
  * Big box stores
  * Shopping malls
  * Newer schools
  * Structures predominantly made of metal and concrete
  * Utilizing robust masonry materials like brick, concrete blocks, and stone


By examining these real-world applications, we can better understand the practical implications of choosing between Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible constructions for commercial properties.
## Choosing the Right Construction Type for Your Commercial Property
Selecting between Joisted Masonry and Masonry Non-Combustible construction types involves considering several critical factors related to building use, occupancy, and location.
#### **Important Factors in Construction Type Selection:**
  * **Building Purpose and Occupancy** : The function of the property, occupant load, and building dimensions (square footage and height) are pivotal. Joisted Masonry is often preferred for cost-effective projects that use materials like stone and bricks and require quick construction. In contrast, Masonry Non-Combustible construction is ideal for businesses prioritizing high fire resistance and durability, such as warehouses and manufacturing facilities.
  * **Proximity to Other Structures** : The location of nearby buildings can influence the choice, especially if fire spread prevention is a concern.


**Location Considerations** : The geographic location of a property can play a big role in determining the best construction type. Areas prone to wildfires, earthquakes, or extreme weather favor Masonry Non-Combustible buildings due to their superior fire resistance and structural integrity. While regional trends vary, the primary location considerations include fire-resistance ratings, building materials, and overall resilience.
**Building Use and Structural Needs** : The intended use of a building impacts the choice between these construction types. Joisted Masonry suits commercial applications where flexibility and affordability are priorities, while Masonry Non-Combustible is more suited for properties needing robust, non-combustible materials for enhanced safety and longevity.
By evaluating these factors, property owners can choose the construction type that aligns with their needs, ensuring safety, cost-effectiveness, and regulatory compliance.
