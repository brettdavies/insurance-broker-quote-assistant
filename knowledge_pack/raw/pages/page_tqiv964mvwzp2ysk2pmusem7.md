Going off to college is an exciting time for [students](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/student-car-insurance) and parents alike. If your child’s college choice is more than 100 miles away from home and they aren’t taking a car to campus with them, you may qualify for the student away at school discount.
Auto-Owners, State Farm, and Progressive are a few companies offering a distant student discount. Let’s examine how and where to get the student away at school discount, plus other ways to save on your auto insurance policy.
## **How Much You Can Save With a Student Away at School Discount**
![Two friends smiling and driving car](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/afd2bc515f/friends-driving-car.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The student away at school discount allows families to save money on car insurance costs when their child [goes away to college](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/student-away-at-school) and doesn’t take a vehicle with them to school.
Insurers don’t advertise how much you can save with the discount, and savings vary by car insurance company and [state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state). The easiest way to determine how much the discount will lower your [premium](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium) is to contact your insurance agent or company.
## **How to Get a Student Away at School Discount**
Eligibility requirements for the student away at school discount are relatively standard across car insurance companies. Student drivers must meet the following criteria:
  * Your parents list you as an assigned driver on their policy.
  * You go to college more than 100 miles away from your [home address](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/how-address-impacts-insurance).
  * You don’t take a vehicle to school with you.


Your auto policy will still cover [college students](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/student-car-insurance) if they drive the car occasionally when they come home for holidays and school breaks.
You’ll have to contact your insurance agent or company to get the discount. You may need to provide proof of enrollment, such as a bill showing the college’s address or a class schedule with the school’s information on it.

## **Where to Get a Student Away at School Discount**
Many [car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) will give you a student away at school discount if you’re an unmarried student who’s an assigned driver on your parents’ auto insurance policy. Here are some companies offering a distant student discount:
  * [Allstate](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/allstate-insurance)
  * [American Family](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/american-family-insurance)
  * [Amica](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/amica)
  * [Auto-Owners](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/auto-owners)

  * [Farmers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/farmers)
  * [Liberty Mutual](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/liberty-mutual)
  * [MAPFRE](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/mapfre)
  * [Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive)
  * [State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm)
  * [Travelers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/travelers-insurance)


The age limit varies by company. With most insurers, the driver can’t be older than [25 years of age](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-insurance-under-25). But Farmers caps the age at 23, and Progressive at 22, for example.
## **The Best Student Away Discounts Currently Available**
![Mother and daughter smiling and driving](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/d04f86784b/mother-daughter-driving.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The student away discount is only available for [teens](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens) and young adults who live more than 100 miles away from home without a household vehicle. If you or your child fits this demographic, it can help lower your car insurance rates.
We’ve researched several companies to find the best savings potential. You might get the most savings with one of the three companies below.
### **State Farm**
  * **Average premium:** $85 per month
  * **Compare.com Rating:** 4.90 out of 5


State Farm offers many ways for teens and [younger drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) to save on car insurance, including the student away at school discount. The company also offers a good student discount for full-time students with good grades, a driver training discount if you complete a training course, and Steer Clear, its safe driving program for young drivers.
### **Farmers**
  * **Average premium:** $181 per month
  * **Compare.com Rating:** 4.53 out of 5


Farmers offers several discounts for young drivers and their parents, including the distant and good student discounts. If there are more assigned drivers than vehicles in the household, you may qualify for the shared family car discount. And the [affinity discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/affinity-discounts) may apply if your child belongs to a sorority, fraternity, honor society, or other college group.
### **American Family**
  * **Average premium:** $126 per month
  * **Compare.com Rating:** 4.98 per month


American Family offers a unique discount for teens and college students who volunteer. To get the young volunteer discount, you must complete 40 volunteer service hours annually. American Family also has distant and good student discounts. Once you’re ready for your own policy, you can get the generational discount if you stay with the same company.
## **How to Maximize Your Student Away at School Discount Savings**
If the distant student discount doesn’t offer the savings you’re hoping for, the good news is there are other ways to [get lower rates](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). Here are some things to consider:
  * **Evaluate your specific needs.** Now is a good time to evaluate your auto insurance coverage to determine if your policy meets your family’s needs. For instance, if the car the student drives is older, you may not need [full-coverage insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/full-coverage).
  * **Consider usage-based insurance.** A [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) could help you save more if you drive fewer miles and practice safe driving habits. You’ll get an initial discount and, depending on your mileage and driving behavior, an additional participation discount.
  * **Compare quotes.** After evaluating your situation, it’s a good idea to get a [car insurance quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) from several companies to determine if you’re getting the best deal on car insurance.
