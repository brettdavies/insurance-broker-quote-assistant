# Types of car insurance coverages
The most basic type of car insurance coverage, liability, covers another driver's injuries or property damage if you're found liable for an accident, up to the limits of your policy. Comprehensive and collision coverage, which are optional, can help cover costs to repair or replace your car, regardless of fault. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage help cover your injuries or property damage if an uninsured or underinsured driver is responsible for an accident. And other coverage options can provide even more protection.

## What are the different types of car insurance coverage?
These are the main types of car insurance coverage offered by most insurers. If you're a Progressive customer or thinking about [getting an auto insurance quote](https://www.progressive.com/auto/), learn more specifics about [Progressive's car insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/). You can also learn more about [how car insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-101/).
### Auto liability coverage: Required in most states
[Auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) is required by law in nearly [every state's minimum car insurance requirements](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/). Liability is usually made up of two parts: bodily injury liability and property damage liability.
  * **[Bodily injury liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/)** can help pay for another person's medical bills if you're at fault in a car accident, up to your policy's limits.
  * **[Property damage liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/)** can help pay to repair or replace another person's damaged property if you're at fault in a car accident.


### Personal injury protection (PIP): Required in a few states
[Personal injury protection](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-injury-protection/) may cover medical bills and related expenses, like lost wages, medications, and prosthetic devices, for you and any passengers in your vehicle who are injured in an accident, regardless of fault. PIP is not offered in every state but is required in a few states.
### Medical payments (MedPay): Optional
[Medical payments coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/medical-payments-coverage/%20) is available in most states. Like PIP, MedPay can help pay for medical expenses for you and your passengers due to injuries from an accident, regardless of fault. MedPay covers only medical bills, whereas PIP may also cover other types of losses, including lost wages.
### Uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage: Required in some states
If you're hit by a driver with no auto insurance or insufficient coverage, [uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) may pay for injuries to you and your passengers (UM/UIM bodily injury) and damage to your vehicle (UM/UIM property damage). Some states require UM/UIM coverage while others consider it optional.
### Collision coverage: Required by car lenders
[Auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) is not required by law in any state, but it's usually required by your lender if you lease or finance your vehicle. It helps pay to repair or replace your vehicle after a collision, regardless of fault, after paying the coverage's [car insurance deductible](https://www.progressive.com/answers/car-insurance-deductible/). Collision covers multi-vehicle accidents and single-vehicle collisions with objects, like running into a telephone pole or hitting a guardrail.
### Comprehensive coverage: Required by car lenders
[Comprehensive car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) coverage protects your vehicle against damage caused by an event outside of your control, including theft, vandalism, weather-related damage, and falling tree limbs, after paying your [comprehensive deductible](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-auto-deductibles/) when applicable. Like collision, it's not required by any state, but it's usually required by your lender if you're leasing or financing your vehicle.
### Gap insurance: Optional
[Gap insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/gap-insurance/) helps pay for the difference between what's owed on the vehicle and its actual cash value. Due to the fact that new cars lose their value quickly, your car's value may drop faster than your loan balance. This coverage is considered optional unless it's required by lenders for leasing or financing a vehicle. Progressive offers a similar coverage called "[loan/lease payoff coverage](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/loan-lease-payoff/)." 
### Rental reimbursement coverage: Optional
If your vehicle is damaged or totaled after a car accident, [rental car reimbursement coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rental-car-reimbursement-coverage/) can pay for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired or replaced, regardless of fault. 
### Roadside assistance: Optional
This coverage provides [roadside assistance](https://www.progressive.com/claims/roadside-assistance/) if your vehicle is disabled on the side of the road, including help with flat tires, a dead battery, or an empty gas tank. 
### Rideshare coverage: Often required for rideshare drivers
Standard car insurance policies exclude coverage if you drive for a rideshare service, so rideshare coverage may be added to your auto policy to extend protection beyond what's offered by your rideshare company. Some insurers may require [rideshare coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-rideshare-insurance-works/) if you drive for a rideshare company. 
## What are the three main types of car insurance?
The three main types of car insurance are often considered: liability, comprehensive, and collision. This is because liability is required by law in most states, and comprehensive and collision coverage are required for most car loans and leases.
But your state might require other coverages (like PIP and UM/UIM), so don't assume you should just get those three for ["full coverage" car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/full-coverage-car-insurance/). When you get a quote, the insurer will include all the coverages required for your situation. Use this [car insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/calculator/) for a personalized estimate of the coverages you need.
## Is buying more than minimum coverage insurance necessary?
No, it's never necessary to buy more than what's legally required by your state and contractually required by your car lender or insurer. However, there are circumstances when it makes sense to buy more than the required amount. For example, if your state doesn't require UM/UIM, but you wouldn't have enough to cover expensive health care costs of a car accident caused by an uninsured motorist, it may make sense to add that coverage.
