## Home insurance requirements in New York 
In New York, there is no state law that requires homeowners to purchase home insurance. However, if you have a mortgage on your home, your mortgage lender will almost certainly require that you have a homeowners insurance policy.
This requirement allows the lender to protect their investment. What’s more, if you stop making payments on your homeowners insurance or drop your coverage altogether, mortgage lenders can take action against you to recover the amount that they loaned you.
Law or no law, purchasing home insurance always makes a lot of sense. Even if your New York home is paid in full, you can be protected against potential damage to your property or belongings from events like [fire](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/home-fire-safety-tips), [theft](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-home-insurance-cover-theft) and severe weather.
**New York Fast Facts**
  * Year Founded: 1788 (11th state)
  * Population: 19.8 million (as of 2024)
  * State Flower: Rose
  * Capital: New York
  * Nickname: Empire State


## Typical home insurance coverages 
There are many different coverages in a home insurance policy that work together to provide your overall protection. Here’s what’s typically covered by a [standard homeowners insurance policy](https://www.plymouthrock.com/insurance/home/coverage-policy-options) in New York.
**Coverage Name** | **Also Known As** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
[Dwelling](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-is-dwelling-insurance) | Coverage A | Protects the structure of your house, such as the roof and walls.  
[Other Structures](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/other-structures-coverage) | Coverage B | Protects the structure of detached buildings on your property, such as garages, fences and sheds.  
[Personal Property](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/personal-property-coverage-homeowners-insurance) | Coverage C | Protects what’s inside your home (e.g., furniture, appliances, electronics, etc.), even if it’s damaged or stolen outside the house.  
[Loss of Use](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/loss-of-use-coverage-homeowners-insurance) | Coverage D or Additional Living Expenses | Reimburses you for expenses like temporary lodging and meals if your home is uninhabitable after a covered loss.  
[Personal Liability](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/what-does-homeowners-liability-insurance-cover) | Coverage E | Defends and protects you if others are injured on your property or you damage their property—and you are legally liable.  
[Medical Payments](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/medical-payments-coverage-homeowners-insurance) | Coverage F | Protects you if others are injured on your property, regardless of fault.

  * Lifestyle changes


###  **How does winter weather in New York** **affect my rate?**
Your state’s exposure to weather plays a significant role in how much your homeowners insurance costs. Anyone who calls New York home knows that winter weather can be tough on a house, especially in upstate areas. Heavy snowfall, [ice storms](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-ice-storms) and [freezing temperatures](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/look-temp-drops) can lead to hazards such as [frozen pipes](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/prevent-frozen-pipes) and [ice dams](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/ice-dam-prevention). As a result, homeowners insurance in New York can cost a little more than it does in other states.
### **Does home insurance cover ice-related damage?**
Generally speaking, a standard homeowners insurance policy will cover a loss if it cannot be prevented, or if it occurs suddenly and accidentally. For example, if a [tree branch](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-home-insurance-cover-tree-damage) weighted down by ice and snow suddenly falls and punctures a [hole in your roof](https://www.plymouthrock.com/resources/does-home-insurance-cover-roof-leaks), the damage will most likely be covered.
Another example is if a guest injures themselves on your icy driveway. The personal liability part of your homeowners insurance could cover the cost of their medical bills and any lost wages, if you were responsible for the incident. Even if you weren’t responsible, your medical payments insurance could cover costs related to their injuries.
Additionally, the dwelling coverage portion of your homeowners policy may cover the cost to repair damage caused by ice dams and frozen pipes.
