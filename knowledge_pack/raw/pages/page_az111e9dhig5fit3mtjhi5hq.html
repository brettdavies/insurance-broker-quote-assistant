Yet, when applying for car insurance, every company wants over $200 a month for two cars, which I find ridiculous. Especially since every commercial INSURIFY promotes much cheaper insurances. Every company that has my information and data calls me saying they can give me a good price, but so far all are $200 and above.

After each trip, you’ll receive personalized feedback, including a star rating, data summary, and driving tips to help improve your score. Safe drivers may earn significant discounts, but risky driving can lead to higher rates.</p><p>Allstate’s <a href="https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/allstate/drivewise" target="_blank">Drivewise</a> also tracks your driving through its mobile app and rewards you for staying under 80 mph, avoiding sudden stops, and limiting late-night trips. New customers get a participation discount after taking at least one trip per policy period and may receive additional rewards after 50 trips.</p><p>Like Snapshot, Drivewise can increase your rates if it detects risky driving behaviors. It also includes crash detection and automatic assistance if you get into a serious accident.</p></div></section><section class="lt-content" id="faq" style="background-color:var(--theme-neutral-lightest)"><div class="lt-flow"><h2 id="faq" class="">Progressive vs. Allstate FAQs</h2><div class="lt-row "><div class="lt-col lt-span-12 lt-span-8-md lt-span-4-sm"><p>If you’re still on the fence about which company to choose.
