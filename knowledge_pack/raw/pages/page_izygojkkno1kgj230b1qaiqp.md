![what percent of commission do you get selling life insurance](https://shunins.com/images/resources/what-percent-of-commission-do-you-get-selling-life-insurance_20250323120137.webp)
Life insurance agents are typically paid through commissions, which are a percentage of the premiums. The commission percentage varies depending on the type of policy, the age of the policyholder, and the dollar amount of premiums. Whole life insurance policies, which offer lifelong coverage and accumulate cash value, tend to have higher premiums and thus result in higher commissions for agents. Term life insurance plans, on the other hand, have lower premiums and commissions. While the specific commission percentage may differ, it often ranges from 30% to 100% or more of the total premiums for the policy's first year.
Characteristics | Values  
---|---  
Commission percentage | 30-180%  
Commission on whole life insurance | 100%+  
Commission on term life insurance | 30-80%  
Commission on blended life insurance | Middle range  
Commission on permanent life insurance | 60% at the beginning of the year

![shunins](https://shunins.com/images/shunins-logo.png)
## **Whole life insurance plans have the highest commission rates**
The commission that life insurance agents receive is typically a percentage of the premiums paid in the first year, with smaller commissions in subsequent years. This percentage can vary depending on the dollar amount of premiums they place with a company over a year. For instance, an agent may receive a commission of 60% at the beginning of the year, but this percentage could increase as the year progresses. Commissions can also vary based on the type of policy being sold, with permanent policies such as whole life insurance often resulting in higher commissions due to their higher premiums and cash value component.
Whole life insurance plans are considered the "bread and butter" product of most life insurance companies, and agents are well-compensated for selling these policies. Whole life insurance policies typically offer lifelong coverage and include a cash value component that accumulates interest over time. As a result, the premiums for whole life insurance are often six to ten times higher than those for term life insurance. This higher premium amount directly impacts the commission earned by agents, making whole life insurance plans attractive to those selling them.
While the commission percentage may be similar across different types of policies, the total commission earned can vary significantly. For example, a 60% commission on a $1000 premium would result in a $600 payout, while a 30% commission on a $5000 premium would yield $1500. This disparity incentivizes agents to promote policies with higher premiums, even if the commission percentage remains unchanged.
Additionally, whole life insurance policies may offer agents the option to utilize dividends to purchase additional coverage or invest in other financial products, further enhancing the potential for higher commissions. It is worth noting that commissions should not be the sole factor in purchasing a life insurance policy, as other considerations, such as costs, fees, and interest rates, should also be taken into account.
Life insurance agents can also increase their earnings through various means, such as bonuses for achieving sales targets, maintaining employment, or sustaining commission levels. Some companies provide subsidy plans to ensure that an agent's income remains above a certain level. Other benefits, such as profit-sharing, insurance coverage, and retirement plans, also contribute to an agent's overall compensation package.

## **Commission rates vary by state**
Commission rates for selling life insurance vary depending on the state, the type of policy, and the agent's experience. Each state has different requirements and regulations for selling life insurance, which can affect an agent's earnings. For example, some states may have regulations related to commission caps. The New York State Department of Financial Services caps first-year commissions at 99% of the premium.
In general, life insurance agents receive a commission of 60% to 80% of the premiums paid in the first year, with smaller commissions in subsequent years. Whole life insurance plans often have higher commission rates than term life policies, and the rate may depend on the age of the policyholder. For instance, whole-life premiums can offer commissions of more than 100% of the first-year premium. Term life insurance plans, on the other hand, typically offer commissions ranging from 30% to 80%.
The type of policy also influences an agent's earnings. Permanent policies, such as whole life insurance, may not build cash value initially due to commissions and other expenses incurred by insurers. As commissions are a percentage of premiums, agents may be incentivized to promote policies with higher premiums. Life insurance companies sometimes offer higher commission percentages for permanent policies, making them more appealing to agents.
Additionally, location can play a role in an agent's earnings. A large city with a bigger population offers more opportunities for life insurance agents to sell policies compared to a small town.
It is worth noting that some states require agents to disclose their commission earnings if the applicant requests it. While commission structures may vary, it is important to prioritize long-term policy performance over commission structures when choosing a life insurance policy.

## **Commissions are a percentage of premiums**
Term life insurance plans pay the lowest commissions, often a percentage of the annual premiums ranging from 30% to 80%. With term life insurance, you can add a term rider that pays a relatively low commission of around 3%. This rider can be converted to permanent coverage later on.
The commission structure for blended life insurance plans, which combine features of both whole and term life insurance, falls in the middle. These plans may be recommended when clients are dissatisfied with the higher premiums of whole life insurance.
While commissions can influence the policies that agents promote, it's important to prioritize overall policy performance and premiums over commission structures when choosing a life insurance policy. A policy with higher commissions may have lower costs of insurance, charge lower fees, or pay a higher interest rate on the cash value component. Additionally, some states require agents to disclose their commission earnings if the applicant requests it, so you can ask your life insurance agent about the commission they'll receive.

## **Permanent policies may offer higher total commissions**
Permanent life insurance policies, such as whole life insurance, typically have higher premiums than term life insurance. Whole life insurance is often more expensive because part of the premium goes toward the cash value of the policy, which earns dividends and grows over time. As a result, the premiums for permanent life insurance are often six to ten times higher than those for term life insurance.
Since commissions are a percentage of premiums, agents have an incentive to promote policies with higher premiums. Permanent life insurance policies generally offer lifelong coverage and have a cash value component that accumulates interest over time. This means that even if the commission percentage is the same as that of a term life insurance policy, the total commission earned by the agent is higher due to the higher premiums associated with permanent life insurance.
In some cases, life insurance companies may even offer higher commission percentages for permanent policies, making them even more appealing to agents. These higher commissions can lead agents to recommend permanent policies when a term policy may be more suitable for the customer. It is important for customers to understand the differences between term and permanent life insurance and to ask their agent about the commission they will receive to make an informed decision.
While permanent life insurance policies may offer higher total commissions, it is essential to consider the needs and financial situation of the customer. Term life insurance is often sufficient for most people, as it provides the necessary coverage at a lower cost. Additionally, blending term and permanent policies can help lower the total commission by taking advantage of the relatively low commission rates associated with term life insurance.

## **Term life insurance plans pay the lowest commissions**
Commissions play a role in which life insurance policies agents promote and how much you pay. The commission that agents receive is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the policyholder. Since term life insurance plans have a low premium, they pay a lower commission to agents than other plans. Term life insurance plans are pure protection policies that only provide death benefits, with no survival benefits. Therefore, most insurance agents do not sell term life insurance plans to customers.
Term life insurance plans are sufficient for most people and have lower costs and commissions. They are usually more affordable than other life insurance policies. However, some insurance buyers see insurance as an investment or buy it for tax-saving purposes rather than considering it an instrument for safeguarding their family's future. Additionally, some insurance companies pay higher commission percentages for permanent policies, making them more appealing to agents.
Permanent policies, such as whole life insurance, typically don't build cash value in the first year or two due to commissions and other expenses incurred by insurers. Commissions slow the cash value growth in permanent life insurance policies, especially in the early years of a policy. Since commissions are a percentage of premiums, agents have an incentive to promote policies with higher premiums, such as permanent life insurance. As a result, the premiums for permanent life insurance are often six to ten times higher than premiums for term life insurance, leading to a higher total commission for agents.
While term life insurance plans may pay a lower commission, it's important to prioritize overall policy performance and premiums over commission structures. Commissions should not be the deciding factor in purchasing a life insurance policy. A specific policy may have higher commissions but lower costs of insurance, charge lower fees, or pay a higher interest rate on the cash value component. It is recommended to research different types of policies and ask agents about the commissions they receive to make an informed decision.
