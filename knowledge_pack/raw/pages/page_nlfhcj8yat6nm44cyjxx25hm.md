The Lowdown
  * Drivers earn an initial average discount of $47 just for enrolling in Snapshot
  * Progressive Snapshot is not available in California, and the participation discount isn’t available in Hawaii or New York
  * Progressive can increase rates for drivers by an average of 20% if they perform poorly while participating in Snapshot


To date, Progressive has awarded $1.2 billion in discounts to drivers participating in its Snapshot program. While a discount is earned by simply enrolling in the program, the real savings come from your driving performance. 
Through the Progressive Snapshot Program, many drivers have saved hundreds on their car insurance, but it is also possible for a driver’s performance to increase their rates. Learn [how to find the best auto insurance rates](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/where-to-find-the-best-auto-insurance-rates/).
If you’re interested in ways to save money on your Progressive car insurance, here’s what you need to know about the Snapshot program. 
**What is the Snapshot program from Progressive?**
Progressive Snapshot is a usage-based insurance program (UBI) offered to drivers who want to be rewarded for safe driving. This free program uses a mobile app or a telematics device to gather data about driving habits and calculate your driving score. 
On average, drivers save $156 per year. You earn an average discount of $47 upon enrollment and an average discount of $145 for performance. Conversely, drivers who don’t perform well during monitoring could see an increase in rates, which has happened to 20%, or 2 out of 10, of Snapshot participants. 
Progressive Snapshot is unavailable in California, and drivers in Hawaii and New York are not eligible for the participation discount.

### Should you use Progressive Snapshot?
Participating in Progressive Snapshot can be rewarding for drivers who perform well. Depending on your state and driving habits, you can save an average of $156, including participation and performance discounts. 
Ultimately, it is your choice to participate in the Snapshot program, but it is risky if you aren’t a safe, responsible driver. 
You could also consider other [auto insurance companies for people who don’t drive often](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/best-auto-insurance-companies-for-people-who-dont-drive-often/), as most offer similar UBI programs. Depending on the insurance company, your discount could potentially be greater, and your driving habits may impact your discount differently. 
Since not all programs work the same, certain drivers may not be a good fit for Progressive Snapshot and might have better luck with a different insurance company. 
## **How does Progressive Snapshot work?**
Here’s how Progressive Snapshot works:
  * **Request a quote from Progressive.** You don’t need to request a quote if you are an existing customer. 
  * **Enroll in the program.** Drivers can enroll online, by phone, or through their insurance agent. 
  * **Download the mobile app or keep an eye out for the plug-in device.** The device typically arrives in the mail seven to 10 days after you sign up for the program. Once it arrives, follow the instructions to install it into your car’s OBD port properly. 
  * **Register within 45 days of signing up to earn the participation discount.** When using the device, you may be required to drive for 30 days before the discount is applied, depending on your state.
  * **Drive and allow the app or device to collect data about your driving habits.** Depending on how the information is monitored, you can review this information via the Snapshot mobile app, Progressive mobile app, or Progressive.com. 
  * **Allow Progressive to calculate your driving score.** Your score determines how much of a discount you’ll be awarded. Whenever you renew your policy, this discount will be applied. Please note the performance discount replaces the participation discount. 
  * **Make sure the discount has been added to your policy.** After confirming that your discount has been applied to your policy, you can return the plug-in device to Progressive or delete the mobile app.


If you’re trying to decide if you want to use the mobile app or plug-in device, here are a few things to consider:
  * **Number of drivers.** If two or more drivers are listed on the policy, every driver must download the mobile app because it needs to monitor their driving habits. 
  * **Number of cars.** If you have two more vehicles listed on the policy, the device may work best, especially if drivers have different driving habits. You don’t need to enroll all cars, so you’ll simply remove the device from one car and plug it into another while driving.


If you choose to use the mobile app but wish to switch to the plug-in device, you can contact Progressive at 1-877-329-7283.
### What driving habits does Progressive Snapshot monitor?
Driving habits monitored by the mobile app or plug-in device when enrolled in Progressive Snapshot include the following:
  * **Distracted driving.** Using your phone to make calls or text while driving
  * **Hard braking.** Making sudden stops.
  * **Rapid acceleration.** Quickly increasing speed. 
  * **Mileage.** High mileage increases the chance of being involved in an accident.
  * **Time of driving trips.** Driving between the hours of 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. on weekends. According to the [National Safety Council](https://www.nsc.org/road/safety-topics/driving-at-night), driving between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. is the most dangerous time to drive. 


Drivers using the mobile app get access to a dashboard that features in-depth details about their driving, including the following:

The information in your dashboard can also be used to assist in an investigation in the event of an accident. Find out [how long an accident can stay on your record](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/how-long-does-an-accident-stay-on-your-record/).
Progressive permanently retains analytics and driving information even though the Snapshot mobile app installed on your smartphone only stores it for a few days. 
Progressive has the right to share this data with third parties for the purposes of:
  * Servicing the insurance policy
  * Detecting and preventing fraudulent activity
  * Marketing and researching
  * Aiding in a police investigation or civil lawsuit
  * Supporting rates (sent to government insurance departments) 
  * Review by Progressive service provider
  * Resolving claims and/or litigation


Although Progressive can use the data for marketing purposes, drivers have the option to restrict their data from being used for specific types of marketing.
### How does Progressive determine who’s driving?
All drivers must download the Snapshot mobile app. Depending on the state, drivers will be asked to identify which vehicle they drive the most. If the household has two or more vehicles, the driving data may also be collected and averaged across the vehicles listed on the policy. 
If multiple drivers share one vehicle, the mobile detects and monitors their driving. It is possible for the app not to detect the correct driver, so there is an option to edit the trip information if necessary.

## **Does Progressive Snapshot really reduce rates?**
Yes, Progressive Snapshot decreases rates, but this largely depends on your driving habits. 
Since the program rewards good driving habits, those who perform poorly won’t earn a discount, but they also risk a rate increase. However, if you’re a safe driver, you might be able to get [cheap auto insurance](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/cheapest-auto-insurance-companies/) with Progressive.
Here are a few tips to maximize your discount:
  * Avoid driving between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. on weekends
  * Avoid using your phone while driving
  * Limit accelerations and hard braking
  * Decrease the number of driving trips
  * Drive the speed limit


All new Progressive drivers, depending on their location, earn the initial discount for enrolling. The additional performance discount will only be earned by drivers who prove they are safe and responsible when behind the wheel. Upon renewal, drivers will see how their performance has impacted their rates. 
If you haven’t yet switched to Progressive but want to see how much you could potentially save with Snapshot, you can enroll in Snapshot Road Test. You simply download the mobile app, drive for 30 days, and review your potential rates once your driving habits have been analyzed and the Snapshot discount has been applied. 
You don’t have to switch if the rates don’t compare to your current insurance company. However, after completing the Snapshot Road Test, you have up to six months to purchase a Progressive policy. If you wish to switch to Progressive after six months, you can retake the Snapshot Road Test. 
## **Is Progressive Snapshot worth it?**
Since unsafe drivers risk a rate increase, Progressive Snapshot is worth it for safe, responsible drivers who keep their mileage low, only drive during daylight hours and avoid dangerous maneuvers, such as speeding and hard braking. 
This doesn’t mean you won’t be able to enroll at a later date. If you know what driving habits are monitored, you’ll know how to increase your chances of earning a discount once you finally sign up. 
Don’t forget — once you are part of the program, the Snapshot app provides tips on improving your driving habits to get you a bigger discount. 
If you decide to move forward with signing up for Progressive Snapshot or to confirm if Snapshot is available in your state, you can contact Progressive at 1-877-329-7283.
