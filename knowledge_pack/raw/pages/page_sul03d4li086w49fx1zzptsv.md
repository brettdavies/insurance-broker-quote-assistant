Home-sharing sites like Airbnb are a good source of supplemental (and even full-time) income, providing an easy way to rent out a portion of or all of your home. But before renting to temporary guests, you’ll want to review your homeowners insurance policy or speak to your insurer about whether you need additional coverage. 
Some insurers offer short-term rental coverage endorsements for an additional fee—ensuring that you’re protected in case of tenant-caused property damage, theft, or accidents. Others may require a separate, standalone policy depending on your property’s location and overall risk.

### Key Takeaways
  * Standard homeowners insurance generally offers limited business property coverage and no business liability coverage for Airbnb or other short-term rentals. 
  * Occasionally, insurers will extend one-off coverage for a short-term rental if you notify them in advance. 
  * Several other insurance options exist for home-sharing, including policy endorsements (home insurance add-ons) and separate [short-term rental insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-short-term-rental-insurance-11688669), as well as landlord insurance tailored for short-term rentals.
  * Airbnb's free supplemental host coverage provides $1 million in liability insurance and $3 million in host damage protection. However, it only covers your property during the rental period and has other coverage gaps.

##  Homeowners Insurance and Short-Term Rentals 
Opening your house to strangers through home-sharing is a good way to make extra money, but it also presents additional risks and liabilities that standard homeowners insurance isn’t designed to cover. Because of this, homeowners insurance may not cover paying guests staying in your home, even for one-off rentals. Some insurers may allow for occasional rentals if you provide advance notice. 
Standard home insurance typically provides limited coverage or no coverage at all for business activities. So if you’re booking [regular short-term rentals](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/vacation_home.asp), your insurance company will likely consider this a business and may require additional coverage, such as a policy endorsement or separate home-sharing insurance. 
### Important
Your insurer may not cover home-sharing or rentals even if it’s not explicitly excluded in your policy. Before renting out your home, consult with your insurer or your state's department of insurance to determine what coverage is required to ensure your property is adequately protected. 
###  Extending Coverage with Endorsements 
Some insurance companies offer riders (or endorsements) for short-term rentals that you can add to your policy for an additional fee. This is generally the easiest way to get home-sharing coverage, as you can just add it to your existing homeowners policy. However, this option may not be available for [detached structures or buildings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accessory-dwelling-unit-adu.asp) on your property that you rent out. Home-sharing endorsements may have a business activity exclusion for other separate, standalone structures. 
### Note
Endorsements may only be available for your primary home, not for a secondary or [vacation home](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vacationhome.asp) that you are renting out.
##  Short-Term Rental Insurance 
Standalone short-term rental insurance is a specialized form of coverage tailored for short-term rentals. These policies often insure your home in the same way as a standard homeowners policy, but provide additional protection for your home’s physical structure, household belongings used as part of the rental, and lost rental income while the house is under repair for covered damage. They also include liability protection in case a guest or someone else is injured during the stay and you’re deemed legally responsible. 
Short-term rental insurance may also provide additional protections, such as covering extra utility costs when a guest forgets to turn off the lights or leaves the faucet running. 
##  Landlord Insurance 
[Landlord insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061515/quick-guide-landlord-insurance.asp) is typically used for long-term rentals, such as those lasting six months or more. Some insurers may also offer [this coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-landlord-insurance-11705333) for short-term rentals like Airbnbs. 
Landlord insurance is similar to homeowners insurance in that it can offer liability protection and cover the costs to replace, repair, or rebuild your property from a covered peril, such as fire, wind, or lightning. It may also have coverage for certain belongings you keep in the home, such as appliances and furniture. Home-share specific policies can even have extended personal belongings coverage. 
The most significant difference between landlord and homeowners insurance is that it may also offer rental income protection, allowing you to receive lost income while your home is being repaired after a covered loss. These policies are also more expensive, typically costing 25% more than standard homeowners insurance. 
##  Which Companies Offer Short-Term Rental Coverage? 
Standard homeowners insurance is much more widespread than short-term rental insurance, but you can find [home-sharing insurance offered by](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-short-term-rental-insurance-11688669): 
  * [**Allstate**](https://www.bestmoney.com/home-insurance/investopedia?utm_source=investopedia&p=as&ts=investopedia&bwid_id=6385e846720393423d8715a2&pub_param_1=4240120&pub_param_2=nf74570afd34a426bb17ac0c46663177019): Allstate’s HostAdvantage policy add-on is available to existing policyholders. It enhances your home insurance with $10,000 of personal property protection for damage not covered by your policy. It also covers belongings stolen by guests. 
  * [**American Family**](https://www.bestmoney.com/home-insurance/investopedia?utm_source=investopedia&p=afi&ts=investopedia&bwid_id=6385e846720393423d8715a2&pub_param_1=4240120&pub_param_2=nf74570afd34a426bb17ac0c46663177019): American Family’s homeowners insurance endorsement (available in 19 states) is for existing policyholders who rent out their home for 62 days or less. You’ll have many of the same benefits from your standard home insurance policy extended to your short-term rental. 
  * [**Foremost**](https://www.foremost.com/products/landlord-and-rental-home/): Foremost’s landlord policies are unique in that they can cover short-stay home rentals and extended rentals of 12 months or less. The company offers $1 million in liability and dwelling coverage. Its policies are customizable and can be built up or pared down based on your needs.
  * [**Proper Insurance**](https://www.bestmoney.com/home-insurance/investopedia?utm_source=investopedia&p=pi&ts=investopedia&bwid_id=6385e846720393423d8715a2&pub_param_1=4240120&pub_param_2=nf74570afd34a426bb17ac0c46663177019): Unlike other companies on this list, Proper specializes in short-term rental insurance. Its comprehensive [all-risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/all-risks.asp) policies cover all causes of damage except those specifically excluded in the policy, and have higher liability coverage limits than competitors. 


##  Airbnb Host Coverage 
Airbnb includes free supplemental coverage called AirCover for Hosts, which provides $1 million in liability insurance if you are found legally responsible for a guest’s injury, damage to their property, or theft of their belongings. 
This coverage also offers up to $3 million in host damage protection, covering your home and your belongings in the event of guest-caused damage. However, host damage protection isn’t a substitute for actual insurance. 
AirCover also won’t protect your home between guest stays if there are damages or liability issues. 
##  State-Specific Requirements 
Some states have minimum insurance requirements you must meet for short-term rentals. Massachusetts, for instance, mandates homeowners carry at least $1 million in liability coverage. If using home-sharing platforms like Airbnb, verify that any included host liability insurance is enough to meet your state’s laws or if additional insurance is necessary. 
##  The Bottom Line 
Contact your insurance company before listing your home on Airbnb to understand your short-term rental coverage needs and options. Insurers may require you to add a rider to your policy or purchase a standalone policy as a condition for coverage. 
While Airbnb offers its own supplemental protection, this coverage has significant limitations and isn’t a replacement for an insurance policy. When you secure the right coverage, you protect your investment and gain peace of mind as you welcome paying guests into your home.
