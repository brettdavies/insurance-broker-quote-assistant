At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Won't use All-State for home insurance anymore.
Reviewed in Alabama on November 2025
I found out from a previous employee about their directive that they are not supposed to cover roof damage. Unfortunately, it was after my roof was damaged. They said it was not wind damage even though two trees were blown down and my son's trampoline was blown over 30 feet.

Why we picked this company
The fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer by market share, Allstate is available in all 50 states. The company has been in business for more than 90 years and also sells home, renters, and condo policies — so it’s a good option for those who want to save by bundling auto with another type of policy. Allstate also offers helpful optional auto coverages, like gap insurance and accident forgiveness. AM Best gives the company a high rating for financial strength, but Allstate has a higher-than-average number of complaints in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Consumer Complaint Index.
Pros
  * Ample opportunities for bundling discount
  * Offers a pay-per-mile option
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * Low customer satisfaction
  * Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
  * Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study


## GEICO
GEICO currently holds the second-highest spot in terms of auto insurance market share and boasts the highest-possible financial strength rating from AM Best: A++.

  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs

## Allstate Drivewise vs. GEICO DriveEasy
Allstate and GEICO offer optional [**telematics programs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) for drivers who want to save even more on their premiums. These programs use smartphone apps to log trips, identify driver habits, and even detect crashes. People who demonstrate safe driving habits can qualify for discounts on their policy, though neither insurance company specifies how much you can save.
Allstate’s Drivewise program tracks driver speed, braking events, mobile phone usage, and what times of day drivers are on the road to determine how much risk a driver poses. The less risky the behavior, the greater the savings. Good drivers can also qualify for additional safe driver performance rewards every six months.
GEICO’s DriveEasy program is also app-based and tracks many of the same data points: how often you use your phone behind the wheel, how fast you drive, whether you brake quickly, and even how fast you take turns. The better your driving habits, the better your driver score and greater your discounts.
## Allstate vs. GEICO: Which is the cheapest?
On average, auto insurance through GEICO is cheaper than Allstate. The average GEICO premium is $91 per month for liability-only coverage and $139 per month for full coverage, while Allstate averages $74 per month and $139 per month for liability and full coverage, respectively.
But premiums vary among drivers depending on factors like age, driving record, coverage level, and even ZIP codes.
