## Travelers Insurance: A good choice for budget-conscious shoppers
Consistently one of the cheapest insurance companies available, Travelers earns a **good** rating from The Zebra for its competitive pricing, generous discount options, and flexible coverage — especially compared to carriers of a similar size.

What customers like:
  * **Financial Strength Ratings:** Strong ratings indicate the carrier can pay claims during major events.
  * **Agent Knowledge and Helpfulness:** Knowledgeable agents resolve issues quickly with accurate information.


What customers don't like:
  * **Market Stability and Longevity:** Unstable carriers may exit your market or face financial issues.
  * **Integration with Other Platforms:** No integration means managing insurance separately from other accounts.

  * **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%): **This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
  * **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
  * **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%): **This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
  * **Trust & Reliability (25%): **This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.


**Price context:**_Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided._

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
