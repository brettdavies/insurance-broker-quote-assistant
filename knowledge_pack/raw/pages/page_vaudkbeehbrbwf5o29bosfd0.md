Comparing home and auto insurance quotes with and without bundling discounts and then researching each company will help you find the best insurance company for auto and home insurance.
Bundled discounts vary by company and may not be available in all states. You'll need to request personalized quotes to see which company is best for you and find out [how auto and home bundling works](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/how-to-save-money-with-an-auto-and-renters-insurance-bundle) with that company.

Be sure to do your research before you decide on a bundle.
## Should I bundle home and auto insurance?
While bundling can save some people a lot of money, it's not the best deal for everyone. You should compare quotes with and without the bundle to determine if it's the best deal.

That provides the total dollar amount you’re paying for both coverages and the total amount saved. Then, you can calculate the percentage of your overall bundling savings. The example below shows that the home and car insurance bundle discount is 23%.
Policy | Rate | Discount $ | Discount %  
---|---|---|---  
Auto | $1,500 | $375 | 25%  
Home | $1,000 | $190 | 19%  
Total premium; pre-discount | $2,500 | – | –  
Premium with discount | $1,935 | $565 | 23%  
To find the best company for your needs, compare each quote as shown in the table above.
### Does bundling insurance save money?
Bundling reduces the cost of both your auto and home insurance. You can save, on average, 15%, or just over $700 annually, when you bundle home and car insurance. The amount you'll save on your home and auto insurance depends on your state, your carrier and other factors.
That said, [bundling is not always the best deal](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/is-bundling-home-and-auto-really-the-best-deal) overall. Always compare rates for home and auto purchased separately from different companies when shopping. Sometimes, it's cheaper to buy them separately.
## Other ways to save on home insurance and auto insurance
There are other ways to lower your insurance coverage costs besides bundling.
  * **Other home insurance and car insurance discounts**. While bundling is among the highest discounts for home and auto insurance, you can earn many other price breaks. Our guide to the [best home insurance discounts](https://www.insurance.com/homeowners-insurance-discounts.html) provides details on which ones get the most savings, for instance, those for [new homes](https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance/discounts/new-home-insurance-discount), [upgrades](https://www.insurance.com/home-and-renters-insurance/home-insurance-basics/home-improvements-to-lower-insurance-cost) and advance purchases. Auto insurance discounts that match your driver profile can also save you a lot on your insurance costs. The best deals are for safe and accident-free drivers, but many don't even consider your driving record and are granted for simply paying in advance or online.
  * **Compare home and auto insurance quotes annually**. Be sure to compare home and auto insurance quotes from at least three companies for the same insurance coverage at least once a year. The best company for you today might not be down the road if your circumstances change, say you remodel your home, your credit score changes, you add a teen driver to your policy or you have to file a claim. Even if your homeowner and driver profiles remain unchanged, you can save on your insurance rate by comparing insurance quotes because the price for identical insurance policies will differ significantly among carriers.
