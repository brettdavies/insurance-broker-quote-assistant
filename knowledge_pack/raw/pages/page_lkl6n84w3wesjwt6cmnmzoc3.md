#  State Farm Homeowner Claim 
Long story short. 
Storm came thru Pittsburgh region. Pretty moderate wind and hail damage to roof, windows, screens, gutters and downspouts. 
Had 2 adjusters that never called me back. 
3rd adjuster scheduled a “ladder assist” inspection. 
Had 2 seek now inspections. (Needed a re-inspection since first one was done with a wet roof.) 
Adjuster 3 said “I put you in for a full roof replacement”. 
2 days later I now have adjuster #4 assigned to my case. 
Adjuster #4 states “your old adjuster didn’t have the authority to issue you a full roof replacement, management is disputing your claim, we’re having a engineer come out to your house for an inspection, the hail in your area wasn’t that big in diameter”. 
It’s been 40+ days since the storm and I have an interior leak…. They just came out 2 days ago to inspect the inside. 
Has this happened to anyone else? What’s my next move? 
I have pictures of my roof from September 2024 when I had my chimneys re-pointed with no damage. 
Now you can tell I have shingles bent from the storm. 
It at a loss on what to do. 
Edit #1: 1” hail came thru the area. 
Edit #2: Correction to edit #1 - Roof is 10 years old. Looking into weather report now. 1.75” hail in my location. 60mph winds. 1/4 mile away a roof was blown off a grocery store. 4 of my neighbors have already had their roofs replaced.

1 inch hail typically doesn’t cause a roof to leak. Likely leaking due to a wear/tear issue. As others said, you have a duty to mitigate the damages to prevent more water damage

I would recommend tarping if you have a leak. You have a duty to mitigate. 
Your next step is to wait on engineer report. If you have a contractor have them send in additional photo/docs supporting hail. You still havent said what the size was. I would add that to your post, possibly photos if you want opinions

I’m not sure what your options are. But maybe this link will help you. If you have leaks I’d think them taking their time is causing more damage.

A public adjuster can really help but ONLY if your claim is approved, but not enough coverage is provided. I've looked into suing State Farm for denying my in-laws claim but in CA, the attorney I spoke to (se specializes in suing home owners associations and insurance companies) said going to court will cost $100K minimum in legal fees so sadly, that's not an option for a $50K claim. However, if your state allows collection of legal fees for this type of lawsuit, a threatening letter from an attorney might cause them to take care of your claim. BTW, my state farm adjuster told us their claim was fully covered. The next day, he called and said his manager denied the claim and quoted some vague verbiage in the policy. Good luck

Hail was bad enough for damage to a car in the driveway. I have exterior security camera footage, and it looks like Christmas it was a white out of hail. Craziest storm I ever saw. And my roof is only 10 years old… 
When the inspector came, he was almost running out of chalk to mark the roof. 10x10 area with 18+ hits. Plus wind damaged shingles.

Let me guess All State or State Farm? You will for sure get the full roof replaced it is just annoying that you may have to pester a manager about it because from what you described that is rediculous.

Started a process with State Farm in September. Just had the roof replaced last week. It took my roofing contractor threatening to turn them into the State before they did anything for me. Calling insurance companies this week to switch up. Been with State Farm for over 20 years

I just settled a HO claim with State Farm from 2022. Ive also been a customer for over 30 years and never a HO claim. Very frustrating. A tree fell on my front porch and broke every window. Tore up the roof and siding. They offered $674. I denied the payment. What a joke. Thought I should hire a Public Adjuster. Well,...After a crooked public adjuster, no help from DOI, and three years of stress....It is closed. Money out of pocket for the roof and nothing else fixed. My trust and respect for any insurance company or government agencies, are gone. Not what is supposed to happen. State Farm literally has a commercial with a tree falling on a portion of a house. Unbelievable and very disappointed

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers 
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors. 
### Home Insurance
  * **Coverage Types** : You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Rebuild Cost** : Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
  * **Personal Property** : Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
  * **Bundling** : Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
  * **Deductibles** : Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)


### Life Insurance
  * **Mortgage Protection** : This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Policy Types** : Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)


### Health Insurance
  * **Premium Stability** : Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
  * **Enrollment Periods** : You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
  * **Employer Plans** : If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)


### Car Insurance
  * **Coverage Considerations** : Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
  * **Car Choice** : Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
  * **VIN Quotes** : Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)


### Additional Tips
  * **Use a Broker** : Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Read the Fine Print** : Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Check Claims Handling** : Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)
