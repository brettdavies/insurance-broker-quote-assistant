Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-vs-allstate/)
State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a great option for customers looking for flexible or with unique coverage needs.

Still, homeowners looking for basic insurance with no bells or whistles may wish to look for an alternative.
