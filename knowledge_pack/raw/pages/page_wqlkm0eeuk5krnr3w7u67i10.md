📊 **The data:** Our September 2025 survey of local agents found that the average real estate commission in Michigan is 5.73%[Calculate your estimated commission in Michigan.](https://listwithclever.com/average-real-estate-commission-rate/michigan/#commission-calculator)
When selling a house in Michigan, the average total realtor fees due at closing are 5.73% of the home's sale price.
For context, if you sell a home that costs $190,000, you'd typically pay around $10,887 in realtor fees; $22,347 for a $390,000 home; and $37,245 for a $650,000 home.
Realtor commission is usually the largest cost you'll face when selling your home — but you don't have to pay the full 5.73%. You can use a [low commission real estate broker](https://listwithclever.com/discount-real-estate-brokers/michigan/) to save on listing fees.
Clever Real Estate could help you save thousands on listing commission by pre-negotiating 1.5% listing fees with full-service Michigan realtors from top brokerages.
On a typical Michigan home, you'd pay just $10,400, up to 29% less than the average rates.

## How real estate commission works in Michigan
Average listing commission | 2.85%  
---|---  
Average [buyer's agent commission](https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/buyers-agent-fee/) | 2.88%  
Total average commission | 5.73%  
Show more
There are usually two real estate agents involved in the real estate transactions of a home sale:
  * The seller's agent (also called the listing agent), who represents the home seller
  * The buyer's agent, who represents the person buying the home


The seller's agent earns their commission by determining an appropriate listing price and managing the closing process. 
The buyer's agent
Sellers and buyers must [negotiate realtor fees](https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/how-to-negotiate-realtor-commission/) with their agents separately (as required by the [2024 NAR lawsuit settlement](https://listwithclever.com/news/nar-settlement-real-estate-commission-changes/)). The seller and buyer each sign a contract with their agent, promising to pay the agreed-upon commission. Sellers can offer to pay a buyer's agent concession to help the buyer afford the home.

## Who pays realtor fees in Michigan?
The seller pays for at least their agent, and often covers the buyer's agent fees, as well. When selling a home in Michigan, you don't need to pay the realtor fees upfront. Similar to [closing costs](https://listwithclever.com/closing-costs/), the real estate agent fees are deducted from the sale revenue when the home purchase is finalized.
When you offer to pay a concession for the buyer's agent, you'll owe an average of 5.73% in commission, taken from the sale proceeds at closing. If you don't offer to pay a concession for the buyer's agent, the buyer will owe their agent an average of 2.88% on top of the price of the home and closing costs.
### Should sellers pay the buyer's real estate agent commission?
Sellers are not required to pay for the buyer's agent, but most listing agents will recommend you offer to cover this fee. 
"Paying a buyer’s agent commission can make or break your home’s appeal," says [Rick Guerrero](https://dalmatianhomes.com/) of Dalmatian Real Estate in Holland, MI. "It’s not required, but offering 2.5% to 3% is standard and gets agents eager to show your place. Skip it, and you might shrink your buyer pool, especially in a busy market. A solid commission keeps pros motivated to bring serious offers." 
Here are a few reasons to offer this concession during negotiations:
  * It will likely attract more potential purchasers for your home. 
  * Your home will be affordable to more buyers since they won't have to pay their agent's commission in addition to the down payment and [closing costs](https://listwithclever.com/closing-costs/).
  * Agents will be motivated to showcase your property to their clients, increasing your chances of securing multiple offers.


### **Recent buyer's agent commission trends**
Buyer's agent commissions can rise and fall with seasonality and other factors, such as the state of the market in your area. 
Nationally, over the past six months, buyer's agent commissions have:
  * Averaged about 2.60%
  * Ranged from a low of 2.56% to a high of 2.62%


Here's the buyer's agent commission averages for each of the past six months:[1]
  * October 2025: 2.62%
  * September 2025: 2.62%
  * August 2025: 2.60%
  * July 2025: 2.61%
  * June 2025: 2.56%
  * May 2025: 2.58%


###  What is the NAR lawsuit? 
After losing a lawsuit over their practices in 2024, the National Association of Realtors agreed to change how real estate professionals do business.
As of August 2024, buyer's agents are required to sign an ["agency agreement"](https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/7-faqs-about-buyer-agency-agreements/) before providing services to a buyer. This agreement has to specify what services the agent will provide, and how much they will get paid.
Real estate agents are no longer allowed to split commissions with one another. In the past, it was common for a listing agent to collect a 6% fee from the seller, and then split this fee with a buyer's agent who brought a buyer. Going forward, buyer's agents will have to negotiate their fee directly with the buyer they represent.
Learn more about [how the lawsuit impacts buyers and sellers](https://listwithclever.com/news/nar-settlement-real-estate-commission-changes/).
###  Will the NAR settlement change how real estate commission works?
Buyers may feel the most immediate impact from the NAR settlement changes. If the seller doesn't offer to pay for the buyer's agent at closing, the buyer could be on the hook for an extra 2–3% of the home's sale price. This may convince some buyers to skip hiring an agent and try to navigate the market themselves. 
Many sellers may continue to offer to pay for the buyer's agent like they always have to help sell their home. However, a seller may decline to offer any concessions if they're in a competitive [seller's market](https://listwithclever.com/average-real-estate-commission-rate/michigan/#current-market) in which they have all the leverage.
A [Clever Real Estate survey](https://listwithclever.com/research/what-does-a-realtor-do-2024/) found that 94% of home sellers support the commission changes.
## How to save on realtor fees in Michigan
Commission rates are not set in stone. In fact, we found that while 2.85% is the average listing commission in Michigan, rates are typically 1.00%–3.00%. You can save money by negotiating a lower rate with your listing agent or by working with a discount real estate brokerage.
Listing commission range | 1.00%– 3.00%  
---|---  
Buyer's agent commission | 1.00%– 4.00%  
Total commission range | 2.00%– 7.00%

## How to negotiate real estate commission in Michigan
Real estate commission is always negotiable. According to our survey of real estate agents, you'll likely have an easier time negotiating low rates if:
  * You're selling a high value home
  * You have a personal relationship with a realtor
  * You can offer a realtor repeat business


The state of the housing market in Michigan will also impact your ability to [negotiate realtor fees](https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/how-to-negotiate-realtor-commission/).
In a seller's market, home sellers have more leverage than buyers. This makes listing agents' jobs more straightforward, so they may be open to reducing their fees. The opposite is often true in a buyer's market.
To assess the current state of your local real estate market, look at the months of inventory, sale-to-list price ratio, and home values.
If all factors indicate Michigan is a seller's market, you may be in a good position to negotiate a lower rate with your agent. If market conditions are mixed or favor buyers, it may be tougher to get your realtor to accept a cheaper commission.
## Michigan housing market (November 2025)
As of October 31, 2025, here's the state of the Michigan market:
  * **Housing inventory** (the total number of homes for sale) stands at 28,613, compared to the 28,488
  * The **median days on market** is 52 days, compared to the 51-day
  * The **median list price**(the seller's asking price for the home) is currently $274,900, compared to the rolling average of $270,142.
  * The **median sale price**(what homes are actually selling for) is $291,800.
  * The **sale-to-list price ratio** (the percentage of listing price sellers are actually getting) is 98.50%, indicating a seller's market.


During the week ending October 31, 2025, there were 1,865 **new home listings** added, compared to the 2,033 homes
## **Interpreting the current state of the market**
In a seller’s market, you may be in a better position to negotiate commission with your agent because homes are generally selling quicker, and agents may compete for listings.
If market conditions are mixed or favor buyers, it may be tougher to get your realtor to accept a cheaper commission.
Here's how to determine what kind of a market you're in.
  * Indicates a seller's market: 
    * **Housing inventory** and**new listings are down** compared to the average**.** This means buyers have fewer options to choose from.
    * **Median days on the market are down** compared to the average**.** This means homes are selling quickly due to strong demand.
    * **Median list price** and**median sale price are up** , meaning demand is strong enough to push prices higher.
    * **Sale-to-list price ratio** is at or above 100%, meaning buyers are willing to pay the asking price or more. 


  * Indicates a buyer's market: 
    * **Housing inventory** and **new listings** are up compared to the average, meaning buyers have more options to choose from.
    * **Median days on the market are up** compared to the average, meaning homes are taking longer to sell.
    * **Median list price** and **median sale price are down** , showing sellers may be lowering prices to attract buyers.
    * **Sale-to-list price ratio** is below 100%, indicating buyers are finding success negotiating prices down and paying less than the listing price.


Keep in mind housing market trends are most useful when examining data at a local level. Statewide data can give you a general sense of the state of the real estate market, but be sure to research your local market for the most helpful statistics.

## How much do real estate agents make in Michigan?
Even though the average total real estate commission is 5–6%, not all those fees go directly to the agents. In most cases, the agents must share as much as half of their commission with their sponsoring brokerage.
Let's say a home sells for $600,000 and each agent is earning 2.5%. Each agent would earn $15,000 at closing. However, since they would owe their brokerage half, their take-home pay would only be $7,500.
### What do real estate agents do in Michigan?
Homeowners continue to rely on real estate agents when selling. A recent [Clever survey](https://listwithclever.com/research/what-does-a-realtor-do-2024/) found that 88% of homeowners planning to sell within the next year intend to use a real estate agent and see them as an important part of the process.
The most important advantage of an agent is their ability to increase the home's sale price. Research by the National Association of Realtors indicates that homes sold with an agent typically sell for nearly $100,000 more than those sold by owner.[2]
Full-service real estate agents provide a wide range of helpful services, including:
  * Providing comparative market analysis
  * Developing pricing strategies
  * Listing and marketing properties to attract buyers
  * Negotiating offers and advising the seller on how to proceed
  * Guiding sellers through the closing process


## Next steps
Think you're ready to sell your home? Start by setting up some listing appointments with local agents. During these meetings, an agent will visit your home to discuss its estimated value, lay out their marketing strategy, and provide a quote for their fee.
Here's why it's smart to sit down with a few agents before signing with one:
  * **It's completely free to meet with agents:** There's no obligation or risk on your end. Just keep in mind that the agent is meeting with you to win your business and will try to sell you on their service.
  * **You can compare pricing and features:** Shopping around helps you find the best fit for your specific needs — in terms of fees, experience, and services provided.
  * **Learn more about your market from an expert:** Realtors can provide local data, like how much nearby homes are selling for, how fast they sell, and other current market trends.
  * **Learn about the home sales process:** An agent can walk you through the sales process from start to finish, and provide tailored advice for marketing your property to home buyers.

## Frequently asked questions
###  Who pays for realtor commission in Michigan?
The buyer and seller are ultimately responsible for paying their own agents. However, many sellers offer to pay for the buyer's agent commission. This makes the home more affordable for the buyer, who already has to come up with a down payment. 
###  Is commission included in closing costs?
Real estate commission is not considered a closing cost, even though it's due when the home sells. The term "[closing costs](https://listwithclever.com/closing-costs/)" is typically used to refer to costs like transfer fees, title services, and other taxes due at closing.
###  What is dual agency?
[Dual agency](https://listwithclever.com/dual-agency/) is when one agent represents both the buyer and the seller for the same deal. This can potentially set up a conflict of interest. Dual agency is not legal in eight states: Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming. 
###  What is an "exclusive right to sell" agreement?
Most real estate agents will ask clients to sign an [exclusive right to sell](https://listwithclever.com/exclusive-right-to-sell/) listing agreement—this is the most common type of contract. This type of contract says the seller agrees to work with only one agent, and that agent gets paid when the home sells, even if the seller finds a buyer themselves. 
## Methodology
We gathered our commission rate data from a September 2025 survey of 828 of agents nationwide. The survey asked about standard local rates for both listing and buying agents. These data points are averages based on responses we’ve received from 26 agents in Michigan.
Additionally, we spoke to agents in Michigan about when and why they're willing to negotiate real estate commissions. We also asked [Rick Guerrero](https://dalmatianhomes.com/) of Dalmatian Real Estate in Holland, MI for advice about offering a buyer's agent concession.
Information on market conditions is based on Zillow data as of September 2025, Realtor.com data as of October 2025, and HouseCanary data as of October 31, 2025.
