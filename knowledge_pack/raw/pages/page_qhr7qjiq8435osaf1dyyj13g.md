## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in New York
In New York State, the age on your driver's license is a [key factor](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) in determining the premium you'll pay for car insurance, with gender playing a more minor role in rate-setting. Teens and other drivers under age 25 pay the highest rates, especially if they're male. While some argue this practice may be discriminatory, actuarial data consistently shows a [higher rate of crashes and fatalities](https://www.iihs.org/research-areas/fatality-statistics/detail/teenagers) among young men compared to other groups, which insurers use as a tool to estimate risk.

### Cost considerations for young drivers in New York 
In most cases, staying on a family policy as long as possible — that is, until they move out and have a separate mailing address — is the best way for [young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) to keep their car insurance bills affordable. When the risk associated with young drivers is diffused by more experienced drivers on the policy, the risk-based rate increase is smaller.

## Car insurance rates in New York by credit
Like most states, New York permits insurers to factor an applicant's credit history into the rate they pay for auto insurance. Rather than using your credit score, insurers use a proprietary number called an [insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rates-by-credit-score/) based on data from credit reporting agencies, which is used as an indicator of a driver's likelihood of filing future claims.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in New York?
Caret Down Icon
No single company offers the [best car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for every driver in New York. Depending on your budget, your risk profile and your priorities, there may be a range of carriers with a good fit for your needs. The best way to find your fit is to [compare rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) from multiple companies and research reviews and insights from current customers.
  * ###  What is the average cost of minimum coverage in New York?
Caret Down Icon
State minimum car insurance in New York State costs an average of $148 per month, or $1,773 per year. That's 116 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). New York's minimum coverage rates are so high because the state's minimum coverage requirements are robust compared to other states, and because related costs like collision repair and healthcare may be higher in New York than elsewhere.
  * ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in New York?
Caret Down Icon
Bankrate's analysis of the [cheapest car insurance providers in New York State](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-new-york/) identified Utica National, Progressive and Preferred Mutual as three of the most affordable carriers for the average driver. However, they may not be cheapest for everyone. Remember that your premiums are based on a complex set of calculations that differs from company to company, and you may be eligible for lower rates from an insurer not listed in our analysis.
  * ###  How much insurance is required in New York?
Caret Down Icon
[New York car insurance laws](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/new-york-car-insurance-laws/) require all drivers to carry 25/50/10 liability coverage, along with 50/100 liability benefits for death. On top of liability coverage, all car insurance policies must include $50,000 of personal injury protection (PIP) first-party coverage and $25,000/$50,000 of uninsured motorist coverage. Finally, New York recently added a requirement that all policies include supplemental spousal liability coverage unless the policyholder declines this coverage in writing. While these minimum coverage requirements raise the cost of insurance in New York, [driving without insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/) is a serious offense that could lead to even higher costs later on.
  * ######  How much is car insurance per month in New York?
Caret Down Icon
If you have a full coverage car insurance policy in New York, Bankrate's analysis shows that you'll pay an average of $341 per month to maintain it. Drivers with only state minimum coverage pay an average of $148 per month.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
