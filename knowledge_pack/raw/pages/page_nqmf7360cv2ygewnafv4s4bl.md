## New York’s No-Fault Insurance System
New York operates under a [no-fault insurance](https://888gothurt.com/faqs/what-is-no-fault-insurance/) system, which means that regardless of who is at fault in an accident, your own insurance will cover your medical expenses and certain other losses. This system is designed to streamline the claims process and provide immediate assistance to injured parties.
### Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
One key component of New York’s no-fault system is Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage. This coverage is mandatory for all drivers and is intended to pay for medical bills, lost wages, and other necessary expenses resulting from an auto accident.The minimum required PIP coverage in New York is **$50**
,**000** per person.
### Minimum Insurance Requirements in New York
  * Bodily Injury Liability: **$25** ,**000** for bodily injury to one person and **$50** ,**000** for bodily injury to all persons in an accident.
  * Property Damage Liability: **$10** ,**000** for damage to someone else’s property.
  * Personal Injury Protection (PIP): **$50** ,**000**.


## The Importance of Comprehensive Coverage
When people speak about**car insurance full coverage** , it typically means they have comprehensive coverage in their policy.While meeting the minimum insurance requirements is essential, many drivers opt for additional coverage to protect themselves further. Comprehensive and collision coverage can help cover costs associated with **vehicle repairs** , **theft** , or damages from **non-collision events** like storms or vandalism.

## Seeking Compensation Beyond Insurance Limits
If you find yourself in a situation where your damages exceed the at-fault driver’s insurance limits, there are steps you can take to seek additional compensation. Here are some options to consider:
  * **Underinsured Motorist Coverage** : This optional coverage can help fill the gap if the at-fault driver does not have enough insurance to cover your damages.
  * **Personal Injury Lawsuit** : If your injuries meet the “serious injury” threshold, you may be able to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver. [Our lawyers](https://888gothurt.com/attorneys/) can help you understand your legal options.
  * **Third-Party Claims** : In some cases, other parties may share liability for the accident, allowing you to seek compensation from them as well.


### Understanding the “Serious Injury” Threshold
New York law defines a “serious injury” as one that results in significant impairment or loss of bodily function. This includes:
  * Fractures
  * Significant disfigurement
  * Permanent limitation of use of a body organ or member
  * Significant limitation of use of a body function or system
  * Injuries preventing you from performing your usual daily activities for at least 90 days in the 180 days following the accident
  * Death
  * Loss of a fetus


If your injuries meet this threshold, you may be eligible to pursue a personal injury lawsuit against the at-fault driver.
## The Role of Underinsured Motorist Coverage
Underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) is an optional but highly recommended add-on that provides additional protection.If you’re involved in an accident where the at-fault driver’s insurance limits are insufficient, UIM can help bridge the gap between your damages and what the at-fault driver’s insurance will cover.
### The Benefits of UIM Coverage
  * **Peace of Mind** : Knowing you have additional coverage can alleviate some stress when driving.
  * **Financial Security** : It protects you from significant out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a severe accident.
  * **Flexibility** : You can customize your coverage limits to suit your specific needs.

I was referred to Joel Levine by another attorney on LI. Joel was immediately responsive and took the time to understand my issue. Along the way he guided on what was needed in order to get the best result possible. At the end of the day we won a huge victory! With Joels confidence throughout the process I felt there was never a doubt, but in liability cases you can never be too sure. I definitely had the best representation possible and it absolutely paid off! I highly recommend Levine and Wiss!

I was involved in a car accident that resulted in my car getting totaled. Without a dash cam from either party, my insurance company was ready to throw in the towel. A close friend referred me to Samuel Sheridan. It was no miracle that we won the case with Sam’s support. He is reliable and responsive. I would highly recommend contacting him if you get into any type of accident.
