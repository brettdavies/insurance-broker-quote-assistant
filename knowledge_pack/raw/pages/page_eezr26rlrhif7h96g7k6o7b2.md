##  How does car insurance work?
Depending on your policy, car insurance can cover damages, theft and bodily injury. Policyholders pay premiums on a monthly or biannual basis and are reimbursed for repairs related to covered collisions or other incidents.
There are five basic types of car insurance coverage. You’ll need [liability insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-liability-car-insurance/) to drive in every state except New Hampshire, although many people also add collision and comprehensive coverage.
**Liability coverage:** Pays for  
  
**Collision coverage:** Pays for repairs stemming from a collision with an object, like a house or a mailbox, rather than another vehicle. 
**Comprehensive coverage:** Protects you in case of damages caused by a non-vehicular incident, like theft, vandalism or weather-related damage. 
**Personal injury protection:** Pays for your medical expenses and lost income after an accident. 
**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage:** Kicks in if you are involved in an accident with another driver who has no insurance or insufficient coverage.
##  How much is car insurance?
According to [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/the-true-cost-of-auto-insurance/), the average cost of a full coverage policy in 2025 is $2,638 a year. Rates vary significantly by state, although they are typically higher in those with [no-fault insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/types-of-car-insurance/), such as New York and Michigan.  
  
Your age, gender, driving record and history of claims will influence your individual premiums, as will the make, model and age of your automobile.
##  Why is car insurance so expensive?
Premiums have steadily increased for several reasons, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/why-did-my-auto-insurance-costs-go-up-even-when-i-didnt-file-a-claim), including the rising cost of repairing and replacing vehicles, as well as medical and legal bills.
Cars are also more technologically advanced, and the number and severity of collisions, including fatal crashes, have gone up, according to [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot).   
  
Factors influencing individual premiums include:
  * **Policy type:**[Full coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/) is more expensive than a [liability-only policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-liability-car-insurance/). A low [deductible](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-deductible-car-health-homeowners-renters-insurance/) can also raise the price of your premiums, as can buying add-ons like gap insurance and roadside assistance.
  * **Your location:** Where you live greatly influences how much you’ll pay and, in many states, so will your age, gender and marital status.
  * **Your credit history:** In all but a handful of states, insurance companies can use your [credit-based insurance score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-an-insurance-score/) to tabulate your premium.
  * **Your driving history:** Having an at-fault accident, speeding ticket or DUI on your record makes you a [high-risk driver](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-high-risk-drivers/) and usually results in pricier premiums.
  * **Car make, model and features:** A six-figure sports car will cost more to insure than a used sedan. While replacement costs can factor into this difference, discounts for safety features can also play a part.


##  How to choose the right car insurance company
If you’re shopping for car insurance, consider the following criteria:
### 1. Availability
Not all insurers are licensed in every state or provide the same coverage or discounts nationwide. Be sure what you want is available in your region.
### **2. Coverage options**
Make sure any provider you’re considering has the options you want, whether that’s gap insurance, accident forgiveness or rideshare insurance.
### **3. Customer satisfaction**
[J.D. Power’s surveys](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-j-d-power/) provide insight into customers’ sentiment in key areas, including the level of trust with their insurance company, the price for coverage, the representatives they deal with, the ease of doing business and the helpfulness of a company’s digital channels. You can also see how a company is rated by the Better Business Bureau and the volume of complaints registered by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
### **4. Financial strength**
It’s important that any insurance company you’re considering can pay out on claims. [A.M. Best’s financial strength scores](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-are-am-best-ratings/) indicate the likelihood that an insurer will be able to make good on its financial obligations. Look for companies that score an A or better.
