## What is an Insurance Underwriter?
May 25, 2025
If you’ve ever worked with an independent insurance agent, you’ve likely heard the phrase, “subject to underwriting approval.” But what does that really mean—and who is the underwriter making those decisions?
An **insurance underwriter** is the person responsible for evaluating risk and determining whether an insurance company can offer you coverage, under what conditions, and at what price. They’re a critical part of the insurance process, quietly working behind the scenes to make sure both the customer and the company are protected.
**In this article, we dive into some of the specifics of an underwriter’s role, and explore how** **the underwriting team at Central has made a name for themselves as experts in the industry.**
### What Does an Insurance Underwriter Do?
At a high level, underwriters:
  * Review applications submitted by agents
  * Analyze information about the person, property, or business to be insured
  * Assess potential risks using data, past loss history, and inspections
  * Determine the appropriate coverage, terms, and premium
  * Communicate with the agent to tailor the policy based on what’s best for the customer and the company
  * Develop and foster relationships with agents and insureds


Underwriters play a key role in making sure policyholders are covered when they need it most without exposing the insurance company to unsustainable risk.
### Types of Insurance Underwriters
Underwriters specialize in different lines of insurance, each with its own risks and requirements:
  * **Personal Lines Underwriters** handle home, auto, renters, and other personal insurance.
  * **Commercial Lines Underwriters** work with insurance for businesses, from small shops to large manufacturing operations.
  * **Life and Health Underwriters** assess individual health and lifestyle factors to determine eligibility and pricing for life or medical policies.


Every business is different, and an underwriter’s job is to understand each risk and customize coverage that fits, not just at the present moment but as the business grows.
### A Day in the Life of a Commercial Underwriter
At Central, Commercial Lines Underwriters focus on protecting businesses by reviewing policy applications, analyzing operations, and evaluating risk factors like property condition, payroll, and claims history.
Here’s what that typically involves:
  1. **Application Review** : Examine the details submitted by the agent.
  2. **Validation & Research**: Verify accuracy of the information, request inspections, and pull supporting data.
  3. **Risk Assessment** : Consider prior claims, industry trends, and safety measures.
  4. **Coverage Customization** : Collaborate with the agent to make informed recommendations or offer alternative options.
  5. **Pricing** : Calculate the premium based on the risk level and coverage selected.

### The Skills Behind the Role
Most insurance underwriters hold a degree in fields like business, finance, insurance and risk management, or actuarial science. But the job also calls for strong analytical thinking, communication skills, and a deep understanding of risk.

### Where Underwriting and a Policyholder Intersect
Whether you’re a commercial client insuring your business or an individual insuring your property or car, you or your agent will likely interact with an underwriter when creating your policy. These trained professionals step in during this early step in the process to make sure it can be properly insured and offer guidance that protects your financial future.
Underwriting may happen behind the scenes, but the decisions made at that stage shape the protection you’ll receive when it matters most.
### Specialized Construction Underwriting at Central
Central Insurance has developed a dedicated construction underwriting team that brings deep industry knowledge to the table. This team includes specialists like [Matt Sbordone](https://bit.ly/Central-MattSbordone) and [Brian Shaffer](https://bit.ly/Central-BrianShaffer), who focus on tailoring coverage for contractors and construction businesses.
> “Our commitment to large construction isn’t a short-term play; it’s a strategic investment to serve this market for years to come,” says [Scott Zemberi](https://bit.ly/Central-ScottZemberi), Director of Construction Underwriting at Central Insurance. “We built a strategy for sustainable, long-term growth in large construction. That consistency makes us a reliable market for these complex risks.”
This specialization ensures that clients receive insurance solutions that are aligned with the unique risks and needs of the construction sector.
#### Proactive Loss Control Collaboration
Central’s underwriting process is complemented by a proactive [loss control team](https://bit.ly/Central-RiskManagementProcess) that works closely with policyholders to identify and mitigate potential risks. Central’s Loss Control Construction Specialists, including [Jim Johnson](https://bit.ly/Central-JimJohnson) and [Shawn Gentry](https://bit.ly/Central-ShawnGentry), conduct on-site evaluations to develop customized risk management programs. 
This collaborative approach between underwriters and loss control experts helps clients implement effective safety measures, reducing the likelihood of claims and enhancing overall operational safety.
#### Expertise in Complex Construction Risks
Central’s underwriters are adept at handling [complex construction risks](https://bit.ly/Central-ConstructionRisks2025), including those associated with large-scale projects. They utilize tools like the Individual Risk Premium Modification (IRPM) factor to adjust premiums based on specific business risk levels, ensuring fair and accurate pricing.
This level of expertise allows Central to offer nuanced insurance solutions that reflect the intricacies of each construction project.
### Work with Central Insurance
At Central, underwriting isn’t a one-size-fits-all process—it’s a relationship. Our underwriters work hand-in-hand with agents, policyholders, and our in-house loss control specialists to design coverage that truly fits. 
Whether you’re insuring your first home or managing a complex construction portfolio, we don’t just write policies—we build protection around what matters most to you.
“Our goal is to be the most engaged and relationship-driven carrier in the space,” Shaffer says. “We want our policyholders to see us as a partner who truly understands their business—not just another insurance provider.”
We invest deeply in our people so they can invest in you. Through continuous learning and specialized training—especially in complex areas like construction—our underwriters stay on top of emerging risks, changing regulations, and evolving coverage strategies. 
As Zemberi puts it, “We’re committed to growing our expertise so we can be the best partners possible for our agents and insureds.”
From proactive risk management to tailored policy design, our integrated approach ensures you’re getting more than just a piece of paper—you’re gaining a trusted advisor. That’s the Central Difference: experienced, responsive underwriting that delivers confidence today and security for the road ahead.

I would add a couple of items to the above-list. Many accounts which generate larger premiums will require the underwriter to work closely with the loss control person once an inspection is made. This requires good communication.  
Also, often the communication with the claims dept. can be critical when identifying a loss problem or the potential for further losses.  
As a former commercial underwriter, I found it critical for underwriting, loss control and claims to be able to maintain and promote communication between the departments within the company and to do the same with the independent agents handling their accounts. Successful underwriting is a partnership.
