# Does renters insurance cover hotel stay?
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Explore how renters insurance may assist with hotel stays during challenging times and provide support when your home becomes uninhabitable. 
Imagine coming home to find your apartment flooded due to a burst pipe. In moments like these, [renters insurance](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/renters) can provide financial support. If your claim is approved and your rental is uninhabitable, it may help cover your hotel stay and other expenses while repairs are underway. Whether your [landlord requires it](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/is-renters-insurance-required) or a near-miss [tornado](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-to-do-in-a-tornado) prompts you to purchase it, renters insurance is a smart investment to help protect yourself from the unexpected.
## Does renters insurance cover temporary housing?
Renters insurance may help cover temporary housing if your rental is rendered uninhabitable due to a covered loss. Loss of use or additional living expenses (ALE) coverage pays for temporary housing until you can return to your rental or move into a new one. Typically, your temporary housing should be comparable to the unit you are renting. Loss of use coverage is subject to the limits outlined in your policy. Check your policy’s maximum payout for temporary housing and other expenses.
## Does renters insurance cover hotel stays?
Renters insurance may cover hotel stays through loss of use coverage if your residence is uninhabitable due to a covered loss, such as fire or water damage. Examples of situations where renters insurance may cover hotel stays include:
  * **Fire** — if a fire damages your apartment, making it unsafe for you to stay, renters insurance may cover a hotel stay.
  * **Vandalism or theft-related damage** — if vandalism or theft leaves your rental uninhabitable (ex: someone breaks in and damages your doors or windows), your policy may cover a temporary hotel stay.
  * **Plumbing failures** — if a burst pipe floods your apartment, forcing you to relocate temporarily, renters insurance may cover these expenses.


## What are additional living expenses?
When your rental unit is rendered temporarily uninhabitable due to a covered peril, renters insurance covers additional living expenses. Additional living expenses might include staying in a hotel, dining out, laundry services, storage fees or even pet boarding if your furry friends can’t stay with you.
Living in temporary housing often leads to higher food and transportation costs compared to your usual expenses. If staying in a temporary location or hotel increases your commute or causes you to dine at restaurants for meals, your plan will likely reimburse the extra expenses you incur up to your coverage limits.
When you're back in your dwelling, does renters insurance cover refrigerator food loss? It's possible. If the [food in your refrigerator is spoiled](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/food-spoilage) due to a [power outage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/power-outage-tips) or failed appliance, it may be covered under your policy.
## What does renters insurance not cover?
Although renters insurance covers a wide range of damages, there may be some exclusions in your policy. Here are a few commonly known ones:
  * **Damage to your landlord’s property** — items owned by a landlord, such as appliances or the building structure, aren’t typically covered by your policy. However, your [liability](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/what-is-individual-liability-insurance-and-what-does-it-cover) coverage might pay for repairs if you caused the damage by accident.
  * **Car theft or damage** — if your [car is stolen](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/preventing-car-theft) or damaged, renters insurance won’t cover it. Instead, you’ll need an [auto insurance policy](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto).
  * **Earthquakes and floods** — natural disasters like [earthquakes](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/do-you-need-earthquake-insurance) and [floods](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/do-i-need-flood-insurance) are excluded. In these cases, specialized insurance policies are required.
  * **Intentional acts or negligence** — damages caused by intentional acts or lack of proper care won’t be covered.


Renters insurance offers more than just protection for your belongings. It can cover temporary housing costs like hotel stays, as well as additional expenses such as food delivery and laundry, offering support when you need it. By understanding your policy and [exploring coverage options](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-much-renters-insurance-do-i-need), you can help ensure you’re prepared for the unexpected.
