When you shop around for an auto policy, the insurance company will consider your driving record as one of many factors determining your rates. You'll usually pay less for insurance if you have a clean driving record, which often means you don't have a history of accidents, moving violations, and driving-related convictions. That's because a clean record indicates less risk. 
But state laws and insurance companies sometimes differ in their answer to the question, "What is a clean driving record?" Knowing how insurers in your state determine whether you've got a clean record or not can help you make sure you keep your record clear and your premiums affordable. It could also prevent you from messing up your spouse's insurance coverage someday, as you'll see below.

## What is a clean driving record?
A clean driving record can mean different things, depending on the laws where you live and how your insurer defines a clean record. Here are a few state-specific examples. 
  * [Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/part-iv-my-driving-record) gives insurance companies the authority to determine what constitutes a clean record but specifies that this is usually "based on years of incident-free driving." Incidents include accidents and traffic violations. However, insurers can't consider accidents or traffic violations that are more than six years old (based on your policy's start date) or raise your premium for such violations for over five years. 
  * [North Carolina](https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/offices-services/records-reports/Pages/driving-records.aspx) says that a driving record includes motor vehicle-related convictions, driver control actions such as a failure to yield, and information on traffic wrecks. A clean record would show you do not have any of these failures or crashes on your report.
  * [Montana](https://mvdmt.gov/driving-records/) notes that items on your record could include "convictions, sanctions, and motor vehicle accident history," so a clean record would have none of those issues. It also clarifies that insurance rates shouldn't increase for convictions (including a DUI) that are more than three years old, but additional DUI convictions can have an effect for a longer five-year period. 


While states have broad rules for what is included on a driving record and sometimes limit how long an insurer can consider information about past problems, the reality is that insurance companies have considerable leeway in setting their _own_ definitions of a clean driving record. 
### How insurance companies define a clean driving record
Insurance companies typically consider a clean driving record to be one that is free of problems like: 
  * **Accidents:** While not-at-fault accidents can also impact your rates, insurers especially consider at-fault accidents in which you were the one to blame for the crash and resulting losses.
  * **Moving violations:** These include speeding, running a red light, failing to yield, and other dangerous driving offenses. Insurers usually don't count non-moving violations (such as parking tickets or broken tail light citations) since they don't impact your ability to drive safely.
  * **Driving-related convictions:** Examples include driving recklessly, driving without a valid license, getting a DUI, or being responsible for a hit-and-run.


Most of the time, insurers want to see a record free of these issues for the last three to five years. That's because recent violations on your record raise a red flag, suggesting you may be an unsafe driver and thus may be more likely to [file an accident claim](https://financebuzz.com/car-insurance-claim-steps). 
Since insurers price policies based on the risk of a claim, car insurance premiums will increase if you have negative items on your record. Generally, the more serious the violation — especially things like a major accident or a DUI conviction — the bigger the premium increase. 
### How to check your record
Your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), Department of Transportation (DOT), or Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) maintains your driving record and typically will provide you with a copy if you request it. Here are some examples. 
  * The [Pennsylvania DOT](https://appsca.pwp.pa.gov/idr) allows you to print your driving record.
  * The [California DMV](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/customer-service/request-vehicle-or-driver-records/online-driver-record-request/) has an online system for driver's records requests.
  * The [Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Department](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/general-information/questions-about-driving-records/) gives you the option to check a driving record for free online or to purchase a three-year, seven-year, or complete driving record.


You'll need to determine which state department maintains these records as it can go by different names in different places. Usually, it's the department that has authority over issuing driver's licenses. Once you've found the right one, you may be able to request your record online, by mail, or in person. You may have to pay a small fee to get the copy provided to you.

## How a clean driving record affects insurance rates
Years ago, my friend got married to someone who had more than a few speeding tickets on his driving record. Since they were married, she tried to add him as an authorized driver on her car insurance policy. Unfortunately, as soon as the insurer saw his ticket history, her premiums soared. 
The problem: While my friend had a clean driving record, her husband did not. The insurer explained how important a driving record is in setting price, and my friend ended up signing a bunch of papers to exclude her husband from her coverage. He also could never drive her car. 
As you've seen, a clean driving record is one of many [factors affecting insurance rates](https://financebuzz.com/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates). Insurers also look at the big picture, including things like your location, marital status, and age. 
Ultimately, though, the goal is to set premiums based on the risk of an accident. Problems on your driving record can be one of the clearest indicators that you're an unsafe driver and likely to become involved in a crash. 
Since this issue is so important to insurers, there are significant differences in premiums for someone with a clean record versus someone with blemishes on their driving record. The table below shows how much of an impact different incidents can have on monthly premiums. 
**Driving record** |  **Average monthly liability-only premium** |  **Average monthly full coverage premium**  
---|---|---  
Clean  | $104  | $186   
Driving incident  | $123  | $221   
DUI  | $151  | $270   
At-fault accident  | $136  | $244   
Speeding ticket  | $131  | $235   
Data provided by [Insurify](https://insurify.com/)  
As you can see, you'll pay almost 61% more for full coverage if you have a DUI than if you have a clean record. A DUI has the biggest impact on premiums because driving drunk is so dangerous. In fact, the [National Highway Traffic Safety Institute](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving) makes clear that an impaired driver with a 0.08 BAC has four times the chances of a collision compared to a sober driver while a driver with a 0.15 BAC is at least 12 times more likely to have an accident. 
## Tips for maintaining a clean record
My friend's experience shows just how much your driving history matters. Since maintaining a clean record can save you a lot of money, aim to ensure your driving history remains free of red flags. Some of the steps you can take to do that include: 
  * **Following traffic laws:** If you're obeying the law, you're less likely to cause a collision or get a moving violation.
  * **Being an overall safe driver who avoids distractions and is defensive:** Texting, eating while driving, or doing any kind of multitasking can increase your crash risk. Make sure you focus solely on the road and drive defensively to react to the behaviors of others. Taking a defensive driving course may help you learn techniques to stay safe. 
  * **Maintaining the vehicle to avoid potential accidents:** Taking care of vehicle maintenance issues like worn-out brakes, tires with low tread, or damaged windshield wipers can help you avoid a crash caused by car problems.
  * **Taking a defensive driving course or going to traffic school to remove points:** If you get a moving violation, you can sometimes avoid getting points on your license or have existing points removed if you agree to go to driving school.
  * **Contesting tickets when there's a good reason:** When you get a ticket, you can challenge it. You'll need a good reason why the ticket isn't valid, though. 
  * **Disputing errors on driving records with the state:** If there's a mistake on your driving record, you can dispute the error with the state to get it removed. Check with your local department to find out how.

## Other ways to keep car insurance costs low
Maintaining a clean driving record can help you reduce insurance costs, but it's not the only option. Here are other ways to keep your car insurance expenses as affordable as possible. 
  * **Taking advantage of telematics programs:** Many insurers offer the opportunity to take part in a [telematics program](https://financebuzz.com/telematics-programs-car-insurance-discounts) to reduce premiums. These programs monitor your driving and reward you for safe behaviors. Some insurers offer discounts just for enrolling. 
  * **Looking for various discount options:** Many insurers offer discounts for things like taking a defensive driving course, adding certain safety features to your car, or working for a specific employer. Ask your insurer about available discounts to make sure you're taking advantage of all opportunities to save.
  * **Comparing quotes from at least three insurers:** Getting quotes from multiple insurers will help you confirm you're paying the best possible price for coverage. For example, if you're looking for [cheap high-risk car insurance](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-bad-driving-record) because you _don't_ have a clean driving record, some insurers charge _much_ higher premiums than others for tickets or DUIs. 
  * **Removing unnecessary coverage types:** You pay for each kind of coverage you have. In some situations, you may be able to remove unnecessary coverages. If you have an old car that's not worth much, for example, you might not need collision or comprehensive coverage. 
  * **Increasing deductibles and lowering coverage limits:** The higher your deductible and the lower your coverage limits, the lower your premiums will be. However, you're taking on more risk, so you could pay more out of pocket if a crash happens. Still, you might decide that facing the potential threat of a larger future bill is worth it to get lower premiums on an ongoing basis. 


## FAQs
### Why is my insurance so high if I have a clean record?
Insurance costs are based on many factors. Not only do insurers consider your driving record, but they also look at factors like your age, location, marital status, and vehicle choice. If you're a very young driver with limited experience or you have a very expensive car, these are potential reasons for high costs.
### How long do accidents last on a driving record?
Auto accidents typically stay on your record for three to five years, but the rules can vary by state. In Massachusetts, for example, insurers can consider accidents for up to six years when setting auto insurance premiums. 
### How can I clean up my driving record?
You can clean up your driving record by taking a defensive driving course to remove points and by contesting tickets you don't think are legitimate. If you have errors on your record, you can also ask your state to correct them. 
But if there are accidents or moving violations on your record because you actually did crash or get a ticket, you'll simply have to wait for those negative pieces of information to drop off your record over time and avoid similar issues in the future.
