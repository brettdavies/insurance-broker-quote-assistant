Raising a child is expensive enough, and high car insurance premiums for young drivers just add insult to injury. While students may be tempted to lower their car insurance coverage to save some money on their premiums, there are other ways students can get cheap car insurance without taking the risk with lower coverage.
Many of the most popular [auto insurance](https://clovered.com/auto-insurance/) providers offer discounts specifically for students. Popular discounts for students, such as a good student insurance discount, [good driver discount](https://clovered.com/good-driver-discount/), [student away discount](https://clovered.com/do-i-have-to-keep-insurance-on-a-car-i-dont-drive/), or an affiliation discount, may discount your premiums by up to 50% when combined. Keep reading to learn about these car insurance discounts for students and to figure out which discounts may apply to you.
## How Much Is a Good Student Discount for Car Insurance? 
Auto insurance for students and young drivers is typically very high because new drivers tend to be the riskiest drivers companies insure. When calculating your premiums, car insurance agencies take into account your [age](https://clovered.com/what-age-does-car-insurance-go-down/), [gender](https://clovered.com/which-gender-pays-more-for-car-insurance/), the type of car you drive, where you live, and [several other factors](https://clovered.com/factors-that-affect-car-insurance-rates/). While these premiums will [stay high until your student or young driver gets older](https://clovered.com/why-is-my-auto-insurance-so-high/) and builds a driving record, there are several discounts they may qualify for to lower your premiums.
A good student discount on your car insurance policy can discount your premium by up to 25%, depending on your provider and where you live. While some providers offer a car insurance discount for students with high academic achievements, some don’t.
