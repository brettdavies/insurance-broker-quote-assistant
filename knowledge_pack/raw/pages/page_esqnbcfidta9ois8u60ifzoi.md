You can get Bankers through Todd.  
  
And MM is part of MM Ohio. You can go direct with them.  
  
Both show up 1 & 2 on CSG in Texas.

I am appointed direct with them . . . no FMO. It's that way with all my carriers.  
  
UW apps are usually processed in a few days. They pull Rx history & Milliman medical report before sending it to underwriting. Sometimes they do phone interviews.
