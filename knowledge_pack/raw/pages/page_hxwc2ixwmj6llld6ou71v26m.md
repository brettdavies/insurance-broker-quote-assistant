I was in an accident almost a year ago. I am suppose to be covered for lost wages. I started getting some money in March, not the 70%. So now GEICO is holding my pay (what they shorted me since December - August) for some reason. They have all info needed. They don't care if because they shorted or not payed you that you are ready to lose everything. Housing, utilities, no gas to get to Dr appointments. I have not received anything since August and that was $297.00. I payed into gieco for 3-4 years for exactly this circumstance. But do they return the services they say ? No. I am filing complaint through the regulatory commission.

This is one of the worst company I have to deal with in comes to “claims” . Every time we call even giving them the claim number still, we have to explain every single time of the whole situation.. finally we got hold of a person who knew what he was doing, C William . But with geico policy he can’t do anything to help us . We asked for the supervisor but never got to talk to that person. Geico wants us to pay out-of-pocket first for them to reimburse and we explained that we don’t have resources to do that. So frustrating trying to deal with them.. no wonder no RV rental company is willing to work directly with them.

GEICO’s handling of my claim has been nothing short of disgraceful. After being hit by their insured — who made an illegal U-turn from the right lane — I’ve spent over $11,000 out-of-pocket to cover damages, medical needs, and rental expenses. GEICO has yet to reimburse me, let alone pay out to their own insured’s policy limits, despite being fully aware that my losses far exceed that amount.  
  
Their tactic has been consistent: stall, deflect responsibility (They admit it, but their actions are the opposite), and avoid accountability. Communication isn’t just slow — it’s strategically delayed. I’ve been told conflicting information by multiple representatives, some of which was blatantly untrue. Because of this, I’ve had to document everything in writing and refuse to communicate through their one-way recorded lines designed to protect them, not the customer.  
  
I’ve suffered physical injuries (wrist, hand, lower back, neck) and continue to deal with the emotional trauma of the crash — including heightened anxiety on the road. Every time I drive, I brace for another reckless driver making an illegal move, because the lasting psychological impact is real — and unacknowledged by GEICO.  
  
To make matters worse, I explicitly requested that all communication be done via email for accountability, and GEICO has ignored that too. I’ve never experienced a company so determined to avoid doing the right thing, and I would caution anyone considering them: you don’t really know your insurance company until you need them.

Geico recently increased my auto policy with no warning. When I contacted them asking why? I was informed it wasn't anything we did, the cost increase had to do with electric car claims that was costing GEICO money. I don't drive or own an electric car. Why are we being charged? Again Geico representative indicated that nothing we did was the reason for the increase, that they needed to raise the rates across the board to offset the claims.   
  
I basically am being charged a higher amount because geico has allot of claims they can't pay out. How is this legal?   
  
I'm still a geico customer, but, I'm shopping for a new insurance company. I'm beyond disappointed with Geico.   
I have been a loyal customer since the 1980s. Now, I'm not.

## [Complaint- GEICO Insurance ](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68652a41095fecc5009caf22)
I had auto insurance coverage through GEICO for approximately 3 years. My initial monthly premium for full coverage was $68.00/month. GEICO steadily continued increasing my premium over the three years with them until it reached $98.00 before the new renewal period. I still do not know why. In January 2025, I was involved in a minor collision, but no police report was filed. Instead, we exchanged insurance information only. I decided against submitting a claim, as I was concerned about potential increases to my premium. The other driver did file a claim, and GEICO paid out $4000. The other driver's car had no visible damage. My vehicle sustained visible damage. I chose not to file a claim as I was concerned about potential increases in my premium. Nevertheless, at renewal time in June 2025, GEICO significantly increased my premium from $98.00 to $150.00 per month for the same coverage I have maintained for the past 3 years. This is an abusive practice that is condoned by lawmakers, allowing insurance carriers to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of consumers. It appears that my insurance payments are protecting the company's interests rather than my own. Now this claim will remain on my record for the next three years, affecting all subsequent quotes. The premiums I have been quoted are directly based on this claim. I dropped GEICO, but I am paying a slightly lower amount with another carrier. I sent a complaint letter to its president, and I intend to contact other relevant agencies as well with this issue.

## [Don't Let Geico's Commericals Fool You](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/68367ec453ada3a4fe861a2a)
I obtained GEICO because of its television commercials completely unaware that who they portray themselves to be on television is the antithesis of who they are as an insurance company, as a professional entity, or as a business. They customer service representatives and adjusters are troglodytes, completely brutish, and easily defer questions asked, to other departments.   
  
On Monday, 5/19/2025, I filed a claim via Geico's website, reporting that I had been involved in a collision while driving home. The accident occurred at about 12:15 a.m. I was the sole occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident. I struck a utility pole and was later driven to an emergency room at Dignity Health Hospital where I was monitored until approximately 2 pm. I was informed that I suffered a fractured nose and it was thought that I passed out while driving as a result of a syncope. Because I struck a utility pole, I was concerned that the city may demand I pay for the damages.   
  
On 5/20/2025, I retrieved a voicemail a Geico adjuster named Roman who invited me to return his call if I had any questions. I called twice that day and left messages but never received a return call from Roman.   
  
On 5/22/2025, Roman called to advise me that he sent documents pertaining to the amount of settlement. I told him I received and reviewed these but was concerned because I struck and damaged a utility pole and secondly, because I fractured me nose. He brushed me off explaining that he was only responsible for assessing the damage to my vehicle and issuing a settlement amount. He suggested I call the claims department. I could not comprehend how an adjuster assigned to a claim and one whose job is to provide customer service could not have said he would research my questions and call me back with answers to my concerns   
  
On Friday, May 23, 2025, my nose began to hemorrhage and paramedics transported me to the ER at St. Joseph Hospital in Burbank, CA. Blood clots in each nostril caused by the accident, had burst and silver nitrate was applied to stop the incessant bleeding. I lost a lot of blood.   
  
On Saturday, 5/25/2025, Geico sent me an email requesting additional information pertaining to my injuries and any damages caused by the collision. I submitted copies of documents given to me on 5/19/2025 at the time I was released by Dignity Hospital and those issued to me on 5/24/2025, by St. Joseph Hospital. I also submitted photos of the damaged utility pole.   
  
On Saturday, 5/25/2025, Sunday, 5/26/2025, and Monday, 5/27/2025, I received emails requesting I sign the settlement forms. Using my Geico app, which by the way is a poorly designed schematic that limits communication to the company, I noted I would sign the agreement but a message informed me that I neededf an authorization number to complete the process.   
  
I called Geico and spoke to Elizabeth. She reviewed y claim and said, "You don't have medical coverage on your policy." When I advised her that I had previously requested verification if damage to the utility pole could be covered under my policy, she replied, "You have damaged property coverage." Of course her response fails to explain what I should do should the city demand I pay for damages to the utility pole. I asked if I was to sign a settlement agreement but she said that was not necessary. I asked if I would have to surrender title of my automobile She said I may have to but that she did not know.   
  
In the late afternoon, I received a letter from Alex F in the Claims Department. The letter is dated 5/20/2025, the day following the accident and before Geico received any of my medical documentation. In his letter, Alex states that the accident was caused because I "fell asleep." That is incorrect and inconsistent with the documents provided by Dignity Health Hospital. I called Geico and spoke to Hideto who placed me on hold while he asked his supervisor if the cause of the accident could be changed. After awaiting 10-minutes, my call was abruptly terminated. I called back and spoke to Jasmine who provided telephone number 808.591.5722 and suggested I call it should I be disconnected when she transferred my call. My call was terminated when she transferred me and I called the number she provided and spoke to Gordon who said Jasmine should not have transferred me to his department. He then said he would request someone call me sometime today.

I can see how many ppl are disappointed in Geico. I have had geico for years. I have 2 policy's as we live in 2 states. We live in our RV part of the yr in Alabama And also in Utah. About a month ago a severe storm damaged the ac in our rv. I have full coverage with comprehensive on all our things. After the claim and not hearing back for weeks I finally got ahold of an adjuster just to tell me my claim was denied. So I went higher. He told me that they had put down all kinds of damages to the rv and enhanced the claim 🤬. One was water damage which we had no water damage and one was we didn't maintenance our ac. Wtf. We have everything maintained every year consistently... well then was told because our rv is 10 yrs old (we bought new)that it is normal for the ac to just go out and that it would not be covered. Again wtf why would I have comprehensive on it. Again I have had Geico for years and now I'm changing insurance's. It's all BS when they do u dirty.... my suggestion would be look for another insurance. Do NOT go with Geico. As u can see all the bad reviews.

My car was broken into a few days ago during the weekend. When I filed a claim, I was sent a link for a web based “photo inspection” of the damage. Unfortunately, the link failed and there was no one to resend it as it was outside of normal business hours. I didn’t receive a new one until after I had taken my car in for repairs. I reached out multiple times and it came down the being told that I was basically out of luck since there was no way to do the inspection after the repairs had been completed and they will not accept photos taken outside of that one website. Basically, good luck if anything fails outside of normal business hours and you actually want to get your car fixed in a reasonable time. I’m having to pay out of pocket for everything despite having photos of the damage, a police reports number and paying monthly for years.

## [THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEY ONLY "CHARGE" IMPROPERLY!!!](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67e63bae8eca3c9aa8fab29b)
THEY HONESTLY DON'T DESERVE A SINGLE STAR! IT'S THE WORST INSURANCE COMPANY I'VE EVER DEALED WITH! When I've made changes to my policy and received a quote, they never apply the agreed-upon cost! I always find surprises that have changed everything in their favor! And when I try to communicate after long waits! They have their employees trained to "steal" and never admit their mistakes! Today I went through a horrible experience that took me most of the day and no one resolved anything for me. Additionally, I requested, as many other times, to speak with "supervisors" who also don't help at all. Furthermore, when they communicate, they do nothing! I have always had to communicate again and ask for the attention of a "manager" even then absurdly I have to wait up to 48 hours for a response. IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF COMMON SENSE!!! Today I had to contact more than three people by phone and more than five via chat, and I couldn't resolve my issue! I will never recommend them! They don't care about their customers at all!

## [Geico Spend Money On Answering Phone Instead Of Commercials!!!](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/67b12022280ba1b69b6e08f5)
Terrible insurance company, worst i ever used!!! I have been saying for years now, if you really want an accurate rating of how a business operates, you do not just grade them on how well they do in the beginning, because thats the initial, "I want to give you my money and my business phase"! No, no, you rate them on how well they handle if a problem should arise later on. And Geico is terrible! I am insured with them, sadly enough, and i tried to get assistance for a 3rd party who is also insured with Geico. Worst customer service! No one answers phone, there is no live chat, there is no message system, the virtual assistant sucks, and i cant even look up the claim i filed 2 days ago because their system online sucks as well! We are both now looking for a better insurance company, but i would avoid Geico, they suck. I NEVER post personal feelings or post anything to do with something that happened to myself. i only post reviews when its a problem that affects everyone that uses this company. There is no one that would accept this kind of service and be okay with it. In fact, they are so bad that since i have to wait until Monday to actually get any assistance, i have to pay every day that the tow company stores the wreckeed vehicle, which means i am losing money because of their poor customer service not beijng available to answer the phone on weekends. And who ever heard of an insurance company not answering on weekends, thats when people drive the most, on their days off. If you have Geico and decide to keep them, good luck, hope you dont need assistance like roadside assistance, you will never reach anyone at that place!!!

## [I have been with GEICO since 2016](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6776e1a22de573e844385d3c)
I have been with GEICO since 2016. I lowered my premiums in February 2024 once my Truck was paid off. Geico added a driver (minor) to my policy that tripled the cost with nothing more than an email.. When contacting them they demanded that I provide proof that a Driver I do not know has other insurance.. I estimate that GEICO stole about $1000.00 from me. I believe this is an intentional tactic.. They are an unethical and fraudulent company.. Avoid this outfit.

Sold me a car insurance policy that I could not cancel. They are completely crooked not stipulating up front the details of their policies when instead they bait you with lower pricing. I can't understand why they get to operate above the law and haven't been challenged about it. Well I plan on giving them a challenge over this that they won't be very happy about. Don't do business with this deceitful organization, in fact BOYCOTT them.

GEICO is a criminal enterprise who commits check and wire fraud, forgery, falsifying statements, operates in the State of California illegally by doing everything they can to damage your vehicle during repairs to an unauthorized repair shop, using Salvaged parts that now make the car completely unsafe on the road ways. If you respect quality in repairs, this is not a company you want backing you during the worst time such as an accident. They will do everything within their power to rob you and your car by committing all kinds of wire and check fraud while depriving you of the rights to repair, to select the shop of you choice, and condoning illegal activities by the Adjusters who are not authorized nor licensed to operate within the State of California. Plus the adjusters do not come out and asses your vehicle as GEICO steps over dollars to save pennies, while forcing every person into a lawsuit as they can fight indefinitely and consider it nothing more than a tax write off. Be warned or you will be getting stiffed.

## [Say it's the cheapest option, but super expensive won't give back my money.](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/676234f36a67a3fc784fa9ce)
Took them forever to send me my insurance information. I asked for a cheaper plan, they said that 1,080 for first payment and $500 for the following months was the cheapest. They kept $220 of it after I canceled only had them for just over a week. I called and they said they couldn't change canceled plans. That I couldn't get my money back and that it was the right amount to pay for a week of having thier insurance.

They purposely use false credit information in order to charge americans even more money, while making record profits.  
As a jersey italian, im honestly a little jealous of their legal extortion.

I had both my house and vehicle insured with them. They are now threatening to drop my home insurance due to a questionable finding about a roof shingle from an inspection, and they’re refusing to insure my Tesla.
