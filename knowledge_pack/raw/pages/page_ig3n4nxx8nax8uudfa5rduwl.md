California drivers, take note! Starting January 1, 2025, a new law will raise the minimum liability insurance requirements for all vehicle owners. This change, enacted through Senate Bill 1107, aims to ensure greater financial protection for all road users. Here’s a breakdown of what this means for you and your auto insurance policy.

**What Are the Current Minimum Liability Limits?** Currently, California law mandates that vehicle owners carry a minimum liability insurance of:
  * $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident for bodily injury.
  * $5,000 per accident for property damage. These limits are often expressed as 15/30/5.


**What Changes with Senate Bill 1107?** Effective January 1, 2025, the minimum liability insurance limits will increase to:
  * $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident for bodily injury.
  * $15,000 per accident for property damage. These new limits are known as 30/60/15.


**How Will This Affect Your Insurance Policy?** If your current liability coverage is below 30/60/15, your insurance provider should automatically adjust your policy to meet these new minimums when it’s time for renewal. This change will lead to an increase in your insurance premium.
In addition, if your uninsured motorists’ coverage is below the minimum permitted by California law, your policy should be updated to meet the required coverage at your next renewal. You’ll receive updated policy documents reflecting these changes without any other alterations to the terms of your auto policy.
**What’s Next?** Your revised policy documents should be provided at the time of renewal. Updated information on these new limits should become available on your insurance carrier’s website starting from today, November 7, 2024, and will apply to policies effective from January 1, 2025, or later.
**Plan Ahead** To avoid any surprises, it’s wise to review your current policy coverage now and speak with your insurance agent. Ensuring that your coverage meets the new requirements can help you stay informed and prepared for potential premium changes.
Take the time to review your auto insurance policy today and reach out to your agent with any questions or concerns regarding these upcoming changes.
