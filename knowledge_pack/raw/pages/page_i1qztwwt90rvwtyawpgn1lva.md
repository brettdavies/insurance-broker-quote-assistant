#### The Importance of Uninsured Motorist Coverage in New York
In 2022, an estimated 10.8 percent of [New York drivers](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists) were uninsured. This staggering fact supports the need for uninsured motorist coverage for the average New York driver. When it comes to car insurance, many drivers focus on basic coverage requirements and overlook the value of additional protections, such as uninsured motorist coverage.
In New York, where motor vehicle accidents are unfortunately common, having this coverage is essential for protecting yourself and your family. Whether you’re involved in an auto accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver, this coverage can ensure that you don’t have to bear the financial burden of medical costs, lost wages, and other expenses that arise from such incidents.
If you’ve been involved in a car accident, don’t hesitate to get help. [**Contact**](https://hillmoin.com/contact/)**a[New York car accident lawyer](https://hillmoin.com/car-accident-lawyer/) at Hill & Moin for a free consultation. Our experienced [personal injury attorneys](https://hillmoin.com/) can evaluate your unique case for free and explain how we can assist you. **
## Underinsured Motorist Coverage vs. Uninsured Motorist Coverage
Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage helps to cover expenses such as medical costs, lost wages, and property damage when the at-fault driver doesn’t have adequate insurance to cover your losses. While both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage protects you in the event of an accident, they differ in how they handle the situation.
Uninsured driver coverage applies when the at-fault driver doesn’t have any auto insurance at all. On the other hand, underinsured driver coverage comes into play when the at-fault driver has insurance, but their coverage limits are insufficient to cover your expenses fully. Which type of coverage may come into play depends on the circumstances surrounding your accident.
For example, if you are in a car accident with an underinsured driver who only has the minimum coverage required by New York law, but your medical bills far exceed their coverage limits, underinsured driver coverage can help you recover the remaining costs.
These are both important aspects of your auto insurance policy to ensure you have sufficient protection in the event of an accident involving an uninsured or underinsured motorist.
## The Role of Liability Insurance and Bodily Injury Liability Coverage
When it comes to car insurance, liability insurance coverage is a [fundamental requirement](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements). In New York, drivers are required to carry liability coverage, which helps cover the costs associated with damage or injuries you cause to others in an accident. Basic liability insurance has its limitations, and you should understand where your coverage ends.
Bodily injury liability coverage, a part of liability insurance, helps cover medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages for the other driver if you’re at fault in a car accident. This part of liability insurance may even cover the other driver’s legal fees if you are considered to be at fault for the accident.
However, liability only covers the costs associated with the other party’s injuries or damages. It doesn’t help with your own medical bills, lost wages, or property damage. That’s where your essential uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage comes in, ensuring that you’re protected if the other driver does not have sufficient insurance coverage.
## Why Do You Need Uninsured Motorist Coverage in New York?
In New York, the law mandates that drivers carry a minimum amount of liability car insurance and uninsured motorist coverage. Unfortunately, though, this doesn’t always mean that the at-fault driver will have enough coverage to pay for all the damages resulting from an accident.
Many drivers on the road may have the bare minimum insurance policies, leaving you with a significant financial burden if you’re injured in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver.
Without additional uninsured driver coverage, also known as Supplemental Uninsured Motorist or SUM coverage, you may have to rely solely on your own auto insurance company or personal assets to cover your medical expenses and damages.
This can be particularly problematic if you’re involved in a serious accident that results in high medical costs and lost wages. Even worse, if the at-fault driver doesn’t have insurance, you may struggle to recover compensation for your injuries.
Uninsured motorist coverage is also invaluable in the case of a hit-and-run accident. If the at-fault driver flees the scene, leaving you with no way to identify him or his insurance, uninsured driver coverage can step in to cover your medical bills and other expenses.
In New York, hit-and-run accidents can be common, but UM coverage can provide the peace of mind that comes from knowing that you won’t be left without financial protection.
## No-Fault Insurance and Personal Injury Protection
[New York is a no-fault insurance state](https://hillmoin.com/no-fault-insurance-in-new-york-car-accidents/), which means that, regardless of who is at fault in an accident, your own insurance company policy will cover your medical expenses and lost wages up to the policy limits. This no-fault insurance coverage is provided through personal injury protection (PIP) coverage, which is mandatory under New York state law.
While no-fault insurance helps cover immediate medical expenses and lost wages, it may not be enough to cover serious injuries or significant property damage fully. This is where uninsured or underinsured motorist or SUM coverage becomes essential.
If you’re injured in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver, your own insurance policy can help cover expenses that exceed the no-fault coverage, such as medical costs, pain and suffering, and lost wages beyond what PIP provides.
## Compassionate Legal Help From Your “Lawyer in the Family”
Uninsured motorist coverage is an essential part of any comprehensive auto insurance policy in New York. With the high number of uninsured and underinsured drivers on the road, it is critical to ensure you have adequate protection in the event of an auto accident.
This coverage can help you recover compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver. By adding this coverage to your policy, you can have peace of mind knowing that you are financially protected, regardless of the [at-fault driver’s](https://hillmoin.com/how-a-car-accident-lawyer-can-help-prove-fault-in-complex-cases/) insurance situation.
When facing a personal injury or car accident with a long recovery time – we often wish we had done certain things sooner, and talking about uninsured insurance coverage might be one of them. So take action now!
