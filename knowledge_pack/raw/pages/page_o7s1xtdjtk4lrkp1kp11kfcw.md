## Frequently Ask Questions About AARP Homeowners Insurance
### [Is Homeowners Insurance Required? ](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance#collapse-53423d38-e3ab-438c-9fe4-70e6eb88f91f-1)
While homeowners insurance typically isn’t [required](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance/required) by law, if you have a mortgage on your home, then usually the mortgage lender will require you to have home insurance. 
### [How Much Coverage Do I Need for Homeowners Insurance? ](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance#collapse-53423d38-e3ab-438c-9fe4-70e6eb88f91f-2)
There is no one-size-fits-all policy when it comes to home insurance. In fact, there are a number of things to consider when choosing the right [home insurance coverages for your needs](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance/how-much-do-i-need), ranging from local construction costs to the value of your belongings.

### [Is Flooding Covered Under Homeowners Insurance? ](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance#collapse-53423d38-e3ab-438c-9fe4-70e6eb88f91f-3)
No, [flood insurance](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/flood-insurance) isn’t included in standard homeowners insurance policies. You’d need to purchase a separate flood insurance policy to be protected.

You can also prevent claims from occurring by installing devices like fire [sprinkler systems](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance/home-security-system) and monitored alarms or even adding security systems, such as a burglar alarm. And these safety enhancements could [save you money](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance/discounts) on your home insurance policy. 
### [How Much Does Homeowners Insurance Cost? ](https://www.thehartford.com/aarp/homeowners-insurance#collapse-53423d38-e3ab-438c-9fe4-70e6eb88f91f-6)
