The two biggest auto insurance discounts you can get are for bundling with other policies and being a safe driver.
You could save up to 40% by bundling policies or signing up to let companies track your driving habits.
**American Family, Geico and Progressive** are some of the best companies for car insurance discounts. They each offer at least a dozen discounts, including ones for autopay, getting good grades and vehicle-based discounts.

## What are the best car insurance discounts?
When you [bundle auto and homeowners insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles"), you could save about 18% on your rates.
Many companies also advertise savings of between 10% and 25% on car insurance if you have more than one car on one policy, instead of covering them separately.
### How much you can save
Discount | Potential savings  
---|---  
[Driver safety](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#safe "#safe") | 10%-20%  
[Driver status](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#student "#student") | 5%-25%  
[Policy based](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#policy "#policy") | Up to 25%  
[Car features](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#vehicle "#vehicle") | 3%-30%  
[Miles driven](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#usage "#usage") | Up to 40%  
**Remember, a bigger discount isn't really what matters.** It's how much you pay overall. If one company advertises a 30% discount off its standard rate, but its regular rates are high, it might still be more expensive than another company with a smaller discount but lower rates.
## Driver safety discounts
Driver safety discounts reward drivers for their good driving habits. They can save you a lot on your car insurance and are the most common discounts across insurance companies.
| Defensive driving course | Accident-free/safe driver | Low mileage  
---|---|---|---  
Allstate |  |  |   
American Family |  |  |   
Farmers |  |  |   
Geico |  |  |   
Liberty Mutual |  |  |   
Nationwide |  |  |   
Progressive |  |  |   
State Farm |  |  |   
Travelers |  |  |   
USAA* |  |  |   
*USAA is only available to current and former military members and their families.
### Defensive driving discount (10% to 15%)
Drivers who take [defensive driving lessons](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses") from a certified or registered school may be able to get a **10% to 15% discount on their coverage.** Classes teach drivers how to handle road, traffic and weather conditions to avoid accidents.
Defensive driving classes typically cost around $25 and take a few hours to complete, but a defensive driving discount could save you an average $154 per year on your car insurance.
Some companies ask if you've taken defensive driving lessons when you get a quote, but you can still get the discount before your policy ends. Before signing up for a class, check with your insurance company to see if you're eligible for the discount.
You'll also want to ask your insurance company if it has a list of approved defensive driving courses in your area. If you take a course that's not on the list, you may not get the discount.
### Accident-free discounts (up to 10%)
Companies like [Allstate, Geico, State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-farm-vs-geico-vs-allstate-vs-progressive-vs-farmers-car-insurance "Compare Allstate, Geico and State Farm") and most others offer good-driver discounts if you have been accident-free for **three to five years.** This discount is usually applied automatically. If you do not qualify at sign-up, your insurance company can adjust your rate at the time of your next renewal if you have been accident-free for the required time.
The definition of a "good driver" may change slightly across companies, so check with your agent for the details.
### Safe-driver discounts (up to 10%)
Insurance companies give safe-driver discounts to drivers who practice good safety habits on the road and let their insurance company track their driving habits. If you wear your seat belt, go the speed limit and brake slowly instead of aggressively, you could save as much as **10% off your monthly rate.**
You may also see insurance companies call this discount a [good-driver discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-driver-car-insurance-discount "How to Get a Good-Driver Discount"). However, Geico and Allstate treat safe-driver discounts and good-driver discounts as separate things.
Companies like Progressive and Allstate may also require you to use a usage-based program. These programs track your driving habits and send that information to your insurance company.
The company can then use this data to decide if you're eligible for the discount or how much of a discount you can get.
### Low-mileage discounts (up to 20%)
If you don't use your car often, you may qualify for a low-mileage usage discount. Whenever you get a quote, companies will ask about your average annual mileage. The average person drives around 12,000 miles per year, but if you drive fewer than 7,500 miles annually, you can see some great discounts. Safeco offers a discount as high as 20%.
You may have to sign up for driver monitoring technology to qualify for this discount at certain companies.
**Low-milage discounts are different from pay-per-mile coverage.** Pay-per-mile coverage sets a base rate and then charges a small amount for every mile you drive.
### Usage-based discounts (up to 40%)
Some insurance companies, like **Allstate, Progressive and Nationwide** , let you download a tracking app or use a device that plugs into your car. These apps and devices track your driving habits and send your insurance company information about how often you speed, start or stop suddenly, or swerve. You could save **up to 40%** by signing up for [usage-based insurance (UBI)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance Companies").
Most insurance companies offer a maximum discount of 30%, but to qualify for that maximum discount, you typically need to show perfect driving behavior.
Only sign up for one of these discount programs if you practice good driving habits every time you drive.
If you regularly speed or brake aggressively and you're using a tracking device in your car, your insurance company could raise your rates.

## Student car insurance discounts
If you're a student or have a student on your policy, you may qualify for student discounts through your insurance company. You could save **up to 25% on your rates** , but these discounts have strict requirements.
### Good student discount (5% to 25%)
If you're a young driver, your car insurance rates will be [very high until you turn 25](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Rates"). But if you're a student who has a B average, you can qualify for savings as high as 25% with a [good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Student Car Insurance Discounts"). You just need to be a full-time student and provide proof of your grades to your insurance company.
You can request school records from your school's registrar or student services office, or you can send copies of your most recent report card to your insurance company.
### Away-from-home student discount (5% to 25%)
As a parent, you can save on your policy if your student child leaves their car at home when they're at college and the school is located more than 100 miles away. Ask your agent about this discount right away or during your [next renewal](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-renewal "How to Renew Your Car Insurance and Stay Covered"). If you qualify, the discount should help you save as much as **25% on your liability coverage.**
## Organization-based discounts
Many car insurance companies offer discounts based on the groups you belong to, your employer or other similar factors. For example, some companies offer [auto insurance discounts to active duty military members](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-save-auto-insurance-while-active-duty "Tips to Save on Auto Insurance While on Active Duty"). Each company's discounts will differ, and you might not get a discount at one company that you could from another.
These discounts depend on what you do, not your driving habits.
### Job-based car insurance discounts
Most insurance companies give discounts to members or employees of certain trade or professional organizations that give their members or employees extra discounts. These tend to be organizations like unions and university alumni groups.
You may be able to get these car insurance discounts if you are a:
  * Firefighter 
  * EMT 
  * [Nurse](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts-for-nurses "Car Insurance Discounts for Nurses")
  * Law enforcement officer 
  * [Teacher](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts-teachers "Best Car Insurance for Teachers")


Every insurance company is different, so check to see if you can get a professional discount. If your company doesn't offer any, you may want to shop around.
Geico currently offers a **3% discount** to members of more than 500 professional and university organizations.
### Military, veteran and federal worker discounts (8% to 15%)
If you served in the United States military or work as a federal employee, you may qualify for more discounts on your car insurance. Geico, for example, gives 8% to 15% discounts to active service members and federal employees, as well as veterans and retirees.
Other companies, such as USAA, exclusively provide [auto insurance to military members](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-and-military-members "Best Car Insurance for Military Members"), their families and defense personnel. They also extend that benefit to up to  two generations of family members.
### Employer discounts (2% to 15%)
Some car insurance companies offer discounts to employees of certain companies. This type of discount is typically available at larger companies like national banks and airlines, but the discount amounts available depend on who you're working for.
Talk to your company's HR department to see if the company gets discounts on car insurance with any companies in your area.
## Policy-based car insurance discounts
Policy-based car insurance discounts are based on the types of policies or coverage you have through your insurance company. You can often change your policy to qualify for these discounts.
### Multicar discount (up to 25%)
You can get a [multicar discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/multi-car-insurance-discounts-quotes "How Much You Can Save on Multicar Policies") when you cover several cars with the same company under the same insurance policy.
Most insurance companies require you to own each car on the policy or require a separate owner to be your spouse, child or domestic partner.
Some insurance companies may also accept unrelated roommates for multicar discounts because they might jointly own or drive the cars. Talk with your insurance company to understand your options.
### Homeowner car insurance discount (varies, 3%)
Your car insurance company may also give you a discount if you own a home, even if you don't have homeowners insurance with that company.
Some companies give you discounts for bundling and being a homeowner, and the discounts often apply automatically when you get your quote.
### Home and auto ownership discounts

### Multipolicy discount (5% to 25%)
People with a car and a house can often save on insurance by getting policies for both with the same company. You can bundle many different kinds of insurance, such as auto and home, auto and boat, and auto, home and umbrella, to name a few. Your savings might differ depending on what kinds of coverage you get.
While the discounts may not apply equally to all of your policies with your insurance company, companies can give a range of **5% to 25% off auto insurance** for [bundling policies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundling-can-save-you-money-car-insurance "Bundling Car Insurance Policies").
## Discounts for how you pay
You may qualify for car insurance discounts if you do things like pay online or all at once. The amount of the discount depends on the company and which discount you're getting.
| Early/online sign-up | Paid-in-full | Electronic billing/autopay | Loyalty/continuous coverage  
---|---|---|---|---  
Allstate |  |  |  |   
American Family |  |  |  |   
Farmers |  |  |  |   
Geico |  |  |  |   
Liberty Mutual |  |  |  |   
Nationwide |  |  |  |   
Progressive |  |  |  |   
State Farm |  |  |  |   
Travelers |  |  |  |   
USAA |  |  |  |   
### Early signing discount (about 3%)
Some insurance companies offer early signing discounts if you buy insurance before your current policy expires. Fewer than half of major insurance companies offer it. However, when it's available, you can get 3% to 10% off your total policy cost, depending on how far in advance you sign up for the policy.
### Paid-in-full discount (5% to 10%)
Insurance companies give you a discount of between 5% and 10% for paying your entire six-month or annual rate up front. This is a separate option on your quote page that you have to choose, and it usually requires that you pay the full cost of the policy by the policy's first effective date.
If you choose to pay monthly or don't end up paying the full cost up front, you won't get the discount.
### Electronic billing and autopay (3% to 10%)
Enrolling in autopay or online billing could get you another discount. This type of discount is typically only available with larger, national insurance companies. Smaller local insurance companies may not offer it.
The amount you'll receive will depend on the insurance company.
Nationwide offers a discount of up to **3% for setting up automatic payments through electronic funds transfer (EFT).** If you sign up with Allstate, you can save 5% on your rates by signing up for automatic EFT payments and 10% for signing up for paperless billing.
### Loyalty discount
Many insurance companies fight to keep their customers by offering loyalty discounts. While some companies like Geico refer to their multicar and bundling discounts as loyalty discounts, other companies reward people who stay with them for a long time. This discount doesn't always result in lower rates, but it could be more rewarding in the long run. You may get benefits like a dedicated customer service line with shorter wait times or accident forgiveness.
Progressive has a tiered loyalty program that gives fifth-year customers large accident forgiveness for one accident and faster customer service. Drivers could save **up to 20%** on liability and collision rates after an accident.
That said, it might still be worthwhile to shop around, especially if your insurance company regularly raises your rates.
## Vehicle feature discounts
If your car has features like an **anti-theft device or antilock brakes** , you may get discounts for them. Insurance companies like to see these features because they can prevent expensive damage and reduce your risk of accidents or theft. That can mean major savings for the insurance company since it's less likely that you'll [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/filing-auto-insurance-claim "Guide to Filing Car Insurance Claims").
| Anti-theft | New car | Daytime running lights  
---|---|---|---  
Allstate |  |  |   
American Family |  |  |   
Farmers |  |  |   
Geico |  |  |   
Liberty Mutual |  |  |   
Nationwide |  |  |   
Progressive |  |  |   
State Farm |  |  |   
Travelers |  |  |   
USAA |  |  |   
### Anti-theft car insurance discount (5% to 15%)
Anti-theft devices like GPS trackers, alarms, dash cams and smartkeys can help you get a discount on your insurance. These devices help reduce the risk of theft and help law enforcement track down your car if it does get stolen, but they can be expensive to install, with some costing **$200 or more.**
You shouldn't buy anti-theft devices for the sake of saving on your car insurance.
The discounts you'll get may not be enough to offset the cost of those devices. Drivers can save **5% to 15% on their comprehensive coverage** , but comprehensive tends to be the cheapest part of your total coverage. You'll want to consider these devices as an investment that can prevent theft and the resulting rate increase if you file a claim for car theft.
### Antilock brakes (5% to 10%)
If your car has a factory-installed **antilock braking system (ABS)** , you may be able to get a discount on your rate. Most companies apply this discount when you get a quote and enter your vehicle's details into their system. But if you don't see the discount on your policy, ask your agent to see if you're eligible.
You could see a 5% to 10% discount on your collision coverage. Depending on your [car type](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/car-make-model "How Make and Model Impact Insurance") and your deductible, that could translate to savings of **$20 to $100 per year.**
### Passive restraint (25% to 30%)
Passive restraint equipment includes features like front air bags and seat belts. Though manufacturers have been installing this equipment on all new vehicles since 1983, insurance companies still give discounts for it. If your car meets the requirements, you could save as much as **25% to 30% on your policy's personal injury protection or medical payments coverage.**
### New car (10%)
If you just bought a new car, you could get discounts on your policy. The discount amounts vary by insurance company and state, as well as how each insurance company defines "new."
For example, Allstate offers new car discounts if you're the car's first title owner and the vehicle is a current model year or one year prior. If you qualify, Allstate leaves the discount in place for three years.
### Daytime running lights (about 3%)
Daytime running lights can reduce collisions and keep you safer on the road. Many newer cars have daytime running lights as a standard feature, and having them could get you a **3% discount on your rates** , excluding your comprehensive coverage.
Although some insurance companies debate whether daytime running lights make your car safer, several large companies offer this discount, including Geico and Allstate.

#### Discounts help companies learn about consumers’ behaviors. For instance, auto insurance companies provide discounts based on safe driving and grades. Are certain age groups more likely to trade their personal data for discounts?
In general, younger consumers, as in millennials or younger, are more open to trusting online entities and willing to share their data in exchange for access to free services, tailored discounts or search results, and overall a more customized and efficient online experience. In the case of auto insurance discounts, this is the group that is usually considered riskier and pays the highest premiums, so getting a discount in exchange for data may be a win-win.
#### How might the perception of a good deal or discount, even if there is risk associated with it, impact someone's buying decision? How does that compare with the perception of a low price with no discount?
I think this depends on who is offering the discounted or lower price. If it is a market-leading firm, then consumers may still trust the brand and find the opportunity appealing. If the offerer is a less known or suspect brand, then this discounted or lower price may be perceived as risky and not trustworthy, which may lead consumers to second-guess or at least to further scrutinize the details of the offering. This may also apply to credible brands offering discounted or lower prices if these truly deviate from what a consumer considers normal.
#### Are discount and/or reward programs, such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts, more beneficial to attract new customers or to help maintain a current, loyal consumer base?
These are both persuasive tools to attract new customers and to maintain current ones as long as the prices are competitive. Some consumers do not bargain on their insurance, as this is a not highly involving product category despite its relatively high price. These are the consumers who may stay indefinitely with a brand unless the price becomes prohibitive. There are other consumers who like to shop around every six or 12 months, especially if they see an ad with this type of offering or if their premium goes up even if just slightly. For these consumers, being exposed to this type of appeal either by their current or prospective provider can be very persuasive.
#### A recent survey by ValuePenguin revealed that nearly 30% of women had never taken advantage of an auto insurance discount, compared to only 13% of men. Can you elaborate on why you believe there may be a gap in those taking advantage of these types of loyalty programs?
In general women are more involved with shopping, which will lead them to look for discounts more than men. This applies to department store shopping, groceries, etc. Interestingly, auto is an exception, as cars are more involving to men than to women, hence men will shop around more when buying cars, insurance, etc. For couples, men may also be in charge of handling car-related purchases, hence their higher likelihood of having taken advantage of discounts in this product category.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
Past work has shown that consumers are very sensitive to the presence of a discount and not always as much to the magnitude of the discount, especially for not highly involving product categories like insurance. Given this, they may overspend on car technologies that may cost hundreds and just deliver discounts in the tens. Additionally, if the consumer truly desires acquiring the technology beyond the opportunity of getting a car insurance discount, then this small discount may serve as a license to justify acquiring the technology. Past research has shown that some people like to pay for advanced technologies that they may not even use, so even better if a small discount helps justify the purchase.

#### Discounts help companies learn about consumers’ behaviors. For instance, auto insurance companies provide discounts based on safe driving and grades. Are certain age groups more likely to trade their personal data for discounts?
Research demonstrates that younger consumers are more comfortable with sharing since they have grown up in an environment in which it is relatively normal to trade, say, social media insights for the free use of Facebook and such. On the other hand, younger consumers are also a bit more digitally savvy, so they know more about when they are being tracked and how. This might also make them a bit more skeptical of these kinds of offers if they are perceived to be deceptive or misleading in any way.
#### How might the perception of a good deal or discount, even if there is risk associated with it, impact someone's buying decision? How does that compare with the perception of a low price with no discount?
There is some research in consumer behavior that shows discounting can affect quality perceptions. Of course, low-priced alternatives can also be perceived as lower quality when they are easily comparable to other options. So I think it would come down to whether consumers are doing a lot of price comparison-shopping for insurance, as I imagine they are. On the other hand, "quality" might not be easily evaluated for consumers when it comes to insurance. My guess is the bigger question is one of trust: Will the company take care of me when I need it? In this case, the more important question will be how discounting or everyday low pricing affects perceptions of trust for automobile insurance.
### Are discount and/or reward programs, such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts, more beneficial to attract new customers or to help maintain a current, loyal consumer base?
In general, discounts are often used to attract new customers or bring back old ones. This is particularly important in an industry where the options are somewhat homogenous — there are many ways of packaging and customizing insurance, of course, but it is a mature product with a well-established business model that works very similarly across providers. It can be a bit hard for providers to differentiate themselves for customers in a way that might allow them to use a more premium pricing model. As far as reward programs, these are designed to maintain current customers. Reward programs work like anything else by reinforcing consumers for the decisions they make — decisions to renew a policy or, as we are seeing increasingly, safe driving decisions. Given that safe driving discounts are relatively new, I do think it is an interesting question as to how effective they might be in attracting new customers. I imagine that drivers who already know they drive safely might find this an appealing promotional strategy. For unsafe drivers, the more interesting question would be whether it actually promotes behavior change.
#### A recent survey by ValuePenguin revealed that nearly 30% of women had never taken advantage of an auto insurance discount, compared to only 13% of men. Can you elaborate on why you believe there may be a gap in those taking advantage of these types of loyalty programs?
If I knew nothing about the product, I would assume that any consumer more likely to take advantage of a discount may have evaluated the product less carefully. That is, discounting is sort of a low-effort consumer strategy — it works when consumers don't care as much about the specific product attributes, or when they don't see competitors as highly differentiated. So this finding suggests to me that women are evaluating insurance options more carefully than men, perhaps. This could mean women are more careful shoppers in general, or it could mean that men and women perceive insurance, as a product, differently. For instance, a consumer that sees insurance as a purely utilitarian product may just make a quick cost-benefit calculation and be tempted by a discount. But insurance is also a product that could be associated with needs and motives related to safety, trust and belonging — needs that could motivate a deeper evaluation of the product.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
I think carefully segmenting the market is necessary here. A customer that is able to buy more car up front is, in theory, a customer of greater means — so this would reflect some pretty sophisticated financial reasoning. I would think transparency with this kind of consumer would be essential on the part of an insurance company.

#### Are discount and/or reward programs, such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts, more beneficial to attract new customers or to help maintain a current, loyal consumer base?
While safe driving discounts (like Progressive's Snapshot program) initially attracted a lot of new customers, their impact on customer loyalty is lasting, at least for safe drivers. Safe drivers receive a substantial discount based on their observed driving habits (using a telematics device). But only their current insurer — the one that monitored them — knows that they have such safe driving habits. Typically, no other insurer can offer a competitive price to these drivers, at least initially. If a consumer were to switch to another insurer with a safe driving discount, they would need to pay a higher price at least until they have been monitored long enough to verify that they indeed have safe driving habits. Moreover, many consumers dislike being monitored so closely. The consumer also faces a risk that the next insurer may not reach the same conclusion that the driver is so safe, and so the discount may be smaller.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
There are various insurance cost estimators one can use when factoring insurance costs into new car purchase decisions. However, one should be very careful. Some of the safest vehicles incorporate accident prevention technologies into the bumper and side mirrors of vehicles. While these technologies help prevent and lessen the impact of severe accidents, they are expensive to repair. Even a small accident can result in a large bill for vehicles with advanced safety technologies, which consumers end up paying a portion of through their deductible and higher premiums later on if they submit a claim.

#### Discounts help companies learn about consumers’ behaviors. For instance, auto insurance companies provide discounts based on safe driving and grades. Are certain age groups more likely to trade their personal data for discounts?
When providing discounts based on safe driving and grades, rather than considering different age groups, it may be helpful for insurance companies to consider the types of consumers that they are attracting with these discounts. If the information on safe driving and grades is verifiable (e.g., by requiring a formal report card or transcript), there might be a self-selection process where safe drivers and students with better grades are more likely to sign up with the company. However, a limitation is that if the information is not easily verifiable or is easily faked, the company may instead end up with an adverse selection problem where riskier individuals sign up in order to take advantage of the discounts.
#### How might the perception of a good deal or discount, even if there is risk associated with it, impact someone's buying decision? How does that compare with the perception of a low price with no discount?
Reference prices are often a powerful driver of consumer decisions, so seeing a discount or some percentage off the standard price may be much more attractive to consumers compared to simply a low price with no reference point. Another useful strategy for insurance companies hoping to outprice the competition is to advertise their lower prices alongside competitor prices, again establishing a reference point.
When it comes to products like car insurance, people often don’t shop around as much as they should, and also tend not to switch insurance companies, regardless of discounts or advertising from other companies. These frictions are often referred to as "search costs" and "switching costs," and can be quite high.
Elisabeth Honka, associate professor of marketing at UCLA, has done extensive research on this topic and has found that search costs and switching costs are important barriers to customers improving their insurance plans. This makes it even more important for insurance companies to emphasize discounts to break down these barriers and make consumers aware of the potential savings.
#### Are discount and/or reward programs, such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts, more beneficial to attract new customers or to help maintain a current, loyal consumer base?
During the early stage of the insurance purchase process, features of the program such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts may not be as top-of-mind to new customers as price discounts or free starting points in a reward program. Instead, these features will probably be more effective in retaining existing customers, who are closer to directly experiencing these benefits. The one exception might be new customers who have recently been in an accident and are specifically looking for programs that provide these benefits.
#### A recent survey by ValuePenguin revealed that nearly 30% of women had never taken advantage of an auto insurance discount, compared to only 13% of men. Can you elaborate on why you believe there may be a gap in those taking advantage of these types of loyalty programs?
One possibility for this gender gap is the difference in behavioral tendencies between men and women when it comes to negotiations. I would recommend an excellent book entitled "Women Don’t Ask" by Linda Babcock, a colleague and professor of economics here at Carnegie Mellon. This book delves into the many ways that women often find it hard to ask for opportunities, pay raises, better deals, etc., compared to their male counterparts due to a variety of social forces and inequalities. You can easily see how this might extend to everyday decisions such as asking for or taking advantage of an auto insurance discount or loyalty program.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
Let’s consider, for example, a device that tracks how many miles you drive. The device may cost some amount up front for the customer to purchase, and if they drive more, then they pay more for their insurance, and if they drive less, then they pay less. In this situation, the customer is potentially at risk of paying more if they drive more than anticipated, or not saving as much as they expected even if they drive less, and therefore not making up for the cost of the initial device purchase. Thus, it is very important for these types of discount programs to clearly represent the projected savings to the consumers and the costs versus benefits.
As these devices get more sophisticated, potentially relying upon complex algorithms to compute how "safe" a driver is and the insurance discount they have earned, transparency between the customer and firm becomes imperative, especially since customers are often giving up more and more of their private data. In my own research on how to define good explanations for algorithms, my colleagues and I find that customer satisfaction for financial decisions such as credit card or loan approvals can be sensitive to factors such as the complexity of the algorithm and the individual’s own realized outcomes.

#### Discounts help companies learn about consumers’ behaviors. For instance, auto insurance companies provide discounts based on safe driving and grades. Are certain age groups more likely to trade their personal data for discounts?
With rapid advancements in technology, I'm afraid that usage-based insurance (or UBI), may become more of the norm in the next five to 10 years.
Safe drivers and those that do not drive a lot (low mileages) may be automatically attracted to such schemes. Discount-prone customers across all age groups will also be attracted to such a policy. Across all age groups, younger individuals are more likely to trade their personal data for discounts, since they grew up in an era where we have very little privacy and are hence more comfortable sharing personal information.
#### How might the perception of a good deal or discount, even if there is risk associated with it, impact someone's buying decision? How does that compare with the perception of a low price with no discount?
This is based primarily on consumer personality. In retailing, studies have demonstrated personality differences in preferences for EDLP (everyday low pricing) versus high-low (deal) pricing. Similarly, while buying auto insurance, we might find similar differences. Younger customers are more likely to be deal prone (versus a not-so-exciting option of low price with no discount).
#### Are discount and/or reward programs, such as accident forgiveness or safe driving discounts, more beneficial to attract new customers or to help maintain a current, loyal consumer base?
They are obviously more beneficial to attract new customers, most of whom are comparison shopping for the best deals and are likely to make decisions based on the benefits offered. However, once enticed, it is important to maintain those discounts and/or reward programs (instead of a "bait and switch" approach) or risk losing their customers to competitors who might snag them with more lucrative deals.
#### A recent survey by ValuePenguin revealed that nearly 30% of women had never taken advantage of an auto insurance discount, compared to only 13% of men. Can you elaborate on why you believe there may be a gap in those taking advantage of these types of loyalty programs?
A recent study found that men pay slightly lower on average ($720 per year) on car insurance compared to women, who pay $739 a year, on average. These numbers do vary by age. Younger men (below the age of 25) pay much more than their female counterparts because of data showing riskier behavior by the former group. Older women, however, end up paying more than their male counterparts.
As far as taking advantage of auto insurance discounts is considered, I am not surprised that almost a third of women have never taken advantage of auto insurance discounts, compared to just 13% for men, primarily because they are socially conditioned not to ask. Recent research by Carnegie Mellon University economics professor Linda Babcock, co-author of the book "Women Don't Ask," showed that women are four times less likely than men to ask for a raise, and when they do ask, they ask for 30% less than men do.
There are at least seven states — California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania — that have laws in the books against discriminatory auto insurance pricing based on gender.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
I would advise auto insurance shoppers to be careful before using this upgraded technology and agreeing to be monitored because of significant privacy concerns. Drivers should comprehend the risks, since the insurance company will have information on your whereabouts, how you drive, what you're interested in, where you live and who you're associating with. The information is also likely to be sold to other third parties without the individual's knowledge. There is also the danger of data breach, which may give this data to miscreants.
For those willing to overlook these risks, it is important to know what exactly will be tracked by the UBI program. Will it be just braking, idling and acceleration, or will it also track mileage and monitor driving quality?
However, UBI methods appear to be gaining traction. A recent J.D. Power study indicated that nearly 12% of auto insurance customers used such programs, and that nine of the top 10 largest passenger auto insurers have UBI programs in place.

#### How might the perception of a good deal or discount, even if there is risk associated with it, impact someone's buying decision? How does that compare with the perception of a low price with no discount?
I might suggest that the perception of a good deal or discount might be more enticing to consumers than just a low price. I find myself more open to exploring a possible purchase when some sort of advantage is advertised.
#### Some car shoppers may be willing to shell out more cash up front to purchase upgraded technology, with the anticipation that an insurance discount will offset the splurge. At what point do discount programs become problematic for consumers?
Discount programs can become problematic when they are overly complicated and may have strings attached that are not fully understood. A parallel example might be the adjustable-rate mortgage, which caused many to secure loans that had low payments at first, unaware of balloon payments and higher interest rates that could lead to foreclosure (which sadly was the case for many).
