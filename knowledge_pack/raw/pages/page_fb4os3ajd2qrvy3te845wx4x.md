## **What is covered in the event of a disaster or accident**
Homeowners insurance from GEICO offers protection for your home, property, and personal belongings in the event of a disaster or accident. It can also provide extra coverage for assets in your home or the cost of staying elsewhere during repairs.
GEICO functions as a broker and matches customers with third-party home insurers through the GEICO Insurance Agency. This means that a homeowners insurance policy purchased from GEICO will actually be from another company. GEICO sells the policy, but your actual coverage is provided by a third-party insurer who manages and underwrites your policy. GEICO works with almost 60 insurance partners to offer homeowners policies, including Chubb, Homesite, Liberty Mutual, and Travelers.
GEICO offers homeowners insurance in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The cost of a homeowners policy through GEICO will depend on several factors, including coverage amounts, location, and the presence of extreme weather events.
Homeowners insurance typically covers plumbing issues if the damage is sudden and accidental, such as a burst pipe or water damage from a storm. However, it usually does not cover plumbing issues caused by negligence or lack of maintenance, external flooding, or gradual damage.
In addition to basic homeowners insurance policies, GEICO offers additional coverages to enhance your financial security and peace of mind, including flood insurance, umbrella insurance, and earthquake insurance. Flood insurance protects against severe water damage from events like heavy rain, melting snow, or coastal storms. Earthquake insurance provides coverage for damage caused by seismic activities. Umbrella insurance provides extra liability coverage beyond the limits of your standard policy, offering additional protection from accidents and lawsuits.
It's important to note that exclusions may vary based on state laws, regulations, and internal company policies. You may be able to purchase endorsements, add-ons, or additional policies to cover excluded perils, such as flood insurance or earthquake insurance. Before purchasing homeowners insurance, determine whether it fits your circumstances and review the policy carefully to understand what is covered in the event of a disaster or accident.

## **What plumbing issues are covered**
GEICO's homeowners insurance typically covers sudden and accidental plumbing issues. For example, if a pipe bursts unexpectedly and causes water damage to your home, GEICO's insurance will cover the cost of repairs. Other examples of sudden and accidental water damage covered by GEICO include an overflowing washing machine or water entering the home due to a storm damaging the roof or windows.
However, it is important to note that GEICO's homeowners insurance does not cover plumbing issues caused by negligence or a lack of maintenance. This includes slow leaks, corrosion, or normal wear and tear. It also does not cover water damage from external flooding, gradual damage, or unresolved maintenance issues. For coverage against flooding, a separate flood insurance policy must be purchased, which is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers.
In addition to plumbing issues, GEICO's homeowners insurance covers damage to the property and personal belongings within the property, including furniture, clothing, electronics, and appliances. It also provides liability coverage against certain types of accidents that occur within the home or on the property. This includes injuries or damages caused by the homeowner or their family members to others.
Homeowners insurance through GEICO can be customized with numerous add-ons, such as flood insurance, earthquake insurance, and umbrella insurance, which provides extra liability coverage beyond the standard policy limits.

## **What personal belongings are covered**
Homeowners insurance from GEICO covers personal belongings within the property. This means that if a covered event occurs, you can get help with the cost of repairing or replacing furniture, clothing, electronics, and other valuables.
GEICO's homeowners insurance covers more than just the house itself. It helps you replace items that you couldn't easily afford to replace otherwise. For example, it covers furniture, appliances, clothing, and more.
GEICO's insurance covers personal belongings in the event of a disaster or accident. It can also provide extra coverage for assets in your home or the cost of staying elsewhere during repairs. This includes additional living expenses if the property becomes uninhabitable because of covered damages, ensuring that homeowners have a safe place to stay while repairs are underway.
You can also add extra coverage to your policy to enhance your financial security and peace of mind. For example, flood insurance, umbrella insurance, and earthquake insurance.

## **What is covered in the event of fire, theft or vandalism**
GEICO offers homeowners insurance in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The company works with over 60 insurance partners, including Chubb, Homesite, Liberty Mutual, and Travelers, to provide customers with homeowners insurance policies.
GEICO's homeowners insurance covers fire, theft, and vandalism. In the event of a fire, GEICO's homeowners insurance will cover the cost of repairing or rebuilding the structure of your home. The insurance will also cover the cost of repairing or replacing any personal belongings damaged by the fire, such as furniture, clothing, electronics, and other valuables.
In the case of theft, GEICO's homeowners insurance will cover the cost of replacing stolen items. This includes personal belongings, such as furniture, appliances, clothing, and other valuables.
GEICO's homeowners insurance also covers vandalism. If your home or property is vandalized, the insurance will pay for the cost of repairing or replacing any damaged items. This includes the structure of your home as well as any personal belongings that may have been damaged or destroyed during the act of vandalism.
It is important to note that GEICO functions as a broker and does not directly underwrite its homeowners insurance policies. The company matches customers with third-party home insurers, so the specific coverage and exclusions may vary depending on the partner company providing the insurance.
Additionally, there are some standard exclusions to homeowners insurance policies. For example, damage caused by neglect, deferred maintenance, or everyday wear and tear is typically not covered. Natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, are also generally excluded from standard policies and must be purchased separately.

## **What is excluded from coverage**
Homeowners insurance from GEICO is provided by a third-party insurer, and the company works with almost 60 insurance partners, including Chubb, Homesite, Liberty Mutual, and Travelers. While GEICO offers homeowners insurance in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., the specific exclusions in a policy may vary based on state laws, regulations, and internal company policies.
Homeowners insurance typically doesn't cover natural disasters like floods and earthquakes unless specific coverage is purchased. Coverage for natural disasters must be bought separately from federal programs or private insurers.
Homeowners insurance also doesn't cover issues arising from neglect, deferred maintenance, or everyday wear and tear. For example, plumbing issues caused by negligence or lack of maintenance, such as slow leaks, corrosion, or normal wear and tear, are not covered.
Additionally, damage to the home or personal property caused by intentional acts by the insured or family members living with them is not covered.
It's important to note that GEICO doesn't offer homeowners insurance directly, so there are no sample rates available on their website. The cost of a homeowners policy through GEICO will depend on factors such as coverage amounts, location, and the presence of extreme weather events in the state.
