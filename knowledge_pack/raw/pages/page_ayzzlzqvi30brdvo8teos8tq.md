If you face a serious driving violation in the state of Indiana that results in a suspension, you may be required to get SR-22 coverage. This certificate serves as proof of insurance to help you get your license back.
Your insurance company will file the certificate on your behalf, which typically requires a one-time cost of about $50.
An insurance policy with an SR-22 in Indiana usually costs more than a standard car insurance policy. But the SR-22 filing itself doesn't generally raise the cost of car insurance much. The increased cost is usually due to the driving violation that caused you to need an SR-22 in the first place.

## Cheap SR-22 insurance in Indiana
State Farm, Progressive and Auto-Owners offer the cheapest rates for SR-22 insurance in Indiana.
The only real cost associated with SR-22 insurance is the fee to file the form, which is usually between $15 and $50. However, SR-22 insurance costs more than a regular policy because drivers with tickets on their record are more likely to cause an accident in the future. This increased risk makes them more expensive to insure.

## How to get an SR-22 in Indiana
To get [SR-22 insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance: Compare Quotes and Find Cheap Coverage") in Indiana, you will need to take a few key steps.
![contact](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_80/static/icons/contact-fill)
**Find an authorized insurance company.** Not all companies provide SR-22 insurance. Start by calling your current company to see if they offer SR-22 insurance. If not, you may need to find a new company that can file the SR-22 form on your behalf. 
![money](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_80/static/icons/money-fill)
**File the SR-22 form and pay the fee.** To get your driving privileges reinstated, your insurance company will need to file the SR-22 form electronically with the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). Your company will likely charge a flat fee between $15 and $50 to file your SR-22 certificate. 
![insurance policy](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_80/static/icons/inspolicy-fill)
**Get confirmation.** After processing the SR-22 form, both the Indiana BMV and your insurance company should send you a letter confirming your insurance coverage and legal right to get back behind the wheel. 
**If the state of Indiana requires you to have SR-22 insurance coverage and you live out of state, you can submit an Out of State Residency Affidavit to waive your SR-22 requirement.**
If you move back to Indiana before the end of your SR-22 requirement period, you must have proof of insurance coverage and file an SR-22 certificate.
* * *
### How long is SR-22 insurance coverage required in Indiana?
The length of time you'll be required to have SR-22 insurance in Indiana depends on the reason you're required to file the SR-22.
  * If you failed to provide proof of insurance when requested by the Indiana BMV, you need to have SR-22 coverage for 180 consecutive days. 
  * If your driving privileges are suspended, you must keep SR-22 insurance for three years following the reinstatement of your license. 
  * After your third or subsequent suspension, you will be required to carry SR-22 insurance for five years. 


Letting your SR-22 coverage lapse can result in lost driving privileges, reinstatement fees and higher auto insurance rates.
To avoid a coverage lapse, you should try to renew your policy early — at least 30 days in advance — while you're required to carry SR-22 insurance. Insurance companies will notify the Indiana BMV if you cancel or fail to renew your SR-22 policy.
Once you've had SR-22 insurance for the required period, contact the Indiana BMV to make sure your requirement is complete before you switch to a standard car insurance policy.

## Methodology
To determine SR-22 insurance rates in Indiana, we gathered quotes from the largest insurance companies in the state across every residential ZIP code. Rates are for a 30-year-old man with a good credit score who drives a 2015 Honda Civic EX.
Quotes are based on a policy with the minimum coverage limits required by Indiana law.
Coverage | Limit  
---|---  
Bodily injury liability | $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident  
Property damage liability | $25,000 per accident  
Uninsured motorist bodily injury liability | $50,000 per accident  
ValuePenguin's analysis used insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services. These rates were publicly sourced from insurer filings and should be used for comparative purposes only — your own quotes may be different.
