Telematics programs, which use a mobile app or device installed in your car to monitor your driving in real time, are increasingly popular with insurance companies. In return for giving your insurer access to your driving habits, you might save money on your premium. That’s never a bad idea, but there are a few catches to be aware of with these programs. Geico’s DriveEasy is one of the best-known, and in this review, Bankrate’s insurance team looks at the program’s pros and cons to help you decide if it is worth participating in — or if it might cost you money instead.
## **What is Geico DriveEasy?**
[DriveEasy](https://www.geico.com/driveeasy/) is a safe driving telematics discount program designed to track driving safety factors in real time using GPS technology. For drivers who avoid unsafe habits like hard braking and phone use behind the wheel, DriveEasy offers discounted rates on auto insurance. The app is [telematics-based](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/), which means that your real-time driving information is transmitted to Geico via your smartphone. The program is currently available in 39 states and Washington, D.C.
Signing up for Geico DriveEasy could save you money on your premium if the telematics data proves you’re a safe driver. Once you’ve downloaded the app and logged in, you don’t need to open it again when you get in your car. Instead, it automatically records trip data as you drive, as long as you remain logged in. The app can even distinguish if you are the driver or passenger or when you are using public transportation — though some users report having to correct trips that were inaccurately labeled.

What is Geico DriveEasy Pro? 
Geico DriveEasy Pro is a [telematics program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/are-telematics-programs-worth-the-discount/) designed for commercial auto insurance customers, particularly small businesses. The program aims to enhance fleet safety by promoting safe driving behaviors and offering personalized rates based on driving data.
There are two versions of the program:
  * **DriveEasy Pro****OBD (On-Board Diagnostic):** This version, meant for commercial auto customers, involves using a free OBD device that connects with Geico to monitor safe driving habits. The device provides insights into driving patterns and behaviors and offers personalized rates upon policy renewal. The DriveEasy Pro Fleet Dashboard allows business owners to access live vehicle locations and status, allowing for easy fleet management.
  * **DriveEasy Pro Dashcam:** Geared toward trucking customers, this program equips each qualified vehicle with a no-cost, road-facing dash cam that monitors the road, helping protect the fleet with video evidence for claims and defense purposes. This dashcam generally suits businesses with heavy trucks and wide operating ranges.

## **What does DriveEasy track?**
Although DriveEasy can’t monitor every factor of your driving, it is capable of analyzing simple driving habits that indicate how safely you may drive, such as hard braking, fast accelerations, speeding and cornering. The safer you drive, the higher your driving score will be, up to 100 points. The app can also log your trips, giving you a sense of how many miles you’ve traveled and where you might be able to improve your driving.
### **Factors that impact your DriveEasy score**
The factors that impact your DriveEasy score vary from state to state. Geico includes several factors that are commonly used in telematics programs from other [major insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/), including the following:
  * **Hard braking or fast acceleration:** DriveEasy can tell how quickly you decelerate when you press the brakes. Hard stops should be avoided unless necessary to avoid an accident. If DriveEasy determines a hard brake, predictive crash detection called Crash Assist will note your location and ask if you were in an accident, taking you to the claims section of the app to start a claim. Likewise, the app will also note if you accelerate quickly.
  * **Distance traveled:** By using location data from your phone, Geico DriveEasy can review your daily miles traveled and adjust your insurance based on how much time you are spending behind the wheel.
  * **Time of day:** Depending on when you do most of your driving, you may be considered a safer or riskier driver. DriveEasy monitors driving habits and it may negatively impact your score if you spend more time on the road after dark rather than during the daytime. Those commuting late at night may be adversely affected by this.
  * **Distracted driving:** The DriveEasy app monitors distracted driving through tracking active phone use, such as handheld phone calls and any sort of typing or scrolling. If a passenger is using your phone while you are driving, you will need to report this in the app to avoid a distracted driving report.
  * **Cornering:** Sharp turns present the risk of losing control of your vehicle. If you take corners tightly or too fast, DriveEasy may recognize this and it may negatively affect your driving score.
  * **Smoothness:** In order to get a high smoothness score, you’ll need to keep your cruising speeds consistent. 
  * **Route regularity:** DriveEasy will note if your routes are generally the same each day.


## **Pros and cons of Geico DriveEasy**
Although many telematics programs are similar across companies, each may have slightly different policies. Comparing telematics programs from each carrier may be a valuable aspect of the [insurance shopping process](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/when-to-shop-for-car-insurance/). Consider these pros and cons to determine if Geico DriveEasy is right for you.
###  DriveEasy pros 
  * **Automatic trip tracking:** The app tracks your trips while you’re logged in, making it easy to monitor your driving habits. 
  * **Driver/passenger distinction:** It can typically distinguish between when you’re driving and when you’re a passenger. 
  * **Possible savings for enrollment:** You may be eligible for savings just by signing up for the program. 
  * **Safe driving encouragement:** The app encourages safer driving habits, potentially helping you avoid accidents and traffic tickets. 
  * **Crash assist feature:** The app sends you a notification to check your status after a hard brake. It can pinpoint your location and contact emergency services or request a tow if you need it. Additionally, the crash assist feature could help you file a claim more easily following an accident by sending your information to your insurance company. 


###  DriveEasy cons 
  * **Rate increases for risky driving:** Your insurance premiums might increase if risky driving behaviors are detected. 
  * **High data sharing requirements:** DriveEasy requires access to [a large amount of personal data](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/are-telematics-programs-worth-the-discount/), including geolocation data, to calculate your discount. In most states, this data isn’t protected by privacy laws and can be used by Geico for a wide range of purposes. The program also uses about 105 MB per month, which may be burdensome for people on a 500 MB monthly data plan with their mobile carrier. 
  * **Penalties for phone usage:** If a passenger uses your phone while you’re driving, the program could incorrectly penalize you, requiring manual corrections. 
  * **May not be ideal for city driving:** Because DriveEasy’s scoring system values smoothness and penalizes hard braking, it may not be a good fit for city drivers who need to deal with quickly shifting traffic conditions. 
  * **May not be ideal for people who work at night:** DriveEasy considers your nighttime driving when it’s calculating your score since after-dark driving can increase the likelihood of a claim. So if you regularly get off of your shift well after dark, you may be penalized. 


## **How do I enroll in Geico DriveEasy?**
Geico policyholders in eligible states can get started with the DriveEasy [usage-based program](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/usage-based-insurance/) by downloading the Geico Mobile app on their smartphone. Then, follow these steps to enroll in the program:
  1. Once downloaded, enter your mobile phone number and input the confirmation code texted to you.
  2. The app will then walk you through setting your privacy and location permissions to use the DriveEasy function.
  3. When you’re done, the app will ask for mobile phone numbers for all drivers on your policy. It will provide a text with a link to send to each driver, so they can download the app and you can start logging trips.


## **How much of a discount can you get from DriveEasy?**
When you sign up for Geico’s DriveEasy program, you might receive an undisclosed discount as a sign-up incentive. Following that, your driving habits will determine any additional discounts, which could reach up to 25 percent. The exact discount you receive depends on your driving behavior, as tracked by the program. Safe driving patterns may lead to significant savings on your insurance premiums, while riskier behaviors might limit or negate potential discounts.
Ultimately, Geico doesn’t make its exact discount amounts publicly transparent. The only way to know the amount of the discount you’ll get from DriveEasy is to use the program. 
## **Is Geico DriveEasy right for me?**
Most insurance companies now have telematics programs, such as Progressive’s [Snapshot](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/progressive-snapshot/) or State Farm’s [Drive Safe and Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/). Each program has unique features, but all monitor your driving habits and typically reward safe practices. If you’re unsure if Geico DriveEasy is worth it, consider comparing it with similar programs to see which one best fits your needs.
Telematics programs like Geico DriveEasy may help you become a better driver by highlighting risky behaviors and encouraging safer habits. If you have a young driver on your policy, enrolling them could promote safe driving practices. However, repeated risky driving could increase your Geico insurance rates in some states, so it’s crucial to understand how your habits could impact your premium. Remember that even if you disenroll from the program, your rates might not immediately change if they’ve already been adjusted based on your driving behavior.
**Bottom line:** DriveEasy may help safe drivers willing to share the necessary data with Geico to get [cheaper car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/). However, factors like working the night shift, living in an urban area with dense traffic patterns or owning an older vehicle could increase the challenge of getting a discount through DriveEasy. In addition, some customers may not be comfortable with the data sharing requirements. 
## **What real customers say about DriveEasy**
To get a closer look at how real DriveEasy users found their experience, we turned to Reddit forums, including r/GEICO. We primarily found users complaining about difficulties they’d encountered when using the app, such as trips where they were incorrectly marked as a driver or falsely detected incidents of hard braking caused by keeping their phone on a seat instead of a secure phone holder. 
You may want to take these comments with a grain of salt; while they may be useful criticisms that reveal DriveEasy’s weaknesses, they might not be representative of all users’ experiences.
####  Reddit user review 
Rate decreased 
I have no idea if it was my DriveEasy score (which is excellent) or what, but my payment went down by like $20/month this 6-month billing period compared to last. I was very surprised when I got the adjusted new bill and it dropped so much, I thought a mistake was made. This is only my first year using it so we’ll see.

Bicycle rider penalized 
I have enrolled myself a few months ago into drive easy and I always kept my score at a nice 87. However, now, I usually use my bike to commute to places such as my classes and Geico thinks I’m driving, so basically every corner I take is considered too fast and every time that I brake is considered too hard, and sometimes it even thinks I have my phone out, which is usually in my pockets but I don’t even touch it, so it dropped my score to 74. I haven’t driven in weeks.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  Can your rates go up with DriveEasy? 
Caret Down Icon
Yes; depending on your state, your rates could go up if you exhibit poor or unsafe driving habits while using DriveEasy. Geico’s online resources clearly state: “Riskier drivers may see a higher rate — depending on the state you live in.” However, the risk may be minimal if you are actively working toward improving your driving skills. 
  * ###  Do all cars in a household have to participate? 
Caret Down Icon
While there is no obligation for every car in a household to participate in DriveEasy, all drivers listed on a single policy will need to participate in the program to receive its rewards. Each car and each driver will need to sign up to be counted. To avoid losing out on potential discounts, all drivers registered in the program should actively participate. 
  * ###  How does DriveEasy know if I’m a passenger rather than the driver? 
Caret Down Icon
DriveEasy uses technology that detects movement and relies on your phone’s sensors to determine if you are the driver or the passenger. It should also be able to identify if you’re on a bus or a train instead of a car. The technology isn’t perfect, but it’s possible to access your account and make changes if the app gets it wrong. 
  * ###  Can I participate in DriveEasy more than once? 
Caret Down Icon
Yes, you can participate in DriveEasy more than once. If you’ve previously decided to stop participating in the program, you can log into your online Geico account, go to “additional discounts,” find the DriveEasy enrollment and complete the steps to re-enroll in the DriveEasy program. 
  * ###  What is Geico DriveEasy Crash Assist? 
Caret Down Icon
Geico’s Accident Assist is a function of DriveEasy that detects hard braking, immediately places a pin in your location and sends a notification to determine if you’re okay, or need help. If you tell the app that you need assistance, it will help you call emergency services, request a tow or get you started on the claims process. If you’re okay and let the app know you don’t need help, it will continue tracking and you can continue your trip. 
  * ###  What counts as distracted driving in DriveEasy? 
Caret Down Icon
In the DriveEasy program, distracted driving usually includes actively using your phone while driving, such as making handheld calls or interacting with apps. If a passenger uses your phone while you’re behind the wheel, it can also be counted as distracted driving since the app can’t distinguish who is using it. However, these activities only count as distracted driving if the vehicle is traveling over 6 mph. Using Bluetooth for hands-free calls, GPS for navigation or streaming music won’t generally be flagged as distracted driving unless you’re also actively interacting with the phone while doing so.
