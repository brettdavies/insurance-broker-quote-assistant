[![Step 1 How building class is determined:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/07/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)

**How building class is determined:** All buildings must be classified into one of six construction classes (see number 3). Classification of a building class is based on two factors: building elements and fire-resistance rating. These factors may not be included in the submission/documentation, in which case additional information will need to be requested. 
     * **Building elements** : The building materials used in the construction of the following elements are the foundation for classification, be they wood, steel, or masonry. 
       * Structural frame
       * Exterior bearing walls
       * Interior bearing walls
       * Exterior nonbearing walls and partitions
       * Interior non-bearing walls and partitions
       * Floor construction, including supporting beams and joists
       * Roof construction, including supporting beams and joists, are comprised of
     * **Fire-resistance rating** : This is the other factor in determining construction class. The building materials used in the construction of the building elements above will have a fire-resistance rating. Fire-resistance rating typically means the duration for which a passive fire protection system can withstand a standard fire resistance test. This can be quantified simply as a measure of time (ex. 0 hours, 1 hour, or 2 hours), or it may entail a host of other criteria involving other evidence of functionality or fitness for purpose. 
       * **“Minimum” rule** : It is important to remember when selecting the construction class that the building is only as strong as its weakest element. For example, a masonry building may have an unprotected wood roof. The wood roof is the weakest member such that it has **no** fire-resistance. Thus, the construction class would be Joisted Masonry (see below). Now imagine this same building with a metal deck roof. So long as the supporting members of the building do not contain wood then this building would be Masonry Noncombustible (see below).

[![Step 2 What to ask:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-2-Version-3.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)

**What to ask:** To determine the ISO class of the building, we must therefore know the following composition of the building elements: 
     * Structural frame
     * Bearing walls (interior and exterior)
     * Floor construction
     * Roof construction
     * What the fire rating of the materials

**Building classes:** All construction types must be classified into the following (all of which are explained extensively below): 
     * **Frame Construction** (ISO Class I, IBC Type V)
     * **Joisted Masonry** (ISO Class 2, IBC Type III, IBC Type IV)
     * **Light Noncombustible** (ISO Class 3, IBC Type IIB)
     * **Masonry Noncombustible** (ISO Class 4, IBC Type IIA)
     * **Modified Fire Resistive** (ISO Class 5, IBC Type IB)
     * **Fire Resistive** (ISO Class 6, IBC Type IA)

**International Building Code (IBC) versus Insurance Services Office (ISO):**  
  
These are two major sources identifying construction types, both of which will be addressed in the construction types outlined below. ISO is traditionally what insurance companies use to denote type, whereas IBC is what architects and builders use.[[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#_note-1) X Research source [](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type) While one company may use ISO classifications, many submission documents may reference IBC classifications and it is important to be able to convert this to an ISO classification. (There have been situations where a frame building has been incorrectly classified as fire resistive because the submittal was read incorrectly!) The following explains what is expected under both: 
     * **International Building Code (IBC)** : This is a model building code developed by the International Code Council (ICC). It has been adopted throughout most of the United States. A large portion of the International Building Code deals with fire prevention. It differs from the related International Fire Code in that the IBC handles fire prevention in regards to construction and design and the fire code handles fire prevention in an ongoing basis. Parts of the code reference other codes including the International Plumbing Code, the International Mechanical Code, the National Electric Code, and various National Fire Protection Association Standards. IBC is more descriptive and also includes A or B types of construction for each class. 
       * **A is protected** , meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have an additional fire rated coating or cover by means of sheetrock, spray on, or other approved method. The additional fire rated coating or cover extends the fire resistance of the structural members by at least 1 hour.
       * **B is unprotected** , meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have no additional fire rated coating or cover. Exposed members are only fire resistant according to their natural ability, characteristics, and fire rating.
     * **Insurance Services Office (ISO)** : This is a provider of data, underwriting, risk management, and legal/regulatory services to property-casualty insurers and other clients.

**Classification:** Frame construction is ISO Class 1. ISO Class 1 encompasses IBC Type VA and IBC Type VB. Regardless of whether the IBC classification is A (protected) or B (unprotected) the ISO Class is 1. 
  2. [![Step 2 Building elements:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b4/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
2
**Building elements:**
     * Frame buildings are buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs with combustible construction — or buildings with exterior walls of noncombustible or slow-burning construction with combustible floors and roofs.
     * Frame buildings generally have roof, floor, and supports of combustible material, usually wood, and combustible interior walls.
     * Two variations on frame construction don't change the construction class: 
       * Masonry veneer (brick veneer)- Masonry veneer is thin layers of brick, stone, or stucco, used for appearance purposes rather than structural support.
       * Metal clad - A building with a metal exterior wall may not look like frame construction, but when the metal skin is attached to wood studs and joists, ISO classifies the building as frame.
     * Other conditions that lead to classification as frame construction include: 
       * Metal walls or floors sheathed with combustible materials
       * Metal floors or roofs with combustible insulation or ceiling material attached to the underside or within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of horizontal supports
       * Composite assemblies of noncombustible materials with combustible materials

**Classification:** Joisted Masonry construction is ISO Class 2. ISO Class 2 encompasses IBC Type IIIA and IBC Type IIIB. Regardless of whether the IBC classification is A (protected) or B (unprotected) the ISO Class is 2. IBC Type IV is Heavy Timber construction and is considered ISO Class 2. The reason is that the heavy timbers perform well and do not fail early in a fire.

**Building elements:** Joisted Masonry buildings are buildings with exterior walls of masonry or fire-resistive construction rated for not less than one hour and with combustible floors and roofs. There are several types of masonry used in the exterior bearing walls of joisted masonry buildings: 
     * brick
     * concrete — either reinforced or non reinforced
     * hollow concrete masonry units
     * tile
     * stone
     * note that exterior bearing walls may also be any noncombustible materials with fire-resistance ratings of not less than one hour

[![Step 3 Variations:](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1f/Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#/Image:Determine-a-Building%27s-Construction-Type-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)[](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type)
3
**Variations:** There's one variation on joisted masonry construction that doesn't change the construction class — heavy timber or mill construction. Heavy timber construction uses wood members much larger than those found in frame (Construction Class 1) or other joisted masonry construction. If the building uses steel columns or beams for walls, the beams must be protected so they have a fire-resistance rating of not less than one hour. Heavy Timber Construction (IBC Type IV); ISO classifies the building as heavy timber construction if it meets these requirements: 
     * walls of masonry construction
     * floors of 3 inch (7.6 cm) wood plank or 4 inch (10.2 cm) laminated plank, both surfaced with 1 inch (2.5 cm) flooring
     * roof of 2 inch (5.1 cm) wood plank, 3 inch (7.6 cm) laminated plank, or 1-1/8 inch tongue-and-groove plywood deck
     * wood column supports not less than 8 inch (20.3 cm) x 8 inch (20.3 cm), wood beams or girders not less than 6 inch (15.2 cm) x 6 inch (15.2 cm), or protected metal

       * mineral wool
     * **Ceilings protecting steel beams or joists** : What happens when there is no fire-protection material applied to steel beams or joists that support floors or roofs? ISO still considers a building modified fire resistive if it has a _suitable ceiling_. Ceilings can be plaster or gypsum wallboard or suspended mineral tile. The entire floor-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting a floor) or roof-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting roof supports) should conform to construction details in a UL-listed or Factory Mutual (FM)-approved design. ISO individually evaluates each approved design.

Most residential homes are wood framed which would designate them as IBC class V or ISO class 1, however a home constructed with 4" + thick solid masonry exterior walls such as filled block or solid brick could be classified as IBC type II or ISO class 4 dependent on if the home has a concrete floor and the ceiling is 5/8" drywall or plaster.

It means it is an unprotected construction. Members rely on their natural fire resistance, rather than a cladding or other protection added to them to provide fire resistance.

Mobile homes are not regulated by IBC codes, but they do have their own construction codes through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Some newer mobile homes can be classified as similar to type-V construction.

[Article SummaryX](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-a-Building's-Construction-Type#summary_wrapper)
To determine a building's construction type, start by figuring out the building elements, or the materials that were used in its construction. Then, determine the building’s fire-resistance rating based on its weakest element. For example, if a building has a metal roof, but the exterior walls are made of wood, the fire rating would be based on wood since that's the weakest element. In that case, the building would be classified as a frame building with combustible elements, which would fall under ISO Class I or IBC Type V. To learn more, including how to classify buildings with insulation or slow-burning materials, read on.
