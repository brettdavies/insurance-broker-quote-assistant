## **Geico's DriveEasy program**
GEICO offers a usage-based insurance program called DriveEasy that can help low-mileage drivers save money. The program tracks mileage and other driving habits, saving policyholders up to 20%.
To qualify for GEICO's low-mileage discount, you typically need to drive fewer miles than the average driver. The exact mileage threshold can vary, but it generally applies to those who drive less than 7,500 miles per year. GEICO may require verification of your annual mileage to apply the low-mileage discount. This can be done through self-reporting or odometer readings. GEICO may ask for periodic odometer readings to verify your mileage.
When you select "Commute" as the vehicle's primary use, GEICO will ask you a few questions to determine your annual mileage estimate. You can also choose "Pleasure" as the primary use if your vehicle is rarely driven or only used for occasional errands.
In addition to the low-mileage discount, GEICO offers a variety of other discounts that can help lower your overall car insurance bill. For example, drivers can get a discount of up to 15% if they insure a car that's three years old or younger. You can also save up to 25% on your premium if you insure more than one car with GEICO. Opting for a higher deductible on any of your insurance policies from GEICO can also lower your premium. However, it's important to choose a deductible amount that you can still afford if you need to file a claim.
Practicing safe driving habits and avoiding moving violations can also help you qualify for lower GEICO insurance rates long-term. GEICO even offers a maximum 15% discount to drivers who take an approved defensive driving course.

## **Discounts for insuring multiple cars**
GEICO offers a discount of up to 25% on most car insurance coverages when you insure more than one car with them. This multi-car discount is automatically applied when a customer insures two or more vehicles on the same GEICO policy. To be eligible for the discount, all vehicles must be:
  * Private passenger vehicles such as cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, or minivans.
  * Registered in the same state.
  * Located at the same address.
  * Equipped with only factory equipment (no aftermarket modifications).
  * Registered to an owner who is listed on your policy.


In addition to the multi-car discount, GEICO offers other ways to save on your car insurance premium. These include:
  * Discounts for safe drivers with a clean driving record.
  * Discounts for completing a defensive driving course.
  * Discounts for insuring a new vehicle that is 3 model years old or newer.
  * Discounts for vehicles with extra safety features such as anti-lock brakes, airbags, and advanced collision avoidance systems.
  * Discounts for bundling your auto coverage with other insurance policies such as home or renters insurance.
  * Discounts for signing up for Auto Pay.
  * Discounts for military personnel, including active duty, retired, and National Guard or Reserve members.


It is important to note that discount availability, amount, and eligibility criteria may vary between states and GEICO companies. To confirm your eligibility for any discounts, it is recommended to contact GEICO directly or visit their website for more information.

## **Discounts for insuring a new car**
GEICO offers a range of discounts for customers insuring a new car. Firstly, if your new car is 3 model years old or newer, you could get up to a 15% discount on certain coverages. Safe drivers with a clean driving record can also save up to 22% on most GEICO coverages. This includes drivers who have completed a defensive driving course.
GEICO also offers a multi-vehicle discount of up to 25% on each car's premium when a customer insures two or more vehicles on the same policy. This discount also applies to motorcycles, RVs, and boats. Additionally, GEICO offers a multi-policy discount when you bundle your auto policy with other insurance policies such as homeowners, renters, motorcycle, and RV insurance.
If you're a student, you can also qualify for a good student discount by maintaining a B or B+ average or better. GEICO also offers discounts for government employees.
Furthermore, GEICO's DriveEasy program is a usage-based insurance program that tracks your driving habits and mileage, offering savings of up to 20%.
By taking advantage of these various discounts, you can significantly reduce your insurance premiums when insuring a new car with GEICO.

## **Lower rates for good credit**
GEICO offers a low mileage discount for policyholders who drive fewer miles than the average driver. This discount can help you save on your auto insurance premiums if you use your vehicle less frequently. The exact mileage threshold can vary, but it generally applies to those who drive less than 7,500 miles per year.
GEICO may require verification of your annual mileage to apply the low mileage discount. This can be done in several ways:
  * Self-Reporting: You may be asked to report your annual mileage when you apply for or renew your policy.
  * Odometer Readings: GEICO may ask for periodic odometer readings to verify your mileage.


GEICO also offers a usage-based insurance program called DriveEasy, which can help low-mileage drivers save money. DriveEasy tracks mileage and other driving habits, saving policyholders up to 20%.
In addition to taking advantage of GEICO's low mileage discount, there are several other ways to lower your car insurance rates if you have good credit. GEICO uses your credit data to calculate your premium in states where it is legal. As a result, having good credit makes you less of an insurance risk, which will reduce your rates over time.
  * Take advantage of GEICO discounts: GEICO offers a wide variety of discounts that can help lower your overall car insurance bill. For example, drivers can get a discount of up to 15% if they insure a car that's three years old or younger, or save up to 25% on their premium if they insure more than one car with GEICO.
  * Opt for a higher deductible: Choosing a higher deductible on your insurance policies can lower your premium. However, it's important to select a deductible amount that you can still afford if you need to file a claim.
  * Practice safe driving habits: Maintaining a good driving record and avoiding moving violations can help you qualify for lower insurance rates long-term. GEICO even offers a maximum 15% discount to drivers who take an approved defensive driving course.

## **Lower rates for good driving records**

GEICO also offers a discount on the comprehensive portion of premiums to customers who install anti-theft alarm systems. Completing a defensive driving course can also make you eligible for premium reductions depending on your age. GEICO also offers discounts to military members as well as federal employees.
Participating in a safe driving program, such as GEICO’s DriveEasy, can help lower your car insurance premiums by rewarding safe driving habits with discounts. The program uses a mobile app to track driving behaviors like speed, braking, and phone usage. If you demonstrate consistent safe driving, you may qualify for reduced premiums.
GEICO insurance rates can increase by about 79% after your first accident resulting in a claim of $750 or more. If you have more than two accidents in a three-year period, you can expect to pay 225% more. However, GEICO offers accident forgiveness in 47 states and the District of Columbia, excluding California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
