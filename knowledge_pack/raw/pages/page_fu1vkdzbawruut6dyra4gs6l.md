## Buyer's Guide to Get the Best Home and Auto Bundle
Bundling home and auto insurance saves policyholders about 13% on premiums while simplifying coverage with one provider. **State Farm offers the best and cheapest bundle at $2,559 per year** , combining affordability and service.
In some cases, separate policies can be cheaper. For example, Nationwide auto insurance and Progressive home insurance cost $3,224 annually — less than Progressive’s bundle but more than State Farm’s or Allstate’s. Some bundles, like Travelers' at $5,285 per year, are much more expensive, making separate policies a better option for certain drivers.
To find the most cost-effective coverage, [compare quotes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/) for bundling and separate policies, especially if you have [poor credit](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-for-drivers-with-bad-credit/) or a [bad driving record](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheap-car-insurance-after-a-bad-driving-record/).
### How to Bundle Home and Auto Insurance the Right Way
Follow these steps to maximize your savings with a car and homeowners insurance bundle:
  1. 1
Know your coverage
Review your current policies to determine your coverage level. Then, you can get quotes for the same coverage limits.
  2. 2
Get and compare quotes
Contact your current insurance company. Then, compare at least three other insurance companies for home and auto coverage. Ask for bundle quotes and individual quotes to compare. Compare equal coverage levels from each company.
  3. 3
Ask about discounts and deductibles
Ask insurers about available discounts to maximize your savings. Some companies also provide a single deductible for home and car damage if an incident affected both.
  4. 4
Consider customer service and claims handling
A low premium isn't the only factor. Look at customer satisfaction ratings and claims processing times to ensure reliable service.
  5. 5
Shop annually
Rates frequently change, so complete this process every year or two for the best deal.


### Questions to Ask When Buying a Home and Auto Bundle
**1. How much will I actually save by bundling compared to separate policies?**
Ask for exact dollar amounts rather than just percentage discounts, as the savings can vary widely based on your specific coverage needs. Request quotes for bundled and separate policies to confirm you're getting the best deal, as bundling isn't always cheaper.
**2. Will I have a single deductible if my home and car are damaged in the same incident?**
Some companies let you pay just one deductible when the same disaster hits your home and car. So if a storm damages your house and vehicle, you'd pay one deductible instead of two. That can save you thousands during a claim, though not every insurer offers this option.
**3. How will bundling affect my coverage limits and policy terms?**
Ensure bundling doesn't result in reduced coverage or higher deductibles in exchange for lower premiums. Ask for a side-by-side comparison of your current coverage versus the proposed bundle to identify any differences in protection levels or policy terms.
**4. What happens to my bundle discount if I need to file a claim?**
Some insurers may reduce or eliminate bundle discounts after claims, while others maintain the same discount regardless of claim history. Understanding this policy beforehand can help you anticipate potential premium increases after filing a claim.
**5. Can I have different renewal dates for each policy within my bundle?**
While bundling typically aligns your policies to a single renewal date for convenience, some companies allow flexibility in setting different dates. This can help spread out payments throughout the year if you prefer not having both premiums due simultaneously.
