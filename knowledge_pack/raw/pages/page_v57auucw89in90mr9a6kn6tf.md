You can go to the building department in your city/county and ask them to pull the permit on when the roof was replaced. insurance companies are getting very strict on the age of roofs. They have been burned many times on misrepresentation of roof age and condition.

Insurance companies are putting the clamp down. Had a buyer in a similar situation. State Farm would not issue the insurance. We tell the seller. Seller says “State Farm is our insurer”. Insurance companies are con artists.

Yes its roofers but we let homeowners off the hook FAR too often. People do not maintain their dwellings in an appropriate way.

That’s when you pull insurance agents together and get them to work it out. That’s so ridiculous.

A lot of insurance companies are really getting nitpicky about this stuff. If you don't have the documentation, you just don't have it. Either the insurance company can find a way to insure it, or they find a different insurance company. I've had to find new insurance last minute (once just a day before closing) because insurance threw a kink in it last minute. Insurance companies generally suck.

I have had them ask before, gave them the answer you did and they just moved on and wrote the policy anyway. 
I think they made the assumption, without evidence to the contrary, that the roof was at the end of its life but were willing to insure it anyway. 
Hopefully there is an insurance underwriter in here that can shed light for all of us.

My experience as a recent buyer: we had the inspection report saying it was in fair condition, no leaks. We knew some of it was 10 yrs old and some older but no date. Mortgage co demanded full replacement value be covered-One week before close. Insurance said no. We went to four different brokers and found a credit meant that would cover it. Then one month after we move in the inspector comes out. Another month passes. Insurance says we must replace roof. They gave us 22 days to get it done and it was still winter and raining so roofers couldn’t schedule us until May. So now we have to take insurance of last resort (ca fair plan) for a few weeks to cover the gap and we are out 30k for a new roof that was otherwise “fair” and in good condition.

Insurance has been the new PITA past few years, when it comes to closing. (Pain in the ass, not the delicious Greek Sandwich) 
“Roof Age” and “Trees to close to the property” are the biggest culprits 
I would go over your contract with your agent and or a lawyer and get to negotiating back up plans. 
Worst case scenario, if buyers have cold feet they can use insurance company to try and get out of contract last minute. 
Best Case Scenario: You tell their insurance company you don’t have that info, they say ok and insure the buyers anyway, and everyone standing around like “Why’d you even ask if it wasn’t a big deal?” 
Other options sucky to not sucky. Buyer finds different insurance company. You replace the roof negotiate price adjustment (long as buyers lenders cool with it).

I'd answer honestly and see what they say. 
Sometimes lenders, when unsure about roof age, will ask a licensed roofer to take a look at give a 'roof certification' that states the roof has at least X remaining years. 3 is the minimum I've ever heard lenders accept. So if the insurance company isn't happy with your lack of documentation, perhaps they'll accept a professional assessment. 
You should be able to get a roofer out in a day or two, they might charge $100 or so, but it can be done.

This is the buyers problem. It sounds like he told his insurance carrier that the roof was brand new or 1-2 years old (to get cheaper insurance) and they called BS on it by looking at satellite images, so they're going to make him prove the age. As long as you didn't tell him something clearly wrong, this is on them. He can hire an inspector to come out and look at the roof and give an educated guess on how old it is. 
Or, easier, the buyer can tell his insurer that the roof is 8-10 years old and they should still write the policy, but they'll give him depreciated roof coverage (usually). 
I'm an insurance agent. Happy to answer any questions.

So I had an insurance person give me trouble finding insurance saying I can’t because of the roof age proof. And then I called a different agent and they said this is odd and was able to sign me up for insurance just fine with me telling him the age of the roof. He said the company will sometimes send someone out to take pictures but that usually happens later, and they don’t usually care as long as it doesn’t look like you were blatantly lying (like saying it’s brand new when it’s never been fixed) so try calling a different insurance agent! Knock on wood, but that worked for us.

It's on the buyer's side. I hope they do that. I think their mortgage company is pressuring them to use a specific insurer (and their realtor...all connected) 
And thank you!!

Oh yes sorry I read that wrong! And definitely that’s what’s happening, the lady who told me I couldn’t get insurance without proof was an insurance agent from the lender company. I ended up calling my agent I’ve worked with for my car insurance for a long time and he got it going for me. So hopefully they will have a similar experience! 😊

My insurance company (Farmers) required roof documentation during my closing last year when I was a buyer. After providing it to them, they had multiple follow-up questions/requirements about the roof.

I'm a buyer, and I just learned this today when we liked for homeowners insurance as required to close. Insurers want to charge bigly for coverage for success under a few years old (eg 10). Gotta love those insurance companies - really looking out for us.

Worst case is have a roofer do an inspection and provide a report of his findings.

In the California Residential Purchase Agreement we now have a separate place for an insurance contingency and once that contingency is removed, buyers can’t back out for insurance reasons. 
If you’re closing this week I assume that all the buyers contingencies have run out but if they’re getting a loan the lender will need proof of insurance so hopefully this doesn’t hold up closing. 
If there’s reference to roof age or replacement in previous listings, you could share that with the buyers. Sometimes insurance companies are just looking for any reference to the age. And the buyers can check permit history with the city although many roofers don’t pull permits, at least not in my area, even though they’re supposed to.
