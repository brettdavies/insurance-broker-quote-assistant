GEICO and State Farm are insurance giants. Their commercials featuring Jake (and his khakis) and the gecko are television mainstays, and they both offer a broad range of coverage options. 
Both companies have strong records for customer satisfaction, reliability, and financial stability, but they do differ significantly in several ways. While State Farm is likely the better choice for those who prefer in-person assistance, GEICO offers a stellar digital experience, making it easier to buy coverage online. 
In this breakdown of GEICO vs. State Farm, learn about how these companies compare in terms of availability, extra benefits, and discount programs.

Drivers who switch their auto insurance and save with State Farm save $764 on average!
### Financial Stability
When choosing an insurer, it's wise to look up the company's financial stability rating to ensure it is financially sound and able to pay out future claims. AM Best is a credit rating agency that evaluates insurance companies and issues ratings based on its opinion of companies' financial strength. Both State Farm and GEICO earned AM Best's highest financial strength rating of A++. 
### Customer Satisfaction
When I'm shopping for insurance, one of the factors I keep in mind is customer ratings. While a few bad reviews aren't enough to deter me, if the overwhelming majority tend to be negative, that's a red flag for me because it indicates that the company is unlikely to be helpful if I have questions or need to file a claim. 
In the J.D. Power Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, State Farm scored better than most; it was ranked sixth out of 21 insurers with a score well above the industry average. By contrast, GEICO didn't perform so well; it ranked 14th out of 21 with a score below the average.

### Contact
When researching companies, think about how you like to communicate with your insurer. If you prefer a completely digital experience — from online quote to completing the purchase of coverage — GEICO is likely a better fit. You can get a quote, adjust your coverages, and purchase a policy entirely online. 
If you, like me, prefer the ability to contact a local agent and have in-person assistance, State Farm is the better choice. The company has a network of over 19,000 agents throughout the country, so you likely have a State Farm office near you. After my car was damaged in a hurricane, having a local agent to talk to about the claim and how auto and homeowners insurance work was a huge help. 
### Claims
Hopefully, you won't have to use your insurance policy. But if you are in an accident, you want to know that your insurance company can be relied on to handle the claim quickly and efficiently. 
One excellent resource to check on how well a company handles claims is The Crash Network's Insurer Report Card. The report card surveys body shop owners and mechanics about their experience working with insurance companies to repair customers' vehicles after accidents. 
Both GEICO and State Farm received C- grades on the report card (a typical grade for large insurers). State Farm just edged out GEICO, placing one spot higher.

## GEICO DriveEasy vs. State Farm Drive Safe & Save
Usage-based insurance (UBI) or telematics policies use mobile apps or devices to track your driving habits and vehicle usage. Those who drive fewer-than-average miles, watch their speeds, and avoid using their phone while they drive can substantially lower their premiums by enrolling in UBIs. For example, I work from home, so I drive much less than most drivers. Because I signed up for a UBI policy, I was able to cut my premiums by about 30%. 
GEICO's program is called DriveEasy, while State Farm's is Drive Safe & Save. 
GEICO's DriveEasy program is only available in 38 states and the District of Columbia. 
With State Farm's Drive Safe & Save program, you can qualify for a 10% discount for enrolling in the program and additional discounts if you drive safely. However, the program isn't available in California, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island. 
## Coverage
GEICO and State Farm offer broad coverage options, including full coverage policies and specialty policies for antique or collector cars. However, there are two key distinctions. 
  * **Rideshare coverage:** For those who drive for services like Uber, Lyft, or Instacart, State Farm allows policyholders to add rideshare insurance to their personal policies for added protection. GEICO doesn't offer rideshare insurance, but it does partner with other companies to connect users to coverage options. 
  * **Mexico coverage:** If you plan to drive your car into Mexico, you'll need a specialty policy to protect your vehicle. GEICO offers policies for those traveling to Mexico.
