# Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage Necessary in California?
August 15, 2024 – Sean Shamsi
![Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage Necessary in the California? - Call 818-764-7640](https://shamsilaw.com/wp-content/uploads/Is-Uninsured-Motorist-Coverage-Necessary-in-California.png)
As you navigate California’s congested highways and winding coastal roads, have you considered what might happen if you’re involved in an accident with an uninsured driver? It’s a scenario more common than many realize, and it raises an important question for every California motorist: [Is uninsured motorist coverage necessary](https://shamsilaw.com/practice-areas/car-accidents/), or simply an optional add-on?
While it’s not legally required in California, understanding its potential impact on your financial security is crucial. In this blog, a [North Hollywood car accident lawyer](https://shamsilaw.com/practice-areas/car-accidents/) from The Shamsi Law Firm explains uninsured motorist coverage, examining its benefits, costs, and relevance in today’s driving landscape.
## Understanding Uninsured Motorist Coverage
Before we explore its necessity, it’s important to understand what uninsured motorist coverage actually is. This type of insurance protects you if you’re involved in an accident with a driver who **does not** have insurance coverage to pay for your damages.
In California, [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/01-auto/auto101.cfm) is optional and typically includes two main components:
  * **Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI):** This covers medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering for you and your passengers if you’re in an accident caused by an uninsured driver. The coverage limits for UMBI usually match your liability coverage limits. UMBI can also cover bodily injury expenses in hit-and-run accidents where the driver cannot be identified.
  * **Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD):** This covers damage to your vehicle caused by an uninsured driver, up to a limit of $3,500. This coverage only applies if the uninsured driver is identified. If you already have collision coverage, you might not need UMPD, as collision insurance typically covers this scenario as well.


You can also add **Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UIM)** to your policy. This coverage provides protection if you’re in an accident with a driver who has insurance, but their coverage is not sufficient to cover all your damages. UIM helps cover the difference between the at-fault driver’s insurance and your actual expenses.
When considering your insurance options, evaluate each component of uninsured motorist coverage and decide if you need to include underinsured motorist coverage based on your personal circumstances, such as the value of your vehicle, your health insurance situation, and your ability to handle unexpected costs.
## The Legal Requirements in California
Even though uninsured motorist coverage is optional, it’s important to understand how it fits with California’s insurance requirements. The state mandates that drivers carry liability insurance with [minimum coverages](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/01-auto/auto101.cfm) of:
  * $15,000 for injury/death to one person
  * $30,000 for injury/death to more than one person
  * $5,000 for property damage


While you’re not required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage, having only the state-mandated liability insurance might leave you financially vulnerable. If you’re involved in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver, you could end up paying significant out-of-pocket expenses for your injuries or vehicle damage. Uninsured motorist coverage can help cover these costs and provide additional protection, reducing the risk of unexpected financial burdens.
It’s also important to note that Insurance companies are required to offer you uninsured motorist coverage, but you have the option to decline it. If you choose to do so, you must provide a written rejection.
## The Uninsured Driver Problem in California
Now, you might be thinking, “If it’s not required, why should I bother?” Here’s where things get interesting. California has one of the highest rates of uninsured drivers in the nation. According to [recent statistics](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), about 17% of California drivers are uninsured. That means nearly one in six drivers you encounter on the road may not have insurance.
## The Potential Consequences of Being Unprotected
Imagine you’re driving home from work, and suddenly an uninsured driver runs a red light and crashes into your car. Without uninsured motorist coverage, you could be left to pay for some of your medical bills and car repairs out of pocket. Even if you sue the at-fault driver, they likely won’t have the assets to cover your expenses if they couldn’t afford insurance in the first place.
## The Benefits of Uninsured Motorist Coverage
By opting for uninsured motorist coverage, you gain several advantages:
  * **Financial protection:** You won’t have to rely on the other driver’s ability to pay for damages.
  * **Coverage for hit-and-run accidents:** If the at-fault driver flees the scene, your uninsured motorist coverage can still protect you.
  * **Additional coverage for underinsured drivers:** Many policies also include protection against drivers who have insurance but not enough to cover all your damages.
  * **Protection as a pedestrian or cyclist:** Your coverage typically extends to situations where you’re hit by an uninsured driver while walking or biking.


## Weighing the Costs
Of course, adding uninsured motorist coverage to your policy will increase your premiums. However, the cost is often relatively modest compared to the potential financial risk of being unprotected. You’ll need to weigh this additional expense against your personal risk tolerance and financial situation.
## Making Your Decision
Ultimately, the decision to purchase uninsured motorist coverage in California is yours to make. Consider your driving habits, financial situation, and risk tolerance. If you frequently drive in areas with high rates of uninsured drivers or if a potential financial setback from an accident would be devastating, uninsured motorist coverage might be a wise choice.
Remember, insurance is all about peace of mind. While you hope never to need it, having uninsured motorist coverage can provide an extra layer of security as you navigate California’s busy roads.
Before making your final decision, it’s always a good idea to speak with a licensed insurance agent who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They can help you understand the exact costs and benefits for your situation, ensuring you make the best choice for your needs.
