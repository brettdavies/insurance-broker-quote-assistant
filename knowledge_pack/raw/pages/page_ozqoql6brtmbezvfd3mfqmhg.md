## Ways to lower home insurance
Shopping around, minimizing your risk of claims, putting your best foot forward — taking one or all of these steps are sure to help you get [cheap homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/discounts/cheap-home-insurance/%20). If you're wondering why your rate is high, you can try these tips to help lower your home insurance premium:
  * **Shop around with HomeQuote Explorer®** : Progressive's extensive network of homeowners insurance carriers can help you shop around for a rate that's right for you. Whether you're looking to cover a condo downtown or a sprawling suburban suite, [HomeQuote Explorer](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/homequote-explorer/)® can help you find the coverage and rate that's right for you.
  * **Increase your deductible** : Increasing the amount of your [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-deductible/) can help you lower your rate overall. Just know that if you make a claim, you'll be responsible for more out-of-pocket. Use our [home insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/calculator/) to determine what your deductible could be.
  * **Build a bundle** : The bigger the bundle, the bigger the savings. [Bundle homeowners with an existing auto policy](https://www.progressive.com/insurance/bundling/) and save. Have a couple of toys to throw in? Add a boat, RV, or motorcycle to get the lowest home insurance cost.
  * **Take advantage of discounts** : Who doesn't love a discount? And boy, do we have [homeowners insurance discounts](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/discounts/). Something as simple as going paperless can make it so you have more paper in your pocket.
  * **Adjust your coverages** : Compare your policy and your [home inventory](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-create-a-home-inventory/) to make sure you have the coverages that are right for you. Are you covering things you no longer have? Or could you lower an asset's overall value based on depreciation?
  * **Secure your assets** : [Adding a security system](https://www.progressive.com/answers/will-security-system-lower-insurance/) is an up-front expense you may see pay itself off with savings over the lifetime of your homeowners insurance policy.
  * **Avoid attractive nuisances** : While in-ground pools and trampolines sound like all fun and games, they tend to increase your [homeowners insurance rate](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-homeowners-insurance-cost/). Be sure to factor that expense in as you determine if it's best to just head to the local pool next summer instead of adding an [attractive nuisance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/what-is-an-attractive-nuisance/) to your home.
  * **Consider key home renovations** : Some home renovations and improvements increase your rate, but certain upgrades can help reduce your rate for some insurers, too – especially if you live in an [older home](https://www.progressive.com/answers/homeowners-insurance-for-older-homes/). See what [home improvements or renovations](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-improvements-renovations-insurance/) could impact your rate.
  * **Know the score** : You might keep an eye on your credit score, but did you know that your insurance score could also play a factor in your [homeowners insurance cost](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-homeowners-insurance-cost/)? Keep tabs on your driving and accident history in addition to your credit score, even if it is for homeowners insurance.
