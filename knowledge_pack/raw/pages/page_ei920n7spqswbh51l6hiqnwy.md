At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.

## Homeowners insurance perils
Some of the most common [**home insurance perils**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/named-perils/) include fire, lightning, wind, hail, water damage, freezing, theft, and liability risks.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-3) But home insurance doesn’t cover all perils. For example, standard home insurance doesn’t cover earthquake or flood damage. If you want coverage for earthquakes or floods, you’ll need separate earthquake and flood insurance policies.
The most expensive perils to claim are fire and lightning, which cost an average of $83,991 per claim, according to Triple-I. The most common perils homeowners claim are wind and hail, making up 40.7% of all home insurance claims in 2022.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-2)

## Homeowners insurance claims
The most common [**home insurance claims**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/how-to-file-a-home-insurance-claim/) involve the following perils: wind and hail, water damage and freezing, and fire and lightning. These three damages made up 90.2% of all claims submitted in 2022.
The average cost of a claim payout between 2018 and 2022 was $15,749, according to Triple-I.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-2) Submitting claims can affect the price of your home insurance policy, as insurers will potentially see your home as a higher risk than before.
Here are the perils homeowners filed claims for in 2022, according to Triple-I.

## 2024 trends in the home insurance industry
Home insurance prices have been increasing across the country for the last few years due to a number of factors, including inflation and climate concerns. The average annual cost of home insurance in the U.S. increased from $1,984 in 2021 to $2,377 in 2023 and will likely increase to $2,522 by the end of 2024, according to Insurify data.[[1]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-1)
States in areas that see a lot of extreme weather have seen the most intense increases. Florida, Oklahoma, and Louisiana are among the hardest-hit states when it comes to home insurance costs, as they face a lot of coastal flooding and tornadoes.
## Homeowners insurance policies
The most common homeowners insurance policy is the [**HO-3 policy**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/ho3-home-insurance/), also known as the special form policy. This policy covers damage from fire, extreme weather, theft, falling trees, and personal liability, among other things. An HO-1 policy, also known as the basic form policy, is less robust. It covers fire but doesn’t include damage from fallen trees.
Companies sell various other types of home insurance policies, including specific ones for condos and mobile homes. The right policy for you depends on your location, financial situation, and coverage needs. If you have concerns about potential severe damages, an [**HO-5**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/), also known as a comprehensive form policy, might be right for you.
Common coverage limits are between $250,000 and $500,000, and typical deductibles are between $500 and $2,500. Although home insurance is a great tool for property owners, states don’t require it, so many homeowners are uninsured or underinsured.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-3) Of homeowners in the U.S., 88% have insurance and 12% don’t have coverage for their homes.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/homeowners-insurance-facts/#cite-4)

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000
