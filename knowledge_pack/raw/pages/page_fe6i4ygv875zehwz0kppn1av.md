## **1. Florida Building Code: Requirements for Hurricane Shutters**
The Florida Building Code (FBC) serves as the primary source of regulations governing the construction and installation of hurricane shutters in Fort Myers. These stringent regulations aim to ensure that new shutter installations can withstand high wind speeds and flying debris, protecting homes from storm damage. Key aspects of the FBC as it relates to hurricane shutters include:
**– Wind-borne debris regions:** Locations within Florida deemed at higher risk for hurricane damage require hurricane shutters on homes that have glazed (glass-containing) openings, like windows and doors.
**– Impact-resistance standards:** The FBC mandates specific impact resistance standards for hurricane shutters, which can vary depending on your home’s location and proximity to the coast.
**– Hurricane shutter ratings:** The ASTM International and Miami-Dade County provide testing guidelines to assess the effectiveness of hurricane shutters. Ensure that your selected shutter type is tested and rated according to these standards for compliance.
## **2. Permits and Inspections: Regulatory Procedures for Compliance**
Before installing hurricane shutters on your Fort Myers home, it’s essential to understand the permitting and inspection processes and how they ensure compliance with local building codes. Here’s what you need to know:
**– Permit requirements:** Most hurricane shutter installations require a permit from your local building department. Be prepared to provide information on the shutter type, installation specifications, and property information. Check with your city or county office for specific requirements, application fees, and processing times.
**– Inspections:** After obtaining a permit and completing the installation, an inspection may be required to ensure your hurricane shutters comply with local building codes. During the inspection, a building official will verify that your shutters meet guidelines and function correctly.
**– Violation consequences:** Non-compliant installations can result in fines or mandatory upgrades to meet FBC standards. Stay proactive by adhering to regulations to avoid costly penalties and keep your home protected.
## **3. Choosing a Licensed Contractor: Credentials and Expertise Matter**
To ensure a compliant and quality installation of your hurricane shutters, selecting a licensed and experienced contractor is crucial. Keep the following factors in mind when hiring a contractor for your hurricane shutter installation:
**– License and insurance:** Verify that your chosen contractor is state-licensed and insured. Florida requires contractors to maintain a general contractor, building contractor, or residential contractor license for hurricane shutter installations.
**– Contractor credentials:** For ultimate peace of mind, look for contractors who are members of professional associations or maintain additional certifications in the field of hurricane protection.
**– References and reviews:** Request references and read online reviews to gauge the contractor’s reputation, quality of work, and adherence to building code requirements.
## **4. Ongoing Maintenance and Code Compliance**
Maintaining your hurricane shutters is essential to retaining their performance, safety, and adherence to local building codes. Conduct regular inspections to ensure that your shutters are:
**– Functioning correctly:** Test your hurricane shutters’ operability and ensure that locking mechanisms, tracks, and other components are in proper working order.
**– Without visible damage:** Inspect shutters for signs of corrosion, peeling paint, or other damage that could compromise their effectiveness during a storm.
**– Meeting updated regulations:** Stay abreast of changes to building codes and regulations and update your hurricane shutters when necessary to adhere to evolving requirements.
