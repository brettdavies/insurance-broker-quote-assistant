# How Much Is a $1 Million Umbrella Policy?
/ [Insurance Articles](https://eugenecyates.com/category/insurance-articles/)
![](https://eugenecyates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/umbrella-agreement-e1628812211421-1024x683.jpg)
If you already have homeowners and auto insurance, you might think you’re fully protected. But what happens if you’re sued for more than your policy limits cover? That’s where an **umbrella insurance policy** comes in. It provides an extra layer of liability protection — often at a surprisingly affordable price.
So how much does a **$1 million umbrella policy** really cost, and what does it cover? Let’s break it down.
* * *
## ☂️ What Is Umbrella Insurance?
Umbrella insurance is **extra liability coverage** that kicks in when your home, auto, or rental insurance limits are exceeded.
For example, if you’re found liable for an accident and your auto policy covers up to $300,000 but the total damages are $900,000, your umbrella policy can pay the remaining $600,000 — protecting your savings, property, and future income.
* * *
## 💵 Average Cost of a $1 Million Umbrella Policy
Most people are surprised to learn how **affordable umbrella coverage** can be.
In general, a **$1 million umbrella insurance policy costs between $150 and $400 per year** , depending on:
  * Your location (urban vs. rural areas)
  * The number of vehicles and properties you own
  * Your personal risk profile (e.g., teenage drivers, swimming pool, rental homes)
  * Your insurance provider and existing policies


The good news? The more policies you already have with the same insurer (like home and auto), the **lower your umbrella premium** tends to be.
* * *
## 🔢 Cost Breakdown for Higher Coverage
Here’s a quick look at how premiums typically scale:
Coverage Amount | Estimated Annual Cost  
---|---  
$1 Million | $150 – $400  
$2 Million | $250 – $550  
$5 Million | $500 – $1,000+  
Adding extra millions in coverage usually doesn’t multiply your cost — meaning each additional $1 million of protection is cheaper than the first.
* * *
## 🧾 What Does an Umbrella Policy Cover?
Umbrella insurance covers **liability claims** that exceed your primary policies, such as:
  * Bodily injury liability (auto or home accidents)
  * Property damage to others
  * Personal liability lawsuits (libel, slander, defamation)
  * Legal defense costs


However, it typically **doesn’t cover** your own property damage or intentional acts.
* * *
## 🏡 Why Sacramento Residents Benefit from Umbrella Coverage
In Sacramento, higher property values and rising legal costs make liability coverage more important than ever. Homeowners, landlords, and even small business owners can face six-figure lawsuits that quickly drain savings or home equity.
A $1 million umbrella policy can provide the peace of mind of knowing you’re protected — without breaking your budget.
* * *
## ✅ Final Thoughts
A **$1 million umbrella insurance policy** is one of the most cost-effective ways to protect your assets. For just a few hundred dollars a year, you can safeguard your financial future from unexpected lawsuits and liability claims.
