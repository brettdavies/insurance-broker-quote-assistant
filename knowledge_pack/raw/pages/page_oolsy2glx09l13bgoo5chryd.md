#  Progressive "Policy Fee" on Auto Policy 
I just discovered that my Progressive auto policy has a $50 every 6 months "policy fee" that my insurance agent is charging me for handling my policy, which he didn't tell me about. When I called Progressive to try to get rid of the agent and just deal directly with Progressive, I got all kinds of bad customer service. The third person I talked to wouldn't tell me how much the policy would be without an agent even though Progressive has access to my policy. I finally was able to get a Progressive quote online, and it was 50% higher than what I am paying with the agent. Usually, a policy without an agent should be cheaper. Does anyone know what is going on here? I would appreciate any guidance.

Out of curiosity, why would the assumption be that a policy without an agent should be cheaper? Having an independent agent has significantly lower overhead than having to staff up direct customer service; not to mention independent agents generally have stickier business which even further drives down an insurer’s acquisition exoense.

What’s going on here? 
You have a blatant and raging misunderstanding of every term used around your policy, have launched yourself off on a tangent and wasted a shitload of time. 
  1. The “policy fee” is not charged by your agent. It’s part of the policy premium. Your agent can’t just add things to the actual policy premiums itself - any agency or broker fees would be disclosed on an entirely separate set of paperwork that you’d frankly have to be rather smooth brained to have “just discovered” 
  2. Progressive has two different products, direct and agency. They have different rate plans. 
  3. Selling policies direct can often be far more expensive than through an independent contractor agency. 


Bottom line. Every single assumption you made to get yourself to this point was faulty, resulting in a rather large waste of time and energy.

When I called Progressive, the customer service agent told me that the “policy fee” was charged by the insurance agent. 
Thank you for wasting your time telling me how ”faulty” and stupid I am and how smart and superior you are. I’m sorry that you are so insecure that you have to insult someone to feel good about yourself.

There wasn't a single insulted contained in my post. Your logic was simply faulty. If you get your bill from Progressive, it's for Amount A - why pay amount B? Did you read the fee disclosure provided by the agent?

Mostly correct, policy fees can be charged by agents in most states in addition to the carriers policy costs. Usually this is done for higher risk business that is less likely to stick around or is mono line like auto only to make it worth the agents time.

Just because you didn’t read the agency fee agreement doesn’t mean they didn’t notify you. Every state I know makes agents disclose all fees they charge. If the policy was a good price when you bought it, why are you complaining?

There was an agency fee of $108 I had to pay upfront. That is why the "policy fee" is baffling.

There are many agencies that charge an application fee, renewal fee, or many other types of fees. The point is, the price was good enough that you still took the policy.

Progressive direct is a different paper with different rates and filings than progressives agency channel, sounds like you want the service of an agent for free.

I went through the Progressive website to get a quote. What is the "Progressive Direct" website? Do you have a link for it because when I look for "Progressive Direct" online, all that comes up is the regular Progressive website. 
No, I don't want the service of an agent for free. I want to deal directly with Progressive. Dealing with the agent just adds another layer of bureaucracy to the process. I paid an agency fee upfront with the insurance agent, in addition to the "policy fee" on the Progressive policy.

Direct just means you bought through progressive, not through an agent. Even if you have an agent you can service the policy yourself online or with progressive directly, you dont necessarily need to contact your agent for anything. Since you already got a quote and it’s more expensive then just keep your current policy.

Are you certain that this is a fee your agency is charging you? Tons of policies have a policy fee that has nothing to do with agent compensation, it just means the carrier doesn't want you to cancel on day one after they've done a bunch of work to set up your policy and they get nothing from it.

So a fun fact, the average google adds search cost for a direct to consumer product on auto insurance in CA is about $350 (I worked in this industry in CA not sure other states). So a direct to consumer product is $350 acquisition costs for a policy. A carrier that uses an agent usually pays that agent 10% of premium as a commission, so unless your auto premium is $3.5K or more paying an agent is actually a cheaper acquisition cost than direct to consumer (for new business at least, gets much cheaper at renewal for direct to consumer product

Policy fee rules vary by state. Your agent may charge the fee directly without a lot of input by the carrier in some states. In other states the carrier may charge it without any input from the agents. It would be conventional wisdom that direct prices would be less, but it’s not a rule. You may be on a legacy product that will always be cheaper than what’s available for new business.

So for $50, you will pay 50% more? If I found out my client was trying to ace me out of deal, I would help you do it and non-renew you at renewal. Even now he know the agent has done real work to save OP money he still wants to screw him. You would be walking away from my office, you are for the streets.

No, of course not. I was just trying to get information here. I was not trying to "ace" anyone out of a deal. I already paid a $108 agency fee, as well as the $50 "policy fee" when I signed up for this agent 6 months ago.
