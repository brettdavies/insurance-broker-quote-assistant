#  State Farm umbrella policy 
What does it really cover? I have my home and auto plus an umbrella policy with State Farm. What am I really paying for with an umbrella policy. I have full coverage on all vehicles, uninsured motorist etc. Is the umbrella policy still a good idea? No one ever explained it to me, they just said to have it with minor drivers, 24, 22,16.

An umbrella kicks in if you max out the liability limits on the underlying policies, in this case, your home and auto. If you or anyone else on your policy are liable for an accident and the amount you're liable for exceeds the limit on your home or auto, your umbrella will cover the remaining amount up to the limit. Without an umbrella, if the amount of damages exceeds your policy limit, the injured party could sue you in court and come after any other assets you have. 
With minor/young drivers, you are at a MUCH higher risk of an at fault accident. The advice given to you to carry an umbrella is good advice in general, not just because of young drivers.

There is no such thing as "full coverage" - even worse, it means different things to different people in different circumstances. Stop using the term and instead be specific about what coverages you have, which could include some or all of: 
  * Collision (with or without New Vehicle Replacement Cost) 
  * Comprehensive (with or without New Vehicle Replacement Cost) 
  * Coverage for Modifications to a vehicle 
  * PIP or Med-Pay 
  * Glass 
  * Rental 
  * BI Liability 
  * PD Liability 
  * Uninsured BI 
  * Underinsured BI 
  * Uninsured PD 
  * Underinsured PD 


Not all are available in all states or situations, but it's important to understand exactly what your policy does and does not cover so you're not surprised when you're already in a bad situation after a loss. 
That said - an umbrella policy provides additional liability limits above the liability limits on your primary policies. Umbrella coverage is a good idea if you have significant assets to protect, or likely will have significant assets anytime in the next 10 years (since most judgments are good for at least 10 years). 
The reason your broker/agent is suggesting umbrella coverage with minor drivers is that they are far, far, far more likely to cause a high six or even seven figure loss, and if you only have $250K in liability limits on your primary policy and no umbrella, you (and your children) will be on the hook for damages above $250K. If you have significant assets, you're a target for a big lawsuit, and you want to push that risk onto an insurance company when you can. That's what an umbrella is for. Your 16 year old hits a school bus and injures kids who then need lifelong care, you better find a way to cover a few million in damages. It's either coming out of your insurance limits or your assets (at least the ones you can't protect).

You're increasing you liability coverage limits for both home and auto to the umbrella limits (usually $1M). 
This provides more protection of your personal assets. If your liable for a severe bodily injury standard limits won't even be enough for medical bills these days and the injured party could attach your personal assets in the event of a jury award in excess of your standard liability limits. 
I'm a retired insurance claims guy. I have an umbrella.

If you have substantial assets, no matter whether you have kids driving it is a good idea to have an umbrella. $1M is good, $2M even better.

Increasing them **by** the umbrella limit right? You get the underlying plus the umbrella don't you?

Thanks for the fast replies. I seem to remember it was $45 a month, and now it's $79. Still cheap, I guess, but why the increase? 
Because everything costs more. Duh.

Not only to things cost more, but umbrella policies are really susceptible to social inflation. Juries are increasingly handing out larger and larger judgements thinking they're "sticking it to the man" when all they're doing is driving up the costs for everyone.

Had an acquaintance who in the rain clipped the front of a tractor trailer sending into the medium. Company claimed almost $750,000 in damages for the cargo and truck damage. Her insurance paid out $250,000 and she was sued for the rest. The next day I upped my vehicle to $500,000 liability and added $1,00,000 umbrella. It’s like $600 a year.

If you have a $1M Umbrella Policy, that will cover any liability claims in excess of the liability limits you have on the other policies. They usually require you to keep at least $300K liability on both of those policies. If you have say $500K and want to drop it down to $300K, first ask SF how much will it raise the Umbrella policy. It usually balances out. It's a good thing to have, especially if you have risky drivers or things like a dog or swimming pool and someone sues if they get bit, their child drowns, etc. If your liability is at $300K and you get sued for $1M, and they settle for $750K, the other policies will pay $300K, and the umbrella will pay $450K. If you don't have umbrella, you risk losing your assets to pay anything awarded above your other $300K coverages.

When you have kids having an umbrella is a smart move to protect your assets in case of large loss. 
Kids can do dumb things and that can leads to major accidents and potential large payouts.
