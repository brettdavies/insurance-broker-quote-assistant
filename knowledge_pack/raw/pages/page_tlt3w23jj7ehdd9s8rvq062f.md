## Do car insurance rates go down at age 18?
An 18-year-old driver can expect to pay less for car insurance than younger, less experienced drivers.
**On average, 18-year-old drivers pay 13% less for car insurance than 17-year-olds.** At 18 years old, you have more driving experience than newly licensed 16- and 17-year-olds. [Your rates reflect that](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-age-affects-auto-insurance-costs "How Age Affects Car Insurance Costs").
Drivers under the age of 25 tend to have high insurance rates. That's because they're more likely to make mistakes and cause accidents. As you get older and have more driving experience under your belt, your insurance rates should start to drop.
[New drivers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-new-drivers "The Best Car Insurance for New Drivers") are an exception to this rule. If you're a new driver at 18 years old, you'll likely pay more than a driver who got their license at age 16 and has two years of driving experience.

*USAA is only available to current and former military members and their families.
Men ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be involved in a fatal car crash as women in that age group. That makes male teens a much higher risk to insurance companies.
However, some states don't allow insurance companies to use gender to determine car insurance rates.
  * California 
  * Hawaii 
  * Massachusetts 


  * Michigan 
  * North Carolina 
  * Pennsylvania 


Men and women in these locations should pay the same price for auto insurance coverage, all else being equal.

## Can an 18-year-old get their own car insurance?
An 18-year-old can buy their own car insurance policy.
**However, you should[share a policy with your parents](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers#parent "Cheapest Car Insurance for Teens") if possible.** It's usually much cheaper than having your own separate policy.
Parents typically see their rates go up when they add a teen driver to their policy. They can help offset the increased cost by asking for [discounts aimed at teens](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts"). For example, you could get a good student discount if your teen has a minimum 3.0 GPA.
* * *
## How to get cheap auto insurance for 18-year-olds
**Besides staying on your parents' policy, the best way to get cheap auto insurance quotes is to shop around.** Prices can differ by thousands of dollars per year depending on the company. So it's helpful to compare [car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Free Auto Insurance Quotes") from multiple insurance companies.
There are a number of other ways 18-year-olds can get cheap car insurance, including:
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/promo)
**Look for discounts.** Insurance companies offer many [discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#status "Car Insurance Discounts") to help you save money.
**High school or college students can get a[good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "How a Good Student Discount Can Save You on Car Insurance") on car insurance if they have good grades.** Insurance companies usually give a discount if you have a B average or 3.0 GPA, or better.
**College students who leave their cars at their parents' home during the academic year can often get an away-from-home student discount.** This discount is typically available if you attend a university more than 100 miles away from home. You may also qualify for a [low-mileage discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts#driver "Car Insurance Discounts").
If you don't live with your parents, you can save on your auto insurance policy by bundling it with your [renters](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-bundle-your-car-insurance-and-renters-insurance "How to Get Discounts Bundling Auto & Renters Insurance") or [homeowners](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle") insurance.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/car)
**Drive an affordable car.** Expensive cars cost more to repair, which means they also cost more to insure. In addition, safer cars like SUVs and sedans are usually cheaper to insure than sports cars.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/chart-up)
**Increase your deductible.** Another way to lower your insurance rate is to [choose a higher deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-deductible "Auto Insurance Deductibles: How Do They Work?"). However, this means you'll pay more after an accident. So it's important to choose a deductible you can easily afford in an emergency.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/shield)
**Sign up for a safe driver program.** By sharing your driving data with your auto insurance company, you can prove you're a safe driver worthy of cheaper rates. Companies track your driving using a plug-in tracking device or app.
[Usage-based auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Best Usage-Based Car Insurance") lets you earn big discounts if you practice safe driving habits, like staying under the speed limit. Some programs will raise your rates if you have bad driving habits, though.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/chart-down)
**Lower your coverage limits.** It's a good idea for 18-year-old drivers to buy a [full coverage policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-full-coverage-car-insurance "What Is Full Coverage Car Insurance?"). Young drivers are more likely to get into an accident, and full coverage insurance helps pay for damage to your own car.
However, a minimum coverage policy costs much less. Minimum coverage might work for you if you have a car that's more than 8 years old or worth less than $5,000.
