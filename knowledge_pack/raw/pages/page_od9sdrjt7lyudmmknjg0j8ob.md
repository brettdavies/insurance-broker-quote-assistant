When you sign up to receive your insurance policy documents or billing statements electronically, you can usually get a paperless discount on your car insurance. The discount can save you up to 5% on your premiums, based on our research. Nationwide, AAA, and Liberty Mutual are a few of the companies offering a paperless discount for electronic documents, but the actual discount amount varies among them.
Here’s how much you can save with a paperless discount, how and where to get it, and other ways to [save on auto insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) rates.
## **How Much You Can Save With Paperless Discount**
![Man outside his car using phone and smiling](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/1dd3cb9f80/man-on-phone-1.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The amount you can save with a paperless discount varies by [state](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state) and insurance company, but you can typically save up to 5%, according to our research. AAA has the largest discount we found, at 5%.
Many companies offer this discount but generally don’t advertise savings amounts. The best way to know how much savings the paperless discount offers is to ask your insurance agent or company directly. You can also enroll in paperless document delivery to see how much it lowers your insurance rates.
## **How to Get a Paperless Discount**
Although paperless discount savings can vary by state and [insurance company](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews), eligibility requirements are generally the same among insurers. In general, you’ll need to change from receiving paper bills and policy documents to electronic documents and statements to get the discount.
In most cases, you only need to sign up for one paperless option. For example, [Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive), Allstate, and Liberty Mutual only require paperless policy documents for the discount. AAA and [Grange](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/grange-insurance-vs-state-farm) will give you the discount when you enroll in paperless billing. But Nationwide, Amica, and [American Family](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/american-family-insurance) require you to go paperless for both policy documents and paperless billing.
You’ll usually need to log into your online account to sign up for paperless documents to get the discount and will need an email address to set it up. You’ll receive email notifications when you have a new bill or document available, and you can view it online or through the company’s mobile app.

### **Progressive**
  * **Average premium:** $119 per month
  * **Compare.com Rating:** 4.73 out of 5


Progressive offers multiple discounts when you [get a quote](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) and sign up for a new insurance policy online.

  * **Compare.com Rating:** 4.93 out of 5


Allstate offers multiple auto insurance policy discounts that you can stack with the paperless policy discount.

## **How to Maximize Your Paperless Discount Savings**
A paperless discount is relatively small, but the good news is you have multiple ways to increase your savings.
A few things you can do to lower your car insurance costs include:
  * **Add younger drivers on your policy:** Car insurance rates can be expensive for teens and young adults. If your child is driving, [adding them to your policy](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/adding-child-to-insurance) is often cheaper than getting them their own separate policy.
  * **Enroll in your insurer’s telematics program:** You can get an initial discount for enrolling in a [usage-based insurance program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount), then an additional discount if you prove you’re a safe driver by avoiding behaviors like accidents, speeding, and [distracted driving](https://www.iii.org/article/distracted-driving-state-of-the-risk).
  * **Bundle your insurance policies with the same company:** You can usually save more money when you insure all your policies with one company. Combine your car insurance policy with homeowners, renters, or life insurance to save up to 25% with a [multi-policy discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-policy-discount).


## **Other Common Car Insurance Discounts**
![Man smiling and using laptop in living room](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/c49651ad12/man-smiling-at-computer-jpg.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The paperless discount isn’t the only one that’s easy to get. Several more [auto insurance discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) you may qualify for to get even more savings include:
  * **Sign online:** Sign your policy documents online.
  * [**Paid in full**](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/paid-in-full-discount)**:** Pay your auto policy premiums in full up front.
  * [**Automatic payments**](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/automatic-payments-discount)**:** If you can’t pay your policy term in full, consider signing up for automatic payments.
  * [**Good student**](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount)**:** Full-time high school or college students who earn honor roll, dean’s list, or at least a B average can qualify.
  * [**Student away at school**](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/student-away-at-school-discount)**:** College students who go to school at least 100 miles away from home and don’t take a vehicle with them can get a discount.
