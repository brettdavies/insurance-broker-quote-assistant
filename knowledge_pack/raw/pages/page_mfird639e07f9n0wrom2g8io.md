**Why Geico made our list:** In addition to some of the lowest average rates, Geico has one of the longest lists of discounts in the industry, which may help you offset the cost of your policy. You might save for being a federal employee, a safe driver or a member of certain organizations like alumni groups. Geico also has a highly rated and easy-to-use mobile app for digital policy management, although it did rank below average for service on the [2024 J.D. Power U.S. Insurance Digital Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), indicating its digital service tools may not stack up as well against some competitors these days. You may also want to keep in mind that the company doesn’t offer certain coverage options, such as gap insurance.
**Who Geico may be good for:** If you're a young driver with a tight budget or someone who wants to spend as little as possible on your Oregon car insurance, Geico could be a good pick — especially if you qualify for a few of its discounts.

**Why Progressive made our list:** Progressive earned a high Bankrate Score for its customizable policies and highly rated mobile app. It has an extensive list of potential discounts, including homeowner, automatic payments and the Snapshot telematics program. However, Progressive came in slightly below the segment average in the J.D. Power 2024 Auto Insurance Study for the Northwest region.
**Who Progressive may be good for:** Progressive may be more willing than some other carriers to extend coverage to individuals with a blemish or two on their driving record. While there's no way to know if you're eligible for coverage without requesting a quote, if you have a speeding ticket or accident on your record, it may be worth looking into.

**Why State Farm made our list:** As the [largest car insurance provider](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in the U.S., State Farm is a popular choice for Oregon drivers seeking a standard variety of discounts and endorsements. State Farm stands out for its two safe driving programs: [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) for adults and Steer Clear for drivers under 25. However, the carrier does not offer gap insurance and accident forgiveness coverage must be earned. That being said, State Farm has plenty of local agents, so you can work with an agent face to face if you have more questions.
**Who State Farm may be good for:** State Farm could be a great option for drivers seeking in-person service from a local agent.

**Why USAA made our list:** Year after year, USAA consistently receives high scores from J.D. Power for customer satisfaction, although it cannot be officially ranked due to coverage eligibility requirements. Its average full coverage premium is lower than Oregon’s average, and policyholders may earn discounts for being a good student, insuring a new car or garaging their vehicle on a military base. However, take note that USAA only sells insurance to current military members, veterans and their immediate family members, so you may not be eligible for coverage.
**Who USAA may be good for:** If you are stationed at Camp Rilea, Umatilla or any Oregon military installation, USAA may be a good fit for you. It may also be worth considering if a member of your immediate family is either an active-duty military member or a veteran.

**Why Travelers made our list:** Travelers has competitive average rates and stands out for its unique insurance endorsements. Potential add-ons include rental coverage, new car replacement and gap insurance. The company's discount list is extensive, including some easy-to-earn discounts such as continuous insurance and paperless billing, as well as some more uncommon options like hybrid and electric car discounts. Unfortunately, Travelers was ranked second to last by J.D. Power for customer satisfaction in the Northwest region, and it came in below average in the [2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), indicating that its customers may not be totally satisfied with its service.
**Who Travelers may be good for:** Travelers policies may be a good choice for drivers looking to customize their policies with endorsements beyond standard coverage options. The carrier may also appeal to drivers of electric and hybrid cars as it offers a potential discount for eco-friendly vehicles.

How Bankrate chose the best car insurance companies in Oregon
Bankrate chose the best car insurance in Oregon through an extensive process that began by comparing average rates collected by Quadrant Information Services. The insurance editorial team assessed each company based on their coverage options, discounts and digital tool availability. Third-party customer satisfaction rankings from J.D. Power and financial strength ratings from [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/) and [Standard & Poor's](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) were also considered. After assessing all data, each company was given a Bankrate Score.
The better a carrier performed in each category, the higher its overall Bankrate Score for a total score of 5.0 out of 5.0 points. This brief overview of each carrier could be useful during your research, and may help you more effectively compare insurers.

## How to find the best car insurance in Oregon
The best car insurance for you will depend on your needs and preferences. The following steps may help you nail down what considerations to make before choosing a provider.
  * Number 1 Icon
###  Consider minimum insurance requirements in Oregon
Caret Down Icon
Most states, including Oregon, have minimum liability insurance requirements that you must meet in order to legally operate a vehicle on public roads. In Oregon, drivers are required to purchase bodily injury and property damage liability, personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage. The exact coverage amounts you need can be found on the [Oregon Department of Transportation website](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/driverid/insurance.aspx).
  * Number 2 Icon
###  Consider lender requirements
Caret Down Icon
If you lease or finance your vehicle, your lender may require you to purchase [full coverage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) rather than just the minimum liability insurance required by the state. Additionally, you may want to consider [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/). This common optional coverage type for new vehicles helps pay the difference between what you owe on the vehicle and its value if your car gets totaled or is stolen and unrecoverable.
  * Number 3 Icon
###  Consider your individual needs
Caret Down Icon
Your unique life events often affect your auto insurance rate. For instance, will you have to add a teen driver to your car insurance? Average rates for [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) can be high, but some providers offer discounts for good students that could help decrease your teen’s auto insurance rate. Do you have a DUI conviction? You may want to look into insurers who offer options for [high-risk drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). Speaking with a licensed insurance agent may help you identify any special considerations you may want to take into account when choosing coverage.

## How much is car insurance in Oregon?
The [average cost of car insurance in Oregon](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-oregon/) is $2,121 per year for full coverage. This is quite a bit less than [the national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) full coverage premium of $2,671 per year. Minimum coverage car insurance in Oregon averages $841 annually, which is slightly more expensive than the national average of $806. Compared to nearby states, Oregon’s average full coverage car insurance rates are cheaper than California, which averages $3,102 per year, but more expensive than Washington, which is $1,919 per year.
Full coverage car insurance rates in Oregon could be less expensive than the national average for a few reasons. Oregon has a relatively low population density, which could contribute to less crowded roadways. The state also does not have particularly high [crime rates](http://www.usa.com/rank/us--crime-index--state-rank.htm) and is home to average [highway infrastructure conditions](https://reason.org/policy-study/25th-annual-highway-report/).

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in Oregon?
Caret Down Icon
There is not just one company that will offer the [cheapest average auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/oregon/) in Oregon to everyone. Insurance companies use many different rating factors to determine your premium, which means that everyone will be quoted unique rates. Some of these factors include your age, gender, credit-based insurance score, driving history and location, as well as your [vehicle’s make and model](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-and-model/).
Companies may weigh these factors differently to calculate your rate, so most insurance professionals recommend comparing quotes from different carriers to find the cheapest premium for your circumstances.
  * ###  Do you have to have car insurance in Oregon?
Caret Down Icon
Yes, in general you will need car insurance in Oregon to comply with state laws. Driving on public roads in the state without insurance can be punishable with fines and other penalties. If a person does not wish to purchase an insurance policy, they may apply to the Oregon Department of Transportation for [self-insurance](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors806.html) and provide proof that they possess the ability to pay for any costs resulting from an accident they cause.
  * ###  How much car insurance do I need in Oregon?
Caret Down Icon
According to Oregon state law, there are several types of insurance you need to have. Liability insurance pays for injuries or damage to the other car, its driver and passengers, and any damaged property. [Personal injury protection](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/personal-injury-protection/) (PIP) coverage is required in no-fault states such as Oregon and helps pay for medical expenses and lost wages for you and your passengers. You are also required to have [uninsured/underinsured](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) motorist insurance, which helps pay damages if the other driver does not have insurance or enough insurance to cover all costs resulting from an accident. If you have a car loan or lease, you may be required to purchase collision and comprehensive insurance, as well.
  * ######  Why do car insurance companies have different rates?
Caret Down Icon
Every car insurance company has its own rating algorithm to determine how much to charge you for coverage. These formulas are developed by taking various driver metrics into consideration. These metrics may include a driver’s claim history, as well as the likelihood of claims in your area and the severity of those claims, among other factors. Because of this, each company will weigh your rating factors differently. One company might heavily [surcharge you for a ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) while another only mildly increases your premium. This is why it may be helpful to get quotes from several companies.
  * ######  What is the best car insurance company in Oregon?
Caret Down Icon
Since insurance needs are highly personalized, there’s no single best car insurance company in the Beaver State. The best car insurance company for you might not be the best for your friend or family member since you have different insurance needs and priorities. To help you find the best provider for you, consider what you’re looking for from an insurance company. For instance, you might be most interested in the cheapest rates, while your neighbor is looking for the best claims handling or a great mobile app. Doing a little research to see which companies have the qualities you want most and then requesting quotes from those companies to compare is the best way to find the best insurer for your needs.
  * ######  How can I save money on car insurance?
Caret Down Icon
If it’s been a while since you purchased your policy, you may want to request quotes from several providers. Use the same coverage types and amounts to make it easier to compare policies. You can also see what discounts you’re eligible for; many providers allow you to combine discounts to maximize your savings. You might also consider adjusting your level of coverage. For instance, raising your deductible might make your premium more affordable. However, ensure that you can cover the higher out-of-pocket costs if necessary. If you’re not sure how much coverage you need, speak with a licensed insurance agent.

Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
