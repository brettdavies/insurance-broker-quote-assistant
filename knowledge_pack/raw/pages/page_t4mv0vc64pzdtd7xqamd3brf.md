The cost of a claim has shot up - things you wouldn’t see unless you’ve actually had a claim. Not to mention insurers can’t just Willy nilly increase rates - they have to file in advance and wait for your state to approve their new rates. 
Best you can do is shop. Just know that claims are happening more often, and the claims are bigger, countrywide. 
The tariffs impacting cost of vehicles and parts is going to continue to push rates upwards.

  * the rest of the customer base gets to help cover the costs of large payouts - like yearly Florida hurricanes. With tariffs the prices on replacement parts just went way up too.

Normal for the market. Eggs have gone up by that much, and there are no lawyers going after eggs. You can shop, just to find another carrier that is late to make the same changes. Welcome to 2025.

Genuinely, out of a pure desire to learn, how the hell do tariffs affect insurance rates?? Is it because some vehicles just cost more now?

Also affects the cost of liability insurance. The more expensive it is to replace or repair a car on the road you might damage, the more your liability insurance rate will go up on average

Tariffs affect the cost of parts. Insurance has to replace parts. Parts are more expensive = insurance is more expensive.

As others said, parts. 
Like let's say need a new alternator. It's $200. Well, tariff now makes that $220. Insurance won't lose money so "hey everyone. Here's a 5% increase" 
Obviously not exactly like that, but that's the general principle of it.

I was paying 2.4K for 6 month premium for 2 cars( 2025 Tesla Y and 2015 honda van) I did a quote on progressive and got the same coverage for 1.5k for 6 months. So look around you have options.

Expect it will go much higher. Tariffs = more expensive replacement cars and parts= more expensive repairs and more expensive car rentals.

Body shops charging hundreds for diagnostic scans pre post during is doubling many estimates. Most of these are way overblown. These get passed onto the consumer.

I can check for myself for my circumstances, but I will say about 18 months ago, going from $500 to $1,000 or higher was I think about $18 less per car per 6 months. I guess I need to see if this math has changed or not because we still have $500 DED, but were at $450 a month, but that is Auto, Umbrella, and Homeowners.
