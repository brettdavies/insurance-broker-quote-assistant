American Family, Allstate, and Geico also stand out by offering well-rounded savings across multiple categories, including bundling, loyalty, and new vehicle discounts, each offering up to 25% or more in several areas.
Farmers and Progressive provide strong good driver and accident-free discounts, while Safeco boasts a standout 30% accident-free discount. These discounts can add up quickly, especially when combined with other savings opportunities available through each provider.
Beyond discounts, California drivers can also save by taking additional steps. Use these expert tips to help reduce your CA auto insurance rates:
  * **Safe Driving Habits:** Avoid accidents, claims, and traffic violations to prevent premium increases.
  * **Reduced Vehicle Use:** Drive less overall to lower your risk profile, especially in high-traffic California cities.
  * **Vehicle Choice:** Opt for a car with high safety ratings, low repair costs, and strong anti-theft features.
  * **Higher Deductibles:** Choosing a higher deductible can lower your monthly premium, as long as you can afford the out-of-pocket cost in a claim.
  * **Continuous Coverage History:** Maintain active coverage without lapses to show insurers you’re a responsible policyholder.


These strategies, paired with the right discounts, can help California drivers secure quality coverage at a more affordable price, no matter where you live in the state.
