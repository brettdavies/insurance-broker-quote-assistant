# Florida Sheriffs Association and State Farm Commit to Improving Teen Driving 
March 04, 2025 
  * [Newsroom](https://flsheriffs.org/category/news-room/)


The Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) is pleased to announce that State Farm has generously granted $90,000 to help fund the Teen Driver Challenge, an educational course that provides training to teenage drivers. The program plays a vital contribution in protecting Florida’s teen drivers and everyone else on the roadway. State Farm has granted a total of $1,075,000 to the program since 2011. 
“We appreciate State Farm’s dedication to promoting safe driving among Florida’s youth and the commitment to safer roadways for all drivers,” said **Florida Sheriffs Association President and Charlotte County Sheriff Bill Prummell.** “Their partnership is crucial in equipping young drivers with skills through the Teen Driver Challenge and I encourage everyone with teen drivers to take advantage of this life-saving program.”
At the request of Florida’s Sheriffs, the Teen Driver Challenge was created in 2007 to lower the high crash and fatality rate of young drivers. It’s the largest commercial driving school in Florida and is offered to teens and their families at no charge. The cost to run this program is covered by grants from State Farm and contributions from local sheriffs’ offices. Instructors are certified law enforcement officers with accreditations from the State of Florida Division of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, under the Florida Sheriffs Association’s State of Florida Commercial Driving School License. The program is currently available in more than 42 counties and coming to additional counties soon. 
“State Farm is honored to support the Florida Sheriffs Association Teen Driver Challenge for the 14th consecutive year,” **said Jose Soto, State Farm Corporate Responsibility Analyst**. “This initiative demonstrates our commitment to promoting safe driving practices among young drivers. Through the dedicated efforts of certified law enforcement officers, we are helping equip teens with the essential skills needed to navigate the roads safely.”
The importance of the Teen Driver Challenge is supported by statistics. According to the Center for Disease Control, teens are involved in three times as many fatality crashes as other drivers. Vehicle accidents are the leading cause of these fatality crashes. The Teen Driver Challenge aims to lower this rate by empowering teens with safe driving knowledge and practices. More than 2,000 students successfully complete the challenge in Florida each year. 
For more information on the Teen Driver Challenge, visit [www.teendriverchallenge.com](http://www.teendriverchallenge.com/). Remember to like the Teen Driver Challenge page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teendriverchallenge) and follow on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teendriverchallenge/). To register for the program or find class offerings in your area, please contact your local Sheriff’s Office. Additionally, a video about the program can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdxM59nSqTg&t=64s).
