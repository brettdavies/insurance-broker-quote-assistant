## Do you have to have insurance on a travel trailer in Connecticut?
If you have a travel trailer, also known as a camper, you're required to carry [auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) for the vehicle you use to pull your trailer. Liability coverage won't cover damage to your travel trailer or motorhome. Purchasing comprehensive and collision coverage can help protect against damage to your RV, but they aren't required by state law. Learn more about [travel trailer insurance](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/travel-trailer-insurance/). 
### Comprehensive and collision coverage
Lenders usually require [RV comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-collision-comprehensive-coverage/) if you're leasing or financing or your motorhome or travel trailer. But even if your RV is paid in full, comprehensive and collision can be valuable in protecting your motorhome or camper against physical damage and loss. These coverages may cover the actual cash value of your RV if your motorhome or trailer is damaged, totaled, or stolen. Comprehensive covers events out of your control, including [RV theft](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-theft-insurance-prevention-tips/), vandalism, fire, hitting an animal, and weather-related issues. Collision covers your RV if you collide with another vehicle, tree, fence, guardrail, or any object.
## How much is RV insurance in Connecticut?
The average premium for a 12-month Connecticut RV insurance policy at Progressive for 2024 was $825.12 for a motorhome and $382.01 for a travel trailer. Progressive offers RV liability-only policies starting at just $125/year.*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. But your [cost for RV insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-insurance-cost/) depends on many factors, such as:
  * **Type and model** : The more expensive your RV is to repair or replace, the more you pay to insure it. Larger, newer RVs often cost more than smaller, used RVs; and motorhomes typically cost more than travel trailers or pop-ups.
  * **Claims history** : Your history of filing insurance claims may affect your rate.
  * **Driving record** : Violations can increase the price of your policy.
  * **Location** : Your ZIP code can influence the cost of RV insurance.
