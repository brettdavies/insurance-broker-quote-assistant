At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

Many car insurance companies now offer programs using telematics technology to gather data about driving behaviors and mileage. Companies with these telematics, or usage-based insurance (UBI), programs offer money-saving incentives based on how safely you drive.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/#cite-1)
You automatically qualify for an initial discount by signing up for the State Farm Drive Safe & Save program, and you can even save more based on your driving. Typically, safe and low-mileage drivers can save the most with telematic programs. Drivers who do a lot of nighttime driving, have high annual mileage, or exhibit poor driving habits may not earn a significant discount.
Here’s what you need to know about the Drive Safe & Save program from [**State Farm**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/).

## What is State Farm Drive Safe & Save?
You can opt into State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save [**telematics program**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) to qualify for potential discounts, including an enrollment discount.
Text “SAVE” to 42407 to enroll. You can check your phone’s eligibility and download the smartphone app from the App Store or the Google Play Store. Once you enroll, State Farm will send you a Bluetooth beacon that works with the mobile app to track your driving habits. You must have your phone’s location services and Bluetooth on for this to work.
Some drivers with Ford or Lincoln vehicles with model years 2020 or later — and a FordPass or Lincoln Way account — qualify for the Drive Safe & Save Connected Car program, which tracks your driving data directly from your car.
Discounts can vary based on your driving behavior and where you live, but you could save up to 30% off your premium. State Farm applies any discount you qualify for during each policy renewal, which typically occurs every six months. Because the discount depends on your driving habits, it can increase or decrease.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/#cite-2)

## Should you enroll in the Drive Safe & Save program?
If you have a State Farm policy, you should definitely consider enrolling in the program because you can earn up to 30% off your premium. The best way to maximize your savings with this program is to drive less and practice safe driving habits. For this reason, this program may work better for some drivers than for others.
The drivers that benefit the most from telematics programs are people who drive fewer than 7,000 miles each year. For example, remote workers and retirees who don’t have daily in-person obligations likely drive less than people who drive to and from work five days a week or more.
The Drive Safe & Save program reviews your annual mileage in addition to your driving data. You may qualify for [**lower rates when you have reduced mileage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/low-mileage/) because the chances of an accident decrease when you drive less.
Here are some pros and cons of the program to consider:
Pros
  * Save money based on mileage and driving habits
  * Get feedback on driving behaviors
  * Doesn’t penalize you for past driving record


Cons
  * Low-mileage discounts vary by state
  * Requires drivers to share data
  * May drain your phone battery


## Drive Safe & Save customer reviews
Customer reviews for the Drive Safe & Save app vary, but the mobile app earned 4.6 out of 5 stars on the App Store and 4.0 out of 5 stars on the Google Play Store. Despite the overall high ratings, many reviewers cite issues with the app’s sensitivity, lack of situational awareness, and effect on phone batteries.

Others claim to have saved money by using the program, even if the app does drain the phone battery.

## Driving behaviors that Drive Safe & Save monitors
The Drive Safe & Save program by State Farm monitors your mileage and several driving factors to determine your savings. These factors include:
  * **Acceleration:** The app monitors how quickly you accelerate because accelerating too quickly can increase your chances of an incident.
  * **Braking:** Any hard braking can contribute to safety scores. Though it’s sometimes necessary, hard braking consistently can indicate that you’re driving at an unsafe speed or not leaving enough room between vehicles.
  * **Cornering:** Sharp turns typically occur when you don’t have enough time or space to proceed safely, which can increase the possibility of an accident.
  * **Phone distraction:** The program will track your phone use. Phone distraction is a major problem that can take your eyes off the road and cause an accident.
  * **Speed:** The app will alert you if you’ve gone 8 mph or more over the posted speed limit. Speeding can lead to accidents, as it takes longer to slow down.
