COST COMPARISON: LIABILITY-ONLY VS. FULL COVERAGE
[Liability-only car insurance is cheaper](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/), costing an average of $61 monthly for the most ideal driver profile. This coverage provides financial protection for damage or injuries to others when you're at fault. This budget-friendly option doesn't include a deductible since you only pay deductibles for comprehensive and collision coverage on your own vehicle.
You can find relatively [cheap full coverage policies](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-full-coverage-car-insurance/), but those will cost an average of $125 monthly for the most ideal driver profile and combines liability with comprehensive and collision insurance. This covers both your liability to others and damage to your own vehicle from accidents, theft, weather and other incidents.
## How Much is Car Insurance by State
Location dramatically affects car insurance costs, with monthly premiums ranging from $75 in Vermont to $243 in Florida — a $168 difference for identical coverage. State insurance requirements, local risk factors, and regional economics create these wide variations.

These three states offer the most affordable car insurance rates:
  * Vermont: $75 monthly ($902 annually)
  * Maine: $76 monthly ($908 annually)
  * Idaho: $79 monthly ($952 annually)


These states benefit from lower population density, fewer severe weather events, and modest insurance requirements that keep costs down.
The highest-cost states present significant financial challenges for drivers:
  * Florida: $243 monthly ($2,916 annually)
  * Louisiana: $236 monthly ($2,832 annually)
  * New Jersey: $180 monthly ($2,160 annually)


Florida and Louisiana's high costs stem from frequent severe weather, high accident rates, and extensive fraud issues that drive up claim costs.
### State Insurance Requirements and Cost Impact 
Your [state's car insurance requirements](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/) directly affect how much you pay for car insurance. States with more comprehensive mandatory coverage typically see higher average premiums than those requiring only basic liability insurance.
No-fault states require personal injury protection (PIP), which covers medical expenses regardless of fault. This adds significant cost but provides immediate medical coverage. Florida ($243 monthly) exemplifies how no-fault requirements combined with local risk factors create expensive markets.
Required coverage drives costs in predictable ways. States mandating additional coverages like uninsured motorist protection or higher liability limits see correspondingly higher premiums. However, other factors like weather patterns, crime rates, and local repair costs often outweigh regulatory requirements, explaining why Vermont maintains the lowest rates despite comprehensive coverage requirements.

## Car Insurance Rate Trends: Why Costs are High and How They've Changed (2020-2025)
You may have noticed that [car insurance rates have gone up](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/why-did-my-car-insurance-go-up/) 51% since late 2019, creating significant financial pressure for drivers nationwide. This dramatic increase stems from multiple factors converging simultaneously.
Modern vehicles with advanced technology cost more to repair. A replacement bumper with sensors can run $3,000 versus $500 for older cars, while repair costs have skyrocketed over 10% annually since 2022 compared to 3-5% pre-pandemic increases. Supply chain disruptions continue affecting parts availability and pricing.
Medical expenses for injury claims keep climbing, adding pressure to liability coverage costs. Extreme weather events have intensified, with the U.S. experiencing over $92 billion in climate-related damage in 2023. States like Louisiana face major hurricanes every three years, while Florida saw 24% premium increases due to severe weather and high uninsured driver rates.
Rate increases show recent moderation. Car insurance inflation peaked at 23% in April 2024 but dropped to 5.3%, with 2025 increases at 7.5% compared to 16.5% in 2024.

**Post-pandemic recovery issues** | The ongoing effects of COVID-19 are still disrupting supply chains, driving up costs for car parts and repairs. Manufacturing took a hit while demand surged after the lockdowns ended.  
**Rising inflation** | General inflation affects all sectors, including insurance. As overall costs for goods and services rise, insurers increase premiums to maintain their operating margins.  
**Higher repair costs** | Modern vehicles come with advanced technology and more expensive parts to repair or replace, driving up insurance costs. While repair expenses rose by 3% to 5% each year before the pandemic, they have skyrocketed by over 10% since 2022, with the average repair cost reaching around $4,721 by 2023.  
**Supply chain delays** | Supply chain issues have made vehicle parts more scarce and expensive, leading to higher repair costs and, consequently, higher insurance rates.  
**Rising vehicle values** | The increasing prices of new and used vehicles add more challenges for insurers. Higher car values mean greater financial risks associated with total-loss claims.  
**Increasing medical expenses** | As the cost of medical care continues to rise, insurers face higher expenses for injury claims, which often results in higher premiums for drivers.  
**Impact of climate change** | The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, like hurricanes, wildfires and floods, have reshaped the insurance industry. In 2023, the U.S. experienced more than $92 billion in damage from climate-related disasters, putting immense pressure on insurance companies.

CAR INSURANCE COST BY AGE: KEY FACTS
  * **Teen driver car insurance costs more:** Drivers aged 16 to 19 have crash rates nearly four times higher per mile driven than drivers 20 and older, and they're more likely to speed, drive distracted, and make risky decisions due to inexperience and brain development factors.
  * **Senior car insurance rates increase after 70:** Older drivers have higher car insurance costs due to age-related changes including slower reaction times, vision changes, and potential medication effects that increase accident risk.
  * **Gender pricing restrictions:** Six states prohibit using gender as a rating factor: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, resulting in identical rates for male and female drivers.
  * **State restrictions for age as a car insurance cost factor:** Hawaii and Massachusetts don't allow insurers to use age as a rating factor, though some states like California require additional testing for license renewals at certain ages. — Mark Friedlander, Director, Corporate Communications, Insurance Information Institute

## Car Insurance Cost Factors
Your car insurance premium depends on how insurers assess your risk level. Four factors create the biggest rate differences, with some causing dramatic cost swings.
#### Biggest Factors Impacting Car Insurance Costs
![carAccident icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/car-accident_q9upxd.svg)
Driving History
Your driving record creates the most dramatic rate differences. Clean drivers pay $215 monthly, while a DUI violation spikes rates to $377 monthly — a 75% increase. Even minor violations add substantial costs: speeding 11-15 MPH over adds $53 monthly, while an at-fault accident increases rates to $310 monthly.
![teen icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/teen_xv2qqk.svg)
Age and Experience
Age creates enormous rate gaps. Young drivers (19-25) pay $537 monthly for full coverage compared to $215 for adult drivers — a 150% difference. Senior drivers pay $270 monthly, reflecting increased risk as reflexes slow. The age penalty is even steeper for minimum coverage, with young drivers paying $251 versus $100 for adults.
![usMap icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/us-map_s1ingz.svg)
Claims History
Your state and ZIP code create wide rate variations. Vermont drivers pay just $75 monthly while Florida residents pay $243 — a $168 monthly difference. Urban areas typically cost more due to traffic density and crime rates, while state insurance requirements drive regional differences.
![goodCredit icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/goodCredit_sahok5.svg)
Credit Score (Where Allowed)
Credit scores create massive rate gaps in states that allow credit-based pricing. Excellent credit earns $120 monthly rates, while poor credit results in $313 monthly — nearly triple the cost. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Michigan prohibit credit scoring, creating more uniform rates.


Among many other factors, vehicle type, coverage levels, deductibles, and mileage all create additional variations. But the four previously mentioned factors are likely to be major factors contributing to your car insurance cost.
## How to Save on Car Insurance Costs
[Lowering your car insurance costs](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-lower-your-car-insurance-rate/) comes from strategic shopping and qualifying for multiple discounts. The biggest savings require proactive steps, while smaller discounts add up over time.
**Shop Around and Compare Quotes**
Rate differences between insurers can exceed $100 monthly for identical coverage. Travelers averages $97 monthly while Allstate charges $161 — a $768 annual difference. Get quotes from at least three companies, including both major insurers and regional providers like National General, which offers competitive rates at $143 monthly.
**Bundle Policies for Multi-Policy Discounts**
Combining auto and home insurance typically saves 5-25% on both policies. A driver paying $150 monthly for auto coverage could save $225-$900 annually by bundling. Most major insurers including State Farm, Allstate, and Progressive offer substantial bundling discounts.
**Increase Your Deductibles**
Raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000 can reduce premiums by 10-20%. A driver paying $125 monthly could save $180-$360 annually. Only increase deductibles to amounts you can afford in an emergency — the savings disappear if you can't pay when filing a claim.
**Improve Your Credit Score**
In states allowing credit-based pricing, improving credit creates massive savings. Moving from poor credit ($313 monthly) to good credit ($125 monthly) saves $188 monthly or $2,256 annually. Pay bills on time, reduce debt, and monitor your credit report for errors.
**Maintain a Clean Driving Record**
Avoiding violations prevents rate increases that last 3-7 years. A single speeding ticket adds $53 monthly ($636 annually), while an at-fault accident increases rates by $95 monthly. Defensive driving courses may reduce rates by 5-10% in some states.
**Take Advantage of Available Discounts**
Stack multiple discounts for maximum savings:
  * Good student discount: 5-15% for students with B+ averages
  * Safe driver programs: 10-30% for demonstrating good driving habits
  * Multi-car discount: 10-25% for insuring multiple vehicles
  * Low mileage discount: 5-15% for driving under 7,500 miles annually
  * Safety features: 5-20% for vehicles with anti-theft devices and advanced safety systems


Combining three discounts averaging 10% each can reduce a $150 monthly premium to approximately $110, saving $480 annually.
## Car Insurance Cost: Bottom Line
Car insurance costs $215 on average across all driver profiles. Car insurance costs range from $51 to $537 monthly depending on your age, driving record, location, and coverage. Young drivers pay the most, while credit scores create differences of up to $193 monthly between excellent and poor credit.
Location matters , with rates varying by $150 monthly between the cheapest and most expensive states. Shopping around, maintaining clean driving records and improving credit scores remain the most effective ways to reduce premiums.

### Average Cost of Car Insurance: Methodology
Car insurance rates in Tennessee vary dramatically based on your specific profile, and understanding what drives those differences helps you find coverage that fits your budget. We built this analysis to show you what factors affect your premiums most and how Tennessee drivers like you can find affordable coverage.
**How we collected the data:**
We gathered rate information from Quadrant Information Services and state insurance departments, analyzing **83,056 quotes from 46 companies across 473 ZIP codes**. This comprehensive dataset ensures our findings reflect real-world pricing across Tennessee's diverse communities, from Memphis and Nashville to rural counties.
**Our baseline driver profile:**
We started with a 40-year-old male with a clean driving record operating a 2012 Toyota Camry LE. This driver carries comprehensive and collision coverage with **100/300/100 liability limits** and a **$1,000 deductible** , logging 12,000 miles annually. From there, we adjusted age, gender, location, vehicle type, credit score, and driving record to show how each factor independently affects what you'll pay.

Car insurance pricing depends on multiple interacting factors—your age, where you live, what you drive, your credit history, and your driving record all combine to determine your rate. By isolating each variable, we show you exactly how much each factor matters for Tennessee drivers.
Our ZIP-code-level analysis reveals significant pricing differences across the state. Urban drivers in Memphis and Nashville face higher premiums than rural residents due to accident frequency, theft rates, and repair costs, while credit scores and driving records create even larger rate swings regardless of location.
This research prioritizes transparency. Understanding which factors affect your rates most helps you make informed decisions about coverage levels, choose insurers who price your specific profile competitively, and identify opportunities to lower your premiums through improved credit or clean driving records.
