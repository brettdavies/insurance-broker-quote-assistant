It pays to be a low-mileage driver or a student who excels at school, and there are plenty of discounts that can shave your monthly premiums. Here are the car insurance discounts you should ask about:
  * **Defensive Driving Discounts** : You may qualify for up to 10% off when you complete a state-approved defensive driving program. These courses improve your driving skills and make you safer while driving.
  * **Low Mileage Discounts** : If you drive less than 12,000 miles, you could receive discounts averaging 11%. Shop with the [best pay-as-you-go auto insurance companies](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/best-pay-as-you-go-auto-insurance/) for more competitive low-mileage discounts.
  * **Autopay Discounts** : Many insurers offer a discount when setting up automatic payments. This ensures timely payments and can typically save you about 4% on your premiums.
  * **Bundling Discounts** : Combining multiple policies, such as home and auto insurance, with the same provider can lead to significant savings—sometimes as much as 20% off the total cost of your premiums.

## Smart Strategies for Reducing Car Insurance Costs
Adding multiple cars to your insurance policy can provide discounts that also make your expenses easier to keep track of. Instead of tracking each policy down for each vehicle in your house, grouping them under one policy can help you save time and money.
Taking eco-friendly measures, like signing up for paperless billing or switching to a hybrid car, can also shave another 4%-10% off your premiums. Security upgrades like installing anti-theft devices can also lower your rates, as they reduce the risk your insurer faces.
﻿  

Choosing safer vehicles, like small SUVs or minivans, instead of sports cars, can decrease your premiums. Maintaining a clean driving record without accidents or tickets could make you eligible for safe driver discounts, often requiring a spotless record for five to seven years. [To save more money on car insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/26-hacks/), consider raising your deductible, which lowers monthly payments but increases out-of-pocket costs for repairs.
### Other Ways to Save on Car Insurance
If you’re looking for additional ways to save, consider taking a defensive driving course. In many states, completing a 5–6 hour safety course can reduce your risk of accidents and qualify you for a discount of up to 10%. Confirm with your state and insurer whether this discount applies (Learn More: [Best Defensive Driving Insurance Discounts](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/best-defensive-driving-insurance-discounts/)).
Reducing how much you drive can also lower your premiums. Driving under 12,000 miles might save you around 11%, and minimizing commuting days can cut costs by another 4%.

>  by[u/emo-ghostface](https://www.reddit.com/user/emo-ghostface/) in[remotework](https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/)
Setting up automatic payments is another simple option and saves you about 4%. Bundling your auto insurance with home or life insurance can lead to even more significant discounts, sometimes up to 20%. Students or recent graduates may qualify for discounts of roughly 4% by maintaining good grades or earning a degree.
#### Always compare discounts across providers, and consider bundling policies and opting for higher deductibles to lower your premiums.

Many providers will also offer discounts based on professional memberships or careers, such as car insurance discounts for nurses or teachers. If your current insurer doesn’t offer professional discounts, it may not be a bad idea to [cancel your car insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/is-it-bad-to-cancel-car-insurance/) and look for a provider that recognizes and rewards these efforts.
