# Can a landlord require renters insurance?

## Why do landlords require renters insurance?
Landlords are looking to avoid lawsuits from tenants, and personal liability coverage on your [renters insurance policy](https://www.progressive.com/renters-insurance/) may help cover liability claims. Here are some instances when your renters insurance policy can act as a safeguard for you and your landlord.
### Bodily injury claims
If someone is injured at your residence, [personal liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-liability-insurance/) may provide coverage for the injured party’s medical bills, up to the limits of your coverage, and shield your landlord from responsibility. Learn more about [personal liability coverage for renters](https://www.progressive.com/answers/renters-personal-liability-coverage/).
### Property damage claims
If your belongings are damaged or lost, for example, in a fire or burglary, your landlord won’t be responsible for replacing the items. But your [personal property coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-property-coverage/) may pay to repair or replace your belongings, up to your coverage limits.
### Temporary housing claims
If your unit or rental home is damaged and becomes uninhabitable, your policy’s [loss of use coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/loss-of-use-insurance/) may pay for you to live elsewhere while your residence is repaired or rebuilt—assuming the damage was due to a covered loss. This may save your landlord from covering your temporary relocation expenses out of their own pocket.
