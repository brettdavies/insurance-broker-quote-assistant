  * Despite online rumors to the contrary, [there is no national law around senior driving](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-drivers-rules-70-and-up/) rules going into effect in August 2025.


When it comes to [renewing a driver’s license in California](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/renew-drivers-license-california/), a different set of rules applies to seniors. If you’re 70 or older, you must renew your license in person at the DMV. As part of this process, you’ll have to take a written test and get your vision checked. 
If you’re over 70, here’s everything you need to know about getting your license renewed in California.
## Key Things to Know about Senior Driver’s License Renewal in California
![Key Things to Know about Senior Driver’s License Renewal in California](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
Seniors must visit a local DMV office to renew their driver’s license. Once there, they must take and pass a number of tests to ensure they are fit to drive. 
One reason is that fatal crash rates increase after age 70-74, according to the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/older-people) (IIHS). The data shows that as people age, their abilities can shift rapidly. The DMV’s goal is to ensure that older drivers are still road-safe.
Here are the key things to understand when it’s time to renew.
### Seniors Need to Renew Their License Every 5 Years
California driver’s licenses are valid for five years. This applies to senior drivers, too. 
Expect to receive a renewal notice by mail about 60 days before your license expires. After that, you must [complete a driver’s license renewal application](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/). You can do much of this online.
### (Most) Seniors No Longer Need to Take a Knowledge Test to Renew Their License
As of October 1, 2024, [seniors no longer need to take a knowledge test](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/news-releases/written-knowledge-test-requirement-eliminated-for-most-california-drivers-license-renewals) to renew their license. Or, at least not all seniors. Let’s break down who does and doesn’t need to take a test.
You do **not** have to take a test (written or eLearning) if:
✅ You are **70 or older**
✅ You have **no points** on your driving record
✅ You have had **few or no recent accidents**  
  
For this group, a visit to the DMV will only require a vision exam and an updated photo.
People with poor driving records may still be required to complete the knowledge test or an online “eLearning” test. The online test is the easier option; unlike the DMV knowledge test, it’s no-fail. Both tests cover traffic laws, safe driving practices, [road signs and their meanings](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-road-signs/), and related topics. The questions are based on information from the [California Driver’s Handbook](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/). 
You **must take the eLearning course** if:
✅ You have **1 point** on your driving record
✅ You apply **online** (not at the DMV office)
✅ You’ve had **only a minimal number of accidents** recently
You **must take the** **written test** (either online or at the DMV) if:
✅ You apply in person at a DMV office (even if you’re eligible for eLearning)
✅ You recently **moved to California** or **just got your first license**
If your driving record includes **any** of the following in the last 2–3 years, you can choose between an the knowledge test and eLearning:
  * **2 or more accidents** in the past **2 years**
  * **3 or more accidents** in the past **3 years**
  * A **DUI suspension** in the past **2 years**
  * **2 or more points** on your record in the past **2 years**

### Seniors Must Renew Their License in Person at the DMV
Once you have submitted the renewal application, [book an appointment at your local DMV](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/appointments/select-appointment-type) to take a vision test and a knowledge test. The latter is only required if you haven’t already done it online. 
Some seniors, such as those who don’t meet the minimum vision requirements, may also need to take a road test. 
### There Is No Medical Exam for License Renewal
You don’t have to undergo a medical examination when renewing your driver’s license. However, your doctor must report to the DMV if you have a medical condition that could impact your driving abilities. 
Seniors with severe health issues, such as advanced dementia, may have their driver’s licenses revoked. For less severe conditions, the DMV may only require a behind-the-wheel test to show you can still drive safely.

## How to Prepare for California DMV Senior Driver’s License Renewal
Senior driver’s license renewal in California involves several steps, but for the most part, it’s quite straightforward. Plus, you can start the application online to save time. 
### Step 1: Complete a California Driver’s License Application
Register for an online account with the California DMV ([MyDMV](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/mga/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:dmvUscAccountCreate)). Next, log in to your account and [complete a driver’s application form](https://www.edl.dmv.ca.gov/apply/choose-language). You’ll need to enter your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information. 
Alternatively, visit a local DMV office to fill out the application. If you go this route, you won’t need a MyDMV account. 
### Step 2: Book an Appointment with the DMV
Schedule an [appointment with the DMV](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/appointments/select-appointment-type?option=CID) to submit your paperwork and undergo further tests. These include:
  * An eye exam (required for all senior drivers)
  * A standard road test (required for seniors with certain health conditions)
  * Additional tests, such as a Supplemental Driving Performance Evaluation (required for some drivers)


You’ll also have to pay a $35 license renewal fee.
### Step 3: Get a Temporary License
If you pass the tests and have your paperwork in order, you’ll likely get a temporary driver’s license. This document is valid until your new license arrives by mail.
### Step 4: Receive Your New Driver’s License
Expect to receive your new driver’s license within 60 days. In the meantime, you can [check its status online](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/drivers-license-id-card-status/) via your MyDMV account. 
## What to Bring for Senior Driver’s License Renewal in California
![Image showing things to bring when you renew a senior driver's license in California, including a passport, license, gas bill, ID card, social security card and money](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
Even if you fill out the driver’s license application online, you must still bring some documents to the DMV. Here’s what you’ll need:
  * **Driver’s license application**(if you haven’t filled it out online)
  * **Identification documents**. Bring at least two documents confirming your identity. You can use your current driver’s license, birth certificate, U.S. passport, permanent resident card or certificate of naturalization.
  * **Social security number**
  * **Proof of residency**. You will need two forms of proof of residency, which can include a mortgage statement, lease, utility bill, or bank statement.
  * **Eyeglasses or contact lenses** : If you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, bring them with you for the vision test. 
  * **$35 renewal fee**(if you haven’t paid it online)


Note that you may have to pay additional fees if the DMV requires you to complete any driving or skills tests.
## What to Expect When You Arrive at the DMV
In-person license renewal allows authorities to identify and evaluate older drivers with potential impairments. For example, they can see when someone shows signs of confusion or has mobility issues that could affect their driving performance. 
That said, here’s what to expect during your visit to the DMV:
  * Check-in at the information desk
  * Submit the required documents
  * Get an eye exam
  * Have your photo taken
  * Provide a thumbprint
  * Pay the renewal fee 
  * Receive a temporary license


As discussed earlier, the DMV may also require additional tests for seniors with certain health issues. These typically include:
  * A standard behind-the-wheel test
  * An Area [Driving Performance Evaluation](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/driving-test-criteria/driving-performance-evaluation-dpe-scoring-criteria/) (DPE)
  * A [Supplemental Driving Performance Evaluation](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/driving-test-criteria/supplemental-area-driving-performance-evaluation-score-sheet-sample/) (SDPE)

![Image of a behind the wheel test with a senior driver and dmv tester with clipboard](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
The **SDPE** is a general driving test administered to new drivers or those needing to demonstrate basic driving skills. It covers a wide range of basic driving tasks like lane usage, turns, stop sign compliance, and parking. 
The **Area DPE** is for individuals who have shown specific driving limitations, who have been referred by a physician, or for those renewing licenses with restrictions due to medical issues. It may also be required for seniors whose abilities are in question. This is a shorter test and focuses on the area in which the driver normally travels.
After an AREA DPE, your license may be restricted to driving only on certain routes in the area where the test was administered.

## Things That Can Prevent You from Getting Your License Renewed
In some cases, the DMV may refuse to renew a senior’s driver’s license. This usually happens when applicants fail one of the tests or have medical issues that can affect their ability to drive. 
Expect to have your application declined if:
### You Fail the Eye Exam
![Senior taking the eye exam for california senior driver's license renewal](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
All drivers, regardless of age, must have a visual acuity of 20/40 in both eyes or 20/70 in one eye and 20/40 in the other eye, with or without eyeglasses. 
If you fail the vision test, the DMV will refer you to an eye doctor. They’ll conduct further tests and fill out [Form DL 62](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/report-of-vision-examination-dl-62-pdf/) (Report of Vision Examination). 
After that, you must submit this form to the DMV. If the report states that you can still drive safely, the DMV will ask you to take a road test or undergo an SDPE. Then they’ll determine whether or not you can have your license renewed. 
But if you’re considered legally blind (meaning you have 20/200 vision or worse), the DMV may not allow you to take a road test. Consequently, your driver’s license will be revoked. You can request a hearing and have your vision tested again. 
### You Have Certain Medical Conditions
The DMV may decline your application if you have [severe physical or mental disorders](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-education-and-safety/medical-conditions-and-driving/), such as:
  * Dementia
  * Diabetes
  * Epilepsy
  * Health conditions that could cause you to lose consciousness
  * Certain sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy
  * Macular degeneration
  * Cataracts 


In such cases, your only option is to request a hearing and undergo further tests.
### You Owe Child Support
The DMV [may suspend your license](https://childsupport.ca.gov/drivers-license-passport-release/) or refuse to renew it if you’re behind on child support. These restrictions will be in place until you solve the issue with the appropriate authorities. 
Also, you may not be able to renew your license if you fail to attend a DMV hearing, provide Form DL 62 or other documents, or complete a court-ordered program, such as DUI school. 
## Restricted Licenses for Senior Drivers in California
![Senior driving wearing glasses which may result in a restricted license](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
Poor vision and other physical or mental conditions won’t necessarily result in a revoked license. The DMV may issue a new driver’s license – but with certain restrictions. The document will have an “RSTR” code printed on it. 
For example, you may not be allowed to drive at night (RTSR 2). Or you might need to wear corrective eyewear while behind-the-wheel (RTSR 1). 
Other common restrictions include:
  * No freeway driving 
  * No driving during rush hour traffic
  * No driving outside of designated areas 


There are also cases where a driver can only operate vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, left-foot gas pedals, or dual mirrors. These restrictions usually apply to individuals with physical impairments, such as an amputated limb. 
According to [Simmrin Law Group](https://www.losangelesduiattorney.com/dui-faq/what-does-rstr-mean-on-a-california-drivers-license/), it’s possible to get a restricted license following a [DUI ](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/drunk-driving-statistics/)conviction. You may still drive, but only during specific hours or for specific purposes (e.g., going to church).
## Alternative Forms of ID
A driver’s license is a standard form of personal identification. If, for some reason, you cannot renew your license, you’ll need another form of photo ID. 
![California Driver's License](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/senior-drivers-license-renewal/)
One option is to use a passport for identification purposes. Alternatively, request a state ID card from the DMV. These are free for seniors. 
If your license is revoked or you turn it in automatically, the DMV will issue you a state ID upon request. 
## Stay Safe on the Road
As we all know, our senses become less sharp as we get older. We may experience changes in our vision and hearing, which can affect our ability to react in traffic.
Aging can also affect coordination, attention span, and other skills required for staying safe behind the wheel. Your driving experience can compensate for some of these issues, but it may not be enough to prevent a crash.
With that in mind, listen to your body before going behind the wheel. Double-check your surroundings, follow traffic rules, and stay alert. Look for alternative means of transportation if you’re feeling tired or unwell. 
Last but not least, consider enrolling in a [Mature Driver Improvement Program](https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/mature-driver/california/). Our online course will prepare you for senior driver’s license renewal in California and lower your car insurance rates.
