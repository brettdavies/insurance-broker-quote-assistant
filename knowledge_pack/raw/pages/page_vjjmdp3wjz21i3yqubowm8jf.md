Allstate initially offered me $866 for a water related damage but later on the company decided not to honor the check, even though the damage was well over $4000. They told me I was not covered by the type of incident so they decided not to issue even the paltry amount of $866.

State Farm home insurance is a great company. When a hurricane destroyed my roof on my home, I notified State Farm and an agent came to my home to take pictures. Immediately we were approved to get a new roof put on my home.

They are fine....until you make a claim. I'll never understand how they could claim that my roof damage was due to a hail storm but the attached garage roof was not. When my house caught fire due to lightning, their adjuster was such a jerk that as soon as the repairs were complete, I changed companies. Note--these were 2 separate claims.

##  The Final Word 
Both Allstate and State Farm offer typical home insurance coverage. State Farm makes it clear from its website what's covered and what's not. This level of upfront, easy-to-understand clarity makes State Farm stand out.
With Allstate home insurance, you can add coverage for identity theft restoration, water backup, specific personal property, business property, sports equipment, green improvement reimbursement, yard and garden, electronic data recovery, and musical instruments. You can also purchase a personal umbrella policy and Allstate's HostAdvantage® policy, which insures your home and belongings if you rent it out.
With State Farm, you can purchase a separate personal or professional liability policy. State Farm's policies already offer coverage for keepsakes, hobbies, and your yard. Because of this inclusion, State Farm's policies may offer more coverage than Allstate's policies before customization.
State Farm offers discounts to its policyholders, including multi-line, home alert, and roofing. These discounts help you save money on the coverage you need. You can also choose a higher deductible to keep your monthly premium costs low.
Allstate offers similar discounts on its policies. It also offers additional discounts. These include a responsible payment discount, claim-free discount, welcome and loyalty discount, home buyer discount (for new homes), early signing discount, and for participation in Easy Pay Plan®. With these discounts, Allstate offers many ways to save. 
Both companies offer good home insurance policies. Allstate's policies are more customizable and offer more options for discounts than State Farm's do. However, looking at the coverage and premium rates from each company can help you decide which is best for you.
