With September and October rounding out the top active months of the hurricane season, State Farm is sharing the top tips for homeowners and encouraging residents to be prepared for storms. The peak period for storm activity occurs between mid-August and mid-October, as evidenced last year by Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacting numerous states in late September and early October 2024. 
In 2024, five major U.S. hurricanes tore across more than a dozen states, leaving trails of destruction from Texas to Michigan. Over 200,000 hurricane related damage claims were filed with State Farm from the 2024 hurricanes and customers have received over $1.9 Billion from State Farm to help them recover and rebuild. The damage wasn’t isolated to coastal communities, with many inland states seeing flooding, wind damage, and widespread power outages. The two significant back-to-back hurricanes Helene and Milton resulted in over 166,000 State Farm claims, primarily in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. 
Given the potential for high impact storms this time of year, State Farm is sharing preparation tips during the top active months of hurricane season:
  * **Review your insurance coverage.** Make sure you have the right amount and type of insurance for your property and to help protect your loved ones. Homeowners are urged to not wait until after disaster strikes to realize that inflation and increasing economic pressures may have impacted the cost to rebuild.
  * **Protect important insurance documents** and policy paperwork by placing them in a protected, waterproof place. And install your insurance app for electronic access to insurance documents.
  * **Create a home inventory.** Make a list of your possessions and their estimated value or **use technology to create your digital home inventory**.
    * **Take pictures with your smart phone.** Capture important individual items as well as entire rooms, closets or drawers. Label photos with what's pictured, where you bought it, the make or model and the serial number.
    * **Take video.** Walk through your house or apartment recording and describing the contents.
    * **Use an app.** There are many mobile app options that can help you create and store a room-by-room record of your belongings.
  * **Protect your property**. Move all large objects inside the house or garage. Board up windows as appropriate.
  * **Have an evacuation plan** and determine if you will ride out the storm in your home (if local authorities permit you to stay) or establish a safe place inland and plan an escape route. Tell relatives where you will be since communication during and after a natural disaster can be disrupted due to infrastructure damage.
  * **Bring out or prepare a storm emergency kit.** Make sure you have plenty of water, food, first aid supplies, clothing, blankets, and important documents such as printed insurance policies. Store your kit in airtight plastic bags or a plastic storage container with a lid.

## Resiliency and Recovery 
#####  **State Farm sponsors American Red Cross Disaster Fleet Across the Country**
As part of our ongoing commitment to community safety and disaster response, State Farm has donated 15 vehicles totaling $1 Million to Red Cross regions around the country. These vehicles will be used to support disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts - specifically serving those impacted by devastating catastrophes. 
The co-branded fleet – including four Emergency Response Vehicles – hit the streets in August, prepped for response at the start of peak hurricane season. The vehicles will be stationed for response in Red Cross regions spanning Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, Eastern New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, North Texas, Southeastern Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia. 
State Farm support is funding four Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) as well as 11 Community Response Vehicles (CRVs). Emergency Response Vehicles, which are SUVs, deploy to large-scale disasters delivering supplies such as food, water, and emergency kits. They are designed for easy maneuvering over rough terrain. 
The Red Cross utilizes CRVs to transport volunteers as well as life-giving emergency response supplies. Beyond providing critical relief items to disaster survivors, these vehicles also help Red Cross stock and support shelters, ensuring they are ready to care for displaced individuals.  
  
The American Red Cross responds to more than 65,000 disasters annually, and these additional vehicles help enhance the organization’s capacity to assist individuals and families during emergencies. This effort reflects State Farm’s core mission to be good neighbors and provide meaningful community support. This initiative also strengthens our decades-long partnership with the American Red Cross, supporting critical disaster preparedness and recovery initiatives such as Sound the Alarm, Be Red Cross Ready, and the Emergency App.
