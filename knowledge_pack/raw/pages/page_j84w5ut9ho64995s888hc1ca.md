### Bakersfield rates for teens

### Bakersfield rates for senior drivers

Loyalty discounts, good driver discounts and clean driving records can all help to lower the cost of car insurance for Bakersfield seniors.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Bakersfield
A conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious violation and can have an outsized impact on the cost of car insurance. The [California Driver’s Handbook](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/alcohol-and-drugs/) outlines the penalties for DUI convictions, which can include fines, [SR-22 filing](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-california/) and potential jail time.
If you have a DUI conviction on your record and are required to file an SR-22 certificate of financial responsibility with the CA DMV, your insurance rates will typically go up. Some carriers may even deny coverage to drivers with DUIs. A Bakersfield driver with a DUI conviction usually pays 158 percent more for state minimum coverage and 154 percent more for full coverage when compared to a driver with a clean record.

Minimum coverage requirements in Bakersfield
Bakersfield drivers are required by [California law](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) to carry at least the following auto insurance coverage:
  * $15,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $30,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $5,000 property damage liability per accident


In addition to [minimum liability coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/), your insurance company must offer a policy that includes uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, but you can decline this coverage in writing if you choose. You can also satisfy your financial obligations through a surety bond or cash deposit to the DMV totaling $35,000 in lieu of purchasing insurance.
California’s relatively low insurance requirements keep rates close to the national average when [compared to other states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/). Keep in mind, however, that only purchasing [California’s minimum coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/) would leave you with no direct coverage for physical damage to your vehicle after an at-fault accident and could leave you underinsured in the event of an accident where you are responsible for damages exceeding $30,000 for injuries and $5,000 for property damage.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Bakersfield?
Caret Down Icon
Almost all [Bakersfield auto insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies//) offer at least [a few discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), and taking advantage of these can have a significant impact on what you pay for coverage. You can often, for example, save a percentage off your rate by agreeing to receive policy documents online rather than via postal mail. Common safety elements on your car such as anti-lock brakes and airbags may also earn you a discount. Many insurers offer discounts to drivers with a demonstrated ability to drive safely, which can be monitored by an optional telematics device if you wish. Even if you prefer to do your insurance business online, it can be a good idea to do an annual review of your policy with an agent to ensure that you are not missing out on any discounts for which you qualify.
  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in Bakersfield?
Caret Down Icon
Auto insurance in Bakersfield, CA costs close to both the state and national averages. When it comes to full coverage, drivers in Bakersfield pay 1 percent more than drivers in Fresno, 31 percent less than drivers in Los Angeles and 0 percent more than drivers in San Jose.
  * ###  How can I get car insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
Purchasing car insurance in Bakersfield online rather than through an agent is becoming increasingly easy as insurers enhance their digital capabilities. In many cases, you can [compare auto rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) from multiple companies online by inputting some simple information, including your name, address and the vehicle's VIN number. Once you find the right company for your needs, you can complete your purchase via the company's website. Most major insurers also offer mobile apps for Android and iPhones that allow you to manage your policy digitally, pay bills, file claims and more.


## Methodology
Bankrate utilizes Quadrant Information Services to analyze September 2025 rates for all ZIP codes and carriers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Rates are weighted based on the population density in each geographic region. Quoted rates are based on a single, 40-year-old male and female driver with a clean driving record, good credit and the following full coverage limits:
  * $100,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $300,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $50,000 property damage liability per accident
  * $100,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per person
  * $300,000 uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident
  * $500 collision deductible
  * $500 comprehensive deductible


To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. Our base profile drivers own a 2023 Toyota Camry, commute five days a week and drive 12,000 miles annually.
These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes.
**Incidents** : Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket and single DUI conviction.
**Age** : Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 20-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations.
**Teens** : Rates were determined by adding a 16- or 18-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy.
### Bankrate Score methodology
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * Cost & ratings 50%

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
