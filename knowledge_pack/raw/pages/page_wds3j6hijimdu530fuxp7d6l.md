## What Is Non-Owner Car Insurance?
[Non-owner car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/non-owner-car-insurance) is a type of liability coverage designed for individuals who drive but do not own a car. It provides financial protection in the event that the driver causes an accident, covering bodily injury and property damage to others.
This [type of car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/types-of-car-insurance) is ideal for those who frequently rent cars, borrow vehicles, or use car-sharing services. However, it does not cover damage to the vehicle being driven or personal injuries sustained by the driver.
Here’s a comparison table between non-owner car insurance and a [full coverage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance) policy:
Feature | Non-Owner Car Insurance | Full Coverage Policy  
---|---|---  
Purpose | Liability protection for non-vehicle owners | Comprehensive protection for vehicle owners  
Covers | Bodily injury and property damage to others | Liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage

Cost | Lower premiums | Higher premiums due to extensive coverage  
Ideal For | Drivers without a personal vehicle | Vehicle owners seeking comprehensive protection  
Flexibility | Generally not customizable | Customizable options for broader protection  
Most non-owner car insurance policies only include liability coverage. They don’t cover damage to the car you drive. With [PolicyOwl](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/policyowl), you can upload your policy and instantly see where your coverage begins and ends.

  * $10,000 for bodily injury per person
  * $10,000 in bodily injury per accident
  * $10,000 for property damage per accident.
  * $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP)


## What Is SR-22 Insurance?
[SR-22](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/sr-22-insurance) is not a type of car insurance but rather a certificate of financial responsibility required for certain high-risk drivers. It serves as proof that the driver carries the minimum liability insurance required by state law.
Typically mandated after serious driving offenses like DUIs, reckless driving, or multiple traffic violations, the SR-22 is filed by the insurance company with the state’s motor vehicle department. While the SR-22 itself isn’t insurance, obtaining one often results in higher premiums because it signifies the driver is considered a greater risk by insurers. This requirement usually lasts for a specified period, such as three years.
## Average Cost Of Non-Owner Car Insurance In Florida
The average cost of non-owner car insurance in Florida is $40 per month. For non-owner SR-22 insurance, drivers in Florida pay around $55 per month.
Understanding the average cost of non-owner car insurance in Florida is essential for anyone who frequently rents or borrows cars. This type of insurance provides vital liability coverage without the full expenses of a standard policy, making it a practical choice for those without a personal vehicle.
## Average Cost Of Non-Owner Car Insurance In Florida – By Age
Age plays a significant role in determining the average cost of non-owner car insurance in Florida. Insurance companies assess risk based on various factors, and age is one of the most influential. Younger drivers often face higher premiums due to their perceived inexperience and higher risk of accidents.
Conversely, older drivers may enjoy lower rates as they are generally considered more experienced and lower risk. For example, a 20-year-old might pay around $1,194 annually, while a 50-year-old could see rates closer to $514.
Below is a table illustrating how average non-owner car insurance rates vary by age in Florida:

## Average Rates Vs Traditional Car Insurance
Understanding the distinction between non-owner car insurance and traditional car insurance is essential for making informed financial decisions. Non-owner car insurance is designed for individuals who frequently drive but do not own a vehicle. It primarily covers liability, offering protection against bodily injury and property damage to others, which generally makes it more affordable than traditional car insurance.
On the other hand, traditional car insurance includes comprehensive and collision coverage, protecting the vehicle itself from damage, theft, and more, thus resulting in higher premiums.
## Should You Get Non-Owner Car Insurance In Florida?
Non-owner car insurance is a valuable option for individuals who don’t own a vehicle but still find themselves in situations where liability coverage is necessary. Below are the different types of people who should consider this insurance, broken down by their specific needs.
### Renters
If you frequently rent cars, non-owner car insurance can save you money and provide better coverage than the insurance offered by rental companies. With a non-owner policy, you’ll have consistent liability coverage, which can be more comprehensive and cost-effective over time.
### Car Borrowers
People who borrow cars from friends or family members occasionally may benefit from non-owner car insurance. It ensures you’re covered for liability if you’re at fault in an accident while driving someone else’s vehicle, without relying solely on the car owner’s insurance policy.
### License Reinstatement
Non-owner car insurance is often required for drivers reinstating their license after a suspension or revocation due to serious violations, such as a DUI. Filing an SR-22 alongside a non-owner policy demonstrates financial responsibility and compliance with state requirements.
### Infrequent Drivers
If you rarely drive but still want to maintain continuous insurance coverage to avoid gaps, a non-owner policy is a practical solution. It helps you avoid higher premiums in the future, as gaps in coverage can signal a higher risk to insurers.
### Drivers Between Cars
If you’ve sold your car or are in between purchasing vehicles, non-owner car insurance can provide interim liability protection. This ensures you remain insured during the transition and maintain a good insurance history.
