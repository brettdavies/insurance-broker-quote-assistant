#### Our Overall Rating: 4.7 / 5 (Excellent)
With its solid financials, eight decades of business experience, and commitment to providing consumers with modern mobile and internet customer interfaces, Progressive is an excellent choice for homeowners coverage. 
* * *
## Financial Strength
### Financial Strength - 5 / 5
Progressive enjoys high ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and AM Best.   
  
The company appears to be on a sound financial footing. Though they only write homeowners policies in 19 states, these have enough geographic diversity to protect the company against heavy and localized claims experience resulting from a natural disaster or other event.

_*The above information reflects the financial strength of the underwriter of the Progressive home insurance policies:**Progressive Casualty.**_

## Customer Experience
### Customer Service - 4.8 / 5
The company is rated A+ by the BBB. As with most sizable companies of any industry, Progressive's negative BBB reviews significantly outnumber its positive ones, but the company's statistics here are in line with most [other insurers of comparable size](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/home-insurance/best-home-insurance).   
  
Communicating with the company is generally done online or through an app, rather than in person.

## Progressive Coverage
### Coverage Options - 4.5 / 5
Progressive offers the usual [suite of homeowners insurance coverages](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/home-insurance/home-insurance-basics) - structures, personal property, and liability.   
  
It also offers the most commonly available optional coverages, in addition to an unusual inflation coverage, which automatically adjusts insurance levels to keep up with rising building and repair costs.
Basic Coverage Types |  Dwelling Protection Other Structures Protection Personal Property Protection Liability Protection Guest Medical Protection  
---|---  
Additional Coverage | Scheduled Personal Property Coverage  
* * *
## Pricing & Discounts
### Pricing and Discounts - 4.5 / 5
Many companies claim that automating their policy initiation service reduces costs and saves consumers money.   
  
As evidenced by Progressive's above-average rating for pricing, however, this is one company that appears to have lived up to its claims. Discounts are available for customers that already hold other Progressive policies, have home security systems, or are retired. 
### Household Discounts
  * New Home
  * Home Safety Features


### Policy Discounts
  * Multi-Policy
  * Higher Deductible
  * Claim-Free

My experience with America Strategic/Progressive House Insurance has been the worst. The one-star rating is being gracious. Indiana Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act requires insurers to act in good faith. This includes a duty to communicate, investigate, and resolve claims in a timely manner. There was a complete lack of effective communication from the agent assigned to my claim—she never once reached out to me by phone. It took 44 days for an adjuster to visit and assess the damage to my kitchen. The claims agent ignored several of my emails and prioritized her holiday vacations, showing little regard for the urgency of my situation. When I called to gain a better... Read More

To begin with it's impossible to reach a human being to resolve your issue. They are NOT a customer friendly company by any stretch, I bought it based on positive experiences with Progressive auto insurance. Bad move. The two are like night and day. Don't waste your money here. Based on a total loss claim from a house fire I got a small fraction of what I lost. Example. Out of 60 thousand dollar contents claim I got $16,000. They're not the same company as their auto insurance. Look elsewhere.

Don't expect anything from a Progressive claim, apart from rudeness and a condescending manner from the Progressive customer service and their claims adjusters. We had 60mph winds and storms in the Mid-West 2 weeks ago which took out the boundary fencing. Total bill to repair $2800 - lowest of four well-regarded and experienced fencing contractor's estimates. Deductible was $1500 (Hail, wind, storm) so we already knew that was going to be out-of-pocket. Progressive paid $89 on this claim, valuing the work needed at $1589. When questioned they literally shouted back on the phone that they knew best and the contractors were wrong. They had sent a roofing inspector to inspect the fence and... Read More

We are the original homeowner. The home is 24 years old. Yesterday our garage door collapsed. According to the repair man the spring broke. Needless to say Progressive would not cover the damage. Per them it was an age issue, also per the Homestead insurance claims adjuster we were talking to, the average lifespan they will cover is garage doors from new to 30 years...WELL progressive homestead?...I believe 24 years is within the 30 years we were quoted. Now comes the pity statement . We are retired!!! We are old...but we still keep our house up. Definitely this “insurance company” is just in it for the money. About 5 years ago Surprise had a big storm...we literally watched our... Read More

Was affected by storms in the Midwest. Progrssive Home owners is terrible. 1st clue when you call to report a claim one of the first speed dial options is "if you are an attorney calling on behalf of a claiment". Expect bad service, from them to not pay claims as expected and months of run around. Expect them to do everything they can to not honor thier obligations. Be ready for a long battle. I would not ever recommend Proressive to anyone.

Progressive is the worst insurance company I have a damaged roof due to wind damage. they send out a adjuster. To look at my roof. He said it could be repaired. The roofer contractor says it cannot be repaired because it’s failing a brutal test. I have been fighting with them for over a year.

Progressive is the worst insurance company! I had my vehicle stolen and they treated me like I did something wrong! They are not for the customers at all! They take you money and tell you to figure it out. No support whatsoever! My vehicle has been at the dealership for almost 30 days and no repairs has been done! I only have a rental car for 30 days and then I have to turn it in with no other transportation because my vehicle has NOT BEEN REPAIRED! They still take your full premium while you have no car to drive and don't care if you have transportation or not!!! This has been a horrible experience and Progressive has not been of any help or comfort during this situation. Do not... Read More

I have a recent claim that my claim adjuster Reid Bernard has limited my repair coverage and hotel expenses to the $2500 mold damage limit and this is unacceptable. ALE coverage is outside of the mold limit and should be treated as such. The treatment of my expenses upstairs should be handled the same as downstairs.

Was a emerald rated customer with progressive for 18yrs plus. Had my car, truck , motor home and my house with them.Got a call one day from a women telling they would not be renewing my homeowners policy.I asked why she said the mailed me letters and called months ago asking about my roof on my house. No one called me or sent me a single letter ! Its because every year they increase my premiums with stuff I didn't ask for or need.....I would call and have it removed I'm sure it had something to do with being cancelled.Very sneaky company go to Geico I switched to them and received a big discount with my excellent credit rating.
