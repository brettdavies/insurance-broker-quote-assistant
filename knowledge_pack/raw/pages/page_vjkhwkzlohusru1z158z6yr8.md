To receive an accurate home insurance quote, you’ll need to provide some personal information, but you may be reluctant to do this. Many people worry about how a company will use and store their personal information or that they’ll start receiving spam emails and phone calls.
Plus, if the company is the victim of a data breach, that could leave your sensitive information exposed. If you have these concerns, you can do things to minimize the amount of personal information you share when [**getting a home insurance quote**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) online.
Quick Facts
  * Insurance companies ask for a lot of information when you request a quote to determine how risky it is to insure you in the event of a covered loss.
  * When applying for a home insurance policy, you’ll need to provide details like your name, marital status, home address, and ZIP code.
  * Using a secure insurance-comparison website is a good way to receive an anonymous home insurance quote.

## How to get an anonymous home insurance quote
It’s possible to get an anonymous home insurance quote, though it may not be as accurate as a customized one. Insurance companies consider a number of factors to determine your monthly insurance premiums, including the state you live in, your claims history, credit history, and the characteristics of your home.[[1]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/anonymous-home-insurance-quote/#cite-1)
If you don’t provide this information, it’ll be hard for insurers to provide accurate home insurance rates and coverage options on a [**standard home insurance policy**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/). And even if you receive an anonymous quote, you can’t finalize your application for home insurance anonymously.
The best option is to conceal details that don’t affect your insurance rates, like your email address and contact information. For example, providing a “burner” email address allows you to evaluate the initial quote. From there, you can decide whether you want to move forward with the application.

## Personal information needed for an accurate homeowners insurance quote
Insurance companies ask for a lot of information to determine the coverage types that best meet your needs and give you an accurate quote. More information helps the company find the right coverage for your situation, like liability insurance, [**replacement cost coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/replacement-cost/), and personal property coverage.
You’ll typically need to provide the following personal details for a homeowners policy:
  * Name
  * Age
  * Gender
  * Marital status
  * Household size
  * Home type (one-story, two-story, etc.)
  * ZIP code
  * Address and previous address (if lived in less than two years)
  * If you have a security system and fire alarm system
  * Whether you have a mortgage
  * The actual cost of your home (the higher the price, the higher the rates)
  * Construction type
  * Roof type
  * Whether your property has any potential risks, like a swimming pool
  * Details about your personal belongings
  * Information about your current policy


Providing this information is vital if you want to receive an accurate insurance quote. The [**average cost of homeowners insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance/) can vary widely depending on where you live. Insurers consider local construction costs, weather events, and crime rates to determine pricing for property damage.
For Example
If you live in an area prone to flooding — like Florida and Louisiana, for example — you can expect to pay more for home insurance. That’s because you’ll likely need additional [**flood insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) to protect your property. And if you live in a flood zone, your lender may require you to purchase a flood policy.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/anonymous-home-insurance-quote/#cite-2)
## Pros and cons of anonymous home insurance quotes
When you apply for a home insurance quote, the company will require you to fill out a form and provide sensitive information. Here are the biggest pros and cons of anonymous home insurance quotes.
Pros
  * **Conceal your personal information:** Since you aren’t sharing any personal info, you aren’t at risk of having your information misused.
  * **Limits spam:** Using a burner email address and declining to provide your phone number limits the number of unwanted calls and emails you’ll receive.
  * **Comparison shop:** Shopping for home insurance quotes anonymously lets you evaluate your options and find the best deal.


Cons
  * **Less accuracy:** Anonymous home insurance quotes will always be less accurate since they’re based on general information.
  * **No personalization:** Without knowing the specifics of your situation, insurers can’t create a personalized insurance quote for you.
  * **Minimal coverage details:** Since you’re only providing general information, the insurance company won’t be able to give you many details about the coverage options and exclusions. This can make it harder to compare policies.


## Three ways to protect your personal information while getting home insurance quotes
If you need to purchase a homeowners insurance policy but are concerned about data privacy, here are three ways you can protect your personal information.
### 1. Use a secure comparison website
Using a comparison website like Insurify allows you to receive multiple quotes at once while protecting your personal information. And Insurify is a spam-free website, so you don’t have to worry about getting bombarded with emails from insurers after applying.
When you apply, you’ll need to provide your name, address, and property details to receive a free quote.

### 2. Use a home insurance calculator
A home insurance calculator is an online tool for estimating your home insurance premiums. You can estimate the costs based on your property type, location, coverage level, and personal information. This helps you understand what you might pay without providing sensitive information to many different insurers.
### 3. Provide limited personal information
You can provide limited personal information when applying for home insurance quotes. For example, you can provide basic details about your property and avoid providing information like your Social Security number. You can also use temporary contact information, like a secondary email address and phone number.
## How Insurify protects your information
Insurify offers free home insurance quotes and takes many different steps to [**protect your personal information**](https://insurify.com/company/policy/). A licensed agent in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., Insurify guarantees you’ll never receive spam emails or phone calls after using our service.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000


Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.
