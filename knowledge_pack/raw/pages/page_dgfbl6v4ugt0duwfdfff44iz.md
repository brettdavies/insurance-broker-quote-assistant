# Best Cheap Non-Owner Car Insurance
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_30/employee_photos/Matt_Timmons_VP_V2)
Written by [ Matt Timmons ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/author/matt-timmons)
Updated Jul 8, 2025
State Farm has the cheapest non-owner car insurance, at $213 per year.
Non-owner auto insurance is for drivers who don't own a car but still want coverage while they are renting vehicles or driving someone else's car.
The cost of non-owner car insurance is much less than even a typical liability-only insurance policy. But getting quotes for non-owner coverage is more difficult than it is for standard auto insurance. Not all insurers sell non-owner coverage, and it isn't typically sold online.

How much you'll save with a non-owner policy varies considerably by insurer. For example, Geico's rates were 53% cheaper without a vehicle. But Progressive's were only 12% less.
### Annual rates of non-owner vs. owner car insurance
| Non-owner policy | Policy with car | Percent savings  
---|---|---|---

Average | $516 | $879 | -41%

Progressive | $656 | $748 | -12%  
Farmers | $675 | $1,278 | -47%  
### Why is non-owner auto insurance so cheap?
Nonowner insurance is cheap because it only includes liability coverage, and because people who buy it typically don't drive as much as those who own cars.
Non-owner car insurance is also cheaper than typical policies because you are likely to drive less and are less likely to file a claim. One of the questions insurance companies typically ask is the number of miles you plan to drive in a year. People who drive more often are at a higher risk of getting into an accident, which causes the insurance company to pay out for a claim.
Insurers will assume that people who don't own a car won't drive very often, and they will charge less for non-owner policies.
Non-owner auto insurance is also usually cheaper than a full-coverage auto insurance policy because it doesn't include comprehensive or collision coverage, which are included in full-coverage policies and cover repairs and replacement to your own vehicle after an accident.
It can be one of the most expensive components that make up the cost of your policy — at least [half the cost](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance#cost "Comprehensive and Collision Insurance Cost") of a full-coverage policy.
## How to get non-owner car insurance quotes
To get non-owner car insurance quotes, you'll need to call insurance companies directly, as most companies don't offer online quotes for non-owner coverage.
Because non-owner car insurance policies are atypical, it's possible that you will need to get a [non-standard car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/nonstandard-auto-insurance "What Is Non-Standard Auto Insurance") company.
Non-standard auto insurers specialize in offering coverage to higher-risk drivers, and those seeking non-owner auto insurance are sometimes considered high-risk. If you don't currently have an auto insurance policy or haven't had one for quite some time, insurers will view you as riskier than drivers who have kept consistent coverage. This is true even if you haven't needed car insurance in the past.
It can be harder to get a non-owner car insurance policy than regular insurance.
Non-standard auto insurance policies may be the only option if you are seeking an [SR-22 non-owner car insurance policy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/non-owner-sr22-car-insurance "How much is non-owner SR-22 insurance?"). This is often the case for drivers who have had their licenses suspended (often for a DUI), don't own a car and need to file an SR-22 to get their licenses reinstated. An SR-22 is a form an insurance company files on your behalf that proves that you have liability insurance.
## Methodology
ValuePenguin collected sample rates across every ZIP code in Illinois for a non-owner liability-only policy. Rates are for a 30-year-old male man with good credit and a clean driving record, who drives a 2015 Honda Civic EX.

---|---  
Bodily injury liability | $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident  
Property damage | $25,000 per accident  
Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury | $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
