The average homeowners insurance cost is $1,951 annually for $350,000 dwelling coverage, but our research found that you can save hundreds or even thousands a year by shopping around and comparing home insurance policies.  
  
To help you find the cheapest home insurance companies, we researched rates for 14 companies for multiple levels of coverage: $200,000, $350,000, $500,000 and $750,000. We also analyzed consumer complaint information. We found that the cheapest policy for one level of coverage doesn’t generally mean that the company will have the best price for every dwelling limit. Review our research to find the home insurance company that best matches your needs and budget.

Our Expert Take
USAA did well in our analysis because it offers excellent home insurance rates across four levels of dwelling coverage. That’s coupled with very low complaints to state insurance departments. If you qualify for a USAA policy, it would be wise to request a quote from USAA to see how much you could save.
**More:**[USAA Home Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/usaa-home-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Offers extended replacement coverage up to 150%, which can help provide enough funds to rebuild your home if it’s destroyed during times of high inflation and building costs
  * Provides an excellent digital experience, including the option to get online quotes
  * Does not have a banned dog list


  * Eligibility is limited to veterans, military members and their families
  * Doesn’t provide guaranteed replacement coverage, which pays to rebuild a home regardless of the amount if it’s destroyed by a problem covered by a policy, such as a fire
  * Average bundling discount (8%) is much lower than many competitors

Our Expert Take
We like that State Farm policyholders save over $500 on average each year for $350,000 dwelling coverage compared to top competitors in our analysis. We also picked State Farm because it has one of the largest bundling discounts of the companies we analyzed.
**More:**[State Farm Home Insurance Review](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/state-farm-home-insurance-review/)
Pros & Cons
  * Customers save 23% on average when they bundle home and auto policies, among the highest savings among the companies evaluated
  * Home insurance rates are lower than average for multiple levels of dwelling coverage
  * Provides a good digital experience, based on our analysis


  * Doesn’t provide guaranteed replacement coverage, which increases your dwelling coverage so you can get your house rebuilt after a covered issue regardless of inflation and construction costs
  * Complaint level to state insurance departments is only about average
  * Average rates for homeowners with poor credit ($3,473 a year) are only so-so

We’re impressed by Erie Insurance’s cheaper-than-average home insurance rates. Erie has the second cheapest rates for $200,000 dwelling coverage and competitive rates for higher levels of coverage.

A [credit-based insurance score](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-insurance-score/) is not the same as your personal credit score. For example, your regular FICO credit score looks at several factors of your credit history to determine how likely you are to repay a loan or credit card, while a credit-based insurance score looks at the factors to determine how likely you are to file an insurance claim.

### Cheapest Homeowners Insurance for Those with a High Deductible: Progressive
Progressive has the cheapest homeowners insurance if you’re choosing a high deductible for your policy.
You can save money by raising your [homeowners insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible/).

Choosing a higher deductible can save money but make sure you choose a deductible that makes sense for you in the event you have to make a claim.

### Shop Around
I recommend comparison shopping, which includes getting quotes from at least three different companies. Request quotes for the same coverage levels from each insurer so that you can compare apples to apples.

### Maximize Discounts
I recommend making sure you’re getting all the [home insurance discounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/find-discounts/) you’re eligible for. One way is by bundling insurance for your house and vehicles with the same company, which is usually one of the best discounts, often between 5% to 25%. Other common discounts include loyalty discounts, new home discounts and retired discounts.

### Increase Your Deductible
I suggest asking your insurance agent how much you can save if you increase your [home insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-deductible/). The deductible is the amount deducted from an insurance claim check. By lowering potential payouts, you should get cheaper home insurance.

### Install Storm-Resistant Roof, Shutters
Depending on where you live, you may save on insurance by updating your roof and shutters. Certain types of roofing materials can result in lower home insurance premiums. I’ve also seen that some homeowners insurance companies offer discounts for houses with storm shutters and impact-resistant glass on exterior windows.

#### Don’t Get More Than You Need
The bells and whistles may sound nice, but are they worth the extra cost? I would suggest reviewing your coverage and make sure the limits and coverage perks make sense. For instance, does a lower liability limit still cover your assets? Do you really need a policy add-on that increases your rates?
[ ![Ashlee Valentine](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/150x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ashlee-Tilford-e1701361587850-150x150.jpg) ](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/atilford/)

## The Risks of Buying Cheap Home Insurance
While paying less for home insurance may be your goal, don’t sacrifice coverage for a cheaper policy that leaves you underinsured.
That includes purchasing enough dwelling coverage to pay to repair or replace your home if it’s damaged. Your insurance company or agent should help you figure out the right amount of dwelling coverage.
You also want to get enough [personal liability home insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/). Liability coverage pays for accidental injury or damage that you and your household members do to others. It also pays for your legal defense if you’re sued because of an injury or damage covered by your home insurance.
Instead, consider other ways to decrease costs, such as choosing a higher deductible and shopping around for a policy with lower rates by [comparing home insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/compare-home-insurance-quotes/).
## Methodology
To find the cheapest home insurance companies we analyzed costs around the country and complaints about home insurance made to state departments of insurance. We scored companies based on these factors:
  * **Home insurance rates for $200,000 dwelling coverage (20% of score):** Based on average rates for each insurance company for homes with that dwelling limit. Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
  * **Home insurance rates for $350,000 dwelling coverage (20% of score):** Based on average rates for each insurance company for homes with that dwelling coverage. Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
  * **Home insurance rates for $500,000 dwelling coverage (20% of score):** Based on average rates for each insurance company for homes with that dwelling coverage. Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
  * **Home insurance rates for $750,000 dwelling coverage (20% of score):** Based on average rates for each insurance company for homes with that dwelling coverage. Source: [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
  * **Complaints (20% of score):** Based on complaints about home insurance that were upheld by state insurance departments. Source: [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).

##  Cheapest Homeowners Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
### Why does my home insurance premium keep going up?
Home insurance companies base their rates on risk, so you may see your [home insurance costs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-homeowners-insurance/) increase if you file claims or if there have been multiple claims in your area. An insurance company could also increase rates based on other factors, including inflation and higher building costs.
### What is the cheapest state for home insurance?
Hawaii is the cheapest state for [home insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/). Homeowners pay $389 annually, on average, for a home policy with $350,000 dwelling coverage. Two other states have an annual average rate of less than $1,000 for that coverage: Vermont ($927) and Nevada ($975).
### Is home insurance more expensive if I have a pool?
Home insurance companies may charge you more if you have a pool since insurers may deem your property a higher risk. 
Our analysis found that Erie charges 15% more on average to homeowners with a pool and who have $350,000 dwelling coverage. Other companies that charge more for pools include Westfield (12%), Travelers (9%) and Farmers (6%). Companies that don’t charge more for pools include Allstate, Auto-Owners, Chubb, Country Financial and Nationwide, according to our research. Still, many other factors affect home insurance costs, so it’s always smart to [compare home insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/compare-home-insurance-quotes/) to make sure you’re getting the best deal.
