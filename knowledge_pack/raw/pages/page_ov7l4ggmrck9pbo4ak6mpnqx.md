# Texas Property Damage Claim Lawyer
Texas faces a high risk of property damage due to its diverse and extreme weather patterns, making it one of the most hazard-prone states in the U.S. Coastal cities like [Houston](https://www.werepresentyou.com/texas-property-damage/houston/), Galveston, and [Corpus Christi](https://www.werepresentyou.com/texas-property-damage/corpus-christi/) are especially vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms, which can cause devastating flooding and wind damage. Dallas and Fort Worth, located in Tornado Alley, frequently experience severe tornadoes that can result in extensive structural damage. 
Cities such as [Austin](https://www.werepresentyou.com/texas-property-damage/austin/), [Bay City](https://www.werepresentyou.com/texas-property-damage/bay-city/) and [San Antonio](https://www.werepresentyou.com/texas-property-damage/san-antonio/) are also at risk from flash floods and hailstorms. The state’s expansive geography means that almost every area is susceptible to some form of natural disaster. At Larry Moskowitz, PA, our top-rated lawyers for [property damage claims](https://www.werepresentyou.com/practice-areas/property-damage-claims/) and Boots on the Ground team can provide you with the strong legal representation you need to recover compensation from the insurance company.

## Texas Property Damage Laws for Recovering Compensation 
Texas property damage laws are governed by a combination of state statutes, case law, and local regulations. Our knowledgeable property damage attorneys in Texas use the full force of these laws to protect your rights and defeat the insurance company’s attempts to undervalue or deny your claim for both real property and personal property.
### Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code contains provisions that guide the legal process for civil lawsuits, including property damage claims. This code outlines the general principles of liability, the requirements for filing a lawsuit, and the potential damages that can be awarded. Specific sections of interest include:
  * Chapter 16: Limitations – This chapter details the statute of limitations for various types of claims. For property damage, the statute of limitations is typically two years from the date the damage occurred or was discovered.
  * Chapter 33: Proportionate Responsibility – This chapter covers the principles of comparative negligence, which can affect the amount of compensation a plaintiff can recover if they are found to be partially at fault for the damage.
  * Chapter 41: Damages – This chapter outlines the types of damages that can be awarded in a property damage lawsuit, including actual damages (cost of repair or replacement), exemplary damages (punitive damages), and prejudgment interest.


### Texas Insurance Code
The Texas Insurance Code regulates the practices of insurance companies and provides protections for policyholders. Texas property damage lawyer Larry Moskowitz is well-versed with the key provisions related to property damage claims, which include:
  * Chapter 541: Unfair Methods of Competition and Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices – This chapter prohibits insurance companies from engaging in unfair practices, such as misrepresenting policy terms, failing to promptly investigate claims, and denying claims without a reasonable basis.
  * Chapter 542: Processing and Settlement of Claims – Also known as the Prompt Payment of Claims Act, this chapter sets timelines for insurance companies to acknowledge, investigate, and pay claims. It includes penalties for insurers who fail to meet these deadlines.
  * Chapter 2002: Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) – This chapter establishes the TWIA, which provides windstorm and hail insurance for properties in designated coastal areas. This is particularly relevant for property owners in hurricane-prone regions of Texas.


### Local Regulations in Texas Cities 
In addition to state statutes, local regulations can impact a property damage insurance claim. These regulations may include building codes, zoning laws, and ordinances that dictate construction standards and safety requirements. Property owners must ensure that their properties comply with these local regulations to avoid complications in their claims.
### Case Law and Precedents
Texas case law, derived from court decisions, also plays a significant role in shaping property damage laws. Courts interpret statutes and apply legal principles to specific cases, creating precedents that influence future claims. Key areas of case law include:
  * Interpretation of Insurance Policies – Courts often decide disputes over the interpretation of insurance policy terms, such as what constitutes “wear and tear” versus covered damage.
  * Bad Faith Claims – Courts address claims of bad faith against insurance companies, setting precedents for what constitutes unreasonable denial or delay of claims.


## Common Property Damage Claims and What Evidence We Use
Texas property claim lawyer Larry Moskowitz and his Boots on the Ground team will move fast to secure all possible evidence and make a strong claim for damages to the insurance provider on your behalf. Our services extend to all types of property damage insurance claims, including:
### Storm Damage Claims
Texas is no stranger to severe storms that cause massive property damage. Whether it is hurricanes, tornadoes, or thunderstorms, the impact on homes and businesses can be devastating.
Types of Evidence Collected:
  * Photographic Evidence: High-resolution photographs and videos of the damage, taken immediately after the storm
  * Weather Reports: Official weather reports and storm tracking data to establish the timing and severity of the storm
  * Structural Assessments: Detailed inspections and reports from structural engineers to assess the extent of the damage to the property
  * Damage Estimates: Comprehensive repair estimates from licensed contractors and construction experts
  * Insurance Policy Review: Examination of the insurance policy to identify applicable coverage and exclusions


### Water Damage Claims
