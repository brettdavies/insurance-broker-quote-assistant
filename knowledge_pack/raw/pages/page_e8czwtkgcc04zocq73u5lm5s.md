If you live in or are moving to the Land of Lincoln, you’ll need car insurance to drive legally. Luckily, car insurance rates in Illinois are below the national average. Several factors, such as the state’s low DUI rate and better-than-average credit scores, contribute to Illinois’s affordable car insurance costs.
Below, we’ll break down how much you can expect to pay in Illinois based on the most relevant insurance rate determinants.
## Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois
The statewide average premium for full coverage car insurance in Illinois is $1,653 annually (or $138 monthly). That’s about 14 percent cheaper than the national average of $1,924. If you pay more than that, it might be because of your driving history, car insurance provider, age or coverage level — or it could be time to price check against other providers to ensure you’re getting the lowest rate.
Here’s a detailed look at how your background and driving history might contribute to your costs in Illinois.
### Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois By Age
Young drivers between 16 and 25 years old pay the highest car insurance rates because of their relative driving inexperience, resulting in more accidents and [distracted driving](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/teen-distracted-driving/). Prices tick up again for [seniors](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/seniors/) once they reach their seventies. Here’s the full breakdown by age:
Age | Average annual cost of car insurance in Illinois  
---|---  
16 | $4,195  
18 | $4,130  
20s | $2,662  
30s | $1,518  
40s | $1,490  
50s | $1,350  
60s | $1,344  
70s | $1,461  
[Seniors are statistically more likely to get into accidents](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/senior-driver-facts-statistics/), which is why there’s an uptick in premiums for Americans over 70.
### Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois By Coverage Level
Illinois requires the following minimum auto insurance coverages and limits:
  * Bodily injury liability: $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident
  * Property damage liability: $20,000 per accident
  * Uninsured/underinsured motorist bodily injury: $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident


The number of uninsured drivers in Illinois has grown to over 16 percent, the 13th highest in the country. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage helps pay for your injuries if you’re involved in an accident with a driver who doesn’t have any or enough insurance, as well as injuries resulting from [hit-and-runs](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/what-to-do-after-hit-and-run/).
If you can afford it, it’s wise to increase your liability limits and add coverages like collision and comprehensive, to protect yourself financially after a serious accident. Additionally, if you leased or financed your car, your lender may require you to carry collision and comprehensive. Here’s how much you can expect to pay by coverage level in Illinois.
Coverage level | Average annual cost of car insurance in Illinois  
---|---  
Minimum coverage | $534  
Full coverage | $1,653  
### Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois By Credit Score
In most of the United States, insurance providers can look at your credit history to generate your premiums. Unfortunately, Illinois is one of those states and car insurance providers are allowed to use [credit scores](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/credit-scores/) to adjust insurance rates. Expect to pay more for car insurance if you have a poor credit score. Here’s a detailed breakdown.
Credit score | Average annual cost of car insurance in Illinois  
---|---  
Poor (Under 500) | $2,618  
Average (500-675) | $1,772  
Good (676-799) | $1,513  
Excellent (800-850) | $1,186  
### Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois By Violation
The more traffic violations you have on your record and the more severe those traffic violations are, the higher your insurance rates will be.
Driving history | Average annual cost of car insurance in Illinois  
---|---  
Clean driving record | $1,653  
[Speeding ticket](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/speeding-ticket-impact-insurance/) | $1,793  
At-fault accident | $2,152  
DUI | $2,730  
The average profile of a DUI offender in Illinois is male (74 percent of all DUIs) and under the age of 45 (55 percent of all DUIs).[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/cost/#citation-1)
### Average Cost of Auto Insurance in Illinois By Company 
Premium rates depend on a provider’s specialization within the industry and your specific background. In Illinois, here’s what those averages will look like among some of the largest car insurance companies.
Company | Average annual cost of car insurance in Illinois  
---|---  
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/reviews/) | $2,768

### How to Save on Car Insurance in Illinois
State-specific discounts differ from provider to provider in Illinois, which means you should talk to your agent or a customer service representative directly to learn about your saving opportunities. However, you can follow several auto insurance tips to help you save on car insurance:
  1. Compare [quotes](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/) before you decide on a provider.
  2. Take advantage of pay-per-mile plans if you don’t drive very much.
  3. Increase your deductibles.
  4. Drive a vehicle that isn’t expensive to insure. Small SUVs, standard SUVs and pick-up trucks are some of the cheapest cars to insure.
  5. Maintain a good credit score.
  6. Drive safely.


### Illinois Fault Law
Illinois is an at-fault state, which means the driver responsible for an accident must pay for the other party’s injuries and property damages. Illinois functions under a modified comparative negligence system.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/cost/#citation-2)
The comparative negligence law in Illinois states that if a driver is at least 51 percent [at fault](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident-your-fault/) in an accident, they cannot claim any compensation from the other party. If a driver is less than 51 percent at fault, they can collect compensation from the other party, minus the damage they incurred. So, if someone gets into an accident and is 40 percent at fault, they can claim 60 percent of what they spent on damages from the other party.
### SR-22s
If you have a history of driving violations or an otherwise poor driving record, you might need an [SR-22](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-sr22/) to drive. An SR-22 is a certificate of financial responsibility that proves you have the minimum insurance requirements to drive in Illinois.
According to the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State, you will need an SR-22 if you have one of the following on your driving record:
  * Safety responsibility suspension
  * Unsatisfied judgment suspension
  * Revocation
  * Mandatory insurance supervision
  * Three or more convictions for mandatory insurance violations, such as [driving without insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/driving-without-insurance-penalties/)


### Recap
On average, you will pay less for insurance in Illinois if you’re a safe driver and take advantage of available discounts — especially compared to other states in the U.S. To find the best deals and providers in Illinois, we recommend you compare quotes, talk to agents about your specific needs and check out our review of the [best insurance companies in Illinois](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/illinois/best-car-insurance/).
