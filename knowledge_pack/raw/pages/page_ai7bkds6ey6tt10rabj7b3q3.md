## How does credit score affect car insurance rates in California?
In most states, car insurance companies can use your credit report and credit score to determine your premiums. However, California is one of the few exceptions that bans or limits the use of credit scores in calculating rates — insurers cannot use your credit history or score for underwriting or rating policies. 
However, we found that those with excellent credit often had higher rates than those with poor or fair credit. The discrepancy can be due to other factors; for example, those with excellent credit may be purchasing luxury vehicles that come with higher insurance premiums.
**Credit health** | **Avg. monthly premium**  
---|---  
Poor (550-649) | $248/month  
Average (650-699) | $192/month  
Good (700-749) | $172/month  
Excellent (750+) | $204/month  
## Average car insurance rates for high-risk drivers in California
High-risk drivers are individuals with a higher likelihood of filing claims or getting into accidents. Insurers consider high-risk drivers as those with past speeding tickets, driving under the influence (DUI) convictions, or at-fault accidents, and charge much higher premiums. 
Depending on the driving violation, you could see a significant increase. 
**Violation** | **Avg. monthly premium _before_ violation*** | **Avg. monthly premium _after_ violation**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident | $199/month | $233/month  
DUI | $199/month | $243/month  
Speeding ticket | $199/month | $243/month  
_*Assumes clean driving record with good credit_

## How does age affect car insurance rates in California?
Age plays a big role in determining your car insurance premiums. Young drivers are more likely to be in accidents than other age groups, so they tend to have higher premiums. But we found that once you reach the age of 30, rates decrease and stay relatively the same through age 60. 
**Age** | **Avg. monthly premium**  
---|---  
17 | $373/month  
25 | $266/month  
30 | $201/month  
40 | $193/month  
60 | $177/month  
  
## California car insurance rates by city
Your location is another major factor in determining your credit. Generally, urban drivers pay more than those that live in rural or suburban areas, and locations with higher rates of crime tend to be more expensive. 
In California, Los Angeles is the most expensive city for car insurance, averaging $305 per month. That's no surprise, considering [NeighborhoodScout](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/los-angeles/crime) gave the city a "9" on its crime index, meaning that 91% of U.S. cities are safer than Los Angeles. 
**City** | **Avg. monthly full-coverage premium**  
---|---  
Anaheim | $204/month  
Bakersfield | $182/month  
Fresno | $178/month  
Long Beach | $236/month  
Los Angeles  
| $305/month  
  
San Diego  
| $175/month  
  
San Francisco  
| $253/month  
  
## CA's minimum car insurance requirements
In California, all drivers must have proof of financial responsibility. But that can take several forms: 
  * Car insurance policy 
  * Cash deposit of $35,000 with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) 
  * DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance 
  * Surety bond of $35,000 or more from a company licensed to do business within the state 


The majority of drivers will meet those requirements with a car insurance policy. For auto coverage, drivers must meet the following [liability coverage](https://financebuzz.com/what-is-liability-insurance-coverage) minimums: 
  * $15,000 for the injury or death of one person 
  * $30,000 for the injury or death of more than one person 
  * $5,000 for property damage 


## How to save money on car insurance in California
You can save money on California auto insurance with the following tips: 
  * **Compare premiums:** Car insurance rates can vary by company, so shopping around and requesting quotes from the [best car insurance companies](https://financebuzz.com/best-car-insurance-companies) could help you get the same or better coverage at a lower rate. 
  * **Bundle your car insurance with other policies:** If you have renters or homeowners insurance, you may qualify for a discount if you also purchase auto coverage from the same insurer. 
  * **Talk to your agent about discounts:** Insurance companies usually have discount programs for drivers with clean driving records, students, or those that complete safe driving courses. 
  * **Increase your deductible:** Your premiums are partially based on your deductible, which is how much you have to cover before your insurer pays for repairs or damages. Boosting your deductible can lower your premium, but make sure you can comfortably afford that cost before increasing it. 


## Methodology
Our analysis was conducted using six different auto insurance marketplaces to determine the average cost of auto insurance in each state. The data we analyzed included coverage premiums from up to 10 different insurance providers. We looked at rates by city, driver profile, and credit score, as well as factored in the impact of driving violations. This data is for comparative purposes only. Your actual quote may be different.
