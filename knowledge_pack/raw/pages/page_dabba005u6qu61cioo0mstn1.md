## Why Understanding Your Insurance Coverage Is Important
No one plans to be in a car accident, but accidents happen—even on familiar roads like I-90, Route 17, or those near the beautiful Taughannock Falls State Park. And when they do, insurance coverage becomes essential. It’s not just about repairing vehicles; it’s about ensuring you can recover physically, emotionally, and financially after an accident. While New York law sets certain minimums, these may not be enough to fully cover all the damages and injuries resulting from a serious crash.
## Types of Car Insurance Coverage in New York
New York requires all car owners to carry specific types of auto insurance. Each type serves a different purpose, so it’s essential to know what you’re paying for—and how it protects you and others. Here’s an overview of the most common types of coverage required in New York:
### Liability Insurance
Liability insurance is designed to pay for damages or injuries to other people if you’re found at fault in an accident. For example, if you accidentally rear-ended someone on East Avenue in Rochester, your liability insurance would cover the other driver’s medical bills and property damage.
[New York law requires](https://dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-requirements) you to carry at least:
  * $25,000 for bodily injury to one person
  * $50,000 for bodily injury to all people in a single accident
  * $50,000 for the death of one person
  * $100,000 for the deaths of two or more people in a single accident
  * $10,000 for property damage in a single accident


While these minimums meet legal requirements, they may not be enough in a serious accident. Imagine a crash along the busy West Side Highway in Manhattan where medical bills and damages far exceed these amounts. If your liability limits are too low, you could be held personally responsible for the difference. To better protect yourself, consider discussing higher coverage limits with your insurance agent.
### Property Damage Coverage
If your car causes damage to someone else’s property—such as another car, a fence, or a storefront like one down in the East Village—property damage coverage comes into play. The New York minimum of $10,000 per accident may seem like a lot, but repairing or replacing a newer vehicle or major property can quickly exceed this amount in today’s economy.
To avoid putting your finances at risk, carry more than the state minimum if you can. It’s a small price to pay for greater peace of mind.
### No-Fault Insurance (Personal Injury Protection)
[No-Fault insurance](https://williammattar.com/blog/car-accident/no-fault-insurance-coverage-ny/?utm_content=organic_direct) (also called Personal Injury Protection or PIP) is insurance coverage that can cover medical treatment, lost wages, and other costs for occupants of the insured vehicle regardless of who caused the accident.
At a minimum, No-Fault insurance covers:
  * Up to $50,000 per person for medical expenses, lost wages, and other related costs, such as travel to medical appointments.
  * Up to $25/day for reasonable expenses like hiring household help or getting transportation assistance for one year after the accident.
  * A $2,000 death benefit payable to the victim’s estate.


The No-Fault insurance claim is separate from the liability claim, even though the same insurance company may be involved or make a payment. Certain circumstances—such as if you were operating your vehicle while intoxicated—will disqualify you from this coverage.
No-Fault benefits have limits. If your injuries are severe or cause significant financial loss beyond what No-Fault pays, you may need to pursue a claim against the other driver’s insurance. 
### Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)
Not everyone on the road follows the rules, and some drivers fail to carry insurance altogether. Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage offers protection if you’re injured in an accident caused by an uninsured driver or a hit-and-run.
Imagine being hit by a reckless driver near Central Park and realizing that they don’t have coverage. UM coverage steps in to help cover your medical expenses and other damages when there’s no other insurance to turn to. New York mandates minimum UM coverage equal to the liability limits ($25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident). However, additional coverage is available for further peace of mind, especially for out-of-state accidents.
## Is the State Minimum Enough?
While New York’s minimum insurance requirements are designed to offer basic protection, many victims find that it falls short in serious accidents. A multi-car pileup on Route 81 in Syracuse or a devastating crash on the Long Island Expressway could easily exceed $25,000 in medical costs or property damage. Unfortunately, when coverage is insufficient, accident victims often face the burden of those expenses themselves.
At William Mattar Law Offices, we believe in setting you up for success before and after an accident. Reviewing your insurance policy with a professional is a smart way to identify gaps in your coverage. Most people find that adding extra coverage—like Supplemental Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (SUM) coverage or increasing your liability limits—is worth the investment for the protection it provides.
## What to Know About Renting a Car in New York
Renting a car in New York can be convenient, whether you’re visiting the state or need a temporary vehicle while yours is repaired. But [accidents can happen in rental cars](https://williammattar.com/blog/car-accident/who-is-responsible-after-a-rental-car-accident/?utm_content=organic_direct) just like with any other vehicle. That’s why it’s crucial to know how insurance applies when you rent a car, especially if you’ve already been in an accident or want to ensure you're properly protected.
### Minimum Insurance Coverage for Rental Cars
By law, all car rental companies in New York must provide the minimum required insurance coverage for every rental vehicle. This includes liability insurance, which offers protection for damages or injuries you may cause to others in an accident. However, the rental company may charge you for damages to their vehicle unless you purchase additional protection.
The required minimums for liability insurance are the same as for private vehicles in New York:
  * $25,000 for bodily injury to one person
  * $50,000 for bodily injury for all people in a single accident
  * $10,000 for property damage


These limits protect other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, but they don’t cover damages to the rental car itself or any personal injuries you might suffer.
### Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Additional Coverage
When renting a car, you’ll typically be offered a [Collision Damage Waiver](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/auto_insurance/minimum_auto_insurance_requirements) (CDW), sometimes called "Optional Vehicle Protection" (OVP). While this is not technically insurance, it waives your financial responsibility for damages to the rental car in cases of accidents or theft. Depending on the vehicle’s value and the rental company’s policies, this coverage may cost up to $12 per day or more.
Car rental companies may also offer optional personal accident and health insurance, as well as coverage for personal items stolen from the vehicle. These options can be helpful if your existing insurance doesn’t provide similar protections, but costs can add up quickly if you’re paying for multiple additional coverages.
### Does Your Personal Auto Insurance Cover Rental Cars?
If you have an active auto insurance policy in New York, your existing coverage may already extend to rental cars. For example:
  * Liability insurance on your current policy will often apply to accidents caused while driving a rental.
  * If you have collision or comprehensive coverage on your own vehicle, it may cover damage to the rental car as well.


Check your policy details or speak with your insurance agent to confirm what’s included. If you’re unsure, it’s better to be safe than sorry—especially if you’ve experienced the stress of a car accident before.
### Credit Card Benefits for Rental Cars
Many credit card companies offer benefits for cardholders who use their card to pay for rental vehicles. These benefits often include supplementary insurance that covers damages or theft of the rental car. However, this coverage usually applies only after your personal insurance has been used, meaning it serves as secondary protection.
Before assuming your credit card has you covered, take the time to:
  * Read the fine print on your cardholder agreement.
  * Verify what is covered (e.g., standard cars versus luxury vehicles).
  * Confirm whether restrictions apply based on location (e.g., New York vs. out-of-state rentals).

You guys are the best with everything your staff did. Everyone answered my questions and went the extra mile to find out any information I needed. The staff was concerned about my well-being and motivated me to get through my appointments and fight for what treatments were needed. Thank you!
