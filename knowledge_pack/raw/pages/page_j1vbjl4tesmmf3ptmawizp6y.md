Anytime you want to get a car insurance quote, such requests typically require you to input a lot of information: your name, ZIP code, age, and other facts you might want to keep private. Many people are interested in getting car insurance quotes without going through this intrusive process, whether it’s simply to save time or protect their privacy. But is it really possible to get a car insurance quote that’s accurate without handing over a ton of personal information? 
## Anonymous Car Insurance Quotes
### Do Anonymous Quotes Exist?
Truly anonymous car insurance quotes do not exist, as quotes are dependent on your personal information. There are many unique [factors that affect car insurance rates](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-affects-car-insurance-rates/), and your information is needed to generate a quote that’s specific to you. The required details usually include the following.
  * **Age:** Younger drivers have higher accident rates and, as a result, higher car insurance costs.
  * **ZIP code:** Urban areas are more expensive for car insurance than suburban and rural areas. Additionally, each state has unique car insurance requirements, and each state’s rate of auto theft, vandalism, insurance fraud, and more will also affect your quote.
  * **Credit score:** If you have good or excellent credit, you can often expect lower rates than someone with fair or poor credit.


In [Michigan](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/michigan/), [California](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/california/), [Hawaii](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/hawaii/), and [Massachusetts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/massachusetts/), car insurance companies can’t take your credit score into account when determining [car insurance costs](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/).
### The Personal Information Companies Require
Car insurance companies will ask for different personal information, but on AutoInsurance.com, we ask for your:
  * Street address, including ZIP code, city, and state
  * Age range
  * Credit level (excellent, good, fair, or poor)
  * First name
  * Last name
  * Email address
  * Phone number


We also ask about your driving record and vehicle information, including the vehicle identification number (VIN), year, make, and model.
Some insurers will also request personal details like your Social Security number.
This information is as detailed as possible in order to give you the most accurate quotes. The more information you provide, the more accurate your quote will be. That’s why quotes without personal information or anonymous auto insurance quotes don’t exist. Insurance quotes without personal information can’t provide accurate car insurance rates and won’t allow you to accurately compare quotes between companies.
### The Companies That Ask the Least
While all insurance companies will request some personal information to get you a car insurance quote, the following providers keep their requests to a minimum:
  * The General
  * GEICO
  * [Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/)
  * Progressive


## How to Compare Car Insurance Without Personal Information
If you want to compare car insurance companies without handing over your personal information, we recommend reading about the average rates from each insurer. While these rates may not be applicable to your particular circumstances, they’ll at least give you a ballpark figure. Here are the average annual rates from top providers.
Company | Average annual rate  
---|---  
21st Century | $2,112  
AAA | $1,903  
AARP (the Hartford) | $1,520  
Allstate | $1,673  
American Family Insurance Group | $1,400  
Amica | $1,688  
Bristol West | $2,910  
Clearcover | $1,119  
Concord | $1,396  
Dairyland | $2,105  
Direct | $2,487  
Erie | $1,084  
Esurance | $1,724  
Farmers | $1,878  
Gainsco | $1,389  
GEICO | $1,194  
GMAC (National General Insurance) | $1,714  
Good2Go | $2,040  
Infinity | $2,908  
Kemper | $1,661  
Lemonade | $1,590

Root | $829  
Safeco | $1,373  
State Farm | $1,419  
The General | $2,418  
Travelers | $1,620  
USAA | $1,151  
## Why You Need a Car Insurance Quote 
In order to [compare car insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/compare/), you need to get multiple quotes from multiple insurers. Otherwise, if you apply for a policy without first getting quotes, you can’t be sure you’re getting the best price. Like any major buying decision, it’s important to do your homework.
### Are Quotes Trustworthy?
Car insurance quotes are trustworthy depending on the robustness of the information you have provided the company. Again, the more information you provide, the more accurate the auto insurance quote will be. However, a quote is not a guarantee, and you’ll never know your actual rate until you formally apply for car insurance with the provider.
This process is a bit more involved and may involve a hard inquiry on your credit, for example. But obtaining a quote is a good first step to getting a good idea of how much your car insurance may cost with a given company.
## What to Do After Getting Your Quote 
  1. **Do more research.** Pricing isn’t the only factor you should take into account when choosing a car insurance provider. Also consider the company’s third-party ratings from sources like the Better Business Bureau, what coverages and discounts the company offers, and whether it sells any other type of insurance you can bundle together for a discount, like homeowners insurance.
  2. **Contact the company.** Once you’ve decided on a provider, contact one of its [insurance agents](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agents/) to create your policy.
  3. **Pay for your policy.** In order for your policy to go into effect, you’ll need to submit the first payment. Some people pay for a six-month or even annual policy upfront, while others take advantage of monthly payment options.
  4. **Cancel your old policy.** Once your new insurance policy is in effect, cancel your old policy if you have one.


Do not cancel your old insurance policy until after your new policy’s effective date. [Driving without insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/driving-without-insurance/) is illegal in most states and can leave you financially responsible for injuries and property damage.
## How to Protect Your Personal Information Online
You may not want to share your personal information online for multiple reasons. Maybe you’re worried about identity theft, you don’t want targeted advertisements, or you simply want to stay as private as possible, online and off. Whatever the reason, use the following best practices to protect your online information when requesting car insurance quotes and when using the internet in general.
  1. **Use password managers.** It’s important to use a different, long, and complicated password for each one of your online accounts, but who can remember all of them? To solve this issue, invest in a password manager, an encrypted digital vault that holds all of your passwords. With LastPass, for example, you can log in to your accounts through Touch ID or a single master password.
  2. **Add advanced authentication.** When it’s available, add two- or multifactor authentication to your accounts. Two-factor authentication will send a passcode to your mobile device, while multifactor authentication includes biometrics, fingerprint, or facial recognition.
  3. **Avoid phishing with antivirus software.** Antivirus software is a one-stop solution to protect your computer against attacks from malware, phishing, spyware, and more.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/no-personal-information/#citation-1) Many devices have antivirus software built in, but you can supplement this digital security with software from Avast or AVG.
  4. **Update software.** Software updates often include security fixes, so be sure to update your programs as regularly as possible.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/no-personal-information/#citation-2)
  5. **Use a VPN.** If you’re on a public Wi-Fi network, don’t connect to it directly. Rather, connect through a VPN, or virtual private network. A VPN is an app that routes your web activity and IP address through an encrypted tunnel, hiding your web activity. That means that if you’re entering your personal information while connected to a VPN, your internet service provider can’t see it.


## Recap
Unfortunately, “no personal information” quotes don’t exist. All car insurance rates are based on your demographics, driving history, and vehicle, so to get quotes that are accurate, you need to provide some personal information. However, with the best digital security practices, you can keep your personal data safe and secure online, even while requesting [car insurance quotes](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/).
## Frequently Asked Questions
Can you get car insurance online without talking to someone?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
You can get car insurance online without talking to someone from companies like Esurance, Progressive, and GEICO. 
What information do insurance companies have access to? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Insurance companies have access to whatever information you provide them, which can include the following:
  * Street address
  * Age or age range
  * Credit score or level
  * Email address
  * Full name
  * Homeowner or renter
  * Military status
  * Phone number
  * Social Security number
  * Vehicle make, model, and year
  * Whether or not you’re currently insured
  * Your driving history, including any at-fault accidents or DUIs in the past five years, SR-22s, etc.


Once you provide insurance companies with this information and apply for a policy, it will run a hard inquiry on your credit report to review your credit history, which includes information about your past and present credit activity, any history of judgments against you, bankruptcies, and other information. Companies use this information to calculate the risk of insuring you.
Do insurance companies run your credit for a quote? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Insurance companies will run a soft inquiry on your credit when you request a quote, which will not affect your credit score. Companies run hard inquiries only when you actually apply for insurance, which will affect your credit score. 
Do car insurance companies check medical records? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Car insurance companies do not check medical records, as they do not appear on your credit reports. The only exception is unpaid medical bills that are 180 days or more overdue; these will appear on your credit report. An insurer may request to view your medical records, but you have the option to deny this request.
