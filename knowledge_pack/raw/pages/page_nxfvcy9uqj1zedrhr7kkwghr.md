#  Home insurance - State Farm “self survey” ??? 
Got an email from State Farm saying they want me to take pictures of the interior of my home as part of a self survey to verify condition/quality/etc. 
I feel like if I do this they’re going to jack up my insurance premium just like my auto insurance at geico did years ago with the driving tracker.

double check with your agent first to make sure it's not spam. 
if it is a real program then it might be wise to contact a few local brokers and shop around in case the prices do increase for some reason or they find some fault with your home

I've had to do this for new policies. They say it's to make sure you have enough coverage for everything. Which is probably true but I sure it's also looking for issues. I wouldn't worry if you don't have anything "sketchy", at least no more worry than normal, they don't need you to do this to raise rates.

Are you sure it was from State Farm? Sounds like a spam email designed to get photos of your house to see if the spammers should break in and rob you.

- HOI providers sets their rules, not internet opinions. Failure to comply makes their next step non-renewal of policies so you best start looking. BTW, this will be very common with all HOI carriers as they find ways to reduce the risk of coverage.....

This is right. Doesn’t matter if someone has had a policy with them for 20 years, that actually makes it even less relevant. This is fairly new, but it is the future of most inspections. The previous complaint used to be “why are they sending someone to my house” and now the complaint is that we have to walk around with a phone and take pictures. 
The inspectors are looking for problems, justify their reason for having a job, and you’re not looking for problems or to try and cause yourself drama, so isn’t that better? 
If you aren’t going to do the inspection, you should switch before they cancel you to failure to comply with inspection. That’s not something your next carrier is going to want to hear. So, likely not a nonrenewal, a “failure to comply” cancellation and you’ve only got “x” number of days. 
Make sure it’s not spam, and if not, get the inspection. The

- I have seen the walkthru inspection over 30 yrs ago when we bought a 1927 house and the ONLY things of interest at that time was the main electric panel to be sure it was circuit breakers and not fuses and the condition of the roof. Today its way more in depth with looking closer at wiring and the actual plumbing now becoming common place. The cost of the risk is going to be reduced one way or another by HOI providers and its never going to become cheaper as weather impacts growing more severe. 10,000 roofs were./re being replaced in my area from a freakish hail storm last year and that money comes from us policyholders for payouts now and future ones. The HOI industry KNOWS climate change is for real and why so many are exiting high risk areas like Florida,. the Gulf coast and the west coast. My own premium has almost doubled in 6 years. Zero claims in 50 yrs of owning houses except from a break in 30 yrs ago...has nothing to do with it any more.

I just got this myself, also with State Farm. However, in my case I just moved to an older home, they need photos to verify its condition. I want to make it clear that the email does actually say if I don't do it myself, State Farm will send someone out to take photos. It doesn't say that the insurance will be cancelled. That said, I think it best to do it yourself, I certainly don't want my insurance to go up because I refused to walk around the home with a phone. This is just a tactic to save money by the company, just like now we have self checkout registers. This is the new normal. Welcome to the future.

Yep, today's the last day to send in photos of house. (Survey). I noticed State Farm with the tracker in vehicle, all the benefits from having the tracker disappeared. Minus $30 to $45 now it's $6 off. Reason being driving is distraction, so it doesn't matter anymore if you haven't had a ticket or accident in 20 years. What the tracker shows, goes. Of course it would be a gimmick. Time to change Insurances

Cost-effective home insulation methods 
Insulating your home can significantly reduce energy costs and improve comfort. Here are some cost-effective methods and tips from Redditors on how to achieve this: 
### Attic Insulation
  * **Blown-in Cellulose** : This is often recommended for its affordability and ease of installation. ["Blown insulation is probably the cheapest. Material and a blower rental is not terrible."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4piwf5/)
  * **DIY Installation** : You can rent the necessary equipment from big box stores and do it yourself to save on labor costs. ["You can get the stuff at the big box stores and they usually give you a free machine rental."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
  * **Cross-Hatched Method** : For better R-value, consider laying insulation in a cross-hatched pattern. ["For example you could put R3 in between the ceiling joists, then lay R4 perpendicular covering the joists."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7tijov/)


### Wall Insulation
  * **Blown-in Cellulose** : If you have existing walls, blowing in cellulose is a good option. ["You can blow in cellulose insulation behind drywall but you will need the right machine and cut a billion holes."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmej7r/)
  * **Injection Foam** : This is another method for insulating walls without removing drywall. ["For the walls, your best bet is probably injection foam."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bgnth2/comment/elmn2rx/)


### Crawl Space Insulation
  * **Vapor Barrier and Foam Boards** : Covering the crawl space with a vapor barrier and attaching foam boards to the perimeter can significantly improve insulation. ["Cover the perimeter beam from the inside with like 10 mil vapor barrier."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)
  * **Encapsulation** : This involves sealing the crawl space to prevent moisture and air infiltration. ["Tape everything together so it's watertight, like turning the space into a bath tub."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pwwiy/)


### General Tips
  * **Air Sealing** : Before adding insulation, make sure to seal any air gaps. ["Start with doing a complete air seal and you'll be amazed at how much that will help."](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1hqhp71/comment/m4pp4s1/)
  * **Thermal Imaging** : Use a thermal camera to identify heat loss areas. ["See if your local library has 'energy efficiency kits' or anything similar - ours included a thermal camera."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusRenovation/comments/1dbsgis/comment/l7t7y5q/)
  * **Professional Help** : Sometimes, hiring a professional can be cheaper in the long run due to their access to bulk materials and efficient installation methods. ["Hire a company that only does insulation. They have access to much more product and it will be cheaper installed then you can buy it for at the box stores."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebuilding/comments/1364vzq/comment/jimuij1/)
