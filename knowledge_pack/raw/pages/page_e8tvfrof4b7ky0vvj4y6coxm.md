#  At fault driver has no bodily injury coverage 
I was rear ended by a distracted driver on a highway last week which resulted in both of our cars being totaled. I did not take an ambulance at the scene but did go to the ER and got x-rays. Thankfully, my injuries were only soft tissue damage, but when I tried to submit my medical bills to the driver’s insurance, they told me she has no bodily injury coverage. This is in Florida so I know our laws are complicated. What would my steps be here? My insurance is USAA and hers is Root.

Unless something has changed, Florida is a no-fault state and first $10K is a PIP claim against your own policy coverage.

Correct, they need to call their insurance and file a PIP claim. Possibly uninsured if they have the coverage on their policy.

This would go under your Uninsured Bodily Injury coverage. And Personal Injury Protection (PIP).

You have you use your own PIP insurance anyway regardless of who's at fault.

You're in Florida, so this is a Personal Injury Protection (PIP) claim that you make against your own USAA insurance. If your medical bills exceed the PIP limit (usually $10K), then your Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists coverage is up next (if you have it). Florida doesn't require drivers to carry bodily injury coverage for liability (i.e., injuries to others).

So, basically, an uninsured driver. Even in Florida you're required to have at least $10,000 in personal injury coverage.

If they're uninsured then it falls upon your insurance to cover it under your underinsured/uninsured coverage

Florida does not require bodily injury coverage to be carried. The coverage you’re talking about is PIP which covers occupants of your own vehicle. The claimant in this case is insured with what the state considers to be the legal minimum.

So if the at fault has no bodily injury coverage , then it will be almost impossible to find counsel to represent you here in Florida. Your best option is to sue the at fault driver in small claims court.

Why don’t you open a UM claim? Since the other driver didn’t have insurance. It should cover you for your pain and suffering.

Please don't make the PIP claim. Your premium will increase and you could be denied coverage in the future..
