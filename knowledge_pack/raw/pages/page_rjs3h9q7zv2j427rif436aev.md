At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Won't use All-State for home insurance anymore.

I found out from a previous employee about their directive that they are not supposed to cover roof damage. Unfortunately, it was after my roof was damaged. They said it was not wind damage even though two trees were blown down and my son's trampoline was blown over 30 feet.

Allstate offers many discounts, including for good students, multiple policies, bundling auto and home insurance, new vehicles, safe driving, and good payment history.
Pros

## Allstate Drivewise vs. State Farm Drive Safe & Save
Allstate’s Drivewise and State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save usage-based telematics programs both offer an opportunity for safe drivers to earn a discount on their insurance premiums.
Allstate’s Drivewise program is a free option you can add to any Allstate insurance policy. You can sign up for the program by downloading the mobile app, which will track your driving behavior. Every six months, you could receive a policy credit for practicing safe driving habits. But the exact discount you receive varies based on your driving behavior and location.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/allstate-vs-state-farm/#cite-3)
In contrast, State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save program advertises a discount of up to 30%. Most drivers will connect to the program through a mobile app. But if you have an eligible Ford or Lincoln vehicle, you can link the program directly to your vehicle. The program rewards safe drivers with a discount on their insurance premiums.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/allstate-vs-state-farm/#cite-4)
Neither program will raise your rates if it detects poor driving habits.

These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
