How Bankrate chose the best car insurance companies in Florida
To find the [best auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/), we began by reviewing 2025 quoted annual premiums from Quadrant Information Services for the largest car insurance companies in Florida. Because price is just one factor when shopping for car insurance, we also considered coverage options, discount opportunities, digital tools and third-party ratings from J.D. Power and AM Best.
We compiled these factors into a Bankrate Score, which uses a scale of 0.0-5.0. The higher a company’s Bankrate Score, the higher that company ranked in each category. By combining numerous facets of each carrier into a single score, we aim to make your research for car insurance companies more manageable.

## How to find the best car insurance in Florida
Since every driver’s needs are different and can [depend on factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) like vehicle type and coverage requirements, finding the best Florida car insurance company largely depends on what aspects of auto insurance you choose to prioritize. Taking the following into account may help you in your search.
  * Number 1 Icon
###  Consider minimum insurance requirements in Florida
Caret Down Icon
Florida is a [no-fault state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/no-fault-coverage/), meaning that regardless of who is responsible for an accident, each person involved is responsible for filing a claim with their own insurer to cover their initial medical expenses. The at-fault driver is responsible for property damage.
The [minimum insurance requirements in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/florida-car-insurance-laws/) are:
    * $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP)
    * $10,000 in personal damage liability (PDL)
Bodily injury liability coverage is not required by Florida law. However, the state does have a “financial responsibility law” that dictates that you must provide proof of your ability to pay for the damage you cause in an accident.  
  
Although [Florida’s minimum required insurance coverage](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) helps keep the state’s high premiums in check, drivers may find themselves with higher out-of-pocket expenses following a more serious accident where injuries or damage exceed their policy limits.
Purchasing additional coverage up front, such as optional bodily injury liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, can help minimize financial losses after an accident.
  * Number 2 Icon
###  Consider lender requirements
Caret Down Icon
If you have a loan or lease on your vehicle, you may have additional insurance requirements on top of the state's minimum coverage. Both lenders and lessors usually require [full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/), which adds comprehensive and collision coverage to your policy. These coverage types provide substantial financial protection for both collision and non-collision damage to your vehicle rather than just for damage you cause to another party. Lessors also usually require that you carry higher liability limits than the state minimum.
You could also consider [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/), which is designed to help pay the difference between your loan value and the vehicle’s actual cash value if your new car is stolen or totaled. Gap coverage typically costs less if you purchase it from your auto insurer versus your lender.
  * Number 3 Icon
###  Consider your individual needs
Caret Down Icon
Every driver has a unique set of circumstances that they bring to car insurance. Your situation may affect the company, coverage types, levels and endorsements you choose, as well as the discounts you qualify for. For example, if you have a [teen driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/), you may want to request quotes from companies that offer student discounts to help lower your premium. If you have a few accidents, tickets, a DUI conviction or any combination of these incidents on your driving record, you might be considered a [high-risk motorist](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). In this case, your insurance company choices could be limited, so you might need to do a bit more research to find the best option for you.

Insurance updates in Florida
  * A number of insurers in the U.S. have left regions where extreme weather and other considerations make it hard for them to do business. Florida and California are possibly the two states that have been hardest hit. [Travelers](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/pinellascounty/travelers-insurance-stops-policies-florida/67-64d8700e-5868-4248-9348-f12ab9fd2c12#:~:text=Now%2C%2010%20Tampa%20Bay%20has%20confirmed%20Travelers,policies%20in%20coastal%20ZIP%20codes%20across%20Florida.), for example, won't write policies in Florida's coastal ZIP codes, while [Farmers](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/business/farmers-insurance-florida/index.html) Insurance pulled completely out of the Florida market in 2023. It is also reported that [AAA](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aaa-insurance-policies-florida-nonrenewal/) would not renew some Florida car and home insurance policies after 2023 as well. Increasingly severe weather patterns take much of the blame, according to published reports.
  * In 2025, the average cost of car insurance in Florida rose by about 16 percent from 2024. The cost of car insurance began [increasing significantly in 2023](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-increases-in-2023/), largely driven by inflation and increased labor costs. However, additional issues like climate change and car theft are hitting the Florida insurance market particularly hard.
  * The full impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the insurance market are yet to be seen. However, legislators are already discussing major changes to [how insurance operates in the state](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/florida-property-backup-plan/).

## How much is car insurance in Florida?
The [average cost of car insurance in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-florida/) for a full coverage policy is $3,884 per year, and minimum coverage costs an average of $1,056 per year. Compared to the 2025 national average cost of car insurance, which is $2,671 per year for full coverage and $806 for minimum coverage, Florida drivers pay quite a bit more on average. In fact, Florida is one of the [most expensive states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) in the nation for full coverage car insurance, according to Bankrate’s analysis. For instance, the average annual full coverage premium in Florida is 34 percent more than their neighbor, Georgia, which comes in at $2,895 per year.
The higher-than-average premiums across Florida may be partly due to the state’s geographic location, with 1,350 miles of coastline (the most in the U.S.) and its resulting susceptibility to severe weather events such as tropical storms, hurricanes and even tornadoes. Florida also has a high population of uninsured drivers, with 15.9 percent of drivers estimated to be driving without insurance, according to 2022 data published by the [Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I)](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists). All of these factors, especially when added to the state’s busy roadways, could be contributing to high insurance costs.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the cheapest car insurance in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Based on Bankrate’s average rate research, State Farm, Allstate and Geico are offering some of the cheapest full coverage insurance in Florida. However, every driver’s needs are different and individual rates will vary. Finding the [cheapest insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) for your needs may be easier if you gather quotes from several companies to see who offers you the lowest rate. At the same time, keep in mind that there are other factors that may matter to you, such as solid claims management, robust digital tools or financial strength. Some companies, for example, are known for writing cheap policies for families with [teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/), while others offer mileage-based policies that may be a good choice if you are retired or work from home. In the end, determining your priorities can help you make the best decision for your own coverage.
  * ###  How much car insurance coverage is required in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
The [minimum coverage requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) in Florida only include personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability (PDL) up to $10,000 each. However, you do have to prove that you have the financial means to pay for bodily injury that you cause. Because of this, most individuals purchase auto insurance to fulfill the financial responsibility law. In Florida, the minimum limits for bodily injury are $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. Most insurance experts recommend purchasing higher liability limits or even full auto coverage. Minimum coverage limits could leave you with hefty out-of-pocket costs if you cause an accident.
  * ###  Why is Florida car insurance so expensive?
Caret Down Icon
Based on Bankrate's research, in 2025 Florida was the most expensive state in the U.S. for car insurance, followed by New York and Louisiana. This may come as no surprise to Florida drivers, who may be wondering why they pay as much as they do for coverage. There are several answers. Florida's erratic and volatile weather patterns and long coastline mean that vehicles are more likely to be damaged in hurricanes and other storms. Florida's [car theft rate](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-theft) is also high, as is the state's rate for uninsured or underinsured drivers. Compared to other states, Florida also has a high number of congested urban areas. Busy city streets and highways may lead to heavy traffic, increased accidents and a higher number of resultant insurance claims. Altogether, these factors make it more difficult for insurers to operate profitably, and that makes them likely to either leave the market — as several have done — or charge higher rates to compensate. Drivers may be able to save on their policies, however, by trying some of [Bankrate's suggestions](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) for lowering your premium.
  * ######  Does credit affect car insurance premiums in Florida?
Caret Down Icon
Like most states, Florida allows insurers to use applicants’ credit histories to help inform the underwriting process. However, insurance companies don't generally use credit scores directly and instead assign [credit-based insurance scores](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) to drivers. Poor credit ratings have been linked to higher driver risk levels. Insurers use this link in states that allow credit as a rating factor to help determine how risky an individual is to insure. In general, drivers with excellent credit pay lower premiums, while [drivers with poor credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/) pay higher premiums.
You may be able to reduce your rates over time by improving your credit score, but be aware that this process can take time. For more immediate savings, drivers might want to consider discounts from their current insurer or shop around to find a provider with better rates.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
