# Florida Personal Injury Protection Insurance
![PIP insurance after accident](https://www.fortheinjured.com/wp-content/uploads/w3-webp/uploads/florida-pip-car-accident-insurance.jpg.webp)
Florida personal injury protection coverage, also known as no fault insurance, covers damages caused during an auto accident, regardless of who is at fault. The amount of coverage is based on the limits of your policy and may also cover members of your household or passengers in the vehicle at the time of the crash.
Though this type of insurance can help you after an unexpected accident, insurance companies may deny a claim, delay payment or offer too little compensation. If you were involved in a car accident and are now struggling to obtain the compensation you deserve, you need an experienced attorney on your side.
The attorneys at Gordon & Partners are well versed in Florida personal injury protection coverage and can help you fight for your rights. We have obtained millions in verdicts and settlements for accident victims, contact us today to schedule a free case evaluation.
Call [(855) 722-2552](tel:8557222552) or fill out a [contact form](https://www.fortheinjured.com/florida-pip-insurance/#CaseEvaluationModal).
## Florida PIP Insurance Minimums
When a driver is involved in a [West Palm Beach car accident](https://www.fortheinjured.com/car-accident-lawyers/), one of the most frequently asked questions is, how will the damages be covered? In Florida, all drivers must carry personal injury protection and property damage for all vehicles they own. The minimum requirements a motorist must have are:
  * $10,000 for personal injury protection
  * $10,000 for property damage liability


If a passenger injured in an auto accident has their own Florida PIP insurance, they may be able to receive compensation under their own policy.
The state of Florida does not require motorists to carry underinsured/[uninsured motorist](https://www.fortheinjured.com/insurance-lawyers/car-insurance-disputes/uninsured-underinsured/) coverage. However, many drivers choose to add this coverage since Florida is a no-fault state, which means that your insurer will pay some of all of the damages, regardless of who is at fault.
If you or a loved one have been involved in an accident caused by another driver’s negligence, our experienced lawyers can help you obtain the compensation you deserve under your Florida personal injury protection coverage.
For a free evaluation of your claim, call [(855) 722-2552](tel:8557222552).
## What is Personal Injury Protection?
The type of coverage included in a Florida PIP insurance plan will vary based on a motorist’s decision, which will also impact their deductible and monthly premiums.
Commonly, personal injury protection includes:
**Medical Coverage** – Covers the cost of treatment received from doctors, hospital workers, or other healthcare providers for injuries sustained.
**Disability Benefits** – If an individual is unable to return to work right away, Florida PIP insurance may cover lost wages and further expenses incurred while away from work.
**Death Benefits** – If you are involved in a fatal accident, Florida personal injury protection coverage may provide benefits to any of the deceased’s relatives related by blood, adoption, or marriage.
With Florida personal injury protection coverage, an injured driver or passenger may benefit no matter whose fault the accident was. Furthermore, Florida PIP insurance can help cover additional medical expenses that a victim’s health insurance may not cover.
Unfortunately, limits on policies and insurance companies acting in bad faith can make it difficult for accident victims to obtain the compensation they need to recover after a crash. If you believe your [car insurance claim](https://www.fortheinjured.com/insurance-lawyers/car-insurance-disputes/) has been wrongfully denied, undervalued or is being delayed, contact a West Palm Beach car accident lawyer you can trust.
The team at Gordon & Partners has more than 200 years of combined legal experience and is ready to fight for your rights against big insurance companies.
