At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

[**Progressive**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/progressive/) and [**Allstate**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/allstate/) are two of the leading auto insurance companies in the U.S., holding the second- and fourth-largest market shares, respectively.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/allstate-vs-progressive/#cite-1) Both insurers offer various coverage options for drivers in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., including comprehensive, collision, liability, and uninsured/underinsured motorist protection.
If you want to compare insurance companies and find the best policy for you, low rates are important, but factors such as customer service, industry ratings, and even discount options are crucial, too.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Why we picked this company
The fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer by market share, Allstate is available in all 50 states. The company has been in business for more than 90 years and also sells home, renters, and condo policies — so it’s a good option for those who want to save by bundling auto with another type of policy. Allstate also offers helpful optional auto coverages, like gap insurance and accident forgiveness. AM Best gives the company a high rating for financial strength, but Allstate has a higher-than-average number of complaints in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Consumer Complaint Index.
Pros
  * Ample opportunities for bundling discount
  * Offers a pay-per-mile option
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * Low customer satisfaction
  * Rates are merely average compared to other insurers
  * Below-average rank for customer satisfaction in many regions, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study


## Progressive Snapshot vs. Allstate Drivewise
Both Progressive and Allstate offer a safe driver discount program based on driving habits. These programs use [**telematics tools**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/), such as a mobile app or vehicle plug-in device, to analyze driver habits and behavior, detect crashes, monitor phone usage while behind the wheel, and more.
The Allstate Drivewise program is smartphone-based, allowing insured drivers to track their trips and unlock significant discounts on their auto insurance premiums. It takes into account driving activity such as sudden stops, aggressive maneuvers, high speeds, driving during certain times of day, and more.
The Drivewise app also collects data on whether or not you use your phone while behind the wheel, though Allstate claims that it doesn’t use this factor to calculate performance-based policy rewards.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/allstate-vs-progressive/#cite-2)
With Progressive’s Snapshot, drivers have the option of using the insurer’s mobile app or requesting a plug-in device for their vehicle. Both devices collect data on many of the same factors to determine available discounts and policy pricing: sudden braking, aggressive driving, high speeds, driving late at night, and phone usage while behind the wheel.
Unlike Allstate’s program, Snapshot is also mileage-based. Drivers who spend less time behind the wheel can save even more with this [**usage-based insurance program**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/usage/usage-based-insurance/).[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/allstate-vs-progressive/#cite-3)
