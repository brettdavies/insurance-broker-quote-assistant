## How Far in Advance to Purchase Travel Insurance
According to an [AAA travel survey](https://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/07/travel-insurance-vacation-investment-americans/), 88% of travelers say that reimbursement after a trip cancellation is the most valuable benefit of trip insurance.
According to data gathered by SquareMouth in the last six months, travelers tend to purchase trip cancellation travel insurance 53 days before their trip. Meanwhile, travelers without trip cancellation insurance will buy a policy approximately 16 days before their trip. Regardless of when you buy, cancellation protection can kick in to protect you against the unexpected.
**Policy type** | **Average trip length (days)** | **Average cost of travel insurance**  
---|---|---  
**Cancellation** | 14 | $396.60  
**Non-cancellation** | 19 | $84.73

## Average Cost of Travel Insurance by Age
A traveler's age is a significant factor in determining the cost of travel insurance. The older a traveler is, the higher travel insurance premiums are. For instance, a senior traveler may need more insurance for health-related emergencies than a millennial.
When calculating your travel insurance premium, travel insurance providers consider the likelihood of a medical emergency.
