##  Country Financial car insurance review 
With a Bankrate Score of 4.2 out of 5.0 for auto insurance, Country Financial is a competitive car insurance option in states where coverage is available. High customer satisfaction ratings from J.D. Power and a low rate of customer complaints put Country Financial above many competitors, but customers may pay higher premiums in exchange for superior service.
When it comes to [coverage](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/insurance/auto/car/coverage.html), Country Financial offers all the standard auto options along with some less-common endorsements like windshield replacement insurance, personal effects coverage and umbrella liability. The company also offers [some unique discounts](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/insurance/auto/car/discounts.html), like a discount for engaged couples and special rates for teachers and first responders. But policies are only available in 19 states, and customers who don't meet Country Financial's desired profile may have trouble finding affordable coverage.

##  Country Financial life insurance review 
In addition to home and auto insurance, Country Financial offers a range of life insurance products designed to meet various needs and budgets. Life insurance options available from Country Financial include term life insurance, indexed universal life insurance and whole life insurance. Country Financial was named to the [2025 Ward's 50 Life and Health Top Performers](https://assets.aon.com/-/media/files/aon/capabilities/strategy-and-technology-group/top-50-performing-insurers---united-states---life-and-health.pdf) list, making it a strong option for anyone seeking this type of coverage.
For most families, a [term life insurance policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/best-term-life-insurance/) may be the most [cost-effective](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/life-insurance/cheap-life-insurance/) and practical way to meet the need for life insurance. Country Financial's term life is available in 10-, 15-, 20- or 30-year increments. For those seeking permanent life insurance with a cash value feature, indexed universal life or whole life insurance may be a better fit.

I’ve used Country Financial for the past ten years
“I’ve used Country Financial for the past ten years after State Farm dropped me over a small claim that I was told, by them, would not trigger them dropping me. My Country Financial rates have remained consistent since.”

Gotta play the game
"Our Country Financial after 24 years went up a lot the past few years with no claims. We are no longer with them, saved $2000 this year switching. We know next year our new carrier will probably do the same, but gotta play the game."

The representative will assist you through the entire claims process.
  * ###  Is Country Financial a sustainable company?
Caret Down Icon
Our Country Financial insurance review would not be complete without discussing the company’s social outreach. Although the company doesn’t partner with specific charities, Country Financial sponsors employee volunteer and employee donation [matching programs](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/about-us/in-your-community.html), charitable marketing programs and provides time off for employees to volunteer. The company’s charitable programs provide donations to 501(c)(3) organizations within and outside Bloomington, Illinois.
  * ###  Is Country Financial cheaper than Progressive?
Caret Down Icon
On average, Country Financial customers pay $36 percent more for car insurance and 20 percent less for home insurance than Progressive customers.

### Rates

Quoted rates for our base profile are based on the following characteristics and full coverage limits with bundling and paperless billing discounts applied:

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.
If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
