# Understanding Personal Injury Protection (PIP) in Florida
[ request free consultation ](https://www.salterhealy.com/understanding-personal-injury-protection-in-florida/#contact)
Posted By Legal Team **|** January 2 2025 **|** [Personal Injury](https://www.salterhealy.com/category/personal-injury/)
Florida is a [no-fault auto insurance state](https://www.salterhealy.com/floridas-new-comparative-negligence-laws/), which means that each driver must carry their own personal insurance protection (PIP) coverage. That coverage typically covers your losses no matter who causes an accident. Just having PIP does not eliminate your need for other coverage or to seek out a [St. Petersburg personal injury attorney](https://www.salterhealy.com/st-petersburg-personal-injury-attorneys/).
PIP is confusing in many ways because it requires that your insurance covers your injuries and property damage, even if someone else caused your accident. That is different from most other states that have fault-based insurance in which the at-fault driver’s insurance covers their losses. There are several key factors you need to understand about PIP in Florida, whether you are a driver or an accident victim, and a [St. Petersburg auto accident lawyer](https://www.salterhealy.com/st-petersburg-auto-accident-attorneys/) can explain them for you.
## What Does PIP Insurance Cover?
PIP insurance is a requirement for most Florida drivers. Under the[ state’s laws](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/), drivers must show proof of PIP and property damage liability insurance. Your PIP policy covers 80% of all reasonable medical expenses associated with the accident, up to $10,000. This applies only to covered injuries, no matter who caused the crash. This is the [minimum amount of insurance coverage](https://www.salterhealy.com/minimum-car-insurance-requirements-in-florida/) you must have to legally operate a motor vehicle in the state. This component may cover:
  * Diagnostic testing
  * Hospital stays
  * Emergency medical care
  * Surgeries
  * Specialist care
  * Physical therapy
  * Rehabilitation


It only covers what is medically necessary and up to the amount of coverage purchased. Many times, drivers will purchase more than this limit requirement.
In addition to this, PIP also provides coverage for [lost wages.](https://www.salterhealy.com/recovering-lost-wages-after-an-accident/) It pays out at a rate of 60% of your lost regular income. It also applies to the $10,000 limit. PIP also covers [wrongful death claims in St. Petersburg](https://www.salterhealy.com/st-petersburg-wrongful-death-attorneys/) in the event that a person dies in a car accident. It will pay $5,000 in addition to the $10,000 limit.
Note that a person must maintain this insurance policy in order to drive legally in the state if they are a resident. Failing to do so can be costly. You may lose your license if you do not have insurance for up to three years and pay fines of $500 or more to get it reinstated.
## You May Still Be Able to Pursue Legal Action
You may expect that the $10,000 limit does not go far when you have a serious accident or injury. In situations where your medical bills are over $10,000 or if you suffer a permanent injury, you may be able to file a personal injury claim against the at-fault driver. Here is an example of what may happen.
You are in a car accident in which a truck driver struck you. You get medical care, need therapy, and miss work for several weeks. Your losses in just these three areas account for $25,000. Your PIP covers the initial $10,000 of verifiable losses. In this situation, you still have substantial debt. If you have proof that the truck driver caused the accident, you may be able to file a claim against that driver for your additional losses.
## What to Do If You Are Hurt
If you are hurt in a car accident, you have the right to file a PIP claim for the losses you have. If you find that your losses far exceed what you expect to receive from PIP, seek out the legal guidance of our attorney, who can help you navigate filing a personal injury lawsuit.
