### How to Get Cheap SR-22 Car Insurance Rates
Finding cheap SR-22 insurance means picking the right provider and keeping continuous coverage. If your current insurer handles SR-22 filings, request one after paying a small fee (typically under $30). If not, [switch to an insurer](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-switch-car-insurance-companies/) that does. Follow these steps:
  1. 1
Check if your insurer offers SR-22 filings
Contact your insurer to confirm it handles SR-22 filings. If yes, request the form and ask about fees. If no, find one that does.
  2. 2
Compare quotes from SR-22-friendly insurers
Not all companies insure high-risk drivers. Rates swing wildly between providers. [Compare quotes from multiple providers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/) that specialize in SR-22 insurance. Some offer discounts for high-risk drivers.
  3. 3
Purchase a policy that meets state requirements
[Buy a policy that meets your state's minimum coverage requirements](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/state-minimum-car-insurance-requirements/). If you already have coverage, your insurer may let you add an SR-22 to your existing policy. A higher deductible cuts your premium.
  4. 4
Pay the SR-22 filing eee
Your insurer submits the SR-22 form to your state for a one-time fee under $30 in most states. Some states also charge license reinstatement or processing fees; check with your local DMV for total costs.
  5. 5
Keep your coverage active
Most states require SR-22 filings for three years, though duration varies by violation severity and recency. If your policy lapses, your insurer notifies the state. This can trigger license suspension, penalties and difficulty finding [affordable](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies/) SR-22 insurance later. [Set up automatic payments or renewal reminders](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/auto/how-to-lower-your-car-insurance-rate/) to avoid coverage gaps.
  6. 6
High-risk driver education training
Court-ordered DUI classes or state-approved defensive driving courses can cut SR-22 premiums at participating companies. These programs show insurers you're working on rehabilitation.

### Best SR-22 Insurance Companies and Quotes: Our Review Methodology
High-risk drivers face premium increases up to **200% or more** after serious violations, making affordable SR-22 insurance critical for license reinstatement. We designed our research to identify which insurers offer the lowest rates for drivers requiring SR-22 filings while maintaining quality coverage and financial stability.
#### Data Collection and Analysis
We gathered **529,578 quotes** from **67 insurers** across all **50 states** and **897 ZIP codes** using data from Quadrant Information Services and state insurance departments. Our analysis used a driver profile with a DUI to identify the most affordable providers for high-risk drivers.
We evaluated insurers using data from J.D. Power, AM Best and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), weighted as follows:
  * **Customer satisfaction: 35%**
  * **Affordability: 30%**
  * **Claim satisfaction: 20%**
  * **Coverage options: 10%**
  * **Financial stability: 5%**


This weighting focuses on what high-risk drivers need most: affordable rates, quality service and reliable claims handling.
#### Sample Driver Profile
Our standardized profile includes:
  * **Driving record with a DUI**
  * **2010 Toyota Camry LE**
  * **12,000 miles driven annually**
  * **40-year-old man**


We modified this profile for different ages and locations to reflect state-specific rate variations.
#### Coverage Definitions
**Minimum coverage** refers to each state's mandated liability-only policy, offering the lowest cost but limited financial protection. **Full coverage** includes a **100/300/100 policy** with a **$1,000 deductible** , meaning you pay $1,000 out-of-pocket before insurance covers damage in an at-fault accident.
The 100/300/100 industry standard provides:
  * **$100,000** bodily injury coverage per person you injured
  * **$300,000** total bodily injury coverage per accident
  * **$100,000** property damage coverage
