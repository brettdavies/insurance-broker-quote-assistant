#  geico insurance monthly increased NYC 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
this is honestly unfair, i live in NYC and i have a bmw that’s 23 years old, i drive to work and home, i got tickets before covid, so they kept getting pushed back, they hit my record last year so i fully understand the increase from that. ive been driving for over 10 years. and im 28 turning 29 in like 4 months. 
i was paying 218 before the points, after the points im paying 418 and next renewal it’s 465!!!!. i didn’t get any new tickets..so wtf is going on. 
i’ve been shopping for a nee premium and NO ONE wants to insure a bmw. i had progressive tell me its because my car is “luxury” which i now is complete BS. anyone know what i should do. i’m going to call geico very soon cause this increase is uncalled for and dead wrong. i’m in a financial stand still im trying to get out off and this is making it worse

Insurance isn't immune from inflation, in fact, it's entirely effected by it. Insurance companies for auto coverage payout almost entire on labor(going up), parts(going up), cost of vehicles(MASSIVELY going up), and cost of medical treatment(indefinitely, always, going up). 
This post is probably seen on this board 5x a day these days. Your insurance is effectively just going up as inflation does. This isn't unique to one carrier, it's everyone. 
With that said, you should shop around every few years. Call an independent agent and have them run some quotes, but if your criteria is going to be "carrier doesn't increase rates", you aren't ever going to be happy.

All you can do is shop around. If you don't get better quotes then the market has spoken. You present a high risk, that cost $$$.

Since you have points look into a defensive driving course. That can lower your points in NYS. And possibly your rates.

Progressive rates luxury cars so not BS. 
I mean, they don't make these numbers up. They file them with NYS and you can get your hands on the table. 
Each thing bumps your rate. Zipcode is huge and sets the base rate. Some NYC zips are sky high. 
Depending on the tickets those surcharges sound right. 
Have fun calling them. If they rated you correctly it is what it is. You can ask NYS Insurance dept to run the numbers but chances are they are correct. 
The chances of them paying out something with those tickets and being in NYC is very likely.

What are you basing it being "dead wrong" on? Just because you don't like the rate doesn't make it "dead wrong." Do you really think everyone in NY that drives a BMW is driving uninsured? Lol There's plenty of insurers that cover BMWs. Call an independent broker for quotes. Maybe you can get a rate that you'll be satisfied with, or maybe not.

Had Geico for 10+ years. No one could touch the rate I was getting from them. Saved me about $700 from what I was paying with Progressive. Shopping around for homeowners insurance prices to see if anything was better. Told them to check for auto too. Said they did 2 years ago and couldn't compete. Called me back an hour later and saved me $600/year with more coverage. Never hurts to shop around.

You can always replace the car but if you absolutely want to keep it then it’s a 23 years old car drop the collision on your policy then there’s no difference luxury or no luxury.

$3,000 every 6 months is about the going rate for full coverage for some not-so-luxury car in NYC, that is if you have decades-long perfect record, zero ticket, zero accident, zero claim.

You’re going to call GEICO and say what exactly? 
Their rates, as with every insurer, are filed with and approved by the State. They have to charge you the filed rates. You can make yourself as big of a pain as you’d like and it changes nothing. 
All you can do is shop around.

You should use my insurance company. My policy includes free attorney representation to fight my moving violation tickets.
