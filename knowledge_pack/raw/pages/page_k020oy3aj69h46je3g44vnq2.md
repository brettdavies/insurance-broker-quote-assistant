The Truth in a Nutshell
  * Geico home insurance is sold through Geico but underwritten by other companies
  * Home insurance claims are handled by the company responsible for underwriting and not Geico directly
  * You can still get Geico home and auto insurance bundle rates from for $98/mo


While Geico advertises that it sells home insurance, the insurer doesn’t underwrite your policy. Geico partners with national and regional home insurance companies to offer coverage.
What company does Geico use for homeowners insurance? That depends on where you live and the [types of home insurance](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/types-of-homeowners-insurance/) you need. Popular partners include Travelers and American Family, but Geico home insurance reviews may actually refer to a number of different companies that vary based on regional availability.
We know that’s confusing, and we are going to clear it all up. Read on for Geico homeowners insurance reviews that cover how it works and which companies will handle your policy and claims.
## Geico Home Insurance Company List

Geico partners with some of the [best homeowners insurance companies](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/top-10-homeowners-insurance-companies/) in the country to underwrite its policies.
