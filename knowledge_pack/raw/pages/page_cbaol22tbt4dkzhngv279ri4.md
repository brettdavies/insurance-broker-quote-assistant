As the largest homeowners insurance company in the U.S., [State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/select/best-homeinsurance-options-cnbc/?mf_ct_campaign=cnbc-homeins-statefarm-spl-lp&product-name=State+Farm+Home+Insurance&sub-id=PLACESUBIDHERE) is able to offer reasonable rates, exceptional customer service and access to an army of over 18,000 agents, both in person and virtually. 
We like that State Farm includes lots of customization, with endorsements covering sewer backup, service lines, home systems breakdowns and separate coverage for earthquakes. Extended replacement coverage can be added to your policy and, if your property is damaged in a covered loss, State Farm’s Premier Service Program can help you find top contractors.
But State Farm has fewer discounts than many competitors and you may need to work with an agent to find out about endorsements not listed online**.** In addition, the brand is not approving new policies in Rhode Island, Massachusetts or California.
