#  10% jump in Geico auto insurance in California? 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
Customer rep said it was not due to any demographic, car details or fault of my own. He first claimed the hike was in part to increased bodily injury minimums from 15/30 up to 30/60 in California, but mine was already 50/100, so rep conceded no impact. Then rep stated price hike was due to the cost of car parts inflation etc, but the hike is 10% vs 2.4% last 12 months. Anyone else seeing this? Will this actually ever come down if said inflationary impacts subside?

10% is literally nothing in this market. Insurance rates are going up everywhere for everybody. Maybe it'll come down but probably not anytime soon.

If all you saw was a 10% increase, you’re very lucky.

Come down? No, probably not. The hope is that things stabilize and we don’t see it go up as much or as fast. But cars are likely never going to be less expensive to repair and claims costs just keep rising and rising.

Search the sub. It's asked 10x a day. Every carrier is raising rates. No, it's not ever coming down.

If Trumps tariffs go through insurance will be even more. Car parts come from all over the world. China, Korea, Germany, Canada, Mexico, Italy etc depending on the make and part.

Thanks all for the perspective I didn’t realize the baseline is much higher. Appreciate the connection to all the tariffs happening!

Where have you been for the last 5 years? Granted, your insurance commissioner didn’t allow increases in that time, but you haven’t heard about what’s going on? 10%? Most people are closer to 40% since 2020
