Discount type | Qualifications | Average discount

## Favorite Features
### Accident Forgiveness
If your claim’s value is less than $500 as a result of a “small accident,” the company won’t raise your premium. If you’re [at fault](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/) for a “large accident” where the claim exceeds $500, Progressive will forgive the first accident. To qualify for this perk, you’ll need to have been insured with Progressive for at least five years and be accident and violation-free during that time.
For an additional fee, you can purchase extra accident forgiveness, allowing for one accident to be forgiven each policy period. This add-on is not available in all states.
### Deductible Savings Bank
Deductible Savings Bank is an optional add-on coverage that will slightly increase your policy’s cost, but worth considering for safe drivers. For each policy period without an accident of violation, Progressive will subtract $50 from your comprehensive or collision [deductible](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/deductibles/). The reduced deductible applies at the start of each new policy period and can decline all the way to zero for safe drivers. Once a claim is filed the deductible resets to its original amount.
This program is available in all states except Alaska, California, Georgia, Hawaii, New York, and North Carolina.
### Rideshare Insurance
Progressive’s [rideshare insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/rideshare/) covers you when driving for companies like Uber and Lyft, ensuring your personal coverage is active even while waiting for a fare, whereas other insurance companies provide coverage only for the period between picking up a fare and dropping off a customer.
Progressive also offers deductible reimbursement to cover the difference between the [ridesharing company’s](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/ride-share-drivers-car-insurance/) insurance deductible and the deductible on your personal policy. For instance, if the policy provided by the ridesharing company has a $1,000 deductible and you have a $500 deductible via your personal policy, Progressive will cover the extra $500 difference.
### Roadside Assistance
Progressive offers 24/7 [roadside assistance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/roadside-assistance/) through Agero, a driver assistance company that services over 80 million drivers nationwide. You can request roadside assistance on the Progressive smartphone app or by calling 1-800-776-4737. The service includes towing, winching, battery jump-start, battery charge for electric cars, lockout help, flat tire changes, and fuel delivery. Roadside assistance is available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, though policy terms may vary.
### Pet Injury Coverage
Progressive will cover up to $1,000 in veterinary costs if your [pet is injured in a car accident](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/pets/). Since Pet Injury coverage is included as a part of collision insurance, no additional deductibles apply.
### Virtual Assistance
You can use your Google Nest device to ask Progressive’s digital voice assistant a variety of insurance-related questions, including how to get a car insurance quote. You can activate this by saying, “Hey Google, talk to Progressive.” Additionally, you can log in to Facebook Messenger and chat with Progressive’s Flo chatbot to ask about your insurance and get a quote. This bot is designed to capture the personality and helpfulness of the company’s iconic spokesperson, Flo.
### Rental Car Reimbursement
With Progressive’s [rental car insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/rental-cars/), you can get a rental car and submit your receipts to Progressive for reimbursement after a covered accident. They typically reimburse your rental car fees for up to 30 days, at a daily limit of $40 to $60 per day, depending on your policy limits.
### Custom Parts and Equipment Value
Custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage helps pay to repair or replace items that you add to modify your car, like a stereo, navigation system, custom wheels, or even a paint job. CPE coverage typically has a $5,000 limit.
### Loan/Lease Payoff
If you’re in a major accident, loan/lease payoff insurance will pay for the difference between your totaled car’s market price and the amount you have left on your loan for up to 25 percent of the car’s current value. It functions similarly to [gap coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/gap/).
## Availability 
Progressive provides auto coverage in every U.S. state as well as the District of Columbia.
## Cancellation Policy
You can [cancel your auto insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/can-i-cancel-my-auto-insurance-at-any-time/) anytime with Progressive. The best way to cancel your auto insurance with Progressive is to contact an agent or customer service representative by phone at 1-866-416-2003. Your cancellation can be immediate or scheduled for a later date.
## Company Background
  * **1937:** Cleveland-based lawyers Joseph Lewis and Jack Green founded the Progressive Mutual Insurance Company. They believed an auto insurance group would be a sound investment and innovated immediately by introducing the industry’s first drive-in claims location.
  * **1956:** With around 40 employees and $2.6 million written in premiums, the company launched the first safe-driver program. This set a new industry standard by offering low rates to drivers without accidents.
  * **1964:** Progressive expanded its programs, offering insurance for products such as [motorcycles](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/motorcycle/) and scooters.
  * **1971:** The company held its first public offering of stock. Motor home and commercial lines policies began.
  * **1988:** In response to a passed California proposition that challenged high auto insurance rates, Progressive Chairman Peter B. Lewis, son of founder Joseph Lewis, called for the industry to give consumers what they pay for with their coverage while educating policyholders about the financial benefits of safe driving.
  * **1990s:** Progressive focused on a “customer-driven strategy” offering immediate responses to claims, 24/7 customer service, buy-by-phone capabilities, and, later, online policy quotes and sales.
  * **2000s:** While consumer-focused innovations continued, Progressive became increasingly open about its financials. The company reported underwriting results and other revenue information on a monthly basis.
  * **2008:** Fictional spokesperson Flo appeared in her first Progressive [car insurance commercial](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/car-insurance-ads/).
  * **2010:** Progressive became the first major U.S. insurer to develop an Android app for car insurance.
  * **2011:** The Snapshot Discount arrived as a rebrand of the company’s usage-based insurance program.
  * **2012:** AdAge named Flo to its list of the Top Ten Female Ad Icons of All Time.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/#citation-2)
  * **2010 to 2020s:** Progressive introduced more technological innovations, including mobile app claim estimates, Google Home voice action, home quoting platform HomeQuoteExplorer, and the Flo chatbot.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/#citation-3)
