# How to Stop Geico Junk Mail for Good with PostGhost
Is your mailbox overflowing with junk mail from Geico? Whether you’re a customer or not, receiving insurance offers and promotional fliers you didn’t ask for can be frustrating. Fortunately, there are ways to opt out and keep your personal information safe from future mailings.
While Geico provides an opt-out process for marketing materials, it may not fully stop the junk mail cycle. Here’s what you need to know to reduce unwanted communication from Geico and take back control of your mailbox.
## How to Opt Out of Geico’s Mailing List
  * Unsubscribe URL: [https://www.geico.com/landingpage/optout/](https://www.geico.com/landingpage/optout/)
  * Best Phone #: +1-800-861-8380
  * Company Website: [https://www.geico.com](https://www.geico.com/)
  * Email: privacypolicy@geico.com


Geico offers a couple of ways to opt out of their marketing materials:
  1. **Paperless Option for Geico Customers** : If you’re a Geico customer, you can go paperless by updating your preferences here. This will stop account-related paper mail but won’t stop marketing materials.
  2. **Marketing Opt-Out Page** : To fully opt out of marketing mail, use Geico’s opt-out page. You’ll need to:
     * Enter your personal information into the required fields.
     * Complete the opt-out process twice to ensure you’re removed from both junk mail and spam lists.


## How Long Will It Take?
Geico doesn’t specify how quickly they process opt-out requests, but typically these take 4 to 6 weeks. During this time, you might still receive promotional materials from them.
## Still Receiving Geico Junk Mail? Here’s What to Do
If you’re still dealing with junk mail after waiting six weeks, you can try these additional steps:
  * **Return Unwanted Mail** : Write “Rejected: Return to Sender” on unopened mail with a return address and send it back.
  * **Contact Geico Customer Service** :
    * Call them at **1-800-841-2964**.
    * Send an email to file a formal complaint using their customer service portal.


## How to Stay Off Geico’s Mailing List
The best way to prevent future junk mail is to avoid giving Geico permission to share your information during any future interactions. However, that alone isn’t enough to fully stop junk mail, as companies like Geico often work with data brokers.
Data brokers collect and sell your personal information, putting you back on mailing lists—even after opting out directly with Geico. With over 500 data brokers operating in the U.S., manually removing your data is a long and tedious process.
## Let PostGhost Take Care of It—Effortlessly!
Tired of junk mail piling up? **PostGhost** is the easiest, quickest way to reclaim your mailbox and your peace of mind. Forget the hassle of forms or waiting in queues—PostGhost has you covered in just a few simple steps.
  * **A 3-Minute Setup** : Verify your identity through PostGhost’s secure platform. It’s quick, easy, and takes less than three minutes of your time.
  * **Snap, Tap, Done** : Want an even simpler option? Use the PostGhost app! Just snap a photo of unwanted mail, and we’ll handle the rest. It’s like having your personal mailbox assistant!
  * **Stops More Than Just Geico** : From catalogs to credit card offers and charity mailers, PostGhost works with thousands of senders to clear out your mailbox for good.
  * **Take Back Control:** With PostGhost, you’ll enjoy a clutter-free mailbox—and a stress-free life.
