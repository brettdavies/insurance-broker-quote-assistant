What You Should Know
  * Geico insurance discounts are abundant and can save drivers over 20% on a coverage
  * Geico has discounts based on driver details, vehicle features, and more
  * Some of Geico’s discounts can’t be combined or may not be available in certain states


Like all other major car insurance companies, Geico offers a slew of Geico auto insurance discounts to help drivers save money on [auto insurance](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/auto-insurance-am-i-covered/). Because the list of discounts is so extensive, we know it can be difficult to keep up with the many [car insurance discounts](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/car-insurance-discounts-the-best-ways-to-save-money/) offered by Geico.
So in an effort to simplify matters, we’ve created lists of discounts from Geico so that you can maximize your savings at Geico. Read on to view our Geico discount list.
## Geico Auto Insurance Discounts
**ABS Discount** – if your vehicle has an anti-lock braking system, you may receive 5% off just the collision portion of your car insurance costs.
**Accident Free Discount** – if you’ve avoided a car accident for five years, Geico can offer up to 26% on most coverage options.
**Air Bags Discount** – you can save 25% for driver-side air bags and 40% for full-front seat air bags (this discount applies to med pay or PIP portion of your premium).
**Anti-Theft Discount** – you can also save up to 25% on the comprehensive portion of your coverage if you’ve got a built-in anti-theft system.
**Daytime Running Lights Discount** – you may receive a 1% discount simply for having daytime running lights installed on your car. This only applies to certain car insurance coverage types, and it’s a mere 1% so you probably won’t notice it…
**Defensive Driving Discount** – you may be eligible for a discount if you’ve taken part in a Defensive Driving course (we debunked this one already). But it’s worth mentioning regardless.
**Driver’s Education Discount** – young drivers may be able to save their parents some money by completing a driver’s education course. This can help cut down that hefty premium, and believe us, every little bit helps there!
**Emergency Deployment Discount** – Geico offers up to 25% off to those deployed in the Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom campaigns, along with other “imminent-danger zones.” Be sure to tell Geico about any military involvement to obtain all eligible discounts.
**Federal Employee Discount** – active or retired government employees may be eligible for the “eagle discount,” which offers up to 8% off the entire premium (learn more: [what is an insurance premium](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/what-is-an-insurance-premium/ "premium")). The Eagle discount refers to federal government employees at GS-7 and above. GS stands for General Schedule.
Those who hold a federal position on the non-GS pay system that is the equivalent to GS-11 and higher may also be eligible for this Geico discount.
**Federal Group Discount** – if you belong to one of many federal groups listed on the Geico website, you might be able to take 8% off your total auto insurance premium. but it can’t be stacked with the Eagle discount.
[**Good Student Discount**](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/a-good-student-discount/ "Good Student Discount") – full-time students (typically aged between 16 and 24) with a “B” average can get up to 15% off certain coverage types. Yet another reason to study, do your homework, and pay attention in class!
**Military Discount** – get up to 15% of your entire premium if active duty or retired military, or a member of the National Guard or Reserves. This is big because it applies to the entire policy premium. You will also get a discount if you are deployed overseas and leave your car parked on a military base.
**Multi-Car Discount** – if you insure more than one vehicle with Geico, you can save up to 25% on most of your coverage options.
**Multi-Policy Discount** – if you also purchase [Geico Home Insurance](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/geico-home-insurance/) or renter’s insurance, you can get a bundling discount that will lower your car insurance rate.
**National Geographic Subscribers** – if you subscribe to National Geographic, you may be eligible for additional discounts.
**Partnering Organization Discount** – if you’re a member of one of 500+ groups, such as alumni organizations, credit unions, fraternity or sorority organizations, student organizations, or even Berkshire Hathaway companies, you can save an additional 8% off your policy premium.
You’d be surprised at the organizations listed, including the American Kennel Club, BJ’s Wholesale Club members, and even USA Water Ski!
**Seat Belt Discount** – get up to 15% off med pay or PIP if you and your passengers always wear your seat belts. It’s unclear how they prove this one…
If you’re in the military, keep in mind that military car insurance discounts are very common. Get a quote from the USAA auto insurance company before you make a decision (learn more: [USAA car insurance discounts](https://thetruthaboutinsurance.com/usaa-car-insurance-discounts/)).

## Geico Multi-Policy Discount

  * Life insurance policy
  * Motorcycle insurance policy
  * Boat insurance policy
  * Homeowners insurance policy
  * Business owners policy
  * Professional liability policy

## How To Contact Geico
You can reach a Geico customer service agent by calling the company’s customer service line at (800) 207-7847. Keep in mind that if you’re a Geico customer, you have online access to many policy service options through the company’s website and the Geico mobile app.
## How To Get the Most Geico Discounts
Both existing Geico customers and prospective ones should take the time to go through the entire list of discounts to ensure they receive any and all they are eligible for. Just remember that all the discounts in the world might still result in a higher premium cost.
If you get a quote from Geico, or already have coverage in place, you may want to take the time to comb through this list line by line to ensure you’re getting all the discounts you deserve.
Keep in mind that while discounts are generally a good thing, if you find lower auto insurance rates with a different provider that doesn’t offer discounts, you’re better off going with them. The final price is what matters, not the discounted rate if it’s still higher than competing offers.

Additionally, these Geico discounts may not be available in all states or by all Geico companies. And as noted above, many discounts only apply to small portions of your overall policy premium, so the savings may not be as substantial as they appear.
For example, if you receive a 10% premium reduction on your policy that only costs $50, that’s just $5 off. Sure, it’s still money, but you might be disappointed.
