These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.

This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

### USAA vs. GEICO: rates for high-risk drivers
If you have an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA could be a better choice than GEICO. Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to understand which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: GEICO VS. USAA
**Violation** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **GEICO avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,304 | $1,857  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $947 | $1,580  
DUI/DWI | $1,952 | $2,550  
Reckless driving | $1,472 | $2,238  
Speeding ticket | $1,124 | $1,395  
### USAA vs. GEICO: rates by age
Auto insurance companies use a driver's age as an indicator of potential risk and price policies accordingly. Car insurance is commonly priciest for young drivers — due to their relative inexperience compared to older drivers. Because every car insurance company rates age brackets in a different way, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA before GEICO: USAA offers average yearly savings of $644, compared to GEICO. USAA was also cheapest for drivers of all ages.
##### RATES BY AGE: GEICO VS. USAA
**Age bracket** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **GEICO avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $2,864 | $3,508  
**20s** | $1,261 | $1,438  
**30s** | $963 | $1,438  
**40s** | $957 | $1,189  
**50s** | $889 | $1,160  
**60s** | $845 | $1,065  
Cost aside, USAA and GEICO each carry pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, add-ons and financial stability. Dive into the data before making your decision and be sure to shop around and [see personalized quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) before purchasing a policy.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/usaa-vs-geico/)
While not as large a portion of its business as auto insurance, homeowners coverage remains an important part of GEICO's product offerings. The company partners with many insurers throughout the nation to provide home insurance. Still, customer service scores and third-party ratings remain high, and home insurance policies can easily be bundled with auto insurance.

* * *
### USAA vs. GEICO: home insurance rate comparison
USAA's [average homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is around $127 per month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Similar to auto insurance quotes, each company has its own underwriting methods for homeowners insurance. This means your rates are highly likely to vary from one company to another. Learn more about [the factors insurers use](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/) to price your home insurance quote.
Things such as your [claims history](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/guide/when-to-file-homeowners-insurance-claim/), crime rates in your area and your proximity to [fire stations](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/does-homeowners-cover-fire-damage/) can have a big impact on how much you pay. As with car insurance shopping, we suggest [getting home insurance quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) from many different companies when looking for home insurance policies.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

Sorry to hear about your accident. If you have comprehensive coverage, it should cover any damages caused by debris. However, just like collision coverage, it will usually have a deductible.
