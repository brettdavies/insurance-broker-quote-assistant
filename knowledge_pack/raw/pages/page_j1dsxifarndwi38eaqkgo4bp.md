We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site.

But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes.

GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.
Pros
  * Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs

## GEICO DriveEasy vs. USAA SafePilot
DriveEasy is GEICO’s optional usage-based insurance program. You can access it through the GEICO app and lock in a 15% sign-up discount as well as up to 25% off on your premium for demonstrating good driving habits.
The app automatically tracks your driving and considers factors like speeding and hard braking to determine your savings. Unfortunately, poor driving habits with DriveEasy can result in a higher premium.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-usaa/#cite-2)
USAA’s SafePilot telematics program is similar to DriveEasy. It monitors your driving behaviors and can reward you with an initial discount of 10%. If you prove you’re an exceptionally good driver, you can score up to 30% off your car insurance rates. Note that SafePilot may penalize you for handheld phone usage and even hands-free phone calls.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-usaa/#cite-3)

## Compare coverages: GEICO vs. USAA
GEICO and USAA have lineups of several main car insurance coverage options, including [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage liability, [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/), and [**uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/). [**Collision**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) and [**comprehensive**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) policies are also available from both car insurance companies.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible


Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.
