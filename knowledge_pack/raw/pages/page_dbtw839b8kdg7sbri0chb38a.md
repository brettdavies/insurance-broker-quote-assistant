##  Cheapest car insurance in Mississippi for minimum coverage 
The average annual premium for minimum coverage in Mississippi is $533, but several companies have lower average rates. [Minimum coverage requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) vary by state and must be fulfilled to legally hit the road. For drivers on the strictest budgets, State Farm and USAA are among the carriers with the lowest annual average premiums in Mississippi, per Bankrate’s research.
Keep in mind that if your car is leased or you have a car loan, you may need to have more than the minimum coverage your state requires. Many financial institutions require drivers with a car loan or lease to carry full coverage insurance, which helps pay for damage to your car after an accident, in order to protect their investment in your vehicle.

### Minimum coverage requirements for Mississippi drivers
Mississippi’s minimum auto insurance requirements for residents include:
  * $25,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $50,000 bodily injury liability per accident
  * $25,000 property damage liability per accident


When searching for the cheapest auto insurance in Mississippi, it might be tempting to purchase liability-only coverage, which is available for an average cost of $533 per year. However, if you can afford it, most insurance agents recommend getting more coverage for additional financial protection. 
For instance, if an accident you cause involves injury to multiple people but you only have $50,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident, you may end up paying out of pocket to cover medical expenses that surpass that limit. Plus, liability insurance only covers other drivers’ property damage and medical expenses — not yours. For that, you’ll need [collision](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/collision/) and [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/), also called full coverage insurance.
##  Cheapest car insurance in Mississippi for full coverage 
[Full coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/full-coverage-insurance/) auto insurance covers damage caused by a variety of scenarios. There are a number of companies offering full coverage in Mississippi at rates that cost less than the state average. Savvy consumers may be able to save over $300 a year or more by shopping around and [comparing quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) from multiple companies.

##  Cheapest car insurance in Mississippi for drivers with prior incidents 
Drivers with speeding tickets, at-fault accidents and other incidents on their driving records may encounter much higher rates for car insurance than drivers with clean records. Since car insurance companies calculate rates differently based on how they weigh various [rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), one of the best ways to mitigate high premiums is to gather quotes from several carriers. Be sure to request quotes for similar types of coverage and policy limits to ensure you’re making an apples-to-apples comparison. 
Based on Bankrate’s research, drivers with less-than-perfect records could benefit from starting their search for cheap car insurance in Mississippi with the following companies:
  * [Cheapest car insurance for drivers with a ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-mississippi/#tickets):**State Farm**
  * [Cheapest car insurance for drivers with an at-fault accident](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-mississippi/#accident):**State Farm**

### Cheapest insurance companies for drivers in Mississippi with a speeding ticket: **State Farm**
Getting a [speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) may indicate to insurers that you engage in risky driving behavior. This is why most carriers raise rates for a driver with a speeding ticket conviction on their record. While most tickets only affect your insurance rates for three to five years, depending on the insurance company, it may be worth it to shop around and compare quotes after a speeding ticket. 
The following carriers offer some of the lowest average rates for drivers with a single spending ticket conviction:

### Cheapest car insurance in Mississippi for high-risk drivers: Progressive
Each insurer has its own definition of what constitutes a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). Generally, you could end up in this group if you have multiple tickets, moving violations or at-fault accidents on your record. A DUI is one of the most serious infractions; even a single conviction could put you in the high-risk category. Although some insurers won't write policies for a driver with a DUI on their record, others may be willing to work with you — though you will likely pay significantly higher rates as a result.

**Bankrate’s take:** Not all companies will [insure a driver with a DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/) on their record. Drivers who are able to secure insurance coverage after such an incident may see a rate hike of 50 percent or more. Mississippi requires [SR-22 documentation](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) from your insurance company following a DUI conviction, but not all insurance carriers offer this certification. If your license has been suspended after a DUI, you may need to switch insurance companies in order to acquire an SR-22 and get back on the road legally.
##  Cheapest car insurance for young drivers in Mississippi

For teens and young adults, [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-adults/) can be especially hard to come by.

**Bankrate’s take:** Teen drivers have less experience behind the wheel and are [statistically more likely](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) to be involved in accidents than other age groups. The increased likelihood of young drivers filing claims can hike rates for all drivers under 20. Average premiums in the table above were determined based on a 16-year-old driver being added to their 40-year-old married parents’ policy.

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.
If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
