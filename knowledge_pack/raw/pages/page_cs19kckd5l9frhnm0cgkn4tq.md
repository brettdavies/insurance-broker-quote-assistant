While [federal tax rates](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-brackets-and-rates/what-are-the-tax-brackets/) apply to every taxpayer filing a tax return in the United States, state income taxes vary by state. Some states have a flat tax rate, some have “progressive” or marginal tax rates, and some don’t have any state income tax at all.
![California state income tax represented by California flag and money](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/California-state-income-taxes-300x200.jpg)
California income tax is levied on your income each year and is often withheld from your paycheck. California taxes support an array of programs and services that impact the lives of California residents. Examples include:
  * Education
  * Social Service programs
  * Transportation
  * Public assistance
  * Corrections
  * Infrastructure


So, if you’re a California resident and wondering, “What is the California state income tax rate?” we’ll provide the answer below. Follow along as we cover the details.
##  How are California tax brackets determined?
There are nine California state income tax rates and brackets, which are based on your level of taxable income. The technical term is a “progressive tax structure”—which simply means the more you earn, the higher your tax rate is.

[File online](https://www.hrblock.com/online-tax-filing/) [File with a tax pro](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-offices/?app_method=GENERAL_TAX_PREP_METHOD)
## What are the California tax rates?
The California income tax brackets differ based on your [filing status](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/around-block/offers/tax-filing-status-guide/) as well as taxable income. To illustrate the point, review the tables below to see what your California tax rate may be, based on your individual filing status and your income range. The below state tax rates and brackets from the [California Franchise Tax Board](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2024/2024-540-tax-rate-schedules.pdf) (FTB) apply to income you earned in 2024 (reported on your 2024 tax return).
###  California tax brackets
Below are the California tax rates organized by filing status and taxable income bracket.
**Note** : The rate for Married Filing Separately also applies to Registered Domestic Partners (RDP) Filing Separately, and the rate for Married Filing Jointly applies to RDPs Filing Jointly.
****Single or Married/RDP Filing Separately**** | **Married/RDP Filing Jointly or Qualified Surviving Spouse** | **Head of Household** | **Rate**  
---|---|---|---  
$0 – $10,756 | $0 – $21,512 | $0 – $21,527 |  1.00%  
$10,756 – $25,499 | $21,512 – $50,998 | $21,527 – $51,000 |  2.00%  
$25,499 – $40,245 | $50,998 – $80,490 | $51,000 – $65,744 |  4.00%  
$40,245 – $55,866 | $80,490 – $111,732 | $65,744 – $81,364 |  6.00%  
$55,866 – $70,606 | $111,732 – $141,212 | $81,364 – $96,107 |  8.00%  
$70,606 – $360,659 | $141,212 – $721,318 | $96,107 – $490,493 |  9.30%  
$360,659 – $432,787 | $721,318 – $865,574 | $490,493 – $588,593 |  10.30%  
$432,787 – $721,314 | $865,574 – $1,442,628 | $588,593 – $980,987 |  11.30%  
$721,314 and over | $1,442,628 and over | $980,987 and over |  12.30%  
## California state income tax deadline and extensions
California income tax returns follow the federal tax deadline which falls on April 15, 2025. If you can’t file on time, you can request an [automatic six-month extension](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/when-to-file/extension-to-file.html) from the IRS. But this only gives you more time to file—if you owe, your payment is still due by the April deadline.
For 2024 taxes, California taxpayers affected by the wildfires in Los Angeles County have an additional six months (until October 15, 2025) to file both their state and federal tax return, as well as pay tax owed.
### Where’s my refund?
[Check the status of your California state tax refund](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/states/wheres-my-refund-california/)
## California’s standard deduction
The [standard deductions](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/adjustments-and-deductions/standard-vs-itemized-deductions/) in California for 2024 tax returns (taxes filed in 2025) are $5,540 (Single or Married/RDP Filing Separately) and $11,080 (Married/RDP Filing Jointly, Qualifying Surviving Spouse, or Head of Household).
##  What is California sales tax?
California’s state sales tax rate is 7.25%. Note that many cities and counties also levy a local tax which can increase the total sales tax up to 10.75%. While you won’t report sales tax on your individual state income tax return, you would report any use tax on your California state income tax return.
##  Who pays CA state tax?
Generally, you must file an income tax return in California if you’re a resident or part-year resident. California residents are also taxed on worldwide income. You would also file if you are a nonresident and you receive income from a source in California over the threshold for filing.
You may also want to file a return with California to get a refund if you qualify for the California Earned Income Tax Credit or you had money withheld from your paycheck for state taxes.
##  How to pay taxes in California
To pay California state taxes, follow these steps:
  1. Navigate to the [State of California Franchise Tax Board website](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/payment_choices.shtml).
  2. Choose the payment method. Your payment options include drawing from your bank account, credit card, check, money order, or electronic funds withdrawal. You can also set up a payment plan.


E-filing your California state return gets you the fastest refund and reduces errors. [H&R Block tax software](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-software/) will choose the right state form for you.
Residents should file either:
  * [Form 540 2EZ](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2024/2024-540-2ez.pdf)
  * [Form 540](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2024/2024-540.pdf)


Part-year residents and non-residents should file Form 540NR.
##  California state tax credits
Tax credits can help lower your tax liability. Read on to learn about a few California tax credits you may be eligible for.
**Note** : The names of some California state tax credits mirror those that exist at the federal level, but the qualifications are specific to California. Qualifying for the [federal adoption tax credit](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/credits/adoption-tax-credit/), for example, does not guarantee you qualify for California’s child adoption costs credit.
###  California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC)
The CalEITC is available to low-income workers who earn up to $31,950 annually for tax year 2024. Depending on your income and family size, this credit can reduce your state tax liability by up to $3,644 for tax year 2024, providing much-needed tax relief for households with the greatest need.
###  California Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC)
If you qualify for the CalEITC and have a child under six, you may also be eligible for the YCTC. Even without earned income in a given tax year (starting in 2022), you may still qualify (see guidelines [here](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/young-child-tax-credit.html)). This credit provides up to $1,154 per tax return for tax year 2024.
###  California Child and Dependent Care Expenses Credit
Taxpayers who pay for childcare or dependent care while working or looking for work may qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Credit. Depending on your income, this credit can cover up to 50% of care expenses, up to a maximum of $3,000 expenses for one child and $6,000 expenses for two dependents. This potentially reduces your taxes by up to $1,500 for one dependent or $3,000 for two or more dependents.
###  California Child Adoption Costs Credit
Families who finalize an adoption through a public agency or political subdivision during the tax year may qualify. Taxpayers can claim a credit for 50% of qualifying costs, offsetting adoption-related expenses up to $2,500 per child per tax year. (If your costs exceed $2,500, you can carry over the remaining amount to future tax years.)
See the Franchise Tax Board’s guidelines for more information on [California’s state tax credits](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/index.html).
##  How do you check if you’ve paid state taxes?
If you want to make sure your state taxes were paid, contact the California Franchise Tax Board by phone, online chat, or mail to see if your payment was received. You can find contact information for the FTB [here](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/help/contact/index.html).
If you don’t pay California income taxes, you will likely incur penalties and fees. This is the case when you don’t:
  * File on time
  * Pay on time
  * Pay enough estimated tax
  * Have enough taxes withheld from your paycheck
  * Pay electronically when you’re required
  * Have insufficient funds to pay


View the California state’s [penalty reference chart](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1024.html) for more information.
