#### **Who can take the DriveSafe Online Mature Driver Improvement Course?**
Florida residents who are 55 years of age or older are eligible to voluntarily take the Mature Driver Course.
#### **How long does it take to complete the DriveSafe Online Mature Driving Insurance Discount Course?**
The Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) sets strict course requirements. The insurance reduction course for mature drivers must be no less than 6 hours.

#### **What does the DriveSafe Mature Driver Insurance Discount Course cover?**
The course is developed as a review, designed to refresh experienced drivers’ road knowledge. However, it’s also much more than that.
You will learn about the latest laws and regulations; helpful safety procedures for dealing with heavy traffic, aggressive drivers, and poor weather conditions; and defensive driving techniques to help you anticipate, identify, and avoid road hazards. You will also learn how aging can affect your driving ability and discover ways for overcoming those challenges.

Absolutely! The FLHSMV is extremely thorough in its review and acceptance process. Not every course meets the strict state requirements.
However, the DriveSafe Online Mature Driver Insurance Discount Course passed approval with flying colors. So, you can take our senior driver course with confidence knowing that your completion certificate will earn you an insurance discount.
#### **How much money can I save with my senior driver discount?**
