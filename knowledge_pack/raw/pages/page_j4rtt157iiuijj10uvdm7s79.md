Progressive offers both home and auto insurance, which allows customers to bundle their coverage for a lower rate, but it only underwrites homeowners insurance in a handful of states. Customers in states where Progressive doesn’t underwrite homeowners insurance can still bundle their insurance coverage, but their policy will be underwritten by a third-party company.
