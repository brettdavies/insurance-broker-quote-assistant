When it comes to [auto insurance providers in the U.S.](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/), Progressive is the second-most-popular provider, holding a market share of over 16 percent.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-1) With affordable prices and a slew of coverages and discounts, it’s a stellar choice for people with a good driving record and those with a DUI or [bad driving record](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/bad-record/). It’s easy to get a quote online from Progressive, and with availability in every state, it’s obvious why the company is so popular.
As a writer for AutoInsurance.com, I took a deep dive into Progressive, requesting a quote and scouring its website, as well as third-party sites, for all of the most important details. Is Progressive the right company for you? Let’s find out together.

## Quick Look: Progressive Pros and Cons 
### Pros 
  * Many available discounts 
  * Low rates for drivers with a DUI
  * Rideshare coverage add-on
  * Nice accident forgiveness perks 


### Cons
  * Mixed reviews for customer service
  * Gap insurance won’t necessarily cover full amount owed on a car


## Who Is Progressive Auto Insurance Best For?
Progressive is best for people with a clean driving record, [drivers with a DUI](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/dui-101/), and those who may need more than one type of insurance, like personal auto coverage and rideshare coverage. It’s not ideal for people who need gap insurance or people who value stellar customer service.
## How Much Does Progressive Car Insurance Cost? 
Progressive’s annual average rate for full coverage car insurance is $1,960, which is under the national average of $2,399 by about 18 percent. Its average rates for minimum coverage ($638) are about on par with the national average ($635).
With [DUI rates](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/insurance-dui/) over $500 below the national average, Progressive is also a good choice for drivers with a DUI.
### Progressive Rates by Driver Profile
Driver profile | Progressive average annual rate for full coverage | National average annual rate for full coverage  
---|---|---  
Good driver with good credit | $1,960 | $2,399  
Driver with a DUI | $2,770 | $3,305  
Driver with an at-fault accident | $3,169 | $2,812  
Driver with bad credit | $3,414 | $3,377  
Drivers with a speeding ticket | $2,640 | $2,511  
25-year-old driver | $2,723 | $2,113  
Senior driver | $1,689 | $1,666  
### Compare Progressive Rates
Here’s how Progressive’s rates compare to other major insurance companies for drivers with a good record:
Company | Average annual premium for full coverage | Average monthly premium for full coverage

National Average | $2,399 | $200  
Compare [insurance from Liberty Mutual vs. Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive-vs-liberty-mutual/)
## How You Can Save on Your Policy With Progressive
I saved on my Progressive quote with seven discounts:
  * Online purchase
  * Pay in full
  * Online quote
  * Paperless
  * Passive restraint (airbags)
  * Other vehicle safety features (Smart Technology Discount)
  * Snapshot (tracking your driving habits)


![Progressive Discounts](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11073008%2FProgressive-Discounts.png&w=3840&q=75)
I want to focus on two discounts: the discount associated with the Snapshot program and the bundling discount, which I did not benefit from.
### Progressive Snapshot
[Snapshot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/snapshot/) is Progressive’s form of usage-based insurance (UBI) or telematics program. When I signed up for Snapshot, my rates dropped even lower, as low as about $48 per month for minimum coverage. I enrolled in Snapshot during my quote process and immediately got a discount of around $5 per month. I chose the mobile app option, although there was also an option to track my driving through a plug-in device.
Essentially, the program rewards customers for safe driving habits. For example, it’ll give lower rates to someone who brakes and accelerates smoothly, avoids driving between midnight and 4 a.m. on weekends, doesn’t use their phone while driving, and drives less overall. Snapshot saved me about $60, but Progressive claims it saves customers an average of $169 at sign-up and an average of $322 when the program has more data on your driving after six months. Keep in mind that your rates could go up if your driving habits are risky, which is why I’d recommend this only to someone with safe habits behind the wheel.
### Bundling Discount
Another discount option is bundling, which saves customers an average of 5 percent.
![Progressive Bundling](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11073110%2FProgressive-Bundling.png&w=3840&q=75)
Had I purchased multiple policy types instead of just auto insurance, I would’ve gotten discounts on both policies. On average, new Progressive customers save 7 percent when they bundle homeowners and auto insurance specifically.
Those weren’t the only ways I could save, however. Here’s a complete list of all the discounts Progressive offers:
  * Automatic payments
  * Bundling
  * Continuous insurance
  * Distant student
  * Good student
  * Homeowner
  * Multiple cars
  * Online quote
  * Paperless billing
  * Pay in full
  * Sign documents online
  * Snapshot
  * Teen driver


## My Experience Getting a Quote With Progressive
It was really easy for me to get an online quote from Progressive. The entire process only took a few minutes, and I loved that Progressive gave me three packages to choose from, costing anywhere from about $51 to $241 monthly.
![Final Progressive Quote](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11073229%2FFinal-Progressive-Quote.png&w=3840&q=75)
There were multiple points during the quote process when I had the opportunity to receive discounts, whether it was signing up for Snapshot, bundling my insurance with another policy type such as homeowners insurance, or having passive restraints in my car. Below, I show the quotes after I added the Snapshot discount.
![Progressive Snapshot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11073545%2FProgressive-Snapshot.png&w=3840&q=75)
Once I chose a package, I filled out some more information online, including my vehicle identification number, my primary phone number, and how I would like to receive my bills (I got $3 off for choosing paperless billing.) From there, all I had to do to begin coverage was provide payment.
If you prefer, you can call Progressive directly to get a quote. However, I enjoyed this simple, frictionless online process, which made buying insurance as easy as any online shopping experience. Additionally, I got a discount for signing up online. Learn more about [Progressive’s pricing](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/).
## What Types of Auto Insurance Coverage Does Progressive Offer?
Progressive offers the standard types of car insurance, which include liability, medical payments/personal injury protection, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/).
In addition to these, Progressive offers many other coverages and add-ons, including:
  * **Accident forgiveness:** It’s no secret that [car insurance rates increase after an accident](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/accidents/). Progressive offers accident forgiveness at an additional cost, which will prevent a surcharge on your premium after an accident. Progressive also offers complimentary accident forgiveness to people who have been customers for at least five years with no accidents or violations. And for new customers, Progressive won’t raise your rates after your first claim of less than $500.
  * **Custom parts and equipment value coverage:** If you’ve made any modifications to your car, like adding an aftermarket stereo system or custom wheels, you can insure these modifications for up to $5,000.
  * **Disappearing deductible:** For every six-month period without a violation or claim, Progressive will reduce your collision or comprehensive [deductible](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/deductibles/) by $50.
  * **Loan/lease payoff:** Typically, finance and leasing companies require [gap insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/gap/), which would cover the remainder of the amount owed on a loan or lease (above the actual cash value) in the event of a total loss. However, Progressive’s version covers only up to 25 percent of the car’s actual cash value, so depending on your financing, it’s possible you could still have a remainder on your bill.
  * **Pet injury coverage:** If you get into an accident with your pet in your car, Progressive will cover up to $1,000 worth of vet bills. This coverage is part of [collision coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/collision/) automatically and does not cost extra.
  * **Rental car reimbursement:** If my car were in the shop for a covered claim, rental car reimbursement would help pay for a rental car.
  * **Rideshare coverage:** Personal auto insurance does not cover rideshare driving, but the insurance from the rideshare companies won’t cover you when you’re driving to pick someone up or when you’ve just dropped them off. If you drive for a rideshare company or deliver for a platform like Postmates, rideshare coverage will fill in those gaps.
  * **Roadside assistance:** [Roadside assistance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/guide/roadside-assistance/) can cover services like towing, lockouts, fluid or fuel deliveries, and flat tire changes.
  * **Trip interruption coverage:** Available as an add-on to roadside assistance, trip interruption coverage would apply if I was more than 100 miles away from home and my car broke down. I would be able to get up to $500 for my related costs, which include lodging, transportation, and food. Note that the daily limits are $100 for lodging, $50 for transportation, and $50 for food.


Trip interruption coverage is not available for off-road vehicles like ATVs.
  * **Vehicle protection:** Last but certainly not least, Progressive’s vehicle protection plan covers non-accident-related repairs to your car’s major systems, minor “dents and dings,” and damaged, lost, or stolen keys. This coverage is available only for newer cars, and you must have liability insurance, rental car coverage, roadside assistance, trip interruption coverage, and collision and comprehensive coverage. It’s an offering you won’t find with every insurance company.


To give you an idea of how these coverages affected my quote, my cheapest quote of $47.95 per month included the following coverages and limits:
  * **Bodily injury per person:** $15,000
  * **Bodily injury per accident:** $30,000
  * **Property damage per accident:** $5,000
  * **Medical expenses coverage:** $5,000


However, the package Progressive recommended, which costs $224 per month, included:
  * **Bodily injury per person:** $15,000
  * **Bodily injury per accident:** $30,000
  * **Property damage per accident:** $5,000
  * **Uninsured motorist bodily injury per person:** $15,000
  * **Uninsured motorist bodily injury per accident:** $30,000
  * **Underinsured motorist bodily injury per person:** $15,000
  * **Underinsured motorist bodily injury per accident:** $30,000
  * **Medical expenses coverage:** $5,000
  * **Comprehensive and collision coverage:** With $500 deductibles
  * **Rental car reimbursement:** $1,200 maximum, or up to $40 per day


Across the U.S., 1 out of every 7 drivers lacks private passenger liability insurance. These rates are even higher in [Mississippi](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/mississippi/hit-and-run/); New Mexico; and Washington, D.C.; with uninsured rates of 28 percent, 24 percent, and 23 percent, respectively.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-2) Uninsured motorist coverage helps pay for damages caused by uninsured drivers.
I recommend playing around on the website to find a package that works for you.
## Progressive: Customer Satisfaction Data
While Progressive has excellent financial strength ratings from third parties AM Best,, its customer satisfaction ratings are mixed. For example, in [Florida](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/best-car-insurance/), it received a 606 out of 1,000 on J.D. Power’s 2025 Auto Insurance Customer Satisfaction Index, while the regional average was 635.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-3) Similarly, Progressive’s NAIC Complaint Index score of 2.51, meaning it receives about twice as many complaints as expected for a company of its size.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-4)
**Category** | **Progressive’s grade/score**  
---|---  
AM Best Financial Strength Rating[5](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-5) | A+  
CRASH Network 2025 Insurer Report Card[6](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-6) | C — No. 75 out of 97  
J.D. Power 2024 Claims Satisfaction Study[7](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-7) | 672 out of 1,000 — Below average  
J.D. Power 2025 Insurance Shopping Study[8](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/progressive/reviews/#citation-8) | 645 out of 1,000 — Slightly above average  
Below, you can see how Progressive stacked up by region in J.D. Power’s Auto Insurance Study.
**Region** | **Progressive** | **Average**  
---|---|---  
California | 638 | 631  
Central | 637 | 649  
Florida | 606 | 635  
Mid-Atlantic | 625 | 656  
New England | 582 | 625  
New York | 620 | 636  
North Central | 634 | 643  
Northwest | 607 | 629  
Southeast | 645 | 667  
Southwest | 616 | 636  
Texas | 628 | 640  
## Filing a Claim With Progressive
There are several ways to [file a claim](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/) with Progressive. You can do so on the company’s website or mobile app, or by calling your agent directly.
![Progressive Claim Online](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11074445%2FProgressive-Claim-Online.png&w=3840&q=75)
Property damage claims can be resolved in about one to two weeks, but with more severe accidents with bodily injuries, it could take up to a few months.
According to J.D. Power’s 2024 Auto Claims Satisfaction Study, Progressive ranks below average, with a score of 672 out of 1,000, while the study’s average was 697. That means customers were not as satisfied with Progressive’s claims process as they were with companies like [Erie Insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/erie/reviews/) and [State Farm](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/state-farm/reviews/). Some more mixed news: Progressive got a C rating on the CRASH Network’s 2025 Auto Insurer Report Card, which is partially based on its claims handling. It’s worth noting that none of the ten major insurers scored above a C+.
## Progressive’s Website and Mobile App
I found both Progressive’s website and app to be super-easy to use. There is a lot of information on the website, and the quote process was smooth on both desktop and mobile.
![Progressive App](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F11074636%2FProgressive-App.jpeg&w=750&q=75)
Progressive’s mobile app lets me request a quote, make a payment, file and check claims, and register with and use Snapshot. The app is highly rated, but users complain about Snapshot, noting that it falsely reports cell phone usage while driving, and that it drains phones’ batteries. My recommendation? Make sure your cell phone is charging while you drive.

## Methodology: How We Review Insurance Companies 
AutoInsurance.com evaluates auto insurance companies in four key areas:
  * **Price (40 percent):** We analyze average premiums for minimum and full coverage for various driver profiles, including safe drivers with good credit, and drivers with accidents, low credit, or DUIs. Availability of discounts is also considered. In addition to state-required coverages, full coverage averages use the following limits: 
    * Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
    * Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
    * Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
    * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
  * **Claims Handling (25 percent):** Claims fulfillment is the primary service of an insurance provider. Transparent communication, availability of customer support, and fair and prompt payouts are hallmarks of good claims processes. We assess claims practices through independent sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings. Real-life customer experiences are included when available.
  * **Customer Experience (25 percent):** Customer experience is evaluated end-to-end, from quote and policy purchase to making changes or accessing documents. We also consider the availability of local agents and the quality of online services. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
  * **Coverage Options (10 percent):** We review each company’s coverage offerings and value providers with add-ons like accident forgiveness, gap coverage, rideshare coverage, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Which company is better: GEICO or Progressive?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
When it comes to price, GEICO is better than Progressive due to its lower rates, costing an average of $1,731 per year compared to $1,960 per year with Progressive. GEICO is also better for those with bad credit, or current or former federal employees or military members.
Are people happy with Progressive insurance?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Progressive insurance receives mixed ratings when it comes to customer satisfaction. In J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Auto Insurance Study, it fared better in some regions than others, but it ranked below average in every region included in the study. It also received over twice as many complaints as expected for a company of its size in 2024, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. However, it has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. Customers on the BBB website gave it only 1.08 out of 5 stars, although I take these ratings with a grain of salt, as most people use the BBB to complain.
Does Progressive raise your rates after six months? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
If you have a six-month policy with Progressive, it is likely that the company will raise your rates after six months.
Is Progressive an A-rated company? 
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Yes. Progressive is an A-rated company from third parties like AM Best, the Better Business Bureau, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s.
