**Why Geico made our list** : Geico is well-known for offering cheap car insurance and several unique discounts. The carrier tends to offer cheaper rates for minimum coverage, and policyholders may extend their [savings opportunities](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/car-insurance-discounts/) with discounts for military personnel, federal employees, good students, emergency deployment and being accident-free. Although the company only offers a handful of coverage options, Geico does have a highly rated [mobile app](https://www.geico.com/web-and-mobile/mobile-apps/) where policyholders can request roadside assistance, view ID cards and get repair estimates.
**Why Geico may be best for discount opportunities** : Although almost all major insurers offer a variety of discounts, Geico's list is one of the most extensive we've seen, with 16 discounts listed on the website.

**Why USAA made our list** : USAA is consistently rated highly by third-party organizations like J.D. Power, but you must be affiliated with the military to qualify, which may limit eligibility for many drivers. In addition to offering some of the cheapest rates in Dallas, USAA extends a number of potential [discounts](https://www.usaa.com/inet/wc/auto-insurance-discounts?akredirect=true%3Fakredirect%3Dtrue) to policyholders, including savings for garaging a vehicle on base, maintaining a clean driving record and bundling with a home or renters insurance policy. USAA may not offer as many options for [policy customization](https://www.usaa.com/inet/wc/insurance_auto_coverage?akredirect=true) as some other carriers, but it does offer roadside assistance, rental reimbursement and car replacement assistance.
**Why USAA may be best for military-focused coverage** : As a company that focuses solely on the insurance needs of America's military and veteran communities, it's not surprising that USAA offers coverage options and discounts geared toward those who serve their country. In addition to providing auto, home, life and renters insurance to active and retired military, the company is also a full-service shop for other financial needs, including home mortgages, checking accounts and investment services.

**Why Mercury made our list** : Mercury offers a strong local agent presence in the 11 states where the company operates. Mercury offers all the standard auto insurance coverage types as well as rental car reimbursement, ridesharing coverage and underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage. While its average rates may be higher than others on our list, its premiums are still well below Dallas and [national averages](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/#average-car-insurance-cost-by-state). Mercury has online and mobile resources for applications and policy management but not for claims filing. Mercury policyholders may save on their premium with an extensive list of [potential discounts](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/insurance/auto/discounts-and-savings.html), including anti-theft features, good student, multi-car and its RealDrive telematics program.
**Why Mercury may be the best regional insurer** : For those who prefer to work with a smaller, more personalized insurance company but don't want to give up the perks of a large insurer, Mercury may be a good option. Although coverage is limited to 11 states, the company still features extensive coverage options and a generous discount list that stands up against anything offered by the larger companies. It even features some perks that larger companies don't usually offer, such as RealDrive, a low-mileage program that earns you a discount just for signing up.

## The cheapest car insurance companies in Dallas
To give you a point of reference while you shop, we compiled a list of the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-texas/) in Dallas. Although your own rate is based on factors unique to you and your vehicle and is likely to differ from the overall averages, knowing these rates gives you a place to start for your own search.

## How much is car insurance in Dallas, Texas?
The average cost of car insurance in Dallas is $3,146 for full coverage, while minimum coverage is available for an average cost of $903. Average Dallas full coverage car insurance rates are 14 percent more than the Texas state average and 17 percent more than the national average. However, your own rate will be based on multiple factors that are unique to you and your situation, including your age, driving record and location, as well as your car's age, make and model.
### Dallas rates for teens
Of all the age groups, teens tend to pay the most for their car insurance policies. This is largely because their [inexperience behind the wheel](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/) means that they are at a higher risk than any other group for accidents and other vehicle mishaps. The good news is that as they age, their rates will generally start to decrease. The average cost of full coverage car insurance for a 16-year-old on their parents’ insurance in Dallas is $2,079 per year; the average cost for an 18-year-old driver on a standalone policy is $2,644 per year.
In most cases, teens cannot purchase their own policies until they are 18, however they may want to remain on their parents' policy even after that time if they live at home, since rates are likely to be lower than if they are on their own policy. On average, a full coverage insurance policy in Dallas with an 18-year-old and two married parents costs only $5,162 — which is 36 percent less than a standalone policy for the same 18-year-old.

### Dallas rates for young drivers
As we noted above, a young driver who maintains a clean driving record is likely to see their rate drop as they enter their 20s. If they live at home, they may be able to stay on their parents' insurance, but once they have their own home, they will likely need to purchase their own coverage. On average, a 20-year-old driver on a standalone full coverage policy pays $6,683 per year in Dallas, while a 25-year-old driver pays an average of $4,144 per year for the same coverage. The rates below are for young drivers on their own policy.

### Dallas rates for adults
Other circumstances being equal, rates will continue to drop for drivers throughout their middle years. On average, a 30-year-old driver in Dallas pays $3,408 per year for full coverage auto insurance, while a 50-year-old driver pays $2,963 per year, on average.
To keep rates low, the best strategy is to maintain a spotless driving record with no moving violations. Even a single accident can be enough reason for an insurer to increase rates for Dallas drivers.

### Dallas rates for senior drivers
Dallas drivers with clean records in their 60s are likely to pay some of the lowest rates for coverage. When they hit their senior years, however, rates may increase slightly to account for the somewhat higher rate of accidents that are statistically likely to involve older drivers. On average, we found that Dallas drivers pay around $2,838 per year for full coverage at age 60 and $3,071 per year at age 70.

## The cheapest car insurance in Dallas by driving record
Your driving record is one of the most important factors insurers look at when determining your rate. Why? Past infractions, whether it be accidents, speeding tickets or a DUI, suggest that a driver may be more likely to file expensive claims in the future. To protect themselves financially, insurance companies compensate for this increased risk by charging higher rates. Some of the cheapest car insurance companies in the region, however, may still offer reasonable rates to drivers with marks on their license.
### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Dallas
On average, Dallas drivers with a single speeding ticket pay $3,530 per year for full coverage insurance, compared to $3,146 prior to their conviction. This means that drivers with a [single speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) conviction typically pay 12 percent more for full coverage. Most insurers will keep this increased rate in effect for three to five years, after which it may drop if the driver has not earned any further infractions.

Minimum coverage requiremets in Dallas
As is true of almost every state in the U.S., Texas drivers must carry [a certain amount of insurance coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) in order to drive legally on public roads. The minimum coverage allowed is 30/60/25, which translates as follows:
  * $30,000 [bodily injury liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/bodily-injury-liability/) per person per accident
  * $60,000 total bodily injury liability for all persons per accident
  * $25,000 [property damage liability](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/property-damage-liability/) per accident


Liability insurance covers damages and injuries to the other car, its driver and passengers. However, in order to have insurance that will cover you, you may want to consider optional coverage types including [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/).
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Dallas?
Caret Down Icon
Obtaining quotes from car insurance companies with the [lowest average premiums](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/) may be a good start, but drivers may also be able to lower their rates by reviewing their carrier choice and coverage options each year. As your personal rating factors, like driving record, age and insurance-based credit score change, the cheapest car insurance company for you may also fluctuate.
  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in Dallas?
Caret Down Icon
Average rates in Texas are in line with national averages, but you may find more affordable coverage from a company that writes some of the cheapest car insurance in Dallas. Drivers in Dallas pay an average of $3,146 for full coverage, which includes optional collision and comprehensive insurance, while minimum liability coverage is available for an average cost of $903. State-wide, those averages are $2,751 and $786, while nationally, they are $2,671 and $806. Multiple factors impact your own rate, however, and you may end up paying more or less than state and national averages.
  * ###  What is the quickest way to get car insurance quotes in Dallas?
Caret Down Icon
[Online car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) are usually the quickest way to compare rates. Using third-party quote tools or each provider's website, you can input your personal and vehicle details and quickly get a sample quote. Make sure the coverage types and limits are the same for each so you get an apples-to-apples comparison. Note that some smaller regional carriers may only offer quotes over the phone or in person. It may be worthwhile to pursue these, even though they take a bit of extra effort, because they may offer more competitive premiums or more personalized local service.
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in Dallas?
Caret Down Icon
The best car insurance for you may depend on your personal vehicle and driving history. For instance, drivers with a sports car may not prefer the same carrier as someone with a minivan. Similarly, you will be categorized as a high-risk driver if you have speeding tickets or other violations. You’ll need to seek a carrier with good rates for drivers like you. Meanwhile, if you work from home, it could be wise to search for an insurer that gives you a low-mileage discount or has a telematics program.

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon

  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings

30% Coverage & savings

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
