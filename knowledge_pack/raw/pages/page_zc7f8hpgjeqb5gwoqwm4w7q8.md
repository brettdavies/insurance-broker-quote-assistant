Foremost, a subsidiary of Farmers, provides the typical range of coverage options offered by other manufactured / mobile home insurers. However, its standout feature is the “extended replacement cost” coverage it offers.
The value of this replacement cost coverage is notable: in the event of total destruction of your manufactured home, you have the potential to receive reimbursement up to 20% beyond your policy limit.
Foremost’s distinction in customer satisfaction is evident, as indicated by its J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating of 868/1,000 – the highest among all the insurers we assessed.

Progressive stands out due to its appealing discounts for new homeowners, strong financial strength, and high customer satisfaction ratings. The user-friendly design of Progressive’s website ensures easy navigation, and it provides instant quotes. Moreover, the availability of a mobile app enhances the digital experience for policyholders.
A distinctive feature unique to Progressive among the manufactured/mobile home insurers we reviewed is its “single deductible” benefit. By combining your home and auto insurance with Progressive, any claim you make for either policy is subject to a joint deductible. This eliminates the need for separate deductibles for each policy.
For instance, if a hailstorm damages both your manufactured/mobile home’s roof and your car, and you maintain a $500 deductible for both policies, you only need to cover one deductible, and repairs for both assets are covered.
Furthermore, there’s an added benefit of a bundle discount when you choose Progressive for both your manufactured/mobile home and auto insurance needs.
Progressive goes a step further by offering an endorsement option called “trip collision.” This valuable feature safeguards your dwelling and personal belongings while they are in transit from one location to another.

Established in 1949, American Modern asserts itself as one of the pioneers in insurance policies tailored to manufactured/mobile homes. Its expertise lies in tailored coverage, particularly for owners of vacant or seasonal homes. This unique feature sets it apart from the other companies we evaluated.
However, it’s worth noting that American Modern does not provide replacement cost coverage for a complete loss. In the event of such a loss, it settles based on the stated value of your home as indicated in your policy, with no depreciation deduction.
Conversely, for partial losses, it compensates based on the actual cash value of the loss. Yet, the option to upgrade to a replacement cost valuation is available for partial losses.
### Benefits & Drawbacks
⇅
**Benefits**
  * Offers a reliable mobile app for convenient claims reporting
  * Brings extensive experience and understanding of the mobile home market over decades
✓ 

**Drawbacks**
  * Requires obtaining quotes from an independent agent, as online quotes are unavailable
  * Doesn't provide certain discounts available with other insurers

1 
### Consider Special Coverage Needs
In California you need to consider any special needs you might have based on your location, particularly earthquake damage or fire damage.

## Do You Need Mobile Home Insurance In California?
California state law does not require manufactured/mobile home owners to carry insurance, but it is highly recommended to protect against financial loss and to protect your home and belongings.
  * If you live in a mobile home community, many mobile home communities require that you carry insurance so check with the rules.
  * If you are financing your manufactured/mobile home, your lender might require insurance, so check with them.


Always check with your financer, or mobile home community and consider whether you are in a position to replace the value of your personal belongings or your home in the event of an emergency or disaster.
## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Cover?
A typical manufactured/mobile home policy typically includes the following coverages:
### Dwelling Coverage

Additionally, you’ll choose a deductible, the amount you pay before the insurer’s involvement in approved claims.

### Personal Property Coverage
This part facilitates replacement or repair of your electronics, furniture, and other possessions in case they’re stolen or damaged by a covered loss.
### Other Structures
This provision caters to repair expenses for structures like sheds, fences, or other non-attached entities. It comes into play if an event specified in your policy causes damage, to provide you with structures coverage.
### Liability Insurance
Liability coverage settles claims if visitors sustain injuries and sue you, or if you unintentionally cause harm to others’ property. It often encompasses related legal expenses.
Depending on the policy you get you can also include additional coverage for things like living expenses being reimbursed if your home is temporarily uninhabitable because of a covered event. 
## Average Cost Of Mobile Home Insurance In California
The average cost of manufactured/mobile home insurance in California ranges between $350 and $1,000 per year and there are several factors that can influence this cost including the age, location, and condition of your mobile home.
This range hinges on your chosen coverage limits, deductible, selected options, and additional factors discussed below.
Various aspects influence the [pricing of your home insurance policy](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/how-much-is-homeowners-insurance) in California:
  * **Home Age:** The age of your manufactured/mobile home contributes to the pricing.
  * **Replacement Cost:** The cost of replacing your manufactured/mobile home influences the rates.
  * **Coverage Limits:** The scope of coverage you opt for impacts the premium.
  * **Deductible:** The deductible you choose affects your insurance costs.
  * **Claims History:** Your history of past claims can influence the rates you receive.


All the insurers we evaluated offer various discounts for manufactured home insurance policyholders, which may include bundling your coverage with auto insurance.
## What Does Manufactured, Or Mobile, Home Insurance In California Not Cover?
There are certain events that are excluded from standard manufactured/mobile home insurance coverage in California including the following:
### Floods
Flood damage is typically not covered by any insurance provider.
### Wear and Tear
As the homeowner you are expected to maintain your mobile home with regular maintenance so damage from wear and tear is not covered.
### Insect or Animal Infestation
Part of your expected regular maintenance is animal and pest prevention so damage from insect or animal infestation is not considered an unexpected item and therefore not covered.
### Earthquakes
California experiences roughly 10,000 earthquakes in the Southern California region per year, every year, but around 500 of those are large enough to be detected by residents and to cause damage. Despite the high frequency, earthquake damage is not covered under most policies in California.
### Business-Related Damage
California has the highest number of small businesses with the highest number of home-based employees so if you run a business from your mobile home, you may need a separate commercial policy to cover any damage resulting from those business activities. Standard policies won’t cover it. 
## Discounts on Mobile Home Insurance in California
Mobile homeowners in California can qualify for many discounts depending on the provider including things like:
  * Multi policy discounts
  * Discounts for installing safety and security features
  * Good credit discounts
  * Discounts for having a clean claims history
  * Discounts based on the number of years you have maintained the same insurance policy with the same provider
  * Discounts based on the age of your mobile home
  * Discounts for monitoring devices like smoke alarms and fire alarms


Many of these can be bundled to maximize your savings.
## Unique Considerations For Mobile Home Insurance In California
One of the most important factors that is affecting California mobile home insurance availability and price is the extreme weather. California faces a range of severe weather conditions that include:
  * Wildfires
  * Damaging Winds
  * Lightning
  * [Tornadoes](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-tornado-damage)
  * Hurricanes
  * Tropical Storms
  * Longer fire seasons
  * Drought conditions
  * Hail
  * [Flooding Damage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage)


All of these mean billions of dollars in claims for insurance companies, and many insurance companies finding it difficult to provide policies to mobile homes at all.
