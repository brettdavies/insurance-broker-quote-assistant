Overview 
**Why NYCM made our list** : New York Central Mutual (NYCM) is a mutual insurer, which means policyholders technically own the company (versus the company being publicly traded). NYCM offers an impressive list of discounts, like savings for working from home and being a retiree. Plus, its average rates are 68 percent less than the citywide average.
**Why NYCM may be the best for working with a local company** : NCYM only writes policies in the state of New York, which could make it a viable choice for anyone looking to work with a smaller insurance company that’s well-versed in NYC homeowners insurance coverage needs. Although it was not included in the J.D. Power studies, NYCM does have a below-average [NAIC Complaint Index](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) for its [home insurance product](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=14834&:refresh), which signals that the company received relatively few formal complaints from policyholders.

## How much is home insurance in New York City?
[Home insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/) in New York City costs $2,575 on average, which is 38 percent more than the statewide average of $1,860. NYC homeowners insurance costs skew higher for several reasons, one of which could be building age. The median residential building age in NYC is [90 years old](https://www.renthop.com/research/building-age-and-rents-in-new-york/), and homeowners in older buildings could be more likely to file a claim. These properties may have older systems, like plumbing, and be more prone to weather damage. However, home insurance rates will fluctuate based on personal factors like credit history, home age, coverage choices and deductible selections.
### New York City rates by credit tier
Having good or excellent credit history will likely earn you a more affordable rate. [Homeowners with poor or average credit](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/bad-credit/) are seen as more likely to file claims, so insurance companies usually charge them more to offset future losses. The table below illustrates how credit affects home insurance rates from the top five cheapest NYC home insurance companies.

Below, our team has compiled average rates from some of the cheapest home insurance companies in New York City by home age.

### New York City rates by deductible amount 
One way to curb the high cost of home insurance in NYC is to consider a higher insurance deductible. But, be careful not to raise your deductible too high. Your deductible should never be so high as to cause financial strain after you file a covered claim. In other words, only set a deductible you can afford to pay in a pinch.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ######  What home insurance do I need if I live in a co-op in New York City?
Caret Down Icon
Home insurance in NYC for co-ops is slightly more complicated. Your insurance needs will vary based on the structure of the building and the design of the co-op. The co-op board will likely have a policy that protects common areas like lobbies, elevators, the building’s roof and other shared spaces. In addition to that, you might choose to purchase a policy, typically [condo insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/condo-insurance/), that covers your liability, personal belongings, loss of use, medical payments and any structural elements not covered by the broader building policy. When in doubt, experts recommend speaking with a licensed insurance agent about your unique coverage needs.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
