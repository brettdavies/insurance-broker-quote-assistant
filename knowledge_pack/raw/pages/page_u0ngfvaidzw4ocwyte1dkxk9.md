Driving for the first time is an exciting milestone for many teenagers. However, as a parent, you may have concerns regarding car insurance for teenagers, especially regarding affordability.
Your auto insurance rates will rise when you add a teen driver, but prices vary by company and state. Some companies also offer discounts to help you stay on a budget. You can add a teen to most plans, but some parents choose to buy a separate auto insurance policy.
Some states allow a 16-year-old to get a car insurance policy independently, but most states require you to be at least 18 years old to purchase insurance. So when we talk about car insurance for teenagers, we mean the cost of adding them to a parent or guardian's existing policy.
Here are the [best auto insurance companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) for insuring teen drivers.
