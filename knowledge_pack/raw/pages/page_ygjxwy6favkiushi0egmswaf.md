## How much is car insurance in Illinois?
In Illinois, the [average cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of a full coverage car insurance policy is $2,376 per year and only $667 per year if you opt for a minimum coverage policy. This is below the national annual average of $2,671 and $806 for the respective coverages. Residents of the greater Chicago area are probably raising their eyebrows at these averages, as they are likely paying more in insurance premiums. That’s because ZIP code is one of the many factors that car insurance companies take into account when evaluating the probability of a driver filing an insurance claim in the future. Bankrate’s insurance team covers how certain personal risk factors, including age, driving record, vehicle type and more, may push your rate above or below the stated averages in The Land of Lincoln.

## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Illinois 
In Illinois, [age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) is a significant determinant in the average cost of car insurance, with younger drivers typically facing higher premiums. It's important to note that while Illinois drivers may see their rates stabilize between the ages of 30 to 60, premiums tend to increase again as drivers enter their 70s. Gender also plays a role in the state, with male drivers often paying slightly more due to having a [statistically higher accident risk](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females#:~:text=Speeding-,Overview,impaired%20by%20alcohol%2C%20and%20speeding.).
The two tables below display rates by gender. They also distinguish between the average costs for experienced drivers with their own insurance policy and younger drivers who remain on their parents’ policy. Both tables provide a snapshot of how gender and age can influence average car insurance cost in Illinois.

**Bankrate’s take:** Statistically, males are often found to be involved in more accidents and engage in riskier driving behaviors compared to females, leading insurers to adjust premiums accordingly. However, it's crucial to recognize that these are general trends and individual premiums are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond gender. Therefore, the rate you pay will be personalized to reflect the unique risk you present.
### Cost considerations for young drivers in Illinois
In Illinois, [car insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) for young drivers can be hefty. Opting for a separate policy at the age of 18 can mean confronting premiums 64 percent more on average than if they remain on their parents' policy. This significant increase underscores the financial advantage of family policies for young Illinois drivers, although individual circumstances will ultimately guide these decisions.

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Illinois?
Having a clean driving record typically earns you the best car insurance rates in Illinois. If you have an infraction on your motor vehicle record, you can expect to pay more until your record is clean again.

For instance, having a speeding ticket will increase your car insurance by 24 percent more on average in Illinois, while having a [DUI](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) might increase your rate by an average of 83 percent more.
The table below shows the average increase per driving incident compared to the annual average cost of car insurance in Illinois.

## Illinois car insurance rates by vehicle type
When shopping for a new or used car, consider the type of vehicle you drive. The [make and model](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/make-model-estimate/) you choose will affect your Illinois car insurance rates. For example, you might save hundreds of dollars per year insuring a Ford F-150 or Honda Odyssey rather than the car used for our average base rate in Illinois, a Toyota Camry. But insuring a BMW 330i could mean paying significantly more than the average cost of car insurance in Illinois.

## How to save on car insurance in Illinois
Illinois drivers, particularly those who live in more expensive areas like greater Chicago, might want to invest some time and effort to save on car insurance. Some ways to reduce your bill include:
  * **Ask for multiple quotes:** You may be surprised at the range of quotes you receive if you [ask for quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/) from more than one insurer. Each company has its own algorithm to determine your rate, so don't assume that the first quote you get is going to be the cheapest option.
  * **Review your own coverage needs:** Insurance needs can change over time, so if it’s been a while since you reviewed your coverage types and limits, you may want to take a look. You may be paying for more insurance you need, so you may wish to discuss your policy in depth with your insurance agent. 
  * **Buy an insurance-friendly vehicle:** Some cars, such as a Honda Odyssey or Ford F-150, are typically [cheaper to insure](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-cars-to-insure/). If the cost of insurance is a concern, consider avoiding more expensive vehicles such as 4x4s, sports cars and exotic cars. If you’re heading to the car lot, you may want to play around with insurance calculators first to help you narrow down your vehicle options.
  * **Bundle insurance policies:** [Bundling home and car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car-and-home-insurance-bundle/) typically offers one of the biggest discounts. You can often still get a discount if you bundle renters insurance with your car insurance, too.
  * **Take advantage of all possible discounts:** Almost every insurer offers at least [a few discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/), and many may be easy to qualify for. You could save money if your car has safety features, such as a blind spot monitoring system. Students can often save money by maintaining a high GPA. Additionally, [telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/) could save you a double-digit percentage if you prove yourself to be a safe and careful driver, which can be especially useful if you’re trying to restore your premium following an accident or traffic violation.

Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
