### GEICO vs. Travelers: What's the difference?
**The Zebra's choice: Travelers**
While scores for both companies are similar, Travelers offers lower rates on average.

  * Digital experience: **3.8**
  * Trust: **4.5**
  * Overall rating: **3.8**


Travelers takes the win for **cheaper rates, claims handling, and better trust scores**
* * *
### GEICO vs. Travelers: rates for high-risk drivers
If you're dealing with an at-fault collision, [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving citation, your insurance premiums are likely to be higher. **Those with a[DWI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) may find Travelers preferable to rates offered by GEICO.** However, GEICO's rates for most other infractions remain relatively affordable. Remember that each insurer has different post-violation pricing structures, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: TRAVELERS VS. GEICO
**Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | n/a  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | n/a  
DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $2,004  
Reckless driving | $2,238 | n/a  
Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $1,752  
#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/). 
Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
### GEICO vs. Travelers: rates by age
Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers because of their increased odds of being involved in an accident. Rates tend to get more affordable as drivers age. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) will pay more for coverage. However, **both GEICO and Travelers tend to be more affordable for teens than many competitors.** Take a look at how other age groups compare below.
##### RATES BY AGE: TRAVELERS VS. GEICO
**Age tier** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Travelers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $3,508 | $3,622  
**20s** | $1,438 | $1,645  
**30s** | $1,218 | $1,348  
**40s** | $1,189 | $1,237  
**50s** | $1,160 | $1,167  
**60s** | $1,065 | $1,165  
Costs aside, GEICO and Travelers both have intriguing qualities, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings and policy [add-ons](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/car-insurance-endorsements/).

## Telematics options: GEICO vs. Travelers
GEICO and Travelers have both moved into the realm of [telematics car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) in recent years. For safe drivers, this can lead to reduced rates. Take a look at the comparison below to see if one option stands out for your insurance needs.

While both companies are major providers of auto insurance, Travelers has a much larger presence in the [home insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/) market. GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner.

### Which company comes out on top?
#### Tie
* * *
Both GEICO and Travelers can pair customers with respectable [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/how-to-read-a-homeowners-insurance-policy/). Because GEICO doesn't actually underwrite their own policies, it's harder to rate them higher than Travelers. For that reason, we feel that both companies are worth exploring for homeowners insurance.
* * *
### GEICO vs. Travelers: home insurance rate comparison
Travelers's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,500. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates are likely to vary from one company to another. This is because companies have different methods for underwriting. Rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile. Some companies, for instance, may place more weight on factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a many different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate.
Cheapest average rates
Based on the data we have available, **Travelers has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $125 per month**.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global.
