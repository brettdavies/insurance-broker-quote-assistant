[Home insurance rates by ZIP code](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/homeowners-insurance-rates-by-zip-code/) can vary dramatically, even within the same city.

### Average Home Insurance Cost by Company

### Homeowners Insurance Average Cost by Dwelling Coverage
Your dwelling coverage limit significantly affects your home insurance premium. The average annual cost for a policy with $250,000 in dwelling coverage is $3,548, or about $296 per month. Increasing that coverage to $500,000 raises the average cost to $6,016 per year, a nearly 70% price increase for double the structural protection.
Coverage Level | Average Annual Premium | Average Monthly Premium  
---|---|---  
$100K Dwelling / $50K Personal Property / $100K Liability | $1,875 | $156  
$250K Dwelling / $125K Personal Property / $200K Liability | $3,548 | $296  
$500K Dwelling / $250K Personal Property / $300K Liability | $6,016 | $501  
$750K Dwelling / $375K Personal Property / $500K Liability | $8,512 | $709  
$1MM Dwelling / $500K Personal Property / $1MM Liability | $10,943 | $912  
Show more  
Dwelling coverage protects the biggest investment most people ever make: their home, including attached structures like garages. It does not cover detached structures, personal belongings or liability since those require separate coverage components.
Too little coverage saves money up front but can cost thousands if you need to rebuild after a fire or storm. Too much coverage wastes money on protection you don't need. You want to insure your home for its full rebuild cost so you’re financially protected without overpaying.

### Average Homeowners Insurance Cost by Deductible
Your [home insurance deductible](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/average-home-insurance-deductible/) is the amount you agree to pay out of pocket before your insurer covers the rest of a claim. In general, the higher your deductible, the lower your annual premium.
For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible and file a covered $10,000 claim, you’ll pay $1,000 and your insurer pays the remaining $9,000. Deductibles apply per claim, and you must pay this amount before your coverage begins. You can compare how average homeowners insurance costs change based on deductible level below.
Deductible | Average Annual Premium | Average Monthly Premium  
---|---|---  
$500 | $3,773 | $314  
$1,000 | $3,548 | $296  
$1,500 | $3,401 | $283

MONEYGEEK EXPERT TIP
Though a higher deductible reduces your monthly premium, only select an amount you can comfortably afford to pay out of pocket. When a major loss occurs, you'll need to pay your full deductible upfront before your insurance coverage kicks in to handle the remaining repair costs.
### Average Homeowners Insurance Cost by Credit Score
Your [credit score](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/getting-home-insurance-with-bad-credit/) affects your home insurance premium in most states. Insurers view higher credit scores as a sign of reliability and lower risk, which translates to lower rates. Homeowners with excellent credit may pay around $5,000 less per year than those with poor credit. But some states (including California, Hawaii, Michigan and Massachusetts) don't allow insurers to factor credit scores into your rate. Check your state's specific regulations as insurance laws vary by location.
If you live in a state where credit is a factor, use the table below to see how premiums vary based on your credit score and dwelling coverage.

### Average Price of Home Insurance by House Age
Your home's age affects your insurance premium. A house built in 2020 with $250,000 in dwelling coverage averages $2,424 per year, while the same policy for a home built in 2000 costs about $3,548.
[Older homes](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/homeowners-insurance-for-homes-in-need-of-repair/) often have outdated electrical, plumbing or roofing systems, increasing the risk of damage and potential claims. Newer homes are built to modern safety codes and have safer, more efficient systems. That lowers the likelihood of costly claims, resulting in lower premiums for newly built homes.
![Illustration of two houses side by side. The older house, labeled 'Built in 2000,' shows an average home insurance cost of $3,548 per year.

## Average Homeowners Insurance: Buyer's Guide
What drives home insurance costs can help you make smarter coverage choices. The key factors that affect premiums and which states tend to be cheapest or most expensive for homeowners insurance:
### Factors Affecting Average House Insurance Prices
Home insurance premiums vary based on how risky your home is to insure. Insurers consider factors like location, home age, roof condition and claims history when setting rates. Insurance companies charge more when they think you'll file expensive claims. Knowing what drives your rate helps you find better deals and avoid overpaying.

Dwelling coverage limit
The cost to rebuild your home is one of the biggest factors in your premium. Higher dwelling coverage means more financial protection and a higher rate.

Personal property coverage limit
Your belongings are typically insured for 70% to 75% of your dwelling limit, but you can increase it. Higher limits mean more coverage for furniture, electronics and other valuables, but also a higher premium.

Coverage type
Replacement cost coverage (RCV) pays to replace items at full value, while actual cash value (ACV) deducts for depreciation. RCV costs more but offers better financial protection.

Deductible amount
A higher deductible amount lowers your premium but increases what you'll owe out of pocket if you file a claim. Choose a level you can afford in an emergency.

Age of home
Older homes have higher premiums because older electrical, plumbing and heating systems break down more often. Upgrades to roofing, plumbing and electrical can help lower costs.

Home location
Where you live affects risk. Areas prone to severe weather or with higher crime rates face higher premiums.
![house icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/house_f1rmru.svg)
Roof type
Metal and tile roofs often earn you discounts because they last longer and resist storm damage. Older or damaged roofs raise insurance costs.
![fairCredit icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/fairCredit_mmgzjz.svg)
Credit score
In most states, insurers use your credit score to help set your rate. Higher scores mean lower premiums, but credit can't be used in California, Massachusetts, Michigan or Maryland.
![giveMoney icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/give-money_x3hzg2.svg)
Frequency of claims
Filing frequent or small claims can raise your premium. Claims stay on your record for three to five years and follow you between insurers.
![points icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/points_onplmb.svg)
Other factors
Less common factors like having a pool, aggressive dog breeds, security systems or distance from a fire station can also affect your rate.


Most insurance companies look at similar factors when setting your premium. However, each provider weighs these factors differently. One insurer may emphasize your home's age, while another focuses more on your claims history.
Two companies can give very different quotes for the same homeowner profile. [Comparing rates across multiple insurers](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/) is the best way to find affordable coverage that meets your needs.

## Homeowners Insurance Cost: Our Methodology
Comparing home insurance quotes may feel overwhelming when prices for identical coverage can differ by thousands of dollars. We built this analysis to show what homeowners actually pay and why rates vary so much, giving you the context to know if you're getting a competitive deal.
**Our Research Approach**
We partnered with Quadrant Information Services to gather premium data from major national and regional insurers across all 50 states. This gave us industry-wide rate information to compare what insurers charge for the same home profile in different locations.
Most homeowners get quotes from just two or three companies. Our broader analysis reveals whether you're seeing competitive rates or missing better options in your area.
**The homeowner we profiled:**
  * Age: 41-60 years old
  * Credit score: 769-792 (excellent range)
  * Claims history: None in recent years


This represents the typical American homeowner most insurers consider low-risk. Your rates will differ if you're younger, have lower credit scores or filed recent claims, but this baseline shows what standard pricing looks like.
**The home we insured:**
  * Built: 2000
  * Construction: Wood-frame with composite shingle roof
  * Safety features: Standard (smoke detectors, deadbolts)
  * Replacement value: $250,000


**Standard coverage package:**
  * **$250,000** dwelling coverage
  * **$125,000** personal property coverage
  * **$200,000** personal liability coverage
  * **$1,000** deductible


Your actual premium depends on your home's age, construction quality, claims history and exact coverage limits, but our analysis reveals whether you're getting a good rate or paying more than necessary.
