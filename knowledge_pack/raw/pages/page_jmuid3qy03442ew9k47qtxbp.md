## Ohio SR-22 Insurance Rates Breakdown
If you need to file an SR-22 in Ohio, expect your car insurance rates to increase significantly. Being required to have an SR-22 classifies you as a high-risk or non-standard driver, which typically results in the highest insurance rates.
However, costs can vary by company and depend on factors like age, gender, location, credit score, vehicle type, and marital status.
A common reason for needing SR-22 insurance is a DUI conviction (OVI in Ohio). On average, drivers with one OVI conviction in Ohio pay about $1,381 annually for car insurance—63% more than drivers with clean records.
However, rates can vary significantly based on the insurance company. The table below shows average rates for Ohio drivers with one OVI conviction from some of the largest companies in the state.
