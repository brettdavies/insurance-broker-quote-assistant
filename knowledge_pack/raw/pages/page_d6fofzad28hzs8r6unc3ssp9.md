If you drive in Florida, understanding the state’s minimum auto insurance requirements is essential — especially after an accident. Many drivers are surprised to learn that Florida’s required coverage is among the lowest in the country. By law, Florida only requires: $10,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) — covers your medical expenses and partial lost wages, regardless of fault. $10,000 in Property Damage Liability (PDL) — covers damage you cause to someone else’s vehicle or property. That’s it. Florida does not require Bodily Injury (BI) liability coverage for most drivers. This means that if you’re hit by someone carrying only the state minimum, their insurance may not pay anything toward your medical bills or pain and suffering. To protect yourself, it’s crucial to have Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage. This coverage steps in when the at-fault driver has no insurance or insufficient coverage to pay for your injuries. At Mausner Graham Injury Law, we’ve seen firsthand how often accident victims face huge medical bills because the at-fault driver carried only minimum coverage. Our attorneys help clients navigate insurance claims, identify all available coverage, and recover the compensation they deserve. 👉 Call us today at 305-344-4878 or visit www.mginjuryfirm.com for a free consultation.

Florida requires $10,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and $10,000 in Property Damage Liability (PDL). Q2: Does Florida require Bodily Injury (BI) coverage? No — most drivers are not required to carry BI coverage, meaning their policy may not cover injuries to others. Q3: What happens if the at-fault driver doesn’t have BI coverage? You can turn to your own Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM) coverage to pay for your medical expenses and losses. Q4: Is the minimum coverage enough? Not usually. Medical bills from even a minor crash can exceed $10,000 quickly, leaving you exposed to out-of-pocket costs. Q5: How can a lawyer help after an accident with an underinsured driver? Your attorney can identify all available policies, negotiate with insurers, and pursue compensation through your UM coverage or a personal injury lawsuit.
