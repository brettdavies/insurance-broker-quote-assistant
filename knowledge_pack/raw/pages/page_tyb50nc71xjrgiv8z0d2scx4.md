Extreme weather is driving sky-high home insurance prices in some especially storm-prone parts of the country, a new analysis finds.
**Why it matters:** Climate change is [supercharging](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/15/climate-change-role-helene-milton-hurricanes) extreme weather events like hurricanes, increasing the odds of losses and claims and driving up insurance premiums.
**Driving the news:** The national average for annual home insurance premiums is up 9% since 2023, per a [new Bankrate breakdown](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/the-true-cost-of-home-insurance/), hitting $2,470 as of July.
  * That's based on quotes for married male-female homeowners with an eight-year-old $300,000 home, a clean claim history, and good credit.


**Zoom in:** Nebraska ($6,425), Louisiana ($6,274) and Florida ($5,735) are just some of the states with shockingly higher-than-average premiums, Bankrate found.
  * All three are vulnerable to extreme weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, wind, hail and more.


**Caveat:** These figures don't include flood insurance.
**Stunning stats:** Homeowners in the New Orleans metro spend nearly 17.5% of the area's median annual income on home coverage, Bankrate found.
  * Those in the Miami metro spend nearly 13.4%.


**Yes, but:** Some places with relatively high average homeowner premiums also have higher median incomes.
  * In the Denver metro, for example, "the average $300,000 home insurance policy costs $3,644 per year ... but homeowners there earn a median annual income of $103,055, resulting in just 3.54% of their pay going toward premiums," Bankrate says.


**The other side:**[Florida lawmakers' attempts](https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2025/08/18/one-key-signal-florida-homeowners-are-seeing-some-insurance-relief) to address the climate-driven [insurance crisis](https://www.axios.com/local/miami/2023/05/19/why-property-insurance-keep-rising-florida-miami) there appear to be working.
  * "From 2023 to 2025, home insurance costs in Florida decreased by an average of $579, representing a 9% drop," per the analysis.


**Between the lines:** Climate change is driving non-renewals in some areas, a Dec. 2024 Senate Budget Committee [report](https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf) found. 
  * Non-renewals are correlated with higher premiums and are "often an early warning sign of market destabilization," per the report.
  * "Premiums are skyrocketing, insurers are non-renewing customers or pulling out of risky markets altogether. As climate change gets worse, insurance availability and affordability will also get worse."


**Reality check:** The amount you'll actually pay for home insurance depends on many factors — not least of which is [your credit score](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/14/credit-score-home-insurance-premiums), but also the cost of your home, its materials, and other variables.
**Go deeper:** Soaring home insurance rates are acting as a ["stealth inflation driver,"](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/15/homeowners-insurance-is-a-stealth-inflation-driver) Axios' Emily Peck reports.
