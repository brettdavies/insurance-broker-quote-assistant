Bundling your home and auto insurance with the same insurance company can save you up to 25% on your policy, depending on the insurer. Not only does bundling save you money, but it also makes managing your insurance policies easier, as you have only one insurance company to deal with. Your insurer will also often combine your monthly premiums into one payment.
Bundling discounts, also known as multi-policy discounts, aren’t all created equally. Some insurers stand out above others in how much bundling policies will save you. Others excel in the number of insurance products and policies you can bundle.
You can save money by exploring discount opportunities from multiple insurers. Be sure to [**compare quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/) before buying a policy.
Quick Facts
  * Bundling home and car insurance can save you 10% to 25% with many major insurance companies.
  * Advantages of insurance bundling include discounts, convenience, and streamlined claims.
  * Bundling might not always be the cheapest option, so compare both bundled and stand-alone quotes.

## How to bundle your home and auto insurance
Bundling your home and auto insurance means purchasing both policies from the same company, often at a [**discounted rate**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/).[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/#cite-1) Think of it like signing up for an internet and cable television package. You get the convenience of one insurance company and a lower total bill. Here’s how to do it:
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/0f334ec089/insurify-icons-auto-blue-96x96_045-document.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/0f334ec089/insurify-icons-auto-blue-96x96_045-document.svg)
#### 1. Review your current policies
Start by gathering details about your existing home and auto coverage, including limits, deductibles, and premiums. This gives you a baseline for comparing quotes.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/95fa30ac35/insurify-icons-auto-orange-96x96_005-insurance.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/95fa30ac35/insurify-icons-auto-orange-96x96_005-insurance.svg)
#### 2. Decide what coverage you need
Before seeking out new quotes, think about your priorities. Do you want higher liability limits, a lower deductible, or [**broader coverage for valuables**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/jewelry-insurance/)?[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/#cite-2) Knowing this helps you avoid buying based only on price.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/7955361cf0/customer-support-1.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/7955361cf0/customer-support-1.svg)
#### 3. Shop around for bundle quotes
Contact several insurance companies and ask specifically for bundle options. Many insurance companies advertise bundle discounts of 10% to 25%, but actual savings depend on your profile and location.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/fa11c1fe75/comparison-website.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/fa11c1fe75/comparison-website.svg)
#### 4. Compare quotes carefully
Don’t just look at the total price. Review coverage limits, exclusions, deductibles, and the insurance company’s financial ratings.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/#cite-3) A lower premium isn’t worth it if coverage gaps leave you exposed.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/42122774e9/contact-us-96x96-orange_039-click.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/42122774e9/contact-us-96x96-orange_039-click.svg)
#### 5. Confirm the discount and finalize
Once you choose the best option, confirm that the insurance company applied the bundle discount. Then buy both policies from the same company.


## How to find the best home and auto insurance for you
Finding the best home and auto insurance can be a challenge. You want reliable insurance, but at the same time, you don’t want to pay an arm and a leg for it.
Check out these tips for finding the best home and auto insurance:[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/#cite-4)
  * **Consider your coverage needs.** Consider what[**coverage you need**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) — especially if you want to bundle your home and auto policies. Check insurance companies’ websites to see what types of coverage they offer.
  * **Look at customer reviews.** Always read an insurer’s customer reviews before buying a policy. An insurer may have very cheap rates but terrible customer service, which may negate the cost savings. Check out sites like the Better Business Bureau, Trustpilot, and J.D. Power for customer satisfaction information.
  * **Make sure the insurer has good financial strength.** An insurer’s financial strength indicates its capability to pay out claims. Check AM Best for financial strength ratings — anything above an A is a good rating.
  * **Compare quotes.** Always compare insurance quotes from multiple insurers before buying a policy. This goes for both home and auto insurance. Each insurer determines premiums differently, so it’s worth comparing pricing from at least three.


## Should you bundle your home and auto insurance?
Bundling often makes sense if you own a home and a car and want the convenience of working with a single insurance company. Although this can sometimes save you money, bundling isn’t always the best choice.
For example, if an insurance company offers great car insurance rates but higher-than-average [**home insurance premiums**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) — or vice versa — you might save more by keeping policies separate. Always compare stand-alone and bundled quotes before deciding, since [**savings opportunities**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-discounts/) vary by insurance company and state.

## Pros and cons of bundling
Bundling your home and auto insurance can offer several valuable benefits, but it isn’t the right choice for everyone. Advantages and drawbacks include the following:
Pros
  * **Discounts:** Many insurance companies offer savings of 10% to 25% when you bundle.
  * **Convenience:** Managing one company relationship, one bill, and one renewal date simplifies your life.
  * **Streamlined claims:** If a single event affects both your home and car, one company handles the process. Some companies even apply a single deductible.


Cons
  * **Not always cheapest:** An insurer may offer the [**lowest car insurance rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/) but charge more for homeowners coverage, or vice versa.
  * **Limited flexibility:** Customers are less likely to switch insurance companies when they bundle home and car insurance.
  * **Possible coverage gaps:** A bundle might tempt you to focus on price, causing you to overlook whether the coverage selections meet your needs.


## Home and auto insurance bundles FAQs
If you’re thinking about bundling your home and auto insurance, see the answers to frequently asked questions below.
  * ### What happens if I change my auto policy after bundling with home?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Changing your auto policy may alter your bundle discount. If you reduce coverage, switch vehicles, or change insurance companies, your home policy usually remains in force, but you may lose the bundled savings.
  * ### Can I bundle my car and home insurance if I live with my parents?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Yes. But you’ll need to get a separate type of policy to bundle with your car insurance, such as renters insurance or life insurance. Many insurance companies offer multi-policy or bundling discounts when you buy more than one insurance policy from the same company. Those policies don’t always have to be home and auto.
  * ###  Can I get home and auto insurance in two different states?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Yes. You can buy policies in two different states if, for example, you own a home in Florida but live and drive in New York. It might not be possible to bundle both policies for a discount, though. While larger insurance companies might offer coverage in both states, others might not because insurance laws and coverage requirements differ by location.
  * ### How is bundling home and auto insurance cheaper than just auto insurance by itself?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Insurance companies reward loyalty. They offer bundling discounts to incentivize customers to give them more business, and those discounts can reduce your insurance premiums by anywhere from 10% to 25%.
  * ### Does unbundling my car and home insurance affect whether my home insurance will be renewed next year?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
No. Unbundling typically doesn’t affect renewal eligibility. But your insurance company will remove the discount, meaning your premium could increase if you separate the policies.
  * ### Am I required to put my spouse on my home and auto policies?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Usually, yes. Insurance companies expect all household members of driving age to be listed on car insurance policies. You should also include your spouse on your home insurance policy for proper liability coverage.
  * ### Does bundling my insurance actually lower my rate?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Often yes, but not always. Discounts range from 10% to 25%, but if one policy has higher premiums, the overall bundle might not be cheaper than buying separate policies from two different companies.
  * ### Does GEICO offer a home and auto bundle?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Yes. GEICO offers bundle discounts by pairing its car insurance with home insurance coverage underwritten by partner companies. Discounts and eligibility vary by state.
  * ### What is the most reliable home insurance company?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Companies like [**Chubb**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/chubb/), [**AIG**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/aig/), [**Amica**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/amica/), [**State Farm**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/state-farm/), and [**USAA**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/usaa/) receive high ratings for customer service in the J.D. Power U.S. Home Insurance Study.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/#cite-5) But the best choice for you depends on your location and coverage needs.
  * ### Which company has the cheapest homeowners insurance?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
There’s no single [**cheapest homeowners insurance company**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/) nationwide. Rates vary widely by state, property value, and risk factors. Shop several different insurers to find the lowest price for your unique circumstances.
