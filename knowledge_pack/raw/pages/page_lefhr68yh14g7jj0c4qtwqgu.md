#  Geico Auto Insurance different rates 
We currently have 2 cars with geico insurance for the past 8 years. Geico always been the the lowest for us. I got my 6 month renewal for july and it was quoted for 1400.00. Highest ever been so I decided to shop around and progressive came out to 1000 for same policy which I will or plan to switch. 
I decided to try something with geico. I went to a geico agent website to get a auto quote, it took me to the same geico webpage. I put in the exact info and names choosing the same policy I current got the renewal for. the new rate geico gave me was 908.00. 
Anybody experience this or done it this way before? Is this some geico trick hoping people will be lazy and automatically assume the renewal rate is the lowest?

They will adjust your policy premium once it goes thru underwriting and they run your MVR.

No, it doesn't pull it until you go thru underwriting.

Nah I don't think Geico runs it until you pay. Some places it can cost up to 25$ per person to run MVRs, they ain't paying that unless they are REAL sure you're starting a policy. And also they assume you should know your own history and answer everything correctly the first time.

The new GEICO quote is probably not pulling your MVR, applying a discount you’re not eligible for, or it has different rating tables when going through the agent rather than direct. Or a combination of all of those. Progressive also does this with different rating tables direct vs. agent.

Did your quote with Geico on the website and Pogressive include running your MRV? Did you apply the same coverages?

If you have an active policy, it will not quote properly. Firstly from the MVR, secondly the policy would be cancelled because the current one is still active. MVR isn't ran til you're just about to pay-as with most insurance companies.
