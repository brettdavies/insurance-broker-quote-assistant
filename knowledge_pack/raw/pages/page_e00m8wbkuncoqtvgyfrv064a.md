When shopping for insurance, the first step is often getting a quote—an estimate of what a policy might cost based on provided information. While useful for comparison, quotes are not always final and may change before a policy is issued. 
## Legal Requirements for Issuing an Insurance Quote
Insurance companies and agents must follow legal guidelines to ensure transparency and prevent misleading estimates. Regulations vary by state, but insurers generally must base quotes on accurate underwriting criteria, such as driving history for auto insurance or medical records for life insurance. They must also comply with anti-discrimination laws, meaning rates cannot be set based on factors like race, religion, or gender unless explicitly permitted by law. 
Quotes rely on applicant-provided data, third-party databases, and industry risk models. Misrepresentations—whether intentional or accidental—can lead to discrepancies between the quoted price and final premium. Many states require insurers to disclose assumptions used in calculations, such as estimated credit scores or claims history, to help consumers understand their rate. 
Some insurers must file rating methodologies with state insurance departments, which review them for fairness and actuarial soundness. This oversight prevents arbitrary pricing and ensures quotes reflect legitimate risk factors. Additionally, insurers may be required to maintain records of issued quotes for regulatory audits and consumer disputes. 
## Binding and Nonbinding Quotes
Insurance quotes fall into two categories: binding and nonbinding. A binding quote guarantees the quoted rate as long as no new risk factors emerge before the policy is issued. These are less common, as most insurers prefer flexibility in case additional underwriting reveals discrepancies or undisclosed information. Binding quotes typically require verification of key details such as claims history, credit scores, or driving records. 
Nonbinding quotes, more common in the industry, are estimates subject to change after further evaluation. For instance, an auto insurance quote may initially be based on self-reported driving history, but if a detailed report uncovers past violations, the final premium may be higher. Similarly, a homeowners insurance quote might assume a property is in average condition, but an inspection could reveal structural issues that lead to an adjusted rate or revised coverage terms. 
Since nonbinding quotes are preliminary, applicants should not consider them guaranteed offers. Many insurers include disclaimers stating that final pricing depends on underwriting approval and may require additional documentation, such as proof of income for disability insurance or medical records for life insurance. Even minor discrepancies—like an incorrect ZIP code or underreported annual mileage—can result in significant differences between an initial quote and the final premium. 
## Disclosures and Consumer Rights
When providing a quote, insurers must disclose how the estimate was calculated and any conditions affecting the final premium. These disclosures help consumers understand what influenced their quoted rate, such as credit history, claims records, or geographic risk assessments. Many insurers include disclaimers noting that quotes are based on preliminary information and may change after underwriting. Some jurisdictions require insurers to provide a breakdown of rating factors, allowing consumers to see how specific elements impacted their estimated cost. 
Beyond pricing, consumers have the right to clear explanations of coverage options, policy exclusions, and potential surcharges. For example, an auto insurance quote should specify whether accident forgiveness is included or if a lower premium results from a high deductible. Homeowners insurance quotes often indicate whether coverage is based on replacement cost or actual cash value, which affects claim payouts. Some companies offer side-by-side comparisons of different coverage levels, helping applicants weigh trade-offs between premium costs and protection. 
Consumers can also request corrections if inaccurate information was used in the quote. Many insurance companies rely on third-party reports, which can contain outdated or incorrect data. If an applicant notices an error—such as a claim that was never filed or an incorrect driver listed—they can dispute the information and request a revised quote. Some states require insurers to provide a process for reviewing and correcting discrepancies to ensure fair pricing. 
## Liability for Misrepresentation
Both insurers and applicants share responsibility for ensuring quote accuracy. If an applicant provides false or misleading information—such as underreporting mileage for auto insurance or omitting past claims for homeowners coverage—the insurer may adjust, cancel, or deny the policy if discrepancies are found during underwriting or after a claim is filed. 
Insurers must also provide accurate quotes based on valid underwriting criteria. If a quote is issued using erroneous data—such as outdated credit scores or incorrect risk classifications—the consumer may receive an artificially low or high estimate. In some cases, insurers can be held liable if they knowingly provide misleading quotes to attract applicants. Regulatory bodies monitor such practices, and companies found engaging in deceptive quoting may face fines or other penalties. Transparency in quoting helps maintain consumer trust and ensures premiums reflect actual risk. 
## The Quote’s Relationship to the Final Policy
A quote is an estimate, not a final policy. Once an applicant proceeds with coverage, the insurer conducts a detailed underwriting process to verify the provided information. This review may involve accessing official reports, conducting inspections, or requiring additional documentation. If discrepancies arise—such as an undisclosed claim or a change in credit score—the insurer may adjust the premium, modify coverage terms, or decline to issue a policy. The final policy reflects the insurer’s confirmed risk assessment, which can differ from the original quote. 
Once issued, the policy terms become legally binding. Coverage limits, exclusions, and conditions specified in the policy override any assumptions made during the quoting process. Consumers should carefully review policy documents to ensure alignment with expectations. If the final policy differs significantly from the quote, applicants may have a limited window to cancel without penalty or request adjustments. Some insurers offer a grace period or free-look period, allowing policyholders to review coverage and make changes before full commitment. 
## Situations That May Invalidate a Quote
Several factors can make a quote inaccurate or invalid before a policy is issued. Changes in an applicant’s circumstances, discrepancies in provided information, or delays in finalizing coverage can all impact the insurer’s ability to honor the originally quoted rate. Since quotes are based on a snapshot of risk at a given moment, any significant changes may lead to pricing adjustments or coverage ineligibility. 
Material Changes in Risk 
If an applicant’s risk profile changes between the quote and final underwriting, the insurer may revise the premium or deny coverage. For example, in auto insurance, if a driver receives a traffic violation or is involved in an accident after obtaining a quote but before purchasing the policy, the insurer may adjust the rate or reconsider offering coverage. Similarly, in homeowners insurance, if a property sustains damage—such as a fire or flood—before the policy is issued, the insurer may require repairs before extending coverage or impose new exclusions. 
In life and health insurance, changes in medical status can also affect a quote’s validity. If an applicant is diagnosed with a medical condition or undergoes a significant procedure before finalizing the policy, the insurer may adjust the premium, impose waiting periods, or decline coverage based on new health risks. Because insurers rely on up-to-date underwriting data, any material changes between the quote and policy issuance can impact final terms. 
Discrepancies in Provided Information 
If an applicant provides inaccurate or incomplete information, the insurer may invalidate the quote upon discovering discrepancies. This can happen if a homeowner underestimates square footage, an auto insurance applicant misreports vehicle usage, or a life insurance applicant fails to disclose a pre-existing condition. Insurers verify details through third-party reports, inspections, and underwriting databases, and inconsistencies can lead to pricing adjustments or coverage denials. 
Some insurers allow applicants to correct minor errors before issuing a policy, but significant misrepresentations—whether intentional or unintentional—can result in policy denial. Even after issuance, insurers may retroactively adjust premiums or cancel coverage if they determine the original quote was based on false or misleading information. To avoid such issues, applicants should ensure all details provided during the quoting process are accurate and up to date.
