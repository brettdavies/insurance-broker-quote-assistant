**Animal Collision Safety Tips**
  * **Slow down.** Reduce your vehicle's speed and maintain a constant lookout for animals. Travel at a speed that will allow you to stop in time if an animal comes into the beam cast by your headlights
  * **Use extra caution**. Slow-down in known animal crossing zones.
  * **Dusk to dawn are high-risk times** ; use high beams when appropriate.
  * **Scan the road and avoid swerving when you see an animal**. Brake firmly when you notice an animal in or near your path but stay in your lane. Many serious crashes occur when drivers swerve to avoid a deer and hit another vehicle or lose control of their cars.
  * **Always wear your seatbelt**.


**After-Crash Tips**
  * **Move your vehicle to a safe place:** Pull to the side of the road and turn on your hazard lights.
  * **Call police:** If an animal is blocking traffic and could be creating a threat for other drivers.
  * **Document:** Take photographs of the road, your surroundings and damage.
  * **Stay away from the animal:** A frightened, wounded animal could use its legs and hooves to harm you. Do not attempt to move an animal.
  * **Don’t assume your vehicle is safe to drive:** Look for leaking fluid, loose parts, tire damage, broken lights and other hazards.
  * **Contact your insurance company:** Quickly file your insurance claim. Comprehensive coverage typically covers repairs for collisions with animals after your deductible.


_*Rodents are not only involved in collisions but included in claims data as an animal related loss for damage they cause to vehicles, like chewing wires._
