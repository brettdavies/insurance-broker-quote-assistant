  * Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator 


1 minute read
# To consolidate debt, first calculate the loan you need
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
It's easier to conquer debt when you streamline multiple payments into one place. 
This debt consolidation calculator will help you determine if combining your loans and other debts into one loan could save you money. By entering the balance, interest and monthly payments on your existing loans and credit cards, this calculator will show you if a consolidation loan could be helpful. However, you may not want to include loans that are almost paid off.
If you own a home, obtaining a home equity loan or home equity line of credit may be preferred since they typically have lower interest rates than personal loans. We have a [Home equity line of credit calculator](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/calculate-how-long-it-will-take-to-pay-off-a-line-of-credit "Calculate how long to pay off a Home Equity Line of Credit") that can help you look into that option.
