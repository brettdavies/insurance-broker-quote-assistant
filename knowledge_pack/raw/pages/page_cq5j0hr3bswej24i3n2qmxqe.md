Homeowners insurance typically covers sudden roof damage caused by problems like a falling tree, hail or a storm. Home insurance, however, doesn’t cover every type of damage, such as normal wear and tear or lack of maintenance.
Filing a home insurance claim for roof damage is similar to other types of home insurance claims, but it’s vital to document the roof damage. We’ll walk you through the steps to file your claim with confidence.

## 10 Steps To File a Home Insurance Claim for Roof Damage
If you need to file a [homeowners insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) claim, it’s wise to follow these steps.
|   
---|---  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Review-policy@2x-1.svg) | 
### **Check What’s Covered**
Review your home insurance policy to make sure the cause of the damage is covered. You’ll want to check the dwelling coverage portion of the policy, which will help you with your roof insurance claim.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Clock-1.svg) | 
### **Act Quickly**
Don’t wait weeks to file a claim. Notify your insurer as soon as possible. Waiting to file a claim may result in further damage, which your home insurer may not cover.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/House-on-fire@2x.svg) | 
### **Document the Damage**
Safely assess roof damage and check the rest of your home, too. Take photos of the damage. If your home is at risk because of the roof damage, you’ll want to stop further damage, such as placing a tarp on the roof. Don’t make any major repairs before the claim is approved.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Phone.svg) | 
### **Contact the Insurance Company**
Notify your insurance company and keep track of your correspondence from the start, including photos, who you spoke to, when you talked to them and what they told you.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Document-1.svg) | 
### **Get Estimates**
Make sure to get a written estimate on a roofing company’s letterhead with the company’s contact information. You want an estimate to repair your house and return it to its former state. An insurer won’t cover enhancements.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house@2x.svg) | 
### **Prepare for an Inspection**
The insurer typically sends an appraiser to gauge the damage. The company decides whether to approve the claim and the amount for damages. An adjuster will look for damage, missing and damaged shingles, water damage below the shingles and signs of wear and tear.

### **Negotiate the Claim**
You can negotiate the claim if the insurance company doesn’t give you what you think is owed. You may even want to consider hiring a [public adjuster](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/public-adjusters/) to work on your behalf.  
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Gavel.svg) | 
### **Appeal the Decision if Needed**
You can appeal your insurer’s decision if you’re rejected or don’t get what you think is needed. The insurer may send another adjuster and a roofing specialist. If it’s still denied, you can contact your state’s department of insurance for help. You can also hire an attorney.   
![](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Building-1.svg) | 
### **Finalize the Claim**
Once you and the insurance company are satisfied with the claim amount, the insurer will provide you with the funds minus your policy’s [insurance deductible](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/insurance/insurance-deductible/).

### **Hire a Contractor**
Once you have the money to fix the roof, you can hire a reputable contractor. If you decide to improve the roof beyond what your insurer covers (getting it back to its former state), you’ll have to chip in money for that portion of the work.   
## How To Document Roof Damage
Document the roof damage before notifying the insurance company. Here’s what to do: 
  * Access the roof if it’s safe to do so
  * Take photos and/or videos of the damage
  * If safe, get close-up photos of the damage as well as the entire roof
  * Jot down information about the damage, cause and date. Describe the damage, including missing or damaged shingles and water damage
  * You may want to hire a professional inspector to inspect the damage and provide you with a detailed report of the damage, which you can give to the insurance company 


Once you have this information, you can file your claim to start the claims process. Home insurance companies may allow you to file a claim by phone, email or web portal. 
## What Roof Damage Qualifies for a Claim? 
The types of roof damage [covered by your insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) vary based on the cause of the damage. Typically, roof insurance covers sudden or accidental problems caused by events like: 
  * Falling objects
  * Fire
  * Hail
  * Lightning
  * Smoke
  * Weight of ice and snow
  * Wind
  * Vandalism


### Wind and Hail Damage
Homeowners insurance companies pay an average of more than $13,500 for wind and hail home insurance claims, according to Triple-I (Insurance Information Institute). Some policies may not cover wind and hail damage, depending on the state. An example is [State Farm](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/state-farm-home-insurance-review/), which may exclude windstorm or hail damage that occurs during a hurricane. 
Some companies may also have a separate deductible for damage caused by a windstorm or hail.
If your insurance company doesn’t include windstorm and hail coverage, you could: 
  * Buy a separate windstorm and hail policy
  * Add a policy endorsement for that coverage that comes with a separate wind and hail deductible
  * Buy coverage through your state’s [Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/fair-plans/), which is the insurer of last resort for homeowners who can’t get coverage elsewhere


You may even decide to exclude wind and hail coverage if you want [cheap home insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/cheapest-home-insurance-companies/), but remember that you won’t get covered if your roof gets damaged by those weather events.

### What Roof Damage Causes Aren’t Covered by Home Insurance? 
Homeowners coverage doesn’t typically cover damage related to:
  * Cosmetic damage from hail if you have a metal roof
  * Damage from lack of maintenance
  * Earthquakes
  * Floods
  * Wear and tear


If floods or an earthquake damage your roof, you need separate [flood insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) or [earthquake insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/). If it’s damaged by normal wear and tear, an insurance company views that as your problem, since the homeowner should take precautions to protect the roof from normal damage. 
That includes a leaky roof. A home insurance company won’t cover a leaky roof that hasn’t been properly maintained, but it may cover [water damage and leaks](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/water-damage/) for problems like a tree falling on your roof, causing a roof leak.
## Average Home Insurance Costs by Roof Type
Home insurance companies set rates and [home insurance quotes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/compare-home-insurance-quotes/) partially based on a home’s roof type. Insurers factor in the cost of replacing a roof and the durability of the materials. An analysis of 14 home insurance companies found that metal roofs are the cheapest to insure, while wood roofs are the most expensive.
Roof type  |  Average annual cost   
---|---  
Metal roof |  $1,928  
Slate roof |  $1,941  
Asphalt roof |  $1,997  
Wood roof |  $2,133

## How To Avoid Roof Scams
Beware of roof scammers who may claim they can do the work, but will leave you with the same damaged roof and less money in your wallet. 
One scam to watch out for is a roofing company that demands money up front, especially when they request the full amount for the project. These cases might be scammers who take the money or a roofing company that does shoddy work because they’ve already been paid the full cost. 
The National Insurance Crime Bureau also warns to beware of lowball bids that are much lower than those of other contractors. These companies may also say they will pay your home insurance deductible or offer special hurricane deals.

##  Home Insurance Roof Claims Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
### How long does it take to receive a home insurance claims check? 
Home insurance claim settlement checks usually take 30 to 60 days after you agree to the amount. 
Your state, the damage amount and the number of claims in your area may influence the exact timing. For example, if a storm damages many homes in your area, it may take longer to be paid for a roof claim.
### When should you not file a roof claim?
You should only file a roof claim if the damage is enough that receiving money from an insurance company will offset future home insurance rate increases for filing a claim. 
For instance, let’s say your home suffered $1,400 damage and your policy has a $1,000 deductible. In that case, you may only be eligible for a $400 claim payment. Future rate increases for filing the claim may easily exceed the $400 payment in the long run, so you may want to handle paying for the repairs yourself.
### Can an insurance company drop you because of your roof?
Home insurance companies may threaten not to renew your policy if you don’t fix a roof that’s old, damaged or at risk of being damaged, such as a tree limb hanging over the house. 
Home insurance likely won’t cover the roof replacement in this case because the homeowner is supposed to maintain the roof and reduce damage risks.
