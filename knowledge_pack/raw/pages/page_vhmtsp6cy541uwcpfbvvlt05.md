Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-nationwide/)
Root was among the early adopters of telematics technology, which helps to assign insurance rates based on driving habits instead of traditional rating factors. In fact, the company aims to discontinue using credit scores — a practice it calls "discriminatory" — by the year 2025. Root car insurance could be a solid option for those with a clean driving history or those who drive limited mileage.

### Telematics options: Root vs. Nationwide
Each of these companies stands as a solid option for drivers interested in usage-based insurance. Telematics sits at the heart of Root's product, powering its entire pricing strategy. Nationwide also offers telematics insurance in the form of its SmartRide program.
Root Insurance
Root is one of the most prominent telematics-first insurance companies. Root uses its telematics app to gather information and calculate customer premiums. Rates are then set based on the insured's driving habits and frequency, rather than solely on demographic and historical information like past driving record or credit history.
Nationwide SmartRide
SmartRide is Nationwide's telematics offering. The primary benefit of the program is the opportunity it gives safe drivers to save money. The app tracks customers' driving habits and offers feedback to reduce risks and incidents on the road.
### Zebra Tip: Turn to Root for telematics

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/root-vs-nationwide/)
Root allows existing auto insurance customers to bundle homeowners insurance through a partnership with Homesite. Root home insurance is not available as a standalone insurance policy — a customer must be enrolled in Root's car insurance program to be eligible.
Though the company is seen as financially stable, it receives more customer complaints than average. Customers looking for top-notch customer satisfaction may do well to look into a policy with a more established carrier. In addition, Root homeowners insurance quotes can only be found via the company's mobile app, not its website. Root claims customers who [bundle home and auto policies](https://www.thezebra.com/best-home-and-car-insurance/) receive 10% discounts on their home insurance premium.
