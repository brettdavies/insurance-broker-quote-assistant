In May 2025, a strong hailstorm hit Texas and New Mexico. It caused a lot of damage and surprised many people. Roads were blanketed in ice-like hailstones, some as large as baseballs.
[Footage from The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/news/weather/video/hailstorm-blankets-texas-new-mexico-roads) shows just how powerful this storm was. But for residents and business owners, the aftermath is more than dramatic, it’s expensive and complicated. Many people are now starting to file claims. They are trying to get fair payment for their hail damage. This can help them recover after the storm.  
San Antonio Hit by Hail and Tornadoes: How to Handle Insurance Claims
[According to MySanAntonio.com](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/weather/article/hail-storms-tornadoes-san-antonio-20309262.php), parts of San Antonio and the Texas Hill Country were hit by large hail. Some hailstones were the size of golf balls. There was also a tornado near Interstate 10. It damaged homes, caused flying debris, and left many properties with damage inside. People in Bexar County reported broken windows, roof damage, and flooding. If not fixed soon, this could lead to water damage.
These storms remind us that Texas often faces big disasters. These include hurricanes, hailstorms, and tornadoes. After a storm, it is very important to file your insurance claim the right way and on time. This helps protect your home or business.
### Worsening Weather and Future Risks
As [reported by USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/05/07/severe-weather-flash-flooding-forecast/83490017007/), reports that the bad weather is not over yet. Experts warn that more flash floods and strong winds could happen soon. Storms like these remind us that Texas often faces natural disasters. These include hurricanes, hailstorms, and tornadoes. After a storm, it is very important to file your insurance claim the right way and on time. This helps protect your home or business.

### How Much Damage Can Hail Really Do?
The short answer: a lot. Hail damage claims commonly include:
  * Roof damage (especially asphalt shingles or tile)
  * Broken windows and skylights
  * Structural damage to walls, siding, or stucco
  * Dented or totaled vehicles
  * Destroyed outdoor property like HVAC units and furniture
  * Interior damage caused by roof leaks leading to water damage


Even small hail can damage your home. This can let water inside later, especially during a hurricane or heavy rain.
### What Does Your Insurance Cover?
Most Texas homeowners insurance policies include dwelling coverage for structural damage caused by hail.
However, coverage varies by policy. Here’s what to watch for:
**Covered:** Physical damage to your home's structure from hail 
**Not always covered:** Damage to fences, sheds, or detached garages: unless you have extra coverage 
**Beware of high wind/hail deductibles:** These are often percentage-based and could cost you thousands before insurance kicks in.

### Working with Your Insurance Adjuster and Getting Accurate Repair Estimates
When you file a claim, your insurance adjuster will inspect the damage. However, you should not rely solely on their report. It’s a smart move to get independent repair estimates from trusted contractors or roofing professionals. This is an important step to make sure your claim is correct. It should cover the real cost to fix your property. This includes roof and wall damage, water damage, and damage inside your home.
### Common Claim Process Problems and Bad Faith Tactics
Many Texans face challenges such as:
  * **Delayed inspections** by insurance companies
  * **Low repair estimates** that don’t cover the actual cost
  * **Underpaid hail damage claims**
  * **Denied claims** , often blamed on “pre-existing” or “cosmetic-only” damage


These are often signs of insurance bad faith, where insurers fail to handle claims fairly.
### What To Do If Your Property Was Damaged
If the May 2025 hailstorms or tornadoes damaged your home or business, take action now. Here are the steps you should follow:
  1. **Take clear photos and videos:** Capture everything, such as roof, siding, gutters, windows, and any debris-related damage.
  2. **Contact your insurance provider ASAP:** Waiting too long to file can hurt your claim.
  3. **Request a professional inspection:** Don’t rely only on the insurance company’s adjuster. Independent contractors can give you a more accurate damage report.
  4. **Keep all records:** Log every call, email, and estimate related to your claim.
