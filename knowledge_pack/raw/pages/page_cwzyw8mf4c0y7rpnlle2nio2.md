# Illinois Home Insurance
If you’ve chosen to make Illinois your home, investing in homeowners insurance is essential to protect against the state’s diverse and sometimes unpredictable climate. With a well-rounded policy in place, you can weather any storm or season, knowing that your home is protected.
## Is home insurance required in Illinois?
Illinois law doesn’t require homeowners to have insurance on their property, but if you finance your home through a mortgage, your lender will likely require you to have [homeowners insurance](https://www.amica.com/en/products/home-insurance.html). Even if you own your home outright without a mortgage, it’s still highly advisable to be insured. Home insurance is not a one-size-fits-all product. It should be tailored to your specific situation and needs.
* * *
## Typical Illinois homeowners insurance coverages
  * **Coverage A – Dwelling:**
Coverage for your home and attached structures for damage caused by events such as fire, lightning, wind or hail.
  * **Coverage B – Other structures:**
This covers damage to other structures on the property that are set apart from the dwelling, such as a fence, shed or detached garage.
  * **Coverage C – Personal property:**
Coverage for your belongings, such as furniture, clothing and electronics, if they’re damaged by a peril listed in your policy.
  * **Coverage D – Loss of use:**
This covers your temporary living expenses when a covered loss makes your home unfit to live in.
  * **Coverage E – Personal liability:**
This covers damage or injury to another person or their property that you’re responsible for causing. It also covers legal assistance for claims made against you.
  * **Coverage F – Medical payments to others:**
This coverage can pay for medical bills for people who are accidentally hurt on your property, not including members of your household.


Remember, each of these coverages is subject to a policy limit, deductible and exclusions, which are specified within your policy. 
Your homeowners insurance won’t cover flood damages, so it helps to ensure you’re properly covered if there’s a flood. Flood insurance policies are available and are written through the federally backed National Flood Insurance Program. It’s common for mortgage companies to require flood insurance if your home is within or near a floodplain. Regardless, a flood can occur anywhere, and it’s a good idea to buy this additional coverage.
### Additional coverages in Illinois
You may find that the general coverages afforded in a basic homeowners policy don’t cover certain losses or types of property. Amica offers [home insurance options](https://www.amica.com/en/resources/home/coverage/home-insurance-options.html) in the form of policy endorsements that can fill in some of those gaps in coverage. Adding endorsements to your Illinois homeowners insurance policy can provide valuable additional coverage tailored to your specific needs. Here are a few endorsements you might consider:
  * **Special computer coverage:**
Additional protection beyond what’s included in your policy for devices against direct physical loss, like accidental damage or theft. Devices covered under special computer coverage include:
    * Desktops
    * Laptops
    * Smartphones
    * Gaming devices
    * Smart TVs
  * **Identity fraud:**
Identity theft is a growing concern, and this endorsement can help cover expenses associated with restoring your identity, such as legal fees, lost wages and other related costs.
  * **Water backup and sump overflow:**
Unexpected and accidental water damage, like from an appliance or burst pipes, is covered by most homeowners insurance policies. But, at the same time, they also exclude coverage for backed-up sewers and drains. This endorsement provides coverage for water that backs up through drains and sump pumps. 
  * **Scheduled personal property:**
If you have high-value items such as jewelry, fine art or collectibles, a basic homeowners policy may not provide sufficient coverage. With this endorsement, you can insure specific items to make sure they're adequately covered against loss or damage.
  * **Earthquakes:**
A standard Illinois policy excludes damage caused by earth movement, including earthquakes. This endorsement would extend coverage to damage caused by an earthquake.


* * *
## Understanding rate factors for Illinois home insurance
Living in a small town or a city can significantly influence your home insurance premiums. Population density, crime rates and environmental risks all play a role in determining insurance costs.
Your Illinois home insurance policy should be tailored to your unique needs and circumstances, taking into consideration specifics like the type of dwelling, the value of your belongings and the level of coverage desired. Certain [factors that impact home insurance](https://www.amica.com/en/resources/home/coverage/6-ways-to-save-money-on-homeowners-insurance.html) rates may be beyond your control, such as repair costs or your proximity to a fire station. 
Regularly reviewing and updating your policy can ensure that you’re protected in a way that fits your current needs.
### Maximize savings with Illinois home insurance discounts
There are several ways Illinois homeowners can save money on home insurance without compromising the quality of their coverage.1 We offer [home insurance discounts](https://www.amica.com/en/products/home-insurance/discounts.html) for:
  * Alarm systems: Receive a discount when you insure a home with burglar alarms, sprinkler systems or fire alarms.

In fact, Illinois homeowners who [bundle home and auto insurance](https://www.amica.com/en/products/how-to-bundle-insurance.html) with Amica could save up to 20% with a multiline discount.1

## Facts and figures about Illinois
### Common claims in Illinois:
Illinois geography allows for a diverse climate that can lead to a wide range of weather conditions, which can pose unique challenges for homeowners.
  * **Weather-related claims:** High winds from tornadoes and severe thunderstorms can result in significant roof and siding damage. Homeowners insurance usually covers structural damage caused by severe weather, including the costs to rebuild your home and replace belongings, up to your policy's specified limits.


The heavy rainfall may lead to flooding, particularly in low-lying areas; because of this, obtaining a separate flood insurance policy is often necessary to ensure protection for your home and belongings.
  * **Old or corroded pipes:** In older homes or those with outdated plumbing systems, pipes may become worn out, corroded or weakened over time. This can increase the likelihood of leaks occurring, especially in areas with high water pressure or hard water.


These leaks can lead to water damage to the structure of the home, as well as damage to personal property such as furniture, electronics and other belongings. Common areas where plumbing leaks occur include bathrooms, kitchens, basements and crawl spaces. Most standard home insurance policies cover water damage caused by leaking pipes, but it’s best to review your policy to understand the extent of coverage and any limitations.
### Fun facts about Illinois:
  * More than half of the Illinois population lives within the greater Chicago metropolitan area.2
  * Built in 1885, the Home Insurance Building in Chicago was considered the first skyscraper in the world.2
  * Collinsville hosts the world’s largest horseradish celebration, the International Horseradish Festival, held each June. The festival holds events like a 5K run, a car show and more.3
