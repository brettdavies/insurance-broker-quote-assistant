#  Best SR-22 and IID setup in LA County? Already have State Farm, DMV suspension in effect. 
Hey everyone, I’m dealing with a recent DUI in LA County and trying to figure out the smartest and cheapest way to handle the SR-22 and IID situation. 
I just got the decision from the DMV hearing, and they suspended my license from 04/26 to 08/25/2025. I’m eligible for a restricted license right now if I install an IID which I am planning on getting. 
I already have State Farm insurance on my car, and I have my first court arraignment this week, so nothing has been decided yet on the court side, this is just from DMV. 
My lawyer recommended Breathe Easy Insurance for the SR-22. They quoted me $650 for the first year, $330 the next, and cheaper again the third year (If I maintain a clean driving record). 
My questions: 
  * Should I just get the SR-22 through Breathe Easy and keep State Farm? 
  * Will State Farm find out and possibly drop me? 
  * Anyone know of a cheaper or better SR-22 option? 
  * Any IID providers in LA County you’d recommend (reliable and low-cost)? 


Trying to get back on the road ASAP and do this the right way. Any help or advice is seriously appreciated

I recommend getting the SR 22 through an outside agency such as breathe easy and keeping your car insurance through State Farm. SR 22 is not insurance. If you get your SR 22 through State Farm, they will drop you most likely upon conviction. If you get the SR 22 through an outside agency such as breathe easy you have a very high chance State Farm will not find out unless they run your license. I have had clients tell me they got an SR 22 for $300 the first year, you need to just call around and Price shop, Lowcost Interlock is one of the cheapest for the IID. Patrick Silva DUI Lawyer

Nice thank you so much for all the info! My arraignment in this week, and I assume I won’t find out conviction for a couple months. 
The thing with State Farm is that I think they run your license every year during the renewal, not too sure on this though…

Don’t these large companies run your license once or twice a year?

If you own a vehicle then it would be an OWNER sr22 attached to your auto insurance. Non owner would be if you don’t own a vehicle or don’t have a daily use vehicle. It is unethical to purchase a non-owner SR22 to keep your carrier from finding out about your dui. Also unethical for an agency to have a client spend money to purchase a separate non owner policy when they can guide the client to add the sr22 filing to their current policy for just $15-$50. A shady agency in southern CA lost their license due to this practice.

The right way is to have State Farm add the sr22 filing to your policy. At renewal they can decide to renew, non renew, or raise your rate. At that point or if State Farm flat out deny adding SR22, I would find a broker that does not charge broker fees and have them shop progressive, Dairyland, KEMPER, bristol, and aspire. Always have your insurance done by the book. Also, for ignition interlock I would look at Smart Start IID. They are the only company that has no contract and I saw a post with the code CADRIVE that gives you the first month free.
