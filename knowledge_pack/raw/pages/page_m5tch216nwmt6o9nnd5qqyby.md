##  Is GEICO a good company? Our Take
GEICO is widely regarded as a reputable insurance company, offering a range of products including auto, home, and life insurance. Its competitive rates and user-friendly online tools make it a popular choice among consumers.
However, customer reviews are mixed, as is common in the insurance industry. While many customers praise GEICO for its affordability and efficient service, others have reported dissatisfaction with claims handling and customer support.
For instance, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) rates GEICO with an A+, but customer reviews average 1.1 out of 5 stars based on over 1,600 reviews.
Similarly, a MarketWatch review notes that GEICO has an A+ rating from the BBB but also highlights the low customer review scores.
These mixed reviews suggest that while GEICO excels in certain areas, individual experiences may vary.

### Auto Insurance Cost
The average cost of GEICO car insurance for full coverage is approximately $1,572 annually. In comparison, the national average cost for full coverage car insurance is about $2,543 per year, exemplifying GEICOs competitive rates.
### GEICO Price Quote
GEICO is generally considered affordable for drivers with a clean record and good credit, offering competitive rates compared to the national average. It is particularly cost-effective for those who qualify for various discounts, such as safe driving, good student, or military discounts.
However, GEICO can be more expensive for drivers with poor credit, recent at-fault accidents, or DUIs, as these factors significantly increase the premium.

## Positive Online Reviews Of GEICO
Reddit: **Pharmacienne123**
I’ve only ever had Geico. Most of my interactions have been smooth (I’ve had a couple of fender benders over the past couple of decades), except in one case where they wanted to declare my car (worth probably around $5000 at the time) a total loss because I had run over something that had punctured my radiator.
BBB: No positive reviews
