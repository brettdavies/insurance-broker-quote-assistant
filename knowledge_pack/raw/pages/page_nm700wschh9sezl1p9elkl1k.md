## The cheapest car insurance in Tampa by driving record
Your driving record will inform your premium rates. If you get even a [single speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) or are involved in an accident, it’s likely that your insurance costs will go up the next time your insurance company pulls your driving record. This typically happens when your policy renews.
### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Tampa
Speeding increases your chances of getting into a serious accident, and most insurance companies penalize this behavior with higher premiums. If you have a speeding ticket on your record, it’s a good time to [compare quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) again. On average, Tampa drivers with a single speeding ticket pay $5,056 per year for full coverage insurance, compared to $4,685 prior to their conviction. This means that drivers with a single speeding ticket conviction typically pay 8 percent more for full coverage.

In addition to finding new insurance, you’ll also need to get an [SR-22 certificate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-florida/), which not all companies are willing to provide. A DUI can influence your premium rates for several years. After a single [DUI conviction in Florida](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-with-dui/), Tampa drivers pay average annual rates of $7,185 for full coverage and $2,381 for state minimum coverage.

Minimum coverage requirements in Tampa
[Florida drivers](https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/) must carry both Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL) on their vehicles. PIP is used to cover necessary and reasonable medical expenses up to $10,000 after a covered accident. Meanwhile, PDL coverage is used to pay for damage to another person’s property.
To register your vehicle in Tampa, you need to have a minimum of:
  * $10,000 in PIP
  * $10,000 in PDL


Bodily injury liability is not required in Florida but drivers do have to prove their ability to pay for damages under the “financial responsibility law.” If a driver does purchase car insurance to satisfy the law, the minimum requirements are:
  * $10,000 bodily injury liability per person
  * $20,000 bodily injury liability per accident


It may be advisable to have additional coverage, especially if you don’t have the cash on hand to pay for a lot of out-of-pocket expenses after a car accident.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  How can I get car insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
You can often find the [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) online. Most companies allow you to [check insurance rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) and apply for coverage on their website. Some of the top Florida car insurance companies may even make it easy to compare quotes with competitors right on their site. Be sure to shop for discounts. You can often lower premium costs by bundling your policy, using a telematics program, or driving fewer miles.
  * ###  Why are car insurance rates in Tampa so high?
Caret Down Icon
Tampa rates are some of the highest in the U.S., for several reasons. Rates are often higher in congested urban areas, where the high density of cars makes accidents more common — along with the resulting claims. Some urban areas have a higher risk of theft and vandalism, which can also increase rates. In addition, weather conditions in Florida, with frequent summer storms and hurricanes, make the state a high-risk location for damage to cars from falling trees and other storm-related mishaps. Finally, Florida has a fairly high percentage of uninsured drivers — almost [16 percent](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists), according to the Insurance Information Institute. If you are in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver, your own insurance company may be on the hook for damages if you have [uninsured driver coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/underinsured-motorist-coverage/).
  * ######  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Tampa?
Caret Down Icon
There are [several strategies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/) you can take to lower your Tampa, FL, car insurance rates. First, it can be helpful to gather several quotes at renewal time to see if another insurer might offer you a better rate. Make sure that your quotes include any discounts for which you are eligible. If you are a fairly safe and careful driver, participating in a telematics program could save you significantly. Improving your credit rating is a long-term way to lower your rates, as well. Perhaps no strategy is as effective, however, as remaining accident-free and avoiding moving violations. Insurers often reserve their best rates for drivers with clean driving records. If you do have a mark or two on your license, consider taking a [defensive driving course](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/defensive-driving-courses/), which can help you brush up on your skills behind the wheel and may also earn you a discount.
  * ######  How do I get car insurance quotes in Tampa?
Caret Down Icon
There are a few different ways you can get car insurance quotes in Tampa. Many insurance carriers offer online quoting through their websites. Others may require you to call to get a quote. Alternatively, you could work with a broker who can source rates from multiple carriers on your behalf and help you choose the best option for your needs and budget. There are also [online tools](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) that compare rates from several carriers at once. Regardless of how you get quotes, you'll want to make sure you're requesting the same coverage types and levels with each company to get an apples-to-apples comparison. While you might not be required to input all your personal details to get an initial quote, the more you're able to provide, the more accurate your quote will be.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.

30% Coverage & savings

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
