In general, high-risk drivers pay more than others for auto insurance, but certain designations are costlier, like having a DUI. In some cases, an insurer may deny you coverage outright. At AutoInsurance.com, we considered dozens of insurers and chose auto insurance providers with affordable rates, varied discounts, and coverage options for individuals with a bad driving record. Alongside affordable rates, we looked at many factors, including at-fault coverage, medical payments coverage, and safe driving incentives.
Whatever their situation, all drivers deserve reliable auto insurance coverage at the right price. For that reason, we’ve conducted in-depth research to ease the search. Below, check out our best picks for car insurance for high-risk drivers.
## Summary of the Best High-Risk Auto Insurance
  1. **Cheapest Standard Provider:**[GEICO](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#GEICO)
  2. **Best for Hard-to-Insure Drivers:**[Direct Auto](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#DirectAuto)
  3. **Best for DUI:**[Progressive](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#Progressive)
  4. **Best for Bad Credit:**[Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#Nationwide)
  5. **Best for Military and Veterans:**[USAA](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#USAA)


## What Is High Risk Auto Insurance?
High-risk auto insurance is a specialized insurance category tailored for individuals who are considered riskier to insure based on their driving history and other factors. Insurance companies classify drivers as high risk for various reasons, including:
  * History of at-fault accidents
  * Traffic violations (such as a speeding ticket or DUI conviction)
  * Lack of driving experience
  * Poor credit history


These factors indicate a higher likelihood of the driver being involved in future accidents, leading insurance providers to assign them a higher risk profile.
High-risk auto insurance policies typically include the same coverages as standard policies, though with higher premiums. The increased cost reflects the insurance company’s assessment of the greater financial risk associated with insuring a high-risk driver.
  1. **GEICO – Cheapest Standard Provider**  
Among widely available carriers, GEICO has the lowest average rates for high-risk drivers. The company offers a host of discounts that can help reduce premiums.
  2. **Direct Auto – Best for Hard-to-Insure Drivers**  
If you’re struggling to find affordable coverage from a standard provider, Direct Auto is a great option for nonstandard insurance. It has a robust list of discounts that don’t require a clean record, flexible payment options, and local agents.
  3. **Progressive – Best for DUI**  
DUIs are one of the costliest high-risk driver designations. Progressive has the best rates for drivers with a DUI on their record.

#### Low Rates for Drivers With a DUI
A DUI will classify you as a high-risk driver. Your rates will increase and standard insurers may turn you down or drop your policy. Progressive is unique in that it’s a major provider that not only sells insurance to drivers with a DUI, but also offers competitive rates.
On average, your auto insurance rates will increase by 70 to 75 percent after a DUI, but Progressive’s go up by only about 30 percent.
Full coverage avg. with good record | Full coverage avg. with DUI | Progressive full coverage avg. with a DUI | Difference  
---|---|---|---  
$2,399 | $3,305 | $2,770 | -16%  
#### Non-Owners Option
After a DUI or another serious moving violation, you may need to file an SR-22 (or an FR-44 in [Florida](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/florida/) or Virginia), even if you don’t own a car. An SR-22 certifies that you hold your state’s minimum coverage.
[Non-owner insurance](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-non-owner-car-insurance/) is for people who don’t own cars but still need auto insurance. The high-risk and non-owner categories often overlap for a number of reasons. Here are some examples:
  * People who received a DUI or moving violation, or caused an accident in a borrowed car
  * Drivers who sold their car after an incident and need an [SR-22](https://www.autoinsurance.com/faqs/what-is-sr22/)
  * New drivers who got their license to drive a rental car or Zipcar, or to establish in-state residency


FYI:  

Only Florida and Virginia use FR-44s, which are reserved for serious violations. The states also use SR-22s for less severe violations. 
High-risk drivers can purchase non-owner insurance from Progressive, and the company will handle filing SR-22s if you need them. The following coverages are available to non-owners:
  * Bodily injury liability
  * Property damage liability
  * Medical payments
  * Uninsured/underinsured motorist


Note that non-owners cannot purchase [comprehensive or collision coverage](https://www.autoinsurance.com/coverage/comprehensive-vs-collision/) because they do not own cars that would need repair. If they get into an accident in a borrowed vehicle, the owner’s insurance will kick in first (including comprehensive and collision coverage). If the limits of the owner’s policy are reached (or the non-owner is explicitly excluded from their policy), the non-owner policy would kick in next.
### 4. Best for Bad Credit - Nationwide
![Nationwide logo](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2F14145558%2Fnationwide-logo-1.png&w=640&q=75)

#### Competitive Rates for Bad Credit
Statistically, people with [bad credit](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/credit-scores/) are more likely to file claims, which is why bad credit is a high-risk designation. In some cases, an insurance provider might deny your coverage based on your credit score.
In every state except California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and [Michigan](https://www.autoinsurance.com/states/michigan/), insurance companies can use your credit report as a factor to determine your premium. People with a low credit score may pay 60 percent more for insurance than people with an average score (on the flip side, a high score can save you around 20 percent).
FYI:  

Insurance companies may require people with bad credit to purchase coverage beyond the minimum requirements. 
Premium increases due to bad credit vary by state, but the nationwide average is about 80 percent. In many states, having bad credit is worse than a DUI. Nationwide’s rates go up by about 50 percent, making it a great choice for people with bad credit.
Market average cost for full coverage with bad credit | Nationwide average cost for full coverage | Difference  
---|---|---  
$3,377 | $2,708 | -20%  
#### Pay-Per-Mile Program
If you drive only occasionally, you can save a lot of money with a pay-per-mile insurance plan. Nationwide is one of the few major insurance providers (along with Allstate) to offer a pay-per-mile option.
Examples of low-mileage, high-risk drivers include DUI offenders who are staying off the road and new drivers who prefer public transportation when available.
DID YOU KNOW?  

On average, Americans drive about 13,500 miles per year, but drivers under age 20 and over age 65 drive only about 7,600 miles, in part because they don’t have to commute to work as often as other adults.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/#citation-1)
With Nationwide’s plan, called Smartmiles, instead of paying a monthly premium, you’ll pay a monthly base rate and a per-mile rate. Here’s an example:
Monthly base rate | Per-mile rate | Average daily miles driven | Total cost per month | Total cost per year  
---|---|---|---|---  
$95 | $0.07 | 15 | $126 | $1,518  
If you drive infrequently or driving less as a result of a violation, we recommend looking into a pay-per-mile plan.

## Methodology
At AutoInsurance.com, we assess car insurance companies based on four key areas:
  * **Price (40%):** We look at average rates for various driver profiles, including those with a history of DUIs, at-fault accidents, or bad credit. We also examine the offered discounts. Full coverage averages use the following limits: 
    * Bodily injury liability: $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident
    * Property damage liability: $50,000 per accident
    * Uninsured and underinsured motorist bodily injury: $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident
    * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
  * **Claims Process (25%):** A strong claims handling process from an insurer is timely, clear, and speedy. It also features clear communication at every step, fair damage evaluations, and efficient payouts. We analyze the claims procedure through third parties like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Auto Insurance Shopping Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best.
  * **Customer Experience (25%):** We assess the customer’s ease while interacting with the provider, from getting a quote to changing policies. We also take into account the accessibility and quality of both online and agent connections, as well as the company’s entire website and mobile app experience.
  * **Coverage Options (10%):** We evaluate each provider’s coverage offerings and value companies with choices beyond state-mandated limits, including gap insurance, new car replacement, rideshare coverage, and more.
