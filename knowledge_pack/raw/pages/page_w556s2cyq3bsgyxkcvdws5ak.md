# What Is the Minimum Amount of Car Insurance Coverage in Illinois?
[ Get YOUR FREE CONSULTATION ](https://feaganslawgroup.com/minimum-car-insurance-coverage-in-illinois/#contact)
Illinois follows an at-fault system for car accidents. This means that if a driver causes a crash, they are legally responsible for covering the resulting damages. If you’re injured in a collision caused by someone else’s negligence, you can file a claim with their insurance company or pursue a [Geneva car accident lawsuit](https://feaganslawgroup.com/geneva-car-accident-attorney/) to recover compensation.
To comply with Illinois law, all drivers must carry minimum amounts of auto insurance coverage. These requirements ensure you have at least some financial ability to pay for any injuries or property damage you cause in a crash. 
## Illinois Minimum Liability Insurance Requirements
The state’s [mandatory insurance limits](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/auto-insurance-shopping-guide.html) are:
  * $25,000 for injury or death to one person in a single accident
  * $50,000 for injury or death to more than one person in a single accident
  * $20,000 for property damage per accident


In addition to liability coverage, Illinois requires drivers to carry [uninsured motorist (UM) coverage](https://feaganslawgroup.com/geneva-uninsured-motorist-lawyer/) in the same minimum amounts for bodily injury. This protects you if you’re injured in a crash caused by a driver who doesn’t have insurance or whose policy limits are too low to cover your losses.
Illinois imposes strict penalties for failing to maintain active liability insurance. These can include:
  * Fines of up to $1,000 for repeat violations
  * Suspension of your driver’s license
  * Impoundment of your vehicle
  * Reinstatement fees to restore your driving privileges
  * Higher insurance premiums when you do obtain coverage


Driving uninsured can also put your personal assets at risk if you cause an accident. Without insurance, you could be personally responsible for paying judgments from a lawsuit.
## Why the Minimum Coverage Might Not Be Enough
While these minimum amounts meet the legal requirement, they may fall far short of covering the full cost of a serious accident. For example, if medical bills exceed the at-fault driver’s $25,000 per person limit, you may be left with significant unpaid expenses. In such cases, you would need to [file a lawsuit against the driver](https://feaganslawgroup.com/how-to-file-a-car-accident-claim-in-geneva/) to recover damages.
That’s why many Illinois drivers choose to purchase higher liability limits and additional optional coverages to better protect themselves financially.
## Additional Coverages in Illinois 
While not required by law, optional coverages can provide additional financial protection in the event of a crash. 
### Collision Coverage
Collision coverage pays for damage to your own vehicle if you’re involved in a collision, regardless of fault. This is especially valuable if you drive a new or high-value car.
### Comprehensive Coverage
Comprehensive coverage covers losses unrelated to a collision, such as theft, vandalism, hail, fire, or falling objects.
### Medical Payments (MedPay) Coverage
MedPay helps pay medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, no matter who is at fault.
While these coverages are optional, they can provide additional financial security in situations where the at-fault driver’s policy limits aren’t enough.
