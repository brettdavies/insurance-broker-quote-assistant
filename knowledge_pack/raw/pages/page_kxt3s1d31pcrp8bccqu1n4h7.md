#  Does Geico allow 6 equal payments for auto ins in California? 
Im thinking of switching and the 25% down payment part always annoyed me about most other carriers. Im on the geico quote page and it says about 6 almost completely equal payments (first one is less than a dollar difference between the other 5), but I don’t want to go through the hassle of switching only to be surprised that they require a 25% dp too. 
Can anyone confirm Geico does 6 equal payments for 6 month auto policies in California?

Depends on risk and tier factors. Once reports are run (after you click pay), it will stay the same or change depending on those reports.

My GEICO quote provided options with 25% down or equal monthly.

Got it, thanks. They offered me the same things, but I was surprised because I thought no one in California could offer a truly 6 even-ish payment plan so I worried they were gonna let me bind, then say ‘just kidding’ and require another supplemental payment.
