A faturação eletrónica (e-Billing) elimina as faturas em papel e substitui-as por versões digitais, aumentando a eficiência dos negócios e dos sistemas tanto para o fornecedor como para o cliente. O pagamento da fatura é feito eletronicamente no âmbito do processo de e-Billing. A faturação eletrónica reduz custos, simplifica os fluxos de trabalho e melhora o fluxo de caixa. 
## O que é faturamento eletrônico (e-Billing)? 
A faturação eletrónica (e-Billing) é um método de envio e pagamento de faturas eletronicamente, em vez de através de faturas em papel. A faturação eletrónica facilita o recebimento de faturas online pelos clientes, num portal do fornecedor, por e-mail ou em formatos de dados legíveis por máquina.
A faturação eletrónica permite que clientes e empresas enviem faturas e pagamentos uns aos outros digitalmente, proporcionando uma visão clara para cada parte. 
O processo de faturamento eletrônico é rápido, eficiente e simplificado tanto para clientes quanto para fornecedores, razão pela qual o faturamento eletrônico é mais adequado para equipes modernas de contas a pagar.
Um portal de faturamento e pagamento eletrônico geralmente permite que o pagador acesse cópias de suas faturas eletrônicas e gerencie ou atualize informações. O faturamento eletrônico é um componente fundamental das finanças modernas. Ele é utilizado pelos departamentos de [contas a pagar (AP) e contas a receber (AR)](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/accounts-payable-vs-accounts-receivable/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) para ajudar a automatizar fluxos de trabalho e reduzir a dependência de processos que envolvem muito papel.
### Autofaturação na Faturação Eletrônica
[A autofaturação](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/self-billing/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) é um tipo específico de faturamento eletrônico (e-Faturamento) em que o pagador gera a fatura ou o boleto em nome do fornecedor ou beneficiário. A autofaturação é, por vezes, utilizada para agilizar o processo de contas a pagar, pois reduz o tempo de espera do fornecedor para a emissão do boleto. 
Em certos casos, o pagador determina o valor a ser pago ao fornecedor; portanto, os fluxos de trabalho tradicionais de faturas e ordens de compra não se aplicam. [Pagamentos em marketplaces online](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/blog/online-marketplace-payments/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) , [royalties](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/blog/royalty-payments/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) e comissões de afiliados são exemplos de gastos não faturados. 
Nessas situações, a autofaturação é um componente fundamental do fluxo de trabalho de contas a pagar, garantindo a existência de um registro de auditoria adequado e facilitando a conciliação. A autofaturação é especialmente comum na Europa e em países onde os pagamentos precisam ser comprovados por uma fatura. Em determinadas situações em que o Imposto sobre Valor Agregado (IVA) é exigido, a autofaturação é vantajosa para os fornecedores, pois garante que o pagador esteja assumindo corretamente a responsabilidade pelo IVA correspondente.
## O que é uma fatura eletrônica?
Uma fatura eletrônica (e-bill) é uma fatura digital gerada pelo fornecedor em um software de contabilidade ou financeiro. Ela é enviada instantaneamente ao pagador em formato digital por e-mail ou por meio de um portal online para processamento eletrônico do pagamento em seu sistema.
## O que está incluído em uma fatura eletrônica?
E-bills typically look a lot like paper bills. In many cases, an electronic bill is merely a digital version of the physical bill, often presented in PDF format. E-bills generally contain all pertinent information that relates to the payment, such as date, amount, due date, and payment terms. In a fully electronic billing system, the e-bill will also contain a link or instructions to access a payment portal where the bill can be viewed and settled or paid.
## e-Bill Example 
The following invoice is a digital e-Bill example that includes a Pay invoice now button for the customer to use for sending an electronic payment. It’s not provided by the supplier as a paper document to request payment.
![An electronic invoice is shown on a computer screen.](https://tipalti.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/media_electronic-invoice-sample.png-768x621.webp)
## What is an Electronic Billing System?
An electronic billing system (e-Billing system) is integrated with the accounting software or ERP system, providing invoicing and accounts receivable functionality to quickly send digital invoices to customers via email, through a supplier portal, or another digital method instead of paper invoices requiring mailing. An electronic billing system includes electronic payment and notifications. 
## Understanding the Electronic Billing Process
The electronic billing process includes these steps:
  1. Creating a bill or invoice 
  2. Electronically sending the invoice to the customer
  3. Customer processing the invoice for approval and payment 
  4. Automatically notifying the supplier that the invoice was received
  5. Sending automatic payment reminder notifications to the customer
  6. Customer issuing electronic payment to the payee
  7. System-generated reports and information, including payment status and history


[Bill pay software programs](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/blog/bill-pay-software/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) automate the steps within the electronic billing process for the supplier and the customer. The paperless invoice captures integrated system pricing data for the items shipped to approved customers or services performed by the service provider. Bill delivery is electronic. An electronic remittance is sent to the payee once the invoice is processed and approved. The bill pay software includes electronic status notifications within a portal system or through email notification. 
## Standards for Electronic Billing and Coding 
Standard computer data formats for electronic billing include [EDI ](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/what-is-edi/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc)(electronic data interchange), XML (extensible markup language), or CSV (comma-separated values) to export files. [CDFI](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/cfdi-compliance/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) is another e-invoicing format that’s used in Mexico and some Latin American countries. 
In health care, [electronic billing and coding standards](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=pt&hl=pt-PT&client=srp&u=https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/hipaa/electronic/%23rule) using [EDI](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/edi-payments/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) (electronic data interchange) are used for HIPAA compliance, including e-Billing and electronic claims payments. 
The Nacha organization establishes and enforces [Nacha Operating Rules](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=pt&hl=pt-PT&client=srp&u=https://www.nacha.org/content/rules-enforcement) for bank-to-bank electronic ACH payments in the U.S. made through member financial institutions of the National Automated Clearing House network.
## Benefits & Drawbacks of e-Billing
E-Billing has benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are enormous, outweighing the drawbacks. 
### Benefits of e-Billing
The benefits of e-Billing include:
  * Efficiency and time savings for the payee and payer
  * Error reduction
  * Employees focus on less monotonous and more strategic activities
  * Invoice approval in time for early pay discounts
  * Faster accounts receivable collection
  * Provides a system of record (SOR) with system integration 


#### Efficiency, Time Savings, and Error Reduction
Electronic billing improves efficiency, while also reducing error rates. 
Historically, bills have been delivered through the mail by the seller. The process of data entry and invoice-generation, putting bills in envelopes, mailing those envelopes, and then waiting for them to be received is a very time-consuming and labor-intensive process. 
For the vendor, electronic billing reduces payment status follow-up time. A supplier portal in an AP automation system automatically generates payment status notifications. 
Electronic billing significantly reduces the customer’s accounts payable and payments processing time and improves the invoice 3-way matching and approval process. 
Customers have fewer lost documents and less follow-time with suppliers regarding past due bills due to paperwork issues. Errors and duplicate invoices are reduced when manual keying of supplier invoices isn’t required. 
#### Employees Focus on Less Monotonous and More Strategic Activities
While time-saving is a major benefit, the reduction of manual labor on monotonous tasks allows finance employees to focus their time on more strategic activities. The shift from paper-based to electronic bills also inherently creates better organization and results in fewer errors.
#### Invoice Approval in Time for Early Pay Discounts
When invoices are quickly included in the accounts payable system, customers can take more early payment discounts for cost savings. 
#### Faster Accounts Receivable Collection
Electronic billing speeds up accounts receivable collection time, improving cash flow. 
#### Provides a System of Record (SOR) with System Integration
Traditional billing and payment methods relied heavily on paper and checks. This process made organization a difficult task with no clear system of record (SOR). Modern finance and accounting applications allow for digital SORs to exist for both the payer and the payee. 
Billing and invoicing systems often integrate directly with payment platforms, banking systems, and ERP or accounting systems, furthering the ability to keep a clean, organized system of record.
### Drawbacks of e-Billing
Drawbacks of e-Billing include:
  * The possibility of security and data privacy issues
  * Not receiving all emailed e-Bills if filtered out as spam
  * The need to handle both e-Bills and paper invoices in the system


By using add-on AP automation software integrated with your accounting software or ERP system, you can mitigate most of these drawbacks of e-Billing. 
For example, an AP automation system enhances security, automatically handles electronic invoices, and uses built-in OCR technology to convert any paper invoices received to electronic invoices. Suppliers can upload their invoices through the customer’s supplier portal, which includes a repository of documents related to the supplier and transactions with the customer. 
## Who uses e-Billing?
E-billing adds efficiency to multiple business units, ranging from accounting to customer service. E-bills are generally created by the AR department, which acts as the payee, and are paid by the AP department of the payer. E-bills make it easy for accounting personnel to balance and reconcile the books and for customer service representatives to access electronic records and resolve issues.
## What is the Difference Between e-Billing and e-Invoicing?
E-Billing and e-Invoicing are related but not exactly the same.[ E-invoicing](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/e-invoicing/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) (electronic invoicing) is a type of e-Billing (electronic billing) with a narrower definition or use case. 
Whereas e-Billing encompasses the entire process of generating the bill and then submitting and receiving the payment, e-Invoicing is generally a function of the[ AP workflow](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/accounts-payable-workflow/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc). The[ AP department](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/structuring-your-accounts-payable-department/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc), which is responsible for approving and[ processing supplier payments](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/supplier-payments-process/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc), uses e-Invoicing to electronically process invoices and submit them to the system of record (generally a bookkeeping or financial solution such as an[ ERP or accounting software](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/erp-integrations/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc)).
## Electronic Billing in the Context of AP Automation
Electronic billing (e-Billing) existed long before the term [“accounts payable (AP) automation”](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/ap-automation/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) was coined. 
Electronic bills and payments exist within almost all automated AP workflows and help to streamline the[ invoice-to-pay process](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/invoice-to-pay/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) because the necessary documents are already digitized. Technology such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition)[ invoice processing](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/resources/learn/automated-invoice-processing/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) allows the[ AP automation](https://tipalti-com.translate.goog/ap-automation/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt-PT&_x_tr_pto=tc) platform to digitize, process, and pay paper-based bills as well as electronic bills.
With electronic billing and OCR digitization of paper bills, invoices are accessible to both the supplier and customer through an online supplier portal provided by payables and global mass payments automation software. 
## Electronic Billing Takeaway
Electronic billing (e-Billing) has replaced paper billing to make the process more efficient for both the supplier and the customer. The result is fewer labor hours for invoice processing and a shift to more strategic work with a higher payoff. Paper and printer use is eliminated, contributing to the environmental goal within ESG and saving money. 
A faturação eletrónica resulta em poupanças de custos tanto para o pagador como para o beneficiário. Melhora o fluxo de caixa e acelera o tempo de cobrança das contas a receber. Os clientes processam e pagam as faturas a tempo e podem usufruir de mais descontos por pagamento antecipado. Isto melhora as relações com os fornecedores. 
Os benefícios da faturação eletrónica são otimizados quando utilizada com um sistema complementar de automação de contas a pagar e pagamentos, integrado com o software ERP ou de contabilidade.
