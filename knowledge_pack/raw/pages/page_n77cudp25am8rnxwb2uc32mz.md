#  Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Claims in New York: What Victims Need to Know
[](https://alanripka.com/what-to-do-immediately-after-a-rideshare-accident-in-new-york/) [](https://alanripka.com/category/news/) [](https://alanripka.com/understanding-motorcycle-accident-claims-in-new-york-key-legal-differences/)

![Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Claims in New York: What Victims Need to Know](https://alanripka.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Uninsured-and-Underinsured-Motorist-Claims-in-New-York-What-Victims-Need-to-Know-.jpeg)
## **Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Claims in New York: What Victims Need to Know**
Car accidents are stressful enough—but when the at-fault driver has little or no insurance, victims often face added uncertainty and frustration. Fortunately, New York law provides important protections for injured individuals through **uninsured motorist (UM)** and **underinsured motorist (UIM)** coverage. If you’ve been hit by a driver without sufficient insurance, here’s what you need to know.
### **What Are Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Claims?**
  * **Uninsured Motorist (UM)** coverage kicks in when the at-fault driver has **no insurance** at all.
  * **Underinsured Motorist (UIM)** coverage applies when the at-fault driver’s insurance policy is **insufficient** to cover your injuries and losses.


In New York, UM coverage is required as part of your auto insurance policy, while UIM is optional but highly recommended.
### **Step 1: Seek Immediate Medical Attention**
As with any accident, your health comes first. Get medical attention as soon as possible, and keep detailed records of your treatment and expenses.
### **Step 2: Report the Accident**
File a police report and notify your insurance provider. Be sure to specify if the other driver lacked insurance or had minimal coverage. This report helps support your claim.
### **Step 3: Review Your Insurance Policy**
Carefully check your policy for the limits and terms of your UM/UIM coverage. These provisions determine how much compensation you may be entitled to and under what circumstances.
### **Step 4: File a UM or UIM Claim with Your Insurer**
You can file a claim directly with your own insurance provider under the UM or UIM coverage. The process is similar to a standard injury claim and may include:
  * Providing medical records
  * Submitting evidence of the accident
  * Proof of the other driver’s insurance status


At Alan Ripka & Associates, we assist clients in preparing and negotiating these claims to maximize their payouts.
### **Step 5: Be Prepared for Pushback**
Insurance companies—even your own—may attempt to minimize or delay your claim. Having legal representation ensures that:
  * Your documentation is strong and timely
  * You understand the full value of your claim
  * You avoid common pitfalls that reduce compensation


### **What Damages Can You Recover Under UM/UIM?**
You may be entitled to compensation for:
  * Medical bills
  * Lost income
  * Future medical care
  * Pain and suffering
  * Disability or disfigurement


In severe cases, a **Supplementary Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (SUM)** claim may be needed to pursue the full value of your losses.
### **Understand the Legal Time Limits**
New York’s statute of limitations for personal injury claims is typically **three years**. However, insurance claims under UM/UIM provisions often have **shorter time limits** set by the policy. Review your contract and act promptly.
### **When to Hire an Attorney**
UM/UIM claims involve technical insurance language and firm deadlines. A New York personal injury attorney can:
  * Analyze your insurance policy
  * Handle insurer negotiations
  * Prove liability and damages
  * Take legal action if the insurer acts in bad faith


### **Related Legal Services**

  * How to File a Personal Injury Claim After a Slip and Fall in New York


## **Conclusion**
Getting hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver in New York doesn’t mean you have to bear the burden alone. With proper legal support and strategic filing of a UM or UIM claim, you can still recover the compensation you need to move forward.
