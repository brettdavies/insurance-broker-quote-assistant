[Renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-renters-insurance-companies/)
While [renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-renters-insurance/) is not legally mandated in any state, a growing number of landlords require tenants take out a policy.
[CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) reviewed more than two dozen providers in California that offer renters insurance and chose [the best renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-renters-insurance-california/#_0HxiDx_px) for price, coverage, convenience and other categories. (Read [our methodology](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-renters-insurance-california/#-3m1E-r5VJB) for more on how we made our selections.)
##  How much is renters insurance in California?
The average renters insurance premium in California is $271 per year or $23 per month, according to [Insurify](https://www.insure.com/renters-insurance/average-renters-insurance-cost-in-california/). That’s for a coverage limit of $40,000 for personal property coverage, $300,000 in liability coverage with a $1,000 deductible.
The best way to lower costs is to shop around. Get several quotes for the same amount of coverage and deductible. Most of our top picks offer online quotes in just minutes.
Another easy way to save [is to bundle your renters policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) with a car, life or pet insurance policy from the same provider. Depending on the carrier, bundling can save you 20% or more.

##  What is renters insurance?
[Renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/is-renters-insurance-worth-it/) is a coverage designed for those who rent their homes. While your landlord has insurance on the building you’re living in, their policy typically doesn’t cover your belongings. That’s where renters insurance can step in.
But renters insurance can also help in other ways, too. Here are the three main things that it covers:
  * **Your belongings:** Your furniture and any items in your home that you own would be covered by renters insurance.
  * **Your liability:** If your pet bites someone or someone falls down your stairs and hurts themselves, you could be held liable for those damages. Renters insurance can cover legal fees and other damages in these situations.
  * **Additional living expenses:** If your rented home isn’t livable after an incident, this coverage can help you pay for another place to live while your home is being repaired or replaced.


##  What does renters insurance cover in California?
Renters insurance in California covers your personal property, your liability for damages to others and additional living expenses should you need to relocate while your home is being repaired.
Renters insurance protects you from losses caused by fire, theft and vandalism, but doesn’t help with damage due to neglect or normal wear and tear. In addition, flooding from outside your home and earthquakes are typically not covered. (You’ll need to either add riders to your policy or get separate earthquake and [flood insurance policies](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/).)
Many compannies also limit how much they’ll reimburse for electronics, precious metals, cash, collectibles and other valuable items. Renters insurance plans typically limit coverage for jewelry to $2,000, for example, but you can pay to increase coverage or get a standalone [jewelry insurance policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-jewelry-insurance/).
## Renters insurance FAQs
### Is renters insurance worth it?
Yes, renters insurance [is usually worth it](https://www.cnbc.com/select/is-renters-insurance-worth-it/), whether you’re required to have it by your landlord or not. It protects your belongings in the event of an accident, theft, fire or other convered event and premiums are usually less than $20 a month.
