Bundling can make a difference. I saved around $600 a year sticking with [one carrier](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+one+carrier&cId=d5fa58aa-7be3-4296-91dd-2d8bb9849217&iId=29cf431d-96e0-4a4f-9be8-f8ead8cd806a) + it’s just less paperwork and hassle.

always go to an independent broker who can comparison shop 50+ places. Bundles do save money, but sometimes it is even cheaper to find 2 different companies, one who can be the lowest for home, and one who is lowest for auto.

Yep. I wanted to cross reference my rates. 
I could have found an auto policy that would have been $600/ann less than my auto policy in my bundle; but I would have lost the bundle discount which saved me $3k/ann on my home insurance so I kept the bundle

Bundling is one of those overhyped [marketing tricks](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+bundling+marketing+tricks&cId=56419f08-7443-40ee-a28d-abff84423559&iId=fd3f4e66-ca9e-4dd6-a2a1-8ef63e85a82f). Yeah, sometimes you’ll shave off $300-$500 a year. Other times it’s pennies and you’re locked into one company’s bs. Last year, i had a better deal checking bundling through insurify but previously it was pennies or nothing! Don’t assume bundling = magic savings, it’s case by case.

I have tried bundling car and home insurance so many times, and it never makes sense. It’s always way more expensive for one or the other than what I currently have.

I bundled my auto and tenants insurance. Before I had the apartment, I was paying $167 for just auto. With tenants insurance added on, it worked out to $187 for both. Not sure how much it would be individually, though I strongly suspect tenants insurance would work out to more than $20/month

On my side, bundling home + auto saved about $450 annually, which beat every standalone combo I compared. I used Insurify to compare and the numbers made sense.The kicker? Way fewer renewal headaches. Bundling isn’t always hype, sometimes it really does crush separate policies.

It only recently has worked out. The bundle and save idea seems to lose money over finding cheaper individual options. I switch carriers every few years since loyalty seems to be punished, I get a bunch of quotes and almost always end up with separate policies. For whatever reason I was able to bundle when I moved most recently.

I tried getting home insurance with my current car insurance company but State Farm was outrageously expensive. I wanted to stick with SF because they honestly took care of me in the past but I’m not spending $1000 more to stick with them. So I kept my car insurance with them and did home insurance with Progressive.

Knocked off about $250 a year for me, which felt decent given I was starting from scratch. The bigger win was convenience: one login, one bill, less headache while juggling everything else.

This is really dependent on your location. In NJ, I bundled home, auto and umbrella with NJM and saved nearly $1000 when you included their annual dividend.
