USAA offers a 22% discount, but it’s limited to military families. Allstate and State Farm both offer 20% off, but Allstate’s applies to drivers under 25, while State Farm’s discount focuses more on full-time students living 100+ miles from home.
Nationwide’s discount hinges on the student not using the insured vehicle, which might work better for those who’ve left their car behind. On the lower end, Progressive and [Travelers auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/travelers/) offer just 10%, and they require the student not to use the car at school. If your student rarely drives while at college, Liberty Mutual or American Family could deliver the biggest savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How does a good student discount work on a car insurance policy?
A good student discount lowers your car insurance premium when you provide proof of qualifying grades. The insurer applies the discount—up to 35%—to certain coverages, reducing your total bill. This reward encourages responsibility in both school and driving.
### What are the good student discount requirements?
Most companies require students to be under 25, enrolled full-time in high school or college, and maintain at least a B average (3.0 GPA) or qualify through standardized test scores like the SAT or ACT. Allstate is more flexible, accepting students with a 2.7 GPA or higher. Proof, such as a transcript or report card, is required at renewal to keep the discount active.
### What are the six car insurance discounts students should ask about?
Students should ask about the good student discount (up to 35%), defensive driving discount (up to 30%), usage-based program savings (up to 40%), student away at school discount (up to 20%), and low-mileage discounts (up to 40%), all of which can help you find the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/cheap/) for college students and high school teens.
### How does auto insurance work for college students away from home?
Many insurers offer a “student away at school” discount on car insurance for college students away from home who don’t regularly drive or keep a car at their parents’ address. This can lower premiums since the student is only driving occasionally.
### Why is auto insurance for college students so expensive?
Car insurance for college students is expensive because younger drivers, especially those under 25, are statistically more likely to be involved in accidents. Insurers also factor in limited driving experience, making premiums higher even if the student has a clean record.
### Which auto insurance is best for students?
State Farm, Allstate, and American Family consistently rank as the best auto insurance for students because they combine affordable rates with strong good student discounts up to 35%.
### Is there auto insurance for international students studying in the U.S.?
Yes, international students can get car insurance, but they may pay higher rates until they build a U.S. driving record. Companies like State Farm, Progressive, and Geico offer policies to international drivers with a valid license or international driving permit, but good student discounts still apply if academic eligibility is met.

### What is the cheapest insurance company for students?
Based on discounts and rates, State Farm is often the cheapest for good student auto insurance discounts, followed by American Family and Progressive. State Farm’s full coverage rates drop significantly after applying the good student discount, making it the top pick for affordable coverage. [Enter your ZIP code](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/best-good-student-auto-insurance-discounts/#mdabottom) to find the cheapest company near you.
### What types of insurance do college students need?
Besides auto insurance, college students may need renters insurance to protect personal belongings in dorms or apartments, health insurance through their school or parents, and sometimes liability insurance if they participate in internships or drive for delivery services.
### What should college student car insurance cover?
College students typically need liability coverage to meet state minimums, but adding collision and [comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) coverage is smart if they own a newer car. Many also benefit from roadside assistance, rental reimbursement, and usage-based programs to lower costs based on safe driving.
### How else can young drivers save money on student car insurance?
Young drivers can save by taking defensive driving courses (earning up to 30% off), enrolling in usage-based tracking apps, bundling auto with renters or home insurance, and maintaining a clean driving record to avoid rate increases. Some also save by increasing their deductibles to lower monthly costs.
### Can college students get discounts on car insurance?
Yes, college students can qualify for several discounts, including good student (up to 35%), driver training, bundling with renters or [homeowners insurance](https://www.quote.com/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained/ "Homeowners Insurance Coverage Explained \(What You Need to Know for 2025\)"), and usage-based programs like Drivewise or SmartRide, which track driving habits and reward safe behavior.
