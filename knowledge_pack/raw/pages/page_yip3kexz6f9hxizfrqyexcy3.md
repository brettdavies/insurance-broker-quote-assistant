At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

State Farm and Progressive are large insurance companies with policies available in all 50 states. State Farm is known for its competitive pricing and high J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings. Progressive stands out due to its robust coverage options, including loan payoff protection and pet injury coverage.
Both companies offer solid coverage, but depending on your priorities, one might be better for you. To determine the best option for you, [**compare rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), customer service reviews, and discount options. Your age, driving record, location, and chosen coverage levels can also help determine which insurer is better for your unique situation.
Here’s how Progressive and State Farm compare.
Quick Facts
  * State Farm’s rates are lower than Progressive’s for every type of driver, including for seniors and teenagers.
  * Progressive stands out with add-on coverage options that State Farm doesn’t have.
  * State Farm and Progressive both offer optional telematics programs that track your driving, allowing you to earn discounts for safe behavior.


## Progressive vs. State Farm: The verdict
State Farm earns a higher Insurify Quality (IQ) Score and offers lower average rates, making it an excellent pick for budget-conscious drivers with high standards. Drivers can also expect top-notch customer service since the company regularly ranks above average for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s auto insurance studies.
Progressive, on the other hand, has more coverage options. Drivers can get pet injury protection and loan/lease payoff coverage, which aren’t available from State Farm.
Progressive’s average rates are higher than State Farm’s, but the company offers a few more discounts, which could help you lower the costs of a Progressive auto insurance policy. And some drivers might consider access to more add-ons worth slightly higher rates.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

They started out as a good option but get more expensive every year. No wrecks, tickets, etc., and it still goes up. Plus, we don't drive a lot. When we added an older pickup, my insurance more than doubled. Not happy with them.

Why we picked this company
State Farm is the largest U.S. auto insurer by market share and has operated for more than 100 years. Available in all 50 states, State Farm stands out for its customer service, extensive discounts, and optional coverages. The insurer ranked fifth for overall customer satisfaction in the 2023 J.D. Power U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study. Safe drivers can enjoy many State Farm discounts, including ones for young motorists who complete an approved driver training course, for having a vehicle with certain safety equipment, and for going three years or longer without violations or at-fault accidents.
Pros
  * High rates of customer satisfaction
  * Rideshare insurance available
  * Savings for bundling auto with home, renters, condo, or life insurance


Cons
  * No gap insurance offering
  * May not be the cheapest choice for drivers with violations
  * Accident forgiveness limited to longtime customers with clean driving records


## Progressive Snapshot vs. State Farm Drive Safe & Save
Progressive and State Farm have optional [**telematics programs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) that allow drivers to opt in to tracking through a mobile app. Drivers can earn discounts for safe driving decisions, like following the speed limit, staying off phones, and obeying traffic signs.
With State Farm’s [**Drive Safe & Save**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) program, you can reduce your car insurance rate by up to 30% — a significant savings. You can enroll in two ways: Download the Drive Safe & Save app or register an eligible vehicle in Connected Car. Your choices on the road determine how much you can save, and State Farm calculates deductions each time your policy renews (typically every six months).
Progressive’s Snapshot program is similar. Policyholders can participate in the program with the mobile app or a plug-in device. Most drivers save around $231 per year with Snapshot, but your actual rate deduction depends on your driving patterns and the amount you drive. You also earn a discount when you sign up.
Good to Know
Both companies’ apps or devices track your driving, including unsafe driving patterns. Reckless driving, like speeding and texting, can increase your rate.
## Progressive vs. State Farm: Which is the cheapest?
State Farm has the lower average rates of the two, according to Insurify data. But other factors also affect how much you’ll pay, including your ZIP code, credit history, driving record, and age.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/progressive-vs-state-farm/#cite-1)
Here’s how State Farm and Progressive rates compare for different driver categories.
### State Farm: Cheapest for drivers with a clean driving record

### State Farm: Cheapest for drivers with a speeding ticket

Disclaimer: Table data sourced from real-time quotes from Insurify's 500+ partner insurance providers. Actual quotes may vary based on the policy buyer's unique driver profile.
### State Farm: Cheapest for teen drivers
Due to inexperience and reckless driving, teen drivers typically pay a higher rate.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/progressive-vs-state-farm/#cite-2) Because of that, it can be even more essential to find competitive rates. State Farm offers lower average rates for young drivers — nearly half the price of Progressive.
**Driver Type** | **Progressive** | **State Farm**  
---|---|---  
18-year-old | $192 | $114

## Compare coverages: Progressive vs. State Farm
Progressive and State Farm offer many car insurance options, including liability insurance, personal injury protection, uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, medical payments, collision, and comprehensive. Both insurers also have optional coverage for roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, and rideshare coverage.
The primary difference between the companies is that Progressive offers lease/loan payoff coverage, while State Farm doesn’t. This coverage is similar to gap insurance, which helps cover the difference between what you owe and what your car is worth if it’s totaled. Progressive customers can also access pet injury protection, a unique perk for pet owners.
Here’s how the optional coverage selections for State Farm and Progressive compare.
