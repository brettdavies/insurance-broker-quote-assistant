State Farm is one of the largest auto insurers in the U.S. With almost a century of experience in the insurance market, State Farm has marketed its company around the jingle, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.”
[![State Farm Car Insurance Guide](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.insurantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/State-Farm-Car-Insurance-Guide.png)
But if you are hesitant to trust a company just on its advertising, our review goes into much more than just State Farm’s commercials and promises.
To decide if a company is right for you, you need to know about their customer satisfaction ratings, premium costs, coverages, and much more. After all, it is your hard-earned dollar going to a company, and you need to be able to trust they will come through for you in an accident.
So keep reading to learn everything you need to know about State Farm as a company.

## Rating Agency
You can never just go off a company’s promises. Instead, it’s important to look at what trusted sites say about State Farm — does State Farm’s promises match its service?
Stick with us as we go through both financial and customer satisfaction ratings. Doing so will provide a complete picture of State Farm, so you can decide if State Farm sounds like the right company for you.
Let’s begin.
What is [A.M. Best](https://web.ambest.com/home)? On its website, A.M. Best describes its ratings as “recognized indicator[s] of insurer financial strength and creditworthiness.”
Ratings are on a letter scale, from [A++ to D](https://www.ambest.com/ratings/guide.pdf). So what rating does State Farm has?
> State Farm has an A++ rating, which is the highest rating possible.
This rating is fantastic. It means A.M. Best believes State Farm has a superior ability to fulfill its financial obligations. Since A.M. Best is an independent reviewer (like all the reviewers we are going to go through), this rating is unbiased and based purely on State Farm’s finances.
The [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/) (BBB) is a private organization that rates insurers on a [number of factors](https://www.bbb.org/overview-of-bbb-ratings). These rating factors focus on ethical business practices within a company:
  * Complaint history with BBB
  * Business type
  * Time company has been in business
  * Transparency of business practices
  * Failure or success in honoring commitments with BBB
  * Licensing and government actions
  * Advertising issues


Companies are rated on a 100 point scale. However, BBB rates companies on a state or local level, which means that there isn’t an overall, nationwide score.
State Farm did earn good ratings in most states, though.
For example, State Farm has an A+ grade in Wisconsin. If you want to see the exact score for State Farm in your local area or state, visit the [BBB website](https://www.bbb.org/).
[Moody’s](https://www.moodys.com/) is a well-known corporation that rates companies’ creditworthiness. The rating scale goes from [Aaa (highest) to C (lowest)](https://www.moodys.com/researchandratings/research-type/regulatory/rating-symbols-and-definitions/003011001003/003011001003/-/0/0/-/0/-/-/-/-1/-/-/-/en/global/pdf/-/rra).
> State Farm has an Aa1 rating from Moody’s.
What does this rating signify?
It means Moody’s believes State Farm has a stable future because State Farm has little credit risk.
[Standard and Poor (S&P](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/)) is another credit rating corporation that has been around for over a century. The corporation’s ratings are on [a letter scale](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/about/intro-to-credit-ratings), with AAA being the highest score possible.
So what did State Farm earn?
> S&P gave State Farm an AA rating, which is the second-highest rating.
An AA rating means State Farm is highly capable of fulfilling its financial commitments, such as paying claims.
It doesn’t matter how financially strong a company is if customers aren’t satisfied. A company that has multiple complaints and problems with customer service will start losing customers to other companies.
To see if State Farm actually acts like a good neighbor, we want to start our customer service analysis with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ [(NAIC)](https://content.naic.org/) data.

State Farm’s complaint index was high in 2016. You may be wondering why over 9,000 complaints only resulted in a complaint index of 2.16. Because State Farm is one of the largest insurers in the U.S., 9,000 customers are only a small percentage of State Farm’s total customers.
All this to say, 2.16 percent isn’t high. As well, in 2017 and 2018, State Farm’s complaint index was below the national average.
So while the number of complaints may seem high, the complaint index puts the number into proportion.
Let’s continue diving into customer satisfaction ratings by looking at J.D. Power’s ratings. [J.D. Power surveyed](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2019-us-auto-insurance-study) over 42,000 customers in 2019 to rate companies’ customer satisfaction.
The companies were rated on a 1,000 point scale and assigned a power circle rating.
  * Five Power Circles: “Among the best”
  * Four Power Circles: “Better than most”
  * Three Power Circles: “About average”
  * Two Power Circles: “The rest”


So let’s take a look at what State Farm rated in multiple U.S. regions.
U.S. Region | Customer Satisfaction  
(out of 1,000) | J.D. Power Circle Ranking  
---|---|---  
California | 824 | Better than most  
Central | 828 | About average  
Florida | 834 | About average  
Mid-Atlantic | 834 | About average  
New England | 844 | Better than most  
New York | 845 | Better than most  
North Central | 841 | Better than most  
Northwest | 820 | About average  
Southeast | 853 | Better than most  
Southwest | 831 | Among the best  
Texas | 835 | About average

State Farm has some great ratings. It earned “better than most” in five regions, and “among the best” in the Southwest region. While the rest of the regions rated State Farm as “about average,” State Farm never had less than three power circles.
Not bad at all! State Farm has done fairly well in J.D. Power’s survey study.
Another independent corporation that rates customer satisfaction, Consumer Reports grades customer’s satisfaction on a 100 point scale.
> State Farm has a score of 89 out of 100.
This score is decent. Let’s look at the rating broken down.
Claims Handling | Score/Rating  
---|---  
Reader Score | 89 out of 100  
Ease of reaching an agent | Excellent  
Agent courtesy | Excellent  
Being kept informed of claim status | Excellent

_Excellent_ is the highest category grade possible, while _very good_ is second. State Farm earned three _excellent_ ratings out of the eight categories.
While we’d like to see some more _excellent_ ratings in the mix, State Farm has a solid score from Consumer Reports.
The last customer satisfaction rating we want to look at is from Consumer Affairs.
> State Farm has four out of five stars in 2019, based on over 2,700 reviews in the last year.
This is an excellent rating. Companies on Consumer Affairs tend to have poor ratings, as Consumer Affairs is an ideal platform to submit complaints. However, State Farm has four stars, which tells us State Farm’s service is better than most.

After all, the last thing you need is to sign up with an insurer that goes bankrupt.

Additionally, State Farm has solid financial ratings from multiple financial gurus. The great ratings don’t stop at finances, either. State Farm also has respectable ratings from customer satisfaction surveys.

So how does State Farm convince people to visit an agent or check out State Farm’s website? One word — commercials.
With so many ads clamoring for our attention, State Farm needs to make its commercials interesting. If they don’t grab viewers’ attention, State Farm will have trouble attracting new customers.

State Farm tends to be one of the cheaper companies. In Connecticut, State Farm is actually the cheapest provider, beating out USAA. However, in New Jersey, State Farm is the most expensive provider.
So make sure to check states’ rates when moving, as there are always exceptions.
State Farm does use gender to determine car insurance rates, except for in states where this practice is outlawed.
> California, Hawaii, Massachusetts,, Montana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and parts of Michigan have outlawed basing rates on gender.
Why does State Farm change rates between males and females? Well, most insurers look at demographic accident data to calculate rates. For instance, young teenagers are more prone to accidents and therefore are charged more.
The same is true of gender. Insurers believe males to be riskier drivers and generally, charge male drivers more than female drivers.
So let’s take a look at State Farm’s demographic rates for age and gender.
Marital Status, Gender,  
and Age | State Farm Average Premium  
---|---  
Married 60-year old female | $1,873.89  
Married 60-year old male | $1,873.89  
Married 35-year old female | $2,081.72  
Married 35-year old male | $2,081.72  
Single 25-year old female | $2,335.96  
Single 25-year old male | $2,554.56  
Single 17-year old female | $5,953.88  
Single 17-year old male | $7,324.34

State Farm doesn’t change rates based on gender for 60-year-olds and 35-year-olds. In the other age and gender categories, though, State Farm does charge male drivers more.
As well, you can see that older drivers pay significantly less for car insurance than young drivers.
When you shop for a new car, you probably don’t stop to consider how much your insurance premium may go up.
According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), insurers look at the type of car you have to determine prices.
> “Insurers not only look at how safe a particular vehicle is to drive and how well it protects occupants, but also how much potential damage it can inflict on another car. If a specific vehicle model has a higher chance of inflicting damage when in an accident, an insurer may charge more for liability insurance.”
If a car rates well in safety and doesn’t cost a ton to repair, that car will cost less to insure.
So let’s take a look at how much State Farm’s rates vary based on vehicle models.
Make and Model | State Farm  
---|---  
2015 Ford F-150 | $3,204.23  
2015 Honda Civic Sedan | $3,024.24  
2015 Toyota RAV4  
XLE | $3,226.02  
2018 Ford F-150 | $3,497.17  
2018 Honda Civic Sedan | $3,189.99  
2018 Toyota RAV4: XLE | $3,418.33  
Average | $3,260.00

There is only about a $200 difference between the most and least expensive models of car. This is fairly low, so State Farm shouldn’t vastly increase its rates when you buy a new car.
State Farm is among the companies that increase rates on commute distance.
Commute | Average Premium  
---|---  
10 miles/  
6,000 annual mileage | $3,175.98  
25 miles/  
12,000 annual mileage | $3,344.01  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm charges an average of $169 extra for a longer commute. This is higher than the average at most companies, as generally, companies charge about $100 extra for longer commutes.
In the unfortunate event of an accident, high coverage protects drivers the best. Some companies charge such high premiums, though, that drivers stick to low or medium coverage.
Coverage Type | State Farm Average Premium  
---|---  
High | $3,454.80  
Medium | $3,269.80  
Low | $3,055.40  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm’s rate increase from low to high coverage is economical, costing about $400. This isn’t bad. Usually, an upgrade from low to high coverage costs about $1,000.
So if you choose State Farm, high coverage should be affordable.
A credit score has a huge impact on rates.
> The average credit score in the [U.S. is 675](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/consumer-credit-review/).
A credit score of 675 is generally considered a good credit score. So if you have a credit score that is lower than this, insurers may place you in the categories of a fair or a poor credit score.
However, how much insurers penalize drivers for fair or poor credit varies.
Credit History | State Farm Average Premium  
---|---  
Poor | $4,951.20  
Fair | $2,853.00  
Good | $2,174.26  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm’s rate from good to fair credit increases $679. This is fairly high, and it gets worse when the credit score drops to poor.
> State Farm customers who go from good to poor credit will end up paying an average of $2,777.
This is higher than most companies, where the rate increase is normally $1,000. However, make sure to look at the overall amount rather than just the rate increase.
State Farm may charge more of a penalty, but its rate could still be lower than other companies’ totals.
State Farm, like every other insurer, also penalizes drivers with poor driving records. So let’s take a look at how much State Farm charges on average for DUIs, accidents, and speeding tickets.
Driving Record | State Farm Average Premium  
---|---  
Clean Record | $2,821.18  
With One Speeding Violation | $3,186.01  
With One Accident | $3,396.01  
With One DUI | $3,636.80  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm’s penalties for driving record offenses are fairly low. A DUI, the worst offense, will cost drivers under $1,000. However, these rate increases are just for first offenses.
If drivers have a poor record with multiple accidents, DUIs, or speeding tickets, they will find their rates will shoot up. If this happens, some drivers may have to purchase high-risk insurance.
## Coverages Offered
We’ve covered prices, but what are you paying for? The types of coverages available are important. If you have a classic car or need extra liability insurance, you want to make sure an insurer offers the coverages you need before signing up.
While all insurers will cover the basic requirements, not all insurers offer a complete list of useful add on coverages.
So keep reading to see what coverages, [discounts](https://www.insurantly.com/discounts/ "discounts"), and programs State Farm offers.
Let’s take a look at what auto insurance coverages State Farm has.
  * Classic Car Coverage — Have a vintage car? Classic car insurance costs less, so check to see if your car qualifies as a classic at State Farm.
  * [Collision Coverage](https://www.insurantly.com/coverage/collision/ "Collision Coverage") — This coverage protects you in accidents with another vehicle.
  * Comprehensive Coverage — Live in an area prone to theft or hurricanes? Comprehensive coverage protects you in collisions that aren’t with another vehicle (such as an animal collision), and it also covers natural disasters and theft/vandalism.
  * Liability Coverage — Required in every state, liability coverage steps in if you cause an accident that injures another person or results in property damage.
  * Uninsured Motorist Coverage — If the driver who causes the accident is uninsured and can’t pay your medical or property damage bills, uninsured motorist coverage will help.
  * Underinsured Motorist Coverage — Likewise, if a driver has poor insurance and can’t completely pay your costs, this coverage will protect you.
  * [Medical Payments Coverage](https://www.insurantly.com/coverage/medical-payments-coverage/ "Medical Payments Coverage") — Medpay will help if you have medical treatment bills after an accident.
  * Rideshare Driver Coverage — Driving for a rideshare company (like Uber) requires rideshare insurance. Rideshare insurance is in addition to your personal insurance.


State Farm has s decent array of coverage options. While it doesn’t have Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage, PIP is similar to medical payments coverage.
There are multiple factors that can bring down rates. While a clean driving record is one way to reduce costs, bundling an auto policy with a home or life insurance policy can also reduce prices.
Since State Farm offers the following types of insurance, it is easy to bundle policies.
  * Home and Property
  * Life
  * Health
  * Disability
  * Small Business
  * Liability
  * Identity Restoration


Bundling will earn customers a discount. If you like the ease of having multiple policies at one provider, bundling is a great option.
While bundling is a great discount, it can only save you so much. Luckily, State Farm offers a variety of discounts.
Discount | Amount

Anti-lock Brakes | 5%

State Farm provides fewer discounts than its competitors (the highest number offered is 38). This may make it harder to save larger amounts, but luckily, State Farm’s rates are usually lower than average.
Still, a larger number of discounts would be nice.
State Farm has many useful programs for customers.
  * Accident Forgiveness — This program can save drivers a lot of money. If you’ve been accident-free for three years at State Farm, your rates won’t go up for your first at-fault accident.
  * Car Rental and Travel Expense — Car in the shop? State Farm will pay for a rental car in a claimable accident. If you’re in an accident more than 50 miles from your home residence, State Farm will also pay for lodging, meals, and transportation.
  * Emergency Road Coverage — If you purchase this coverage, State Farm will help you with multiple situations. For example, being locked out of your car or running out of gas.
  * Usage-Based App — State Farm has a Drive Safe & Save™ App that offers discounts for safe driving habits. It also has a Steer Clear® app for young drivers.


These programs are great to have in case of accidents or mishaps on the road.
Now that we’ve covered prices, coverages, and discounts, let’s take an overall look at State Farm.
  * What’s Missing — State Farm has fewer than average discounts. It is also lacking coverages like PIP.
  * What Stands Out — State Farm has a great collection of coverages and programs. The company also has lower-than-average rates in most states.


While State Farm lacks some discounts, generally it is still cost-effective.

## Canceling Your Policy
Ready to leave State Farm behind? Because some insurers can make it difficult to leave, we want to go through every aspect of canceling a policy at State Farm.
From fees to when you can cancel, we will cover it all in this section, so keep reading to learn how to break up with State Farm as a provider.
State Farm doesn’t mention cancellation fees on its website. However, sometimes insurers will charge a small fee if customers cancel in the middle of a policy period.
If customers cancel after the renewal cycle is up, though, there should be no fee.
So call and talk to your State Farm agent to ask if you’ll be charged a cancellation fee.
Yes, there should always be a refund if customers cancel before the end of a renewal cycle. For example, if you prepay for six months of coverage but cancel in month four, State Farm should refund you for the remaining two months.
Now that we’ve covered fees and refunds, let’s go through how to cancel a State Farm Policy.
We can’t stress this step enough. Before you even begin to prepare to cancel your State Farm policy, you need a new insurer beforehand. State Farm will ask during the cancellation process for your new insurer’s policy number.
Why?
Because if you cancel your State Farm policy and have a gap period until your new insurer kicks in, you’ll be heavily penalized. Driving without insurance is illegal, and insurers take notice of gaps in coverage.
So have a new policy that will be effective as soon as you cancel your State Farm policy.
If you are getting rid of State Farm because you no longer need car insurance (such as selling your vehicle), then you need proof that you no longer need it.
For example, you’ll need a bill of sale or proof you turned in your license plate.
We covered what you need to do beforehand, so let’s dive into the cancellation methods. One of the first ways you can cancel your policy is over the phone.
State Farm doesn’t have a main hotline to call to cancel. Instead, you’ll have to call your local agent to cancel. When you call, you’ll need the following information (you will need this information for every method of cancellation):
  * Social Security Number
  * State Farm Policy Number
  * Name/Policy Number of New Insurer (or Bill of Sale)


State Farm agents may try to convince you to stay by asking if there’s anything they can fix for you. For example, they may discuss adjustments that can change the price of your policy.
You can also cancel by mail. The letter will need to be mailed to the following corporate address.
Corporate Headquarters  
State Farm Insurance  
One State Farm Plaza  
Bloomington, IL 61710
This method takes longer than calling by phone, so make sure to send it in well before your intended cancellation date. In your dated and signed letter, you need to include the following:
  * Name, address, and phone number
  * State Farm policy number
  * Date of desired policy end
  * New insurer’s name, policy number, and policy start date
  * OR Bill of Sale


Be as thorough as possible. Since mail takes longer, you won’t know if you missed something until State Farm receives your letter.
The last method of cancellation is an in-person visit to a local agent. You will need to bring along the same information needed for canceling by phone or mail. This method may be more inconvenient, depending on how far away an agent is from you.
You can cancel at any time. However, if you cancel your State Farm policy halfway through a renewal cycle, then State Farm may charge you a small fee.
So how do you know if the cancellation was effective?
State Farm should notify you of successful cancellation. You can also call State Farm or check your online account.
## How to Make a Claim
Car insurance only exists to help drivers after accidents. If you find yourself in an accident and need to make a claim, you may be overwhelmed by where to start.
Not to worry.
We are going to cover how to make a claim at State Farm, as well as important claim information (State Farm’s written premiums and loss ratio).
Let’s get started.
Like most providers, State Farm has used technology to its advantage. While calling by phone is still an option, there are also ways to file online.
Below are the methods to file a claim at State Farm.
  * Online — Customers can file online at State Farm’s website.
  * Mobile App — State Farm’s mobile app allows customers to file on their smartphones.
  * Phone — Call 800-SF-CLAIM (800-732-5246).
  * In-Person — Customers can visit a local agent to file a claim.


If you choose the in-person option, you are restricted to agents’ working hours. All the other methods, though, are available 24/7.
So what do you need to file a claim?
  * Date, time, and location of the incident
  * Names of involved parties
  * Vehicles involved
  * Description of damages and injuries
  * Description of accident


If you can, take pictures of the damages as proof to submit to State Farm. This will help speed up the process.
State Farm is a large insurer, which means it will be writing out a ton of premiums every year. This is good, as generally, the more premiums a company writes the lower costs are.
This is because insurers have to pay out claims. If a company has few written premiums but a high number of claims, it will have to charge customers more to pay claims.
So let’s take a look at the NAIC’s data on State Farm’s written premiums.
Year  | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018  
---|---|---|---|---  
State Farm Written Premiums  | $35,588,209,000 | $39,194,660,000 | $41,817,416,000 | $41,963,578,000  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm has steadily increased its premiums over a four-year period. There was a huge increase from 2015 – 2017, which is impressive.
These increases show State Farm is well established in its position as one of the largest providers in the U.S.
State Farm’s loss ratio is important, too. It directly ties into State Farm’s written premiums.
> A loss ratio is calculated by comparing the amount paid in claims to the amount earned from written premiums. For example, a 65 percent loss ratio means a company is spending $65 on claims for every $100 earned in written premiums.
Based on this, it’s easy to see that a company with a loss ratio over 100 percent is at risk of going bankrupt. On the other hand, a company with a low loss ratio is clearly not paying out many claims.
Now that you know how important loss ratio is, let’s see what the NAIC has recorded for State Farm’s loss ratios.
Year  | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018  
---|---|---|---|---  
State Farm Loss Ratios | 66.1% | 77.02% | 68.79% | 63%  
Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.insurantly.com/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/#mdatop)
State Farm’s loss ratios have fallen and risen over the years. However, they have stayed in a respectable range (not too high or low). The dip and rise could be due to various factors, such as a rise in vehicle crashes.

## Design of Website and App
Have you ever given up on reading a webpage because it took too long to load or had too many popups? Or perhaps you’ve deleted an app because of technology glitches?
If so, you know the importance of well-designed websites and apps.
Keep reading to learn about State Farm’s website and app design.
State Farm’s homepage has a simple design. The white background helps the menu options stand out and the menu options are simple and straightforward.
![State Farm Main Page Quote Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201225%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Each of the menu options gives viewers subtopics that lead to more information about that topic.
For example, the snapshot below shows what appears when viewers select _insurance_. **![State_Farm_Insurance_Dropdown_Menu-medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201576%20744'%3E%3C/svg%3E)**
State Farm also has options on the upper right side of the screen to change the language to Spanish, search for an agent, and log in. Users can also click the _help_ or _search_ button if they are having trouble finding information.
As you can see, State Farm’s website is well designed. The well-organized menus and search button makes it easy to find information.
So if you pick State Farm as a provider, the website shouldn’t be a deterrent.
State Farm’s general app was created to allow customers to manage their accounts from their smartphones. [On Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/state-farm-pocket-agent/id318142137), the app has great ratings.
The app has a 4.8-star rating (out of five stars), which was calculated from over 84,00 ratings.
![State_Farm_App-medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20699%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
  * File and manage claims
  * Access ID cards
  * Get roadside assistance
  * Upload photos (of damages) and documents
  * Contact a State Farm agent


The app allows customers to do the same tasks they could do on a computer. Now that we’ve covered State Farm’s main app, let’s look at State Farm’s discount apps.
The Drive Safe & Save™ app also has [fantastic ratings](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drive-safe-save/id1043246998?amp%3Bmt=8&ls=1).
![State_Farm_App_Apple_Reviews-medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20860%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
The app has 4.5-stars, calculated from over 21,000 ratings. This is great, especially for a usage-based app.
Another discount app is State Farm’s Steer Clear® program. Drivers under age 25 can earn a discount for completing programs on the app, which is a great way to encourage young drivers to practice safe driving habits.
On Google Play, the app didn’t earn as a high of a rating as State Farm’s other apps. However, the app still did well.
Calculating the percentage from over 580 reviews, [Google Play gave](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.statefarm.sfsteerclear) 3.6 stars to the app.
**![State Farm Steer Clear App](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20752%20611'%3E%3C/svg%3E)**
Clearly, State Farm has done well in designing its apps, as all of them have earned solid reviews and ratings.

State Farm has a number of great pros, such as cheaper rates, great apps, and strong financial ratings. However, State Farm’s rates can become high if you move to a different state, and it doesn’t have high J.D. Power ratings in most regions.
Still, State Farm has a number of strong pros that help balance out the negatives.
## The Bottom Line
State Farm hasn’t dominated the insurance market just to go under in the near future. It has great financial ratings and solid customer reviews.
Its apps are among the best in the market, and State Farm offers multiple coverages and add-ons that are great for the lower price.
The company also has consistently grown over the last decade, which shows State Farm is still keeping up with the times and staying a major competitor in the insurance field.
So if you chose State Farm, you’ll be picking a well-known insurance giant with lower than average rates. Not bad at all.
## FAQ
Still unsure about a few things? Not to worry. We’ve compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions about State Farm to conclude this review.
Let’s jump in.
Some usage-based apps will add to premium costs for consistent bad driving habits. However, State Farm’s usage-based app doesn’t follow this practice.
The Drive Safe & Save™ app only subtracts from premiums, it doesn’t add on (although bad driving will not subtract anything from a premium). So if you want to save with the app, good driving is essential.
Unfortunately, State Farm will only cover damages from natural disasters like flooding if you have comprehensive coverage. This coverage will also protect you in cases of animal collisions and vehicle theft.
Yes, you can sign into State Farm’s website or mobile app to make payments. You can also set up an auto-pay option.
You will have to check with your provider to see if your policy covers this. State Farm does cover windshield repairs and replacements, but only if the customer’s coverage extends to this.
While you can always show your paper version from State Farm, you can also use an electronic version.
State Farm’s mobile app allows drivers to access an electronic version of their insurance ID, which can be used at traffic stops, after an accident, or while registering a vehicle.
We hope we’ve answered any questions you may have about State Farm. Now that you’ve read our review, you should be ready to decide if State Farm is the right provider for you.
