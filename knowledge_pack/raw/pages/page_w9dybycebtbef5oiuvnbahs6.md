**Why Erie made our list:** In 2024, Erie ranked as the official top car insurance company in the Mid-Atlantic region in J.D. Power’s U.S. Auto Insurance Study. Additionally, AM Best gives the company an A+ (Superior) rating for financial strength. Erie is a regional carrier that writes policies in 12 states and Washington, D.C. Drivers who value robust coverage may be interested in Erie as the carrier's standard full coverage policies include locksmith services, pet coverage and personal item coverage. The carrier also has a long list of potential discounts, but it does not offer a telematics program and its digital tools are fairly basic compared to many larger insurers.
**Who Erie may be good for:** If you're looking for great customer service and robust auto policies, but you don't care much for digital tool capability, Erie may be the best carrier for you.

## How to find the best car insurance in Washington, D.C.
Since auto insurance is highly personalized, the best car insurance in the D.C. region depends on factors unique to you. Fortunately, there are a few simple strategies you can use to help you find the ideal company for you at a price that fits your budget.
  * Number 1 Icon
###  Consider minimum insurance requirements in Washington, D.C.
Caret Down Icon
When reviewing options for Washington, D.C.'s best car insurance, the first step is often to become familiar with the [required minimum liability limits](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) and decide if they are enough to provide adequate coverage for you. Although some drivers may choose minimum coverage as a cost-saving measure, many insurance experts recommend purchasing higher coverage limits if your budget allows for it to ensure a broader level of financial protection for you and your vehicle.
The [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-insurance) found that the average U.S. bodily injury claim totaled $24,211 in 2022. Since car accidents may result in tens of thousands of dollars (or more) in damage, carrying minimum limits could increase your risk of a hefty out-of-pocket expense if you’re at fault and the damage exceeds the liability limits you have on your policy.
  * Number 2 Icon
###  Consider lender requirements
Caret Down Icon
If you are financing or leasing your vehicle, your lienholder will almost certainly require you to carry [comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-vs-collision/), otherwise known as full coverage. You will often also have a cap on your [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) amount for comprehensive and collision and may have to carry more [liability insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-car-insurance/) than the state’s minimum requirements. These rules are in place to protect the financing institution’s investment in the vehicle, which they technically own until you pay off the loan or buy out the lease.
  * Number 3 Icon
###  Consider your individual needs
Caret Down Icon
If you want the best car insurance in Washington, D.C., you may want to consider what optional coverage types (if any) you’d like to include on your auto policy. Although availability and eligibility may vary among companies, some popular coverage options include:
    * [**Gap insurance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/)**:** If your insurance company deems your vehicle a total loss as the result of a covered incident, gap insurance is intended to help pay off the balance of your loan if you owe more than what the vehicle is worth. This may occur as a result of an accident or non-recoverable theft.
    * [**Roadside assistance**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/roadside-assistance/)**:** If you break down and need a tow, lock yourself out of your car or need assistance changing a flat tire, emergency roadside assistance coverage may be able to help.
    * [**Rental reimbursement**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/does-insurance-cover-rental-cars/)**:** Rental reimbursement coverage may help pay or reimburse you for your rental car while your vehicle is repaired due to a covered claim.
    * [**New vehicle replacement**](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/new-car-replacement-insurance/)**:** This endorsement may be useful if you have a car that is fairly new. Normally your insurer will pay you the depreciated value of your car if it's totaled in an accident, but with this add-on, you would receive enough to purchase a new car of the same make and model.


New
What’s new in Washington, D.C.?
  * Washington, D.C. saw a [huge increase in the number of carjackings](https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/carjacking-rates-skyrocket-in-dc-how-drivers-can-save-as-insurance-rates-rise/) in 2023, with juveniles making up the bulk of offenders. The area currently ranks second in the nation for the number of thefts per 100,000 residents. [Current police data](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/when-and-where-could-you-get-carjacked-in-washington-dc-carjackings-omnibus-crime-bill-washington-national-insurance-bureau-police-metropolitan-department-juveniles-teens) show that Washington, D.C. is on pace with last year's high numbers of carjackings, which is a significant factor in why insurance rates have climbed in recent years. In order to receive an insurance payout after a car theft, drivers must have a full coverage policy.
  * [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/05/auto-insurance-claims-disasters/) did an extensive report on rising car insurance prices in September 2023. The report noted that even though other types of inflation have cooled, car insurance for U.S. drivers was 16 percent more expensive in July 2023 than in July 2022 and 70 percent more expensive than in 2013. It notes that motor vehicle maintenance costs are also on the rise since it is more expensive to diagnose newer, high-tech vehicles. In addition, insurers are hedging their bets against the increasing number of big payouts they are seeing in the wake of natural disasters, such as flooding or hurricanes.

## How much is car insurance in Washington, D.C.?
The [average annual cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/) of full coverage car insurance in the U.S. is $2,671, while [Washington, D.C. drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-dc/) pay an annual average of $2,873 for the same coverage. Minimum coverage is slightly more expensive, on average, in Washington, D.C. at $888 per year compared to the national average of $806 per year. The higher minimum coverage rate in Washington, D.C. may be attributed, in part, to the region's high population density, which could lead to higher rates of accidents, theft and vandalism.
Full coverage car insurance rates in Washington, D.C. are also higher than those in [some surrounding areas](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/). For instance, the average annual full coverage rate in [Maryland](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-maryland/) is $3,039. In [Virginia](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-virginia/), the price difference is much more dramatic with a yearly full coverage premium of $2,070. Washington, D.C. is unique in that it is essentially one large metropolitan area, so the entire region sees the higher average rates we typically associate with big cities in other states.

However, [several factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) go into determining an individual’s premium.

For this reason, experts recommend that you ask for quotes from several companies since you are likely to get a different rate from each.
  * ###  What is the best car insurance in Washington, D.C.?
Caret Down Icon
Depending on priorities, the best auto insurance in the DC region may vary from driver to driver. For example, if you value cheap coverage, the best company for you may differ from your neighbor, who is looking for the highest possible customer satisfaction.

  * ###  Is car insurance required in Washington, D.C.?

  * ######  Why is car insurance so expensive in Washington, D.C.?
Caret Down Icon
Although the average cost of Washington, D.C., car insurance is slightly above the national average, your own rate may be more or less. There are multiple reasons for this. The District is mainly urban, with crowded traffic patterns leading to accidents and a higher-than-average theft rate. These factors make insurers more likely to charge high rates to protect themselves from costly claims. Your own circumstances also play a role in your rate. If you have some marks on your driving record, such as a past DUI or, in some cases, even just a speeding ticket or two, you are likely to pay more for your coverage. Finally, D.C.'s high cost of living may translate into higher repair costs, which is another factor your insurer will consider when determining your rate.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from S&P and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
