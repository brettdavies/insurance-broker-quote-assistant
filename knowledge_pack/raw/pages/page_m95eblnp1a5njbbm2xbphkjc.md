The [State Farm](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/statefarm-13017237i) safe driver discount is up to 30%. State Farm policyholders can enroll in the [Drive Safe & Save](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/state-farm-safe-driver-discount-2140729090/) telematics program, which allows them to save 10% on sign up and up to 30% by simply engaging in a more healthy driving behavior. Keep in mind, however, that State Farm [discounts](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/state-farm-discounts/90977) can vary by state, so it's best to contact a local State Farm agent to discuss the discounts you're eligible for.
The company also offers a variety of discounts for policyholders that maintain a clean driving record, from their good driving discount, to their accident-free discount and even their steer clear discount.
