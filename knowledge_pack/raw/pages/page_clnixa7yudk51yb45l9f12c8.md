# Guide to Car Insurance for New York City Drivers
Driving in NYC comes with unique challenges, and having the right car insurance is not just smart – it’s the law. This guide explains everything New York City drivers need to know about car insurance in clear, everyday language. Our [car accident lawyers](https://orlowlaw.com/car-accidents/) cover New York’s minimum insurance requirements, the different types of coverage (like liability, no-fault, collision, comprehensive, and uninsured motorist), special rules for NYC, how to get and keep your coverage, the penalties for driving uninsured, what to do after a car accident, and more. By the end, you’ll understand your insurance responsibilities under New York law and how to stay protected on the road.
![Car Insurance Guide - Minimum Requirements](https://orlowlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/minimum-coverage-requirements-for-ny-car-insurance-1024x683.png)
To **register and drive a car in New York** , you **must** have certain minimum insurance coverage. New York State law mandates at least the following liability insurance limits for **private passenger vehicles** :
  * **[Bodily Injury](https://orlowlaw.com/what-is-the-difference-between-bodily-injury-and-personal-injury/) Liability:** $25,000 per person injured in an accident, and $50,000 total per accident if multiple people are injured (these limits double to $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident if someone is killed). This coverage pays for injuries or death to **others** if you cause a crash.
  * **Property Damage Liability:** $10,000 for damage to property of others per accident. This pays for damage you cause to someone else’s car or property (such as a fence or building).


These minimum liability limits are often written as **“25/50/10”** (for $25k/$50k/$10k). They are the **legal minimum** – you can choose higher limits for more protection.
New York is also a “[**no-fault**](https://orlowlaw.com/is-new-york-a-no-fault-state/)” state, so **Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** coverage is required. PIP (often called **no-fault insurance**) pays for **your own medical bills and lost wages** after an accident, **regardless of who was at fault**. In New York, you must carry at least **$50,000** in PIP coverage per person. This **pays for reasonable and necessary medical and rehabilitation expenses** , 80% of lost earnings (up to $2,000 per month for up to 3 years), and other reasonable costs (up to $25 per day) if you or your passengers are injured. It even includes a small death benefit of $2,000 on top of the medical coverage. PIP covers **you, your passengers, and any pedestrians** hit by your vehicle in New York. (Pedestrians are covered by the vehicle’s no-fault insurance in NY.) Importantly, because of New York’s no-fault law, people **generally cannot sue** over a car accident for pain and suffering unless they suffer a **“serious injury”** as defined by law. (We’ll explain the [serious injury](https://orlowlaw.com/what-is-a-serious-injury/) threshold later in this guide.)
New York also **requires Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage** for bodily injury. This protects you and your family if you are injured by a driver who has no insurance or in a hit-and-run accident. The **minimum UM coverage** limits are the same as the bodily injury liability minimums (25/50). UM coverage will pay for injuries to you, your passengers, or family members in your car if an uninsured (or hit-and-run) driver causes an accident. (Property damage by an uninsured driver is not covered by UM in NY – you would need collision coverage or other means to cover damage to your car, as explained below.)
**Summary of required coverage:** To legally drive in NY, your auto policy must include **liability insurance** (25/50/10 minimum), **PIP no-fault coverage** ($50k min), and **uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage** (25/50). These are **mandatory** under state law. You **cannot register a vehicle** in New York without this insurance in place.
Beyond the basic requirements, it’s important to understand the different **types of car insurance coverage** available in New York. Here’s a breakdown of key coverage types and what they mean for you:
### Liability Insurance (Bodily Injury and Property Damage)
**Liability insurance** pays for injuries to other people or damage to others’ property if **you are at fault** in an accident. In New York, liability coverage is **required by law** (minimum 25/50/10 as noted above). It has two parts:
  * **Bodily injury liability:** covers medical bills, lost wages, and related expenses for other people injured or killed if you cause an accident.
  * **Property damage liability:** covers repair or replacement costs for another person’s vehicle or other property you damage in an accident.


Liability insurance **protects other people from the harm you cause**. For example, if you run a red light and hit another car, your liability insurance will pay for the other driver’s injuries and car repairs (up to your policy’s limits). **It does not pay for your own injuries or damage to your car** – that’s where no-fault (PIP) and collision coverage come in.
New York’s liability insurance also includes coverage if you are sued. If another party in the accident has the right to sue (e.g. they suffered a serious injury), your liability insurer will typically **defend you in court and pay settlements or judgments** up to your coverage limits. However, under New York’s no-fault rules, minor injuries usually **cannot lead to lawsuits** ; the injured person’s PIP coverage handles those costs. Only if someone suffers a **“serious injury”** (like significant disfigurement, a fracture, loss of use of a body organ or limb, etc.) or incurs more than $50,000 in economic losses can they step outside no-fault and sue the at-fault driver for pain and suffering.
**Important:** Liability insurance in NY must remain in effect as long as a vehicle is registered – even if you’re not driving it. If you **cancel your insurance** and don’t simultaneously turn in your license plates, the [DMV](https://dmv.ny.gov/) will know (insurance companies notify DMV electronically) and your registration **will be suspended**. We’ll discuss insurance lapses and penalties later, but be aware you **cannot “pause” coverage** on a car (except for motorcycles – see special cases) without consequences.
_Tip:_ Consider buying liability limits higher than the state minimum. The minimum might not be enough if you cause a serious accident. Higher limits (like 50/100/50 or 100/300/50) give you more protection and are often recommended in a city like New York where medical and legal costs can be very high.
### Personal Injury Protection (No-Fault Insurance)
**Personal Injury Protection (PIP)** is New York’s **no-fault insurance**. This coverage pays for **your own** medical expenses, lost earnings, and certain other reasonable costs if you’re injured in a car accident – **no matter who caused the crash**. Every auto policy in NY must include at least **$50,000 of PIP coverage per person**.
What does PIP cover in practice? It will pay for **medical and hospital bills** , rehabilitation costs, and necessary expenses like physical therapy after a crash. It also covers a portion of your **lost wages** if your injuries keep you from working (typically 80% of lost earnings up to $2,000 per month for up to 3 years). Additionally, PIP can reimburse other reasonable accident-related expenses (up to $25 per day for up to one year), such as the cost of hiring help for household tasks you can’t do while injured, or transportation to medical appointments. If someone covered by your policy dies in a crash, PIP provides a **$2,000 death benefit** to their estate, on top of any medical payments.
Your PIP coverage extends to:
  * **You** , the policyholder (if you’re injured as a driver or passenger).
  * Any **passengers** in your car who are injured (they will claim under your PIP).
  * Any **pedestrian** hit by your car in New York (they can claim PIP benefits from your policy).
  * **Family members in your household** who don’t have their own auto policy, if they are injured as passengers or pedestrians.


Because PIP pays out regardless of fault, most smaller accidents are handled through PIP. In exchange, New York law places limits on lawsuits: an injured person can only sue the at-fault driver for [non-economic damages](https://orlowlaw.com/what-are-non-economic-damages-in-a-personal-injury-case/) (pain and suffering) if they meet the **“[serious injury](https://orlowlaw.com/what-is-a-serious-injury/)” threshold** under the law. “Serious injury” in New York includes things like death, dismemberment, significant disfigurement, a bone fracture, loss of a fetus, permanent loss or limitation of a body organ or function, or any injury that keeps someone from their usual daily activities for 90 out of the 180 days following the accident. If an injury meets this threshold, the injured party can pursue a liability claim or lawsuit against the at-fault driver; if not, they are limited to no-fault benefits.
**Key point:** After any accident,  _notify your insurance company quickly_ to file your no-fault (PIP) claim. New York insurance regulations require that you submit a written claim (no-fault application) **within 30 days of the accident** in order to receive PIP benefits (unless you have a reasonable excuse for delay). Don’t delay in contacting your insurer after a crash, even if injuries seem minor.
New York insurers also offer options to increase your PIP coverage. For example, you can purchase **Additional PIP** to raise the limit above $50,000, or add **Optional Basic Economic Loss (OBEL)** coverage which provides an extra $25,000 that an injured person can direct specifically to certain expenses (like extra wage loss or rehab) once the basic $50k is used. These options can provide a bigger safety net, especially for [serious injuries](https://orlowlaw.com/what-is-a-serious-injury/), but they are optional. Your basic $50k PIP is standard on every policy.
Remember, PIP is there to cover **you and your passengers’ injuries** , but it **does not cover damage to vehicles** or other property. It also won’t compensate for pain and suffering – it’s purely for economic losses like medical bills and lost income. And note that **motorcyclists are excluded from no-fault coverage** in NY (motorcycles have special insurance rules discussed later).
### Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
New York requires **Uninsured Motorist (UM)** coverage as part of every auto policy. This coverage protects **you** if you are injured by a driver who doesn’t have liability insurance or by a hit-and-run driver. Basic uninsured motorist coverage in NY applies to **accidents that happen in New York State** and covers bodily injuries to you, your passengers, and relatives in your household, up to the minimum liability limits (25/50). For example, if you are hit by a car that flees the scene (hit-and-run) or by someone who carried no insurance, your own policy’s UM coverage can pay for your medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering, just as if that at-fault driver had insurance (up to the policy limits).
**Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** In New York, insurance companies also offer **Supplementary Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (SUM)** coverage. This extends protection to cases where the  _other driver does have insurance but not enough._ SUM coverage lets you recover the difference if another driver’s liability limits are lower than your own. It also covers you for accidents outside of New York (since basic UM is in-state only). For instance, if you carry $100,000 of SUM and you’re hit by an out-of-state driver with only $25,000 of liability coverage, your SUM can pay your injury costs above that $25k (up to your $100k limit). SUM essentially **raises your protection to your own liability limit** in accidents with underinsured or out-of-state motorists.
When you buy a new auto policy in NY, insurers are required to **include SUM coverage equal to your liability limits by default** (unless you decline it or choose a lower amount in writing). It’s a good idea to carry this coverage, especially in NYC where not everyone has adequate insurance. It’s usually relatively inexpensive for the added protection it provides.
A few notes on UM/SUM coverage:
  * It **only covers bodily injuries** , not damage to your vehicle. So it will pay medical bills, etc., if you’re hit by an uninsured driver, but it won’t pay to fix your car. To cover your car, you need collision coverage (or you could attempt to sue the at-fault driver personally, but if they had no insurance, they may not have funds to pay damages).
  * If you’re a **pedestrian** hit by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver, you can also claim under your UM coverage. And if you don’t have a car or insurance but are injured as a pedestrian by an uninsured vehicle, New York has a special fund called the **Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation ([MVAIC](https://mvaic.com/))** that may step in to provide no-fault and uninsured motorist benefits.
  * If a **family member** who lives with you has a car and insurance, and you’re injured by an uninsured driver, you could file a UM claim under that household policy as well.


### Collision Coverage (Optional)
**Collision coverage** is an optional insurance that pays for **damage to your own car** from a traffic collision, **regardless of who was at fault**. If you have collision coverage, your insurer will pay to repair or replace your vehicle if it’s damaged in an accident – whether you hit another car, another car hits you, or you hit an object like a tree or pole. You will just be responsible for the **deductible** you chose (a deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket on a claim before insurance pays the rest). Common deductibles for collision in NY are $200, $250, $500, $1,000, etc. – choosing a higher deductible can lower your premium, but means you pay more out of pocket if an accident happens.
If you **lease or finance** a car, your lender will typically require you to carry collision (and comprehensive) coverage. But if you own your car outright, it’s up to you. Skipping collision coverage might save money on premiums, but **consider how you would pay for repairs** to your car if it got wrecked. In NYC, even a minor fender-bender can be costly to fix.
_Example:_ You get into a crash on a crowded [Manhattan](https://orlowlaw.com/manhattan/) street and your car has $5,000 in damage. If you have collision coverage with a $500 deductible, you pay $500 and insurance covers $4,500 to fix your car. If you **don’t** have collision, you’d have to try to collect from the other driver’s insurance – which only works if the other driver was at fault **and** is identified and insured. Even then, you might wait a long time for their insurance to pay. Collision coverage lets you get your car repaired right away, and **your insurer will handle seeking reimbursement** from the other driver’s insurer if you weren’t at fault.
Collision coverage applies when your car is damaged by impact or overturning. It does **not** cover mechanical breakdowns or normal wear and tear. It also won’t pay for injuries (that’s what PIP and liability are for). It purely covers damage to **your vehicle**. Keep in mind that if you make a collision claim, you’ll be responsible for the deductible, and the insurer will pay up to the **actual cash value** of your car (basically, the market value considering depreciation, not the cost when new). Very expensive repairs on an older car might result in the car being “totaled” (declared a total loss) if repair costs exceed the car’s value.
### Comprehensive Coverage (Optional)
**Comprehensive coverage** is another optional protection for your vehicle. It covers damage to your car from **non-collision incidents** – basically, things other than a crash with another vehicle or object. Comprehensive typically covers risks such as **theft** , **vandalism** , **[fire](https://orlowlaw.com/construction-accidents/fires/)** , **flooding** , **hail or windstorm** , **falling objects** (like a tree limb), **glass breakage** , or hitting an **animal** on the road. If your car is stolen, comprehensive will reimburse you for the value of the car (minus your deductible). If a tree falls on your parked car or someone scratches graffiti on your door, comprehensive pays for repairs. Like collision, you choose a deductible and the insurance pays up to the car’s cash value.
For NYC drivers, comprehensive coverage can be very valuable. In a big city, cars can sustain damage off the road – for example, **car theft** and break-ins are risks, as are vandalism or damage from [falling debris](https://orlowlaw.com/construction-accidents/falling-debris/). Comprehensive covers those situations. It also often covers things like a cracked windshield (many policies even waive the deductible for glass-only claims or offer a special glass coverage). New York insurers generally offer the same deductible options for comprehensive as for collision ($100, $200, $500, etc.). If your car is financed or leased, comprehensive will be required by the lender.
One feature of comprehensive in NY: if your car is **stolen** , comprehensive coverage will usually reimburse you for reasonable transportation expenses (like a rental car or transit fares) while you don’t have your vehicle, up to a limit per day, until they settle your claim. This can help you get around while you wait for either the car to be recovered or a payout.
Both collision and comprehensive are considered “**physical damage** ” coverages for your car. They are optional by law (if your car is paid off), but remember, without them you have no coverage to fix or replace your own vehicle after an accident or other mishap. Many drivers carry them especially if the car is newer or valuable. If you have an older car that isn’t worth much, you might opt to skip these to save money – just be sure you could afford to replace the car out-of-pocket if something happened.
### Other Optional Coverages
In addition to the big coverages above, New York insurers offer other options you might consider:
  * **Medical Payments (MedPay):** This is extra coverage that can pay for medical and funeral expenses for you and your passengers, similar to PIP. However, because PIP already covers a lot of medical costs, MedPay is often less crucial in NY. It might cover things PIP doesn’t (for example, if you’re injured as a passenger in another state or after basic PIP is exhausted), but many people skip this if they have health insurance and adequate PIP.
  * **Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D):** Some policies offer a set lump-sum payment if you or a passenger dies or has certain serious injuries (loss of limbs, etc.) in a car accident. This is usually in addition to other coverage, as a special benefit.
  * **Towing and Labor:** Coverage that reimburses you for towing or roadside assistance costs if your car breaks down or is disabled in an accident.
  * **Rental Reimbursement:** Pays for the cost of a rental car (up to a daily limit) while your car is in the shop for a covered repair.
  * **Gap Insurance:** If you have a car loan or lease, gap coverage pays the difference between what you owe and the car’s value if the car is totaled. This prevents you from owing money on a car you no longer have.


All of these are **optional add-ons**. They can be helpful depending on your situation. Always review your options and costs – for example, if you rely on having a car daily, rental reimbursement coverage could be worthwhile. If you’re concerned about leaving your new car on city streets, comprehensive and gap coverage are important. Tailor your insurance to your needs, but **never go below the required coverages**.

Driving in New York City has some special considerations, both practical and legal. Here are some key points NYC drivers should keep in mind regarding car insurance:
  * **New York Insurance Only:** If you live in NYC (or anywhere in NY) and have a car registered here, you **must insure it with a New York-licensed insurance company**. You **cannot** use an out-of-state auto insurance policy for a New York registered vehicle. The DMV will not accept out-of-state insurance, even if you’re just keeping the car here. So if you move to NYC from another state, be sure to switch your policy to a New York policy when you register your car here.
  * **Insurance Must Match Registration:** The name on your insurance policy **must exactly match** the name on your vehicle registration. For example, if the car is registered in your name, you have to be the named insured on the policy. If two people co-own a car (registration can have two names), both names should appear on the insurance as well. If the names don’t match, DMV can suspend your registration and driver’s license. Bottom line: make sure the paperwork is consistent to avoid problems.
  * **Always Carry Proof of Insurance:** New York law requires that you **carry proof of insurance** and show it to police if asked. In NYC, traffic stops or accident scenes will almost always involve being asked for your insurance card. The good news is NY allows electronic proof of insurance – insurers can provide digital ID cards that you can show on your smartphone. Just ensure you have access to it at all times (or carry the paper card in your glove box as a backup). Presenting an invalid or falsified insurance card is a serious offense (it’s a misdemeanor), so never try to pass off old or fake documents. Keep your insurance up to date and accessible.
  * **Continuous Coverage (No Lapses):** In New York, a car that’s registered must be insured 100% of the time. The state’s Insurance Information and Enforcement System continuously monitors insurance coverage on vehicles. If your insurance lapses **even for a day** , the DMV will be alerted. You could face a registration suspension and fines for any lapse in coverage. We’ll cover specifics in the “Maintaining Coverage” and penalties section, but it’s especially relevant in NYC for those who may not drive often. Even if your car is just parked on the street or in a garage and you rarely use it, you **cannot let the insurance expire**. The only exception is for motorcycles (see below) or if you fully **surrender your license plates** to the DMV to take the car off the road.
  * **High Traffic and Accident Risk:** NYC’s crowded streets mean a higher chance of fender-benders and pedestrian incidents. This is one reason insurance rates in the city tend to be higher than in rural areas. As a driver, be mindful that even a small scrape in a parking lot could lead to an insurance claim. It’s wise to consider carrying collision coverage due to the increased risk of minor accidents in heavy traffic. Also, be aware that **if you hit a pedestrian or cyclist** , your no-fault insurance will cover their basic injury expenses (pedestrians and bicyclists are covered under the vehicle’s PIP in NY). Always drive cautiously, not only for safety but because every incident can affect your insurance record.
  * **Vehicle Theft and Vandalism:** Big cities like New York have higher rates of car theft and vandalism compared to many other areas. If you park on the street or in public lots, your car could be at risk for break-ins or theft. **Comprehensive coverage** is highly recommended for NYC drivers to protect against these urban risks. For example, if your car is stolen or your windows are smashed, comprehensive coverage will pay for your loss (minus deductible). Without it, you’d be on your own. Consider your parking situation and risk factors when deciding on comp/collision coverage.
  * **Special Insurance for TLC Vehicles:** If you drive for hire (yellow taxi, Uber/Lyft, livery car, etc.) in NYC, be aware that **commercial auto insurance requirements** apply. The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission ([TLC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/index.page)) requires higher liability limits (often much higher than 25/50) for licensed vehicles for hire – for instance, TLC rules require taxis and livery cars to carry at least $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident in liability coverage. Those policies are a bit different from personal auto insurance. Rideshare (TNC) drivers, when logged into the app, are covered by special insurance maintained by the TNC company. If you’re only using your car personally, this won’t concern you, but anyone considering **commercial use of a vehicle in NYC** should look into the specific insurance rules and make sure they’re covered properly. (A personal policy typically **does not** cover commercial use like picking up passengers for pay.)
  * **No-Fault and Lawsuits in NYC:** New York City doesn’t have separate car insurance laws from the state, but it’s worth noting how **no-fault works with so many drivers and pedestrians around**. In NYC, you might encounter scenarios like multi-car pileups or pedestrian knockdowns. Remember that no-fault (PIP) will cover immediate injury costs for you and pedestrians. However, if someone is seriously injured (common in high-speed or severe crashes), that’s when liability coverage and potential lawsuits come into play. The busy city environment means you should always be alert – an accident that injures a pedestrian, for example, could expose you to a lawsuit if the injury is grave. Your insurance would handle the claim up to your limits, but any excess or non-economic damages would be an issue if the injury qualifies as “serious”. This is another reason why higher liability limits can be very important for NYC drivers.
  * **Garage and Parking Discounts:** If you do keep your car in a private garage or only use it part-time, mention it to your insurer. Some companies offer discounts for vehicles stored in secure garages (versus street parking) or for low annual mileage – which might apply in NYC if you mainly use the car on weekends. These aren’t unique laws, just practical tips: your insurance cost is influenced by how and where you park and drive.


In short, NYC drivers should ensure they meet all state requirements and consider the city-specific risks (dense traffic, theft, multiple drivers on the policy if using car-sharing, etc.). Keep your insurance documents handy, never let your coverage lapse, and think about optional coverages that make sense for city life.
**How to get insurance:** To drive in NYC, you’ll need to purchase an auto insurance policy from a **company licensed in New York State**. Shopping for insurance can be done directly with insurance companies, through their websites or agents, or via independent brokers who can get quotes from multiple insurers. New York’s Department of Financial Services ([DFS](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/)) oversees insurance companies – you can find a list of authorized insurers on their website. Make sure any policy you buy is a legitimate NY policy. When you obtain a policy, the insurance company will issue you a New York State Insurance ID Card (physical and/or electronic) and will also **send proof of your coverage electronically to the DMV**. This electronic reporting is critical; your registration won’t be allowed unless the DMV receives that electronic confirmation from the insurer.
**Registering your vehicle:** You must have **insurance in place before registering** a car in New York. At the DMV, you will need to provide an Insurance ID Card as proof. The DMV will verify that your insurance is active (thanks to the insurer’s electronic filing). If you’re switching insurers or buying a new car, remember you have a limited time (usually 180 days from the effective date on the insurance card) to actually register the vehicle. Plan to get the car registered soon after getting insurance, otherwise the policy’s start date might get stale relative to registration.
**Maintaining continuous coverage:** Once your car is registered in NY, you are **required to keep it insured at all times** while the registration is active. New York’s DMV uses the **Insurance Information and Enforcement System ([IIES](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/property_insurers/iies_system))** to track every registered vehicle’s insurance status in real time. Insurance companies notify the DMV whenever a policy is started, canceled, or not renewed. If your policy is canceled and no replacement is reported, the DMV will automatically record an insurance lapse. What happens then?
  * For short lapses (under 90 days), NY DMV allows you to pay a **civil penalty** fee for each day without coverage to avoid a registration suspension. The penalty is $8 per day for the first 30 days, $10 per day for days 31–60, and $12 per day for days 61–90.  _Example:_ a 25-day lapse could be cured by paying $200 (25×$8).
  * If your lapse is longer than 90 days (or if you don’t want to pay the daily fees), you will have to **surrender your license plates** and serve a suspension of your vehicle registration for the same number of days as the lapse. Essentially, your car will be off the road during that period.
  * If you’ve had a prior insurance lapse within 3 years, you may not be allowed to pay a civil penalty to avoid suspension – surrendering the plates would be your only option.
  * Failure to take any action will result in **registration suspension** , and if you drive while suspended you could face even more penalties.


To avoid these headaches, the best practice is: **never cancel your insurance before you’re done with the car**. If you’re selling the car or moving out of NY, **turn in your plates to the DMV first** before canceling the policy. If you’re just switching insurance companies, make sure the new policy starts **before or on the same day** the old one ends so there’s no gap. Even a one-day lapse will trigger a problem with DMV’s system.
If you  _do_ receive a notice or inquiry from DMV about your insurance status (for example, sometimes an insurance company’s report might not match up, or there’s a clerical error), don’t ignore it. Contact your insurance agent or DMV to resolve it promptly. The system might flag you even if you think you have coverage, so always double-check.
**What if you can’t find affordable insurance?** Some NYC drivers, especially those with recent accidents, violations, or other high-risk factors, might struggle to get a policy from the standard insurance market. If multiple companies decline to insure you, **New York has an Assigned Risk Plan** known as the **New York Automobile Insurance Plan ([NYAIP](https://www.aipso.com/Plan-Sites/New-York))**. This program ensures that  _everyone_ can get at least the required liability coverage. You apply through the NYAIP (most insurance agents can assist with this), and you’ll be **assigned to an insurance company** which must cover you. Be aware, premiums under the assigned risk plan are usually higher than regular market rates (because it pools higher-risk drivers). It truly is a **last resort**. The plan is there so no driver is left completely uninsured – because driving without insurance is illegal. Over time, if your driving record improves, you can move back into the standard insurance market. New York’s insurance market is competitive, and there are even some companies that specialize in higher-risk drivers outside the NYAIP, so explore those options too. But know that **help is available** – you cannot be denied the ability to buy insurance altogether.
**Multi-car and multi-driver households:** In NYC, many families share cars. It’s important to list all licensed drivers in your household on your policy (or specifically exclude someone if the insurer allows it and they won’t ever drive the car). **Household members** are generally covered when driving your car with permission, but you should disclose regular drivers to your insurer. If you have more than one vehicle, you can often get multi-car discounts by insuring them with the same company. Each vehicle needs its own coverage, but they can be on one policy. Just ensure each car meets the minimum requirements and appropriate coverages for its use.
![What Happens If You Let Your Insurance Lapse Timeline](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20683%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Driving in New York without the required insurance is a **serious offense** – and in NYC, enforcement is strict. Here’s what can happen if you operate an uninsured vehicle or allow someone else to use your uninsured vehicle:
  * **Traffic Infraction & Fines:** Driving without insurance (or permitting your car to be driven without insurance) is a traffic offense. If caught, you can be fined **not less than $150 and up to $1,500** for a first offense. The judge may also sentence you to **up to 15 days in jail** (though jail is uncommon for this offense, it is legally possible). Even if you weren’t the one driving (say you let a friend borrow your uninsured car), as the owner you are held responsible too.
  * **License and Registration Revocation:** Upon conviction of driving without insurance, the DMV will **revoke your driver’s license and your vehicle registration for at least one year**. “Revoke” is more severe than a suspension – it means you have to reapply after the revocation period and requalify for a license/registration. If someone else was driving your car uninsured and got in an accident, both your registration and their license can be revoked. Driving privileges in NY will be lost, and you’ll need to meet strict requirements (and pay fees) to restore them later.
  * **Civil Penalty to Reinstate:** After a no-insurance revocation, you must pay a **$750 civil penalty** to DMV to get your license back (in addition to any court fines). This is basically a hefty administrative fee on top of the court fine. If you were suspended for an insurance lapse (without being caught driving), a similar penalty schedule applies as we discussed (daily fees up to $900 for 90 days lapse). But for being caught actually driving uninsured or being in an accident uninsured, expect the full $750 hit to reinstate.
  * **Towing and Impound:** In NYC, if you’re stopped by police and can’t show valid insurance, they might impound your vehicle on the spot. You’d then have towing and storage fees on top of everything, and you’d have to show proof of insurance to get the car released.
  * **Accident Costs:** If you cause an accident while uninsured, you will be **personally liable** for all damages. You won’t have an insurance company to pay for the other party’s injuries or property damage. This can be financially devastating – you could be sued for the full amount of someone’s medical bills, car repairs, lost wages, pain and suffering, etc. Even if you’re not at fault, being uninsured means you  _cannot recover_ non-economic damages from the other driver due to New York’s “No Pay, No Play” rules (you forfeit certain rights if you broke the insurance law). Plus, you’d have no one to cover your own injuries (no PIP) or car damage. Simply put, driving uninsured is **not worth the risk**.
  * **False Insurance Cards:** Never try to present a fake or expired insurance ID card. If you knowingly show a phony proof of insurance, it’s a **misdemeanor crime** in New York. That could lead to a criminal record, higher fines, and even potential jail time beyond the traffic infraction. It’s better to face the no-insurance charge honestly than to add a fraud charge on top of it.


The law in New York is so strict that even **parking** an uninsured vehicle on public streets is illegal (because it’s still “operating” in terms of registration). Enforcement cameras and scanners can pick up insurance lapses. If you have a car you don’t want to insure, your only legal choice is to **surrender the plates** and take it off the road.
**Bottom line:** **Never drive in NYC (or anywhere) without at least the required insurance.** The financial and legal consequences are severe. If you’re having trouble affording insurance, seek out discounts, ask about payment plans, or use the NYAIP as a last resort – but don’t take the chance of going uninsured.
No one wants to think about accidents, but they happen frequently in the city. It’s important to know what steps to take **immediately after a crash** and in the days following, both for safety and to comply with the law and insurance requirements. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
  1. **Stop and Stay at the Scene:** **Never leave the scene of an accident** , no matter how minor. In New York, it’s a traffic violation to leave the scene of even a property-damage incident, and a criminal offense to hit-and-run when there’s an injury. So if you collide with another vehicle, a pedestrian, a cyclist, or property, you **must stop** as close as safely possible to the scene. Move out of active traffic if you can, to avoid causing another crash, but don’t go far.
  2. **Check for Injuries and Call for Help:** **Check if anyone is hurt**. If there are any injuries (even minor ones) or if there’s significant damage, **call 911** to get police and if necessary an ambulance on the way. In NYC, police generally respond to most accident scenes, especially if there’s injury or substantial damage. It’s required by law to notify police immediately if someone is injured or killed. Even for a minor fender-bender, you can call the local precinct if 911 is not warranted. Let professionals handle any injured persons – don’t move someone who’s badly hurt unless there’s an imminent danger like a fire.
  3. **Exchange Information:** New York law requires that drivers involved in an accident **exchange identification and insurance information** with each other. You should provide your **name, address, driver’s license number, vehicle registration number, and your insurance company name and policy number** to the other driver(s) and to the police at the scene. Likewise, get the same information from the other driver(s). If the other driver flees or refuses, try to get their license plate number and report it to the police. If you hit a parked car or someone’s property and can’t find the owner, you must notify the police about the collision.
  4. **Show Your Insurance ID:** If a police officer is at the scene (or later, if you file a report), you will need to **show proof of insurance**. This is where your insurance ID card (paper or electronic) is used. The officer will likely take down your insurance info for the report. Make sure it’s readily accessible.
  5. **[Document the Scene:](https://orlowlaw.com/how-to-take-photos-after-an-accident/)** If it’s safe, take photos of the damage, the positions of vehicles, and anything relevant (skid marks, traffic signals, etc.). This can be helpful for insurance claims. Also note the time, location, weather, and any witness contact info if bystanders saw what happened.
  6. **Remain Calm and Don’t Admit Fault:** When talking to the other driver or police, stick to the facts of what happened. It’s okay to say “I’m sorry” in a general sense, but **don’t admit blame** or argue about fault at the scene. Fault will be determined later by insurance companies or authorities. Cooperate with police and be truthful, but you do not need to speculate on who caused the accident.
  7. **Report to DMV if Required:** New York State law says you **must file an accident report with the DMV** (Form MV-104) within 10 days **if** : **any person is injured or killed** , **or** there is more than $1,000 in property damage to any one person’s property. In practice, that means most accidents other than very minor scrapes need to be reported. Failing to file this report is a misdemeanor and can lead to license suspension. If police respond and make a report, you still need to file your own MV-104 form unless the police report indicates all required information and you’re excused (generally, you still file one). You can get the form on the DMV website or at a precinct. Fill it out with the details of the crash and send it to DMV. This report is  _in addition_ to giving information to your insurance.
  8. **Notify Your Insurance Company:** As soon as possible, inform your insurance company about the accident. Nearly all policies require prompt notice of any accident or potential claim. For no-fault (PIP) claims, remember the 30-day rule to file your application for benefits. Contact your insurer or agent and start the claims process. Provide them the details and the other driver’s information. If you are making a **collision claim** for your vehicle, you’ll arrange for an adjuster to inspect the damage. If the accident was clearly the other driver’s fault, your insurer may pursue subrogation (getting reimbursed) from the other company after they pay your claim. But you should still use your own coverage in the meantime (that’s why you have it).
  9. **Understand the Claims Process:** For vehicle damage, you generally have two routes:
     * **File through your own collision coverage** (you pay your deductible, your company pays for repairs, and they handle recovery with the other insurer if applicable).
     * **Or file a third-party claim** against the other driver’s property damage liability coverage, if the other driver was at fault. In that case, an adjuster from the **other driver’s** insurance will inspect your car and they’ll pay for repairs (no deductible). This can save you money if you don’t have collision or want to avoid using it. However, this process can be slower and you’re at the mercy of the other person’s insurance admitting liability. In straightforward cases, it might be fine. In NYC, if the other driver’s insurance is known, you can contact them directly to start a claim.
For injuries, your **no-fault (PIP) claim** with your insurer will cover immediate medical bills, etc., regardless of fault. If your injuries are serious, you (or your attorney) may also file a **bodily injury claim** against the at-fault driver’s liability insurance for pain and suffering and any excess medical costs beyond PIP. That typically comes later, after it’s clear injuries are serious/long-term.
If the other driver was **uninsured or a hit-and-run** , you would file a claim under your **Uninsured Motorist coverage** for injuries. For property damage, unfortunately, you’d have to use your own collision coverage or sue the other driver personally if identified (there’s no uninsured motorist property damage coverage in NY standard policies). If you have no collision coverage and the other driver is uninsured, you may be eligible to make a claim with MVAIC for some benefits, but that’s generally for injuries, not car damage.
  10. **Follow Up and Repair:** Work with the insurance adjuster to get an estimate for repairs. You can typically choose a repair shop; many insurers have recommended shops in NYC that can expedite the process. Keep copies of all paperwork (towing bills, repair bills, medical receipts). If you suffered injuries, keep track of medical treatment and days of work missed – you’ll need to submit that info for PIP reimbursement. And importantly, **attend to your health first** – get the medical care you need. Insurance forms can be filled out after you’re stable.
  11. **Legal Consultation if Needed:** If you were seriously injured or fault is disputed, you might consider consulting a personal injury attorney. They can help protect your rights, especially if it might turn into a lawsuit for a serious injury. Simple claims without serious injuries can usually be handled directly with insurance, but don’t hesitate to seek legal advice if you feel overwhelmed or if the case is complex (most attorneys offer a free consultation for accident cases). Just remember, this guide isn’t legal advice – it’s always okay to get a professional opinion for your specific situation.


By following these steps, you’ll fulfill your **legal responsibilities** and also set yourself up for a smoother insurance claim process. In NYC’s busy environment, accidents can be very stressful – having this checklist in mind can help you stay calm and cover all the bases if it happens to you.
New York’s insurance requirements we’ve discussed mostly apply to standard passenger **cars** , but what about other vehicles? Here are brief notes on special vehicle categories:
  * **Motorcycles:** Motorcycles in New York must carry **liability insurance** just like cars (with the same minimum limits) whenever the bike is being operated. However, motorcycles are **not covered by no-fault (PIP)** in New York – motorcycle operators and passengers do  _not_ receive PIP benefits if injured in a crash. This means if you ride a motorcycle, you rely on health insurance or optional motorcycle medical coverage for injuries, and you can also sue an at-fault driver from the first dollar of loss (the no-fault threshold doesn’t protect the other driver in that case). Another difference: motorcycles have a one-year registration that expires every April 30, and you’re **allowed to drop insurance in the off-season without surrendering plates**. For example, many riders cancel insurance for the winter. Just remember, you **cannot take the bike on any public road without insurance** – even a quick test ride could be catastrophic if you haven’t reinstated coverage. So, while you get flexibility to lay up a bike, make sure it’s insured before that first spring ride. Also note, motorcycle insurance often doesn’t include no-fault, but you can often get add-ons like guest passenger liability (to cover a passenger’s injuries) or medical payments for yourself. If you’re a motorcyclist in NYC, strongly consider good health insurance and perhaps **underinsured motorist coverage** , since bike accidents can be severe.
  * **Commercial & For-Hire Vehicles:** Vehicles used for business, like delivery trucks, vans, taxis, Ubers/Lyfts, and other commercial vehicles, have **additional insurance rules**. They still must meet the state minimums (and actually higher in many cases). For instance, **taxicabs and liveries in NYC** are required by the Taxi & Limousine Commission to carry much higher liability limits than personal cars (often $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident or more). Rideshare drivers (Uber/Lyft) in New York State are covered by a **commercial insurance policy** provided by the TNC when they’re logged into the app (with $1.25 million liability coverage, etc.), but they need their own personal policy for when they’re not active. [Commercial trucks](https://orlowlaw.com/car-accidents/commercial-vehicles/) that carry goods have their own insurance requirements too, sometimes set by federal law if they cross state lines. If you’re driving a vehicle for work, make sure you understand the insurance requirements – **business use may not be covered** by a standard personal policy. Businesses often need a **commercial auto policy**. Also, vehicles like buses, ambulances, and school vehicles have special insurance certificates (for example, “FH-1” for for-hire insurance) that must be filed when registering. In short, if it’s not a personal car, do a specific check on insurance laws for that vehicle type. Commercial insurance can be complex, so consult with the company or appropriate agency (like TLC for taxis) to ensure compliance.
  * **Non-Motor Vehicles:** Bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar modes of transport are common in NYC. These are **not motor vehicles** under NY law, so they **do not require car insurance**. In fact, you generally can’t even buy “car insurance” for a bicycle. Instead, any liability for bicycle accidents would typically fall under other insurance (like a homeowner’s or renter’s policy liability coverage, if you have one, or just personal liability in a lawsuit). Pedestrians and cyclists hit by cars are covered by the car’s no-fault insurance for their injuries, as noted earlier. If you’re strictly a cyclist, you don’t need auto insurance, but if you occasionally rent or borrow cars, you might consider **non-owner car insurance** for liability protection. Also, ATVs and off-road vehicles can’t be driven on public roads in NYC and have their own registration and insurance rules when used elsewhere. Essentially, if it has a motor and goes on public roads, it needs insurance (this includes motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses). If it’s human-powered (bike) or a low-speed e-mobility device, no auto insurance is mandated (though ride carefully because you could still be held liable for injuries you cause).
  * **Out-of-State Vehicles in NYC:** If you are visiting NYC with an out-of-state car, you must adhere to your home state’s insurance requirements at minimum. New York honors out-of-state insurance as long as the vehicle is not registered in NY. However, if you become a New York resident, you are expected to register your vehicle here within 30 days of residency and then need NY insurance. Also, note that New York’s no-fault benefits cover accidents in NY, so if you’re an out-of-state driver and you get in an accident here, New York’s no-fault law can still apply (your insurance might have to pay no-fault benefits to your passengers or others, even if your state isn’t no-fault, due to reciprocity agreements). It gets complicated, but the key takeaway is: once you have NY plates, you need NY insurance.


New York law creates a balance between **no-fault insurance** (to quickly cover injury expenses) and the ability to sue for serious damages. As an NYC driver, you should be aware of how **insurance and legal liability intersect** :
  * **Obligation to Insure:** The most fundamental legal responsibility is to **carry the required insurance** on any vehicle you own and drive. Failing to do so is against the law (Vehicle and Traffic Law Article 6) and comes with the penalties we discussed. By law, you must also **produce proof of insurance** when requested by police or in an accident. Keeping insurance up to date is not optional – it’s a duty of every driver/owner.
  * **Duty After an Accident:** Legally, you are required to **stop after a collision** , exchange info, and report certain accidents to authorities. Fleeing the scene or failing to report can result in criminal charges. These duties tie into insurance because if you don’t follow them, insurance companies can also deny coverage (for example, policies have clauses requiring you to cooperate and report accidents timely).
  * **No-Fault Claims:** Under Insurance Law, if you’re injured, you have a right to claim no-fault benefits from the appropriate insurer. In return, you generally **cannot sue the other driver for minor injuries**. This is a legal trade-off. You have the **responsibility** to file your no-fault claim within 30 days and to cooperate with the insurance in providing medical documentation, etc., to get your bills paid. If you fail to submit the no-fault application in time, you could lose those benefits.
  * **[Serious Injury Threshold:](https://orlowlaw.com/what-is-a-serious-injury/)** The law defines **serious injury** strictly. Only if an accident causes one of those serious outcomes can an injured party step outside the no-fault system and pursue a **liability claim or lawsuit** against the at-fault driver for pain and suffering or full damages. Practically, this means if you cause a minor accident, you likely won’t be sued (the other person will use their PIP). But if you cause a major crash – say someone breaks a bone or worse – you can expect a claim or lawsuit. Your **liability insurance** will handle such claims up to your policy limit. It will also **provide you a lawyer (at the insurance company’s expense)** to defend you if you’re sued, as part of your coverage. This is a crucial protection; without insurance, you’d have to hire your own attorney and pay any judgment yourself. With insurance, the insurer’s duty is to defend and indemnify you (pay settlements/judgments) up to the coverage amount.
  * **Lawsuit Process:** If you are sued after a serious accident, notify your insurer immediately (if they aren’t already handling the claim). They will assign a defense attorney to represent you. Typically, these cases may be settled out of court by your insurance paying the injured party an agreed amount. If it goes to trial and a verdict is higher than your policy limit, you could be personally responsible for the excess – another reason to carry higher limits if possible, to avoid that scenario. It’s rare, but not impossible, for very severe injuries to result in judgments beyond minimum insurance (for example, $25,000 doesn’t go far for a major injury).
  * **No-Fault and Lawsuit Interplay:** You cannot be required to pay someone’s medical bills out of pocket if no-fault covers them. No-fault insulators you to some extent. In a lawsuit, the other party can only seek damages that are not covered by no-fault or that exceed the no-fault $50k. They can also seek non-economic damages (pain and suffering) if serious injury is proven. Property damage is not covered by no-fault at all, so claims for car damage can always be pursued (though usually those are handled insurer-to-insurer without lawsuits). As a driver, your responsibility is simply to have insurance and, if a claim arises, to cooperate with your insurance company and any legal proceedings.
  * **Subrogation and Reimbursement:** There’s a legal concept called subrogation where, for instance, your insurance may recover costs from an at-fault party. As an insured, you typically must **cooperate** with such efforts. For example, if your insurer pays your collision claim, you can’t then also sue the other driver for those same damages – your rights to recover may transfer to your insurer. Be aware that you can’t “double dip.” Similarly, if you use health insurance for injuries that should fall under no-fault, the health insurer might seek reimbursement from the auto insurer. These behind-the-scenes processes are handled by the companies’ legal departments.
  * **No-Fault Fraud and Misuse:** New York has had issues with staged accidents and insurance fraud. As a driver, never partake in any fraudulent claims – it’s illegal and heavily prosecuted. Your role is to provide honest information. If you suspect the accident was intentional or fraudulent (e.g., someone slams their brakes to cause a crash), report your suspicions to your insurer or the authorities. New York has a fraud bureau for auto insurance scams.
  * **Legal Advice Disclaimer:** While this guide provides a legal overview, it is **not legal advice** for any specific case. Every accident scenario can have its nuances. If you are involved in a complicated situation, you might need to consult a lawyer, especially if injuries are serious or if there’s a dispute about fault that could lead to litigation.


In summary, your legal responsibilities as an NYC driver boil down to: **carry the right insurance, follow the rules after an accident, and fulfill the requirements of the no-fault system.** If you do that, your insurance will usually protect you both by paying out claims and by shielding you with legal defense in court if needed. By obeying these laws, you not only avoid penalties but also ensure that if the worst happens, everyone involved (including you) has financial protection in place.
### **What car insurance is required by law in New York?**
To register and drive a vehicle in New York, you must have:
  * **Liability insurance** : At least $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident for injuries, and $10,000 for property damage.
  * **No-Fault (PIP)** : $50,000 per person for medical expenses and lost wages.
  * **Uninsured Motorist (UM)** : $25,000/$50,000 minimum for injuries caused by uninsured or hit-and-run drivers.


### **What happens if I let my car insurance lapse in NYC?**
Even a one-day lapse can trigger a **registration suspension** , fines, or daily civil penalties. You must maintain insurance at all times while your vehicle is registered. If you cancel a policy without turning in your plates, the DMV will automatically suspend your registration.
### **Does car insurance in NYC cover pedestrians or cyclists I might hit?**
Yes. Your **no-fault (PIP)** insurance covers pedestrians or cyclists injured by your vehicle. Your **liability coverage** would also apply if the injuries are serious and they sue you.
### **Can I use out-of-state insurance on a car registered in NYC?**
No. New York requires that the insurance be **written by a company licensed in New York** , and the policyholder’s name must match the name on the vehicle registration.
### **Is no-fault insurance the same as liability coverage?**
No. **No-fault (PIP)** pays for your own medical expenses and lost wages, regardless of fault. **Liability** pays for injuries or damage you cause to others.
### **Can someone sue me even if I have insurance?**
Yes, but only if they meet New York’s **“serious injury” threshold** or have over $50,000 in economic losses. If you’re sued, your insurer provides a lawyer and will pay out any settlement or judgment up to your policy limits.
### **Do I need collision or comprehensive coverage?**
They are **optional** unless your car is financed or leased. Collision pays for damage to your car from crashes. Comprehensive covers theft, vandalism, fire, and non-collision damage. These are smart to have, especially in NYC.
### **What should I do right after a car accident in NYC?**
  * Stop and exchange information
  * Call 911 if there are injuries or major damage
  * Take photos
  * Notify your insurer
  * File a DMV accident report (Form MV-104) within 10 days if there’s injury or damage over $1,000


### **Can I suspend my insurance if I’m not using the car?**
Only if you **surrender your plates to the DMV**. Otherwise, the car must stay insured even if it’s not being driven. Motorcycles are an exception—you can drop coverage in the off-season without surrendering plates.
### **What if I can’t afford car insurance?**
New York has an **Assigned Risk Plan (NYAIP)** that ensures all drivers can get the required coverage, even if they’ve been denied elsewhere. Premiums are higher, but it’s better than driving illegally.
* * *
**Stay safe and insured!** Car insurance may seem like a hassle or expense, but in a metropolis like New York City, it is absolutely crucial. It’s there to protect your finances, your license, and to get you back on your feet after an accident. Make sure you understand your policy and keep your coverage continuous. By meeting your insurance obligations and driving responsibly, you’ll be well-prepared for the challenges of city driving. New York’s roads can be unpredictable – but with the right insurance, you and your fellow New Yorkers can drive with greater peace of mind.

My experience from beginning to the end regarding my injury was a smooth transition. Both Adam and Brian guided me accordingly with the least amount of stress possible. Whenever I needed to speak to either of them, they were always available. The information being relayed to me by the other party was always straight forward with no uncertainties. They were honest with my settlement and what was expected. I highly recommend this practice. Everyone in the practice has always been professional and courteous. If I were to ever be in a situation again when I need to seek legal counsel for an injury I will certainly be contacting them again. Many thanks to the Orlow Firm.

> I was involved in a car accident and sustained some serious injuries. I got in touch with The Orlow Firm and spoke to Brian. I couldn't have been happier with the results. I was always made to understand the decisions I needed to make, they were very flexible and patient with me and I truly believe they got me the most compensation possible due to their experience and knowledge. I recommend them to anyone looking for a personal injury firm in New York.

Very happy with the results!
> We had a situation where my mother had been neglected in a nursing home and the injuries were appalling. The Orlow Firm comforted us, knew what steps to take and got us the justice we deserved for our mother. I will be forever grateful to them for their compassion and hard work.
