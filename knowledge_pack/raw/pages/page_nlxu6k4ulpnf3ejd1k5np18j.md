# Do you live in Florida’s ‘Sinkhole Alley?’ Here’s what to watch for
## Central Florida is especially susceptible to sinkholes, data shows

Any long-time residents of the Sunshine State are likely all too familiar with sinkholes.
They’re a relatively common staple of Florida, thanks to the fact that the state sits on a bedrock made up mainly of limestone.
And because of how porous limestone is, water can seep in and eat away at this layer, forming cracks that eventually cause the ground itself to collapse.
While [nowhere in the state](https://floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes/content/sinkhole-faq#G4 "https://floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes/content/sinkhole-faq#G4") is immune to sinkholes, Central Florida tends to see them form much more often, leading to the region being dubbed “Sinkhole Alley.”
“It goes all the way from Hillsborough County, and close to Tampa, all the way up to Daytona, and it goes through our areas of Maitland and Winter Park,” UCF’s [Dr. Manoj Chopra](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/person/manoj-chopra/ "https://www.cece.ucf.edu/person/manoj-chopra/") told News 6 last year.
**[BELOW: Watch News 6 anchors Matt Austin and Ginger Gadsden discuss Sinkhole Alley with Dr. Chopra]**
However, experts at [the University of Florida](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/blog/tell-me-about-sinkholes-in-florida/ "https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/blog/tell-me-about-sinkholes-in-florida/") say that more sinkholes have been forming in recent years due to factors like climate change and land development.
In fact, a 300-foot-deep sinkhole opened up beneath a Central Florida fertilizer plant back in 2016, which reportedly sent [millions of gallons of contaminated sludge](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/national/2024/10/09/polluted-waste-from-floridas-fertilizer-industry-is-in-the-path-of-miltons-fury/ "https://www.clickorlando.com/news/national/2024/10/09/polluted-waste-from-floridas-fertilizer-industry-is-in-the-path-of-miltons-fury/") into the state’s main drinking water aquifer.
When it comes to sinkholes, the Florida Geological Society breaks down the state [into four main types of areas](https://geodata.dep.state.fl.us/datasets/FDEP::florida-sinkhole-types/explore?location=28.933386%2C-81.853557%2C7.59 "https://geodata.dep.state.fl.us/datasets/FDEP::florida-sinkhole-types/explore?location=28.933386%2C-81.853557%2C7.59"):
Area | Description | Sinkholes?  
---|---|---  
I | Bare or thinly covered limestone |  _Few_ , generally being shallow, wide and happening over time  
II | Consists mainly of permeable sand |  _Few_ , generally being shallow, small and happening over time  
III | Consists mainly of heavy soil with low permeability |  _Most numerous_ , with varying sizes and happening abruptly  
IV | Consists of cohesive sediments interlayed with discontinuous carbonate beds |  _Very few_ , but some large, deep sinkholes may occur  
[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_scale,w_640/v1/media/gmg/RIIBP3T7TNCDJEJGWX777VG5TM.png?_a=DAJHqpE+ZAAA)](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTools/index.html?appid=404f2e8dbde44c2baff4a53175e278e7)A "Sinkhole Risk Map" using data from the Florida Geological Survey. (Red = Area 1; Blue = Area 2; Green = Area 3; and Purple = Area 4) (Arcgis)
Within Central Florida, places like Orlando’s Lake Eola and Winter Park’s Lake Rose actually got their starts as sinkholes.
Chopra told News 6 that there’s an easy way to tell whether a lake in Florida began as a sinkhole.
“If you fly over Central Florida, if you see those really round lakes, they’re probably sinkholes, because a sinkhole is typically a funnel that fails the surface and falls in,” he explained.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_scale,w_640/v1/media/gmg/5PRDYOBRFRCKDNDRJJ5SKHP4EI.png?_a=DAJHqpE+ZAAA)
A massive sinkhole opens up in Winter Park in 1981, eventually forming into Lake Rose.
There are also two primary types of sinkholes to watch out for, [state officials warn](https://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/FGS/FGS_Publications/L/L20.pdf "https://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/FGS/FGS_Publications/L/L20.pdf"):
  * **Cover-Subsidence Sinkholes** : These form slowly and occur when surface sediments settle or wash into a void. Common in Area II.


![](https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_scale,w_640/v1/media/gmg/OJE3QAZWEJGVTOJZJ4ARH4A22Q.png?_a=DAJHqpE+ZAAA)

  * **Cover-Collapse Sinkholes** : These form by the sudden collapse of cover sediments into a large void in the limestone bedrock beneath the surface. Common in Areas III and IV.

On the flip side, state officials also caution that not everything is a sinkhole, as there are some “imposters” that may fool residents.
These can include utility main breaks, storm-drain line leaks, septic tank collapse, underground rotting tree stumps, erosion, and buried debris.

But for homeowners aiming to keep their houses from falling prey to a sudden sinkhole, the FDEP discusses the following warning signs that could indicate a sinkhole is forming:
Inside or Outside? | Warning Sign  
---|---  
Inside your home | Cracks in walls or floors  
Inside your home | Floors become uneven or sloped  
Inside your home | Windows and doors become difficult to open/close  
Inside your home | Creaking/popping noises  
Inside your home | Nails in walls and sub-floors begin to extrude  
Inside your home | Cabinets and drawers become uneven and difficult to open/close  
Inside your home | Displaced moldings and wall trim  
Inside your home | Water leaks  
Outside your home | Water pooling under the house or along the foundation  
Outside your home | Changes in surface drainage  
Outside your home | Cracks in exterior walls or foundation  
Outside your home | Exposed rock that is not normally visible  
Outside your home | Cracks or depressions in the yard  
Outside your home | Broken water, utility or sewer lines  
Outside your home | Cracks or separation of paved surfaces  
Outside your home | Leaning trees, vegetation or structures  
Outside your home | Dying foliage and grass
