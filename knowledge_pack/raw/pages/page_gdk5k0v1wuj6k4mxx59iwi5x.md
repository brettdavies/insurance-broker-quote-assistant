![What a Homeowners Policy Typically Covers](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67a27f8cb619a78ee83a01a3/684ad48955ff929df8b94830_684ad47690cb758365b39fa9_EDI%2520-What%2520a%2520Homeowners%2520Policy%2520Typically%2520Covers.jpeg)
Homeownership comes with all kinds of responsibilities: regular upkeep, unexpected repairs, and making sure your insurance policy actually protects what matters most. If you’re a Florida homeowner, understanding what’s covered by your insurance policy (and what isn’t) can help you avoid surprises when it matters most.
Let’s walk through the essentials of what standard homeowners insurance in Florida typically includes, what’s usually excluded (like wear and tear), and optional add-ons you may want to consider.
## **What’s Covered**
A standard homeowners insurance policy in Florida generally provides coverage for sudden and accidental losses – unexpected events outside your control. Here are the core protections most policies include:
### **Fire and Lightning**
If a fire damages your home or possessions, your policy can help pay for repairs or replacements. Lightning strikes are also included, which could involve fire damage or electrical surge losses.
### **Windstorm and Hurricane**
Wind damage from hurricanes and other strong storms is typically covered, though your policy may include a separate hurricane deductible.
### **Sudden Water Damage**
This applies to things like a burst pipe or water heater leak – _sudden and accidental_ water damage, not slow leaks or ongoing issues (more on this below).
### **Vandalism and Theft**
If someone breaks in or damages your property intentionally, your policy likely includes protection for both your home and personal belongings.
### **Personal Liability**
If someone is unintentionally injured on your property or you accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property, your policy can help cover your legal fees and their medical costs.
### **Loss of Use**
If damage to your home makes it uninhabitable, your policy can cover hotel stays, temporary rentals, and other additional living expenses while repairs are underway.
## **What’s Not Covered**
While standard homeowners insurance in Florida covers many hazards, it’s just as important to understand what it doesn’t cover. In nearly all cases, home insurance is meant to protect against sudden and accidental events – not problems developing gradually over time.
### **Wear & Tear: Not Covered by Home Insurance**
These are the kinds of gradual issues likely to naturally occur over time. While frustrating, they're considered part of normal homeownership, not insurable events. This includes:
  * An aging roof beginning to leak
  * Mold buildup from long-term humidity
  * Rusted pipes or old plumbing equipment failures
  * Cracks in the foundation due to settling
  * HVAC breakdowns from normal usage
  * Faded paint, warped wood, or deteriorated siding


Insurance doesn’t act as a maintenance plan. Natural deterioration over time – aka wear and tear – is not covered by home insurance, even if the resulting damage is extensive. It’s why regular upkeep is essential.
### **Maintenance-Related Exclusions**
Your claim may also be denied if the damage could have been prevented with routine maintenance. For example, if a leak has been dripping under your sink for months and causes mold or rot, the insurer is likely to consider it a maintenance issue – not a covered event.
### **Flood Damage Isn’t Included**
Flooding caused by rising water – due to heavy rain, a storm surge, or overflowing lakes, rivers, or canals – is **not included** in standard homeowners insurance policies. This often surprises homeowners, especially in Florida where flood risk is high even outside designated flood zones.
To be protected, you'll need to add separate flood coverage, either through your insurance company (if eligible for an endorsement) or by purchasing a policy through the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.floodsmart.gov/).
## **Optional Coverages You May Want to Add**
Most insurance companies offer endorsements (optional policy add-ons) to help you customize your protection. And while standard homeowners insurance in Florida provides a solid base, these extras can help fill in the gaps.
### **Animal Liability**
Home insurance policies may exclude injuries or damage caused by household pets, especially certain dog breeds. An animal liability endorsement, then, can help cover costs if your dog bites someone or otherwise causes harm or destroys the property of others.
### **Flood Insurance**
[Flooding is the most common natural disaster](https://www.ready.gov/floods) in the U.S., but it’s not covered under standard homeowners policies. Some companies (like [Edison Insurance Company](https://www.edisoninsurance.com/products/additional-coverage)) offer a flood endorsement for qualifying homes. Otherwise, you’ll need a standalone flood policy through the NFIP.
### **Identity Theft Protection**
This coverage can help cover expenses if your identity is stolen and you’re the victim of fraud – including legal fees, lost wages, and credit monitoring services.
### **Equipment Breakdown & Service Line Coverage**
Equipment breakdown coverage protects major appliances and systems (like your HVAC or water heater) from unexpected mechanical failure – not normal wear and tear. If you purchase this coverage, you may also be eligible for service line protection, which covers underground pipes and utility lines running between your home and the street.
### **Personal Property Replacement Cost**
Without this coverage, claims for damaged belongings may be paid based on actual cash value, meaning depreciation is factored in. With this endorsement, you’ll be reimbursed for the cost to replace items at today’s prices, without regard for the age or condition of your belongings.
### **Premium Packages**
At Edison, we go a step further and offer bundled coverage upgrades called premium packages to raise policy limits for things such as:
  * Money/credit card theft or forgery
  * Jewelry and furs
  * Personal injury & liability
  * Medical payments to others
  * Water backup 


These packages offer added protection and convenience for a single, affordable added cost.
## **What About Condo Insurance?**
While standard homeowners insurance in Florida is designed for single-family homes, condo owners need a different type of policy. The condo association typically insures the building’s exterior and shared spaces. Your individual [condo insurance](https://www.edisoninsurance.com/products/condo-insurance) (known as an HO-6 policy) covers:
  * The interior of your unit
  * Your personal belongings
  * Personal liability
  * Loss of use
  * Sometimes improvements you’ve made (like flooring or cabinetry)


Flood insurance and many of the add-ons mentioned above may still be available – but coverage options like screen enclosures or service lines don’t apply to condo units.
## **Get the Most From Your Edison Home Insurance Policy**
Whether you're new to homeownership or reviewing a long-standing policy, the best way to protect your investment is to understand both what your policy covers and what it doesn’t.
Here’s how to stay proactive:
  * **Review your policy annually.** Make sure it still fits your home’s value, your belongings, and your lifestyle.


  * **Ask about optional coverages.** You might benefit from adding flood insurance, equipment breakdown coverage, or personal property replacement cost to your policy.


  * **Practice regular maintenance.** Inspect your roof, plumbing, and appliances. Fix small issues early so they don’t become big, costly problems later.


  * **Speak with your agent.** They can help explain exclusions like wear and tear or flood coverage, and recommend ways to strengthen your coverage.


  * **Document upgrades.** If you've added a new roof, installed monitored security systems, or made energy-efficient updates, your agent should know – it could help you save on your insurance cost.


Home insurance is one of the most important protections you have as a homeowner – but standard homeowners insurance in Florida isn’t one-size-fits-all. By understanding the basics, staying on top of home maintenance, and customizing your policy with smart add-ons, you’ll be in a stronger position to weather whatever comes your way.
