![Household items swirling in the wind](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt62d40591b3650da3/blt051c3496d84100f5/636ad0b4ff20df28ca3ca491/does-home-insurance-cover-storm-damage_hero-block-image.svg)
## What types of storm damage does homeowners insurance typically cover?
**Hail, sleet, ice, and snow** : Standard home insurance will generally cover [hail damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/hail-damage-home-insurance/), minus your deductible. In fact, hail damage to roofs is one of the most common weather-related insurance claims. In addition, damage from the weight of ice, snow, or sleet may be listed as a [covered peril](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/) on your homeowners policy.
**Example** : Sudden and accidental water damage from inside your home, such as a washing machine overflow, may be covered by insurance. Damage from an ice dam or the weight of ice, snow, or sleet may also be covered by your dwelling coverage.
**Wind (including tornadoes and hurricanes)** : Standard home insurance policies typically cover damage to your home's structure and belongings from high winds, including those caused by events like tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter storms. However, it's possible that your policy excludes or reduces coverage for wind damage, so check the terms and conditions. Learn more about [how home insurance may cover hurricane damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-hurricanes/) and [tornado damage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-tornado-damage/).
**Example** : Suppose your home's roof or siding gets damaged by strong winds, which may also result in damage to the interior of your home. Your homeowners insurance may cover the damage, as long as there isn't a wind damage exclusion on your policy. You may also be covered if a tree falls on your house due to strong winds.
Pro tip:
Your homeowners policy might have a separate, higher deductible for damage caused by windstorms or hail. Homeowners insurance deductibles may be based on a percentage of your home's Coverage A (dwelling coverage) amount, Coverage A and C (personal property coverage) amounts combined, or a flat dollar amount, so check your policy to find out your deductible.
**Lightning** : [Damage to your home and personal property from lightning](https://www.progressive.com/answers/home-insurance-lightning-strike-damage/) is typically covered by your home insurance policy.
**Example** : If lightning hits your home and causes a fire or power surge, your homeowners policy may pay for the damage, up to your coverage limit and minus your deductible. You may also be protected for electronics or appliances damaged by a power surge.
## What types of severe weather damage does home insurance typically NOT cover?
**Floods** : Flood damage isn't typically covered under standard home policies, especially when its cause is a weather-related event. However, specialized flood insurance may be purchased from the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.floodsmart.gov/) or a private [flood insurance](https://www.progressive.com/flood-insurance/) company.
**Earthquakes** : Home insurance policies typically won't cover [damage from earthquakes](https://www.progressive.com/answers/does-home-insurance-cover-earthquakes/) on standard policies. In certain states, some insurers offer a separate policy or endorsement for earthquake coverage. In California, earthquake coverage can be offered through the [California Earthquake Authority (CEA)](https://www.ca.gov/agency/?item=california-earthquake-authority/).
## Tips for protecting your property from severe weather
  * **Check your policy** : Be aware of any exclusions and coverage limitations. If your home is in an area prone to severe weather, make sure you have the right storm insurance coverage in place. If you're unsure about what's covered, reach out to your insurance company.
  * **Be proactive** : Don't wait to purchase the proper protection until a disaster occurs. If there's a hurricane watch in your area, it may be too late to buy homeowners insurance, as most insurers won't offer policies if there's an impending hurricane.
  * **Make sure your deductible is within your budget** : As mentioned, storm and wind deductibles can be expensive. Be prepared to pay more in out-of-pocket expenses for situations where your policy's percentage deductible is more than you can afford. If you have the option for a flat deductible amount, you may want to choose the lowest deductible in exchange for paying a bit more on your monthly premium.


## What steps should I take for a weather-related insurance claim?
When you experience [damage to your home due to a natural disaster](https://www.progressive.com/answers/natural-disaster-insurance-coverage-claims/) or severe weather, contact your insurer immediately to get things rolling and to prevent further damage from occurring. Documenting the damage with photos or a video may come in handy when your claim gets reviewed.
