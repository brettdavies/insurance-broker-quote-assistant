Foremost, a subsidiary of Farmers, offers the standard and optional coverage features you’ll find with other mobile home insurers, but its most competitive feature is “extended replacement cost” coverage.
The value of replacement cost coverage with Foremost: if your manufactured home is totally destroyed, you will be eligible to be reimbursed up to 20% above the value of your policy limit.
Foremost is also a stand-out when it comes to customer satisfaction. Its J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating was 868 / 1,000, which was top of all the insurers we reviewed.
However, Foremost doesn’t offer instant quotes on its website. Instead, after submitting your information on a quote form, you’ll receive an email quote within 24 hours.
Foremost is one of the largest mobile insurance providers in the U.S., with more than 38,000 agents representing the company.
Pricing: you can get a quote after entering your information on its website or from an agent appointed with the company

Progressive is appealing because of the discounts it offers new homeowners, its high financial strength and customer satisfaction ratings, and its digital experience. Progressive’s website is easy to navigate, and you’ll receive an instant quote. It also offers a mobile app.
Unique to the mobile home insurers we reviewed was Progressive’s “single deductible” benefit. If you bundle your mobile home and auto insurance with Progressive, any claim you file for either policy applies to both policies instead of having a separate deductible for each policy.
For example, if a hailstorm damages your manufactured home’s roof and your car, and you have a $500 deductible for both policies, you only have to pay one deductible, and both will be repaired.
You also receive a bundle discount when you have your mobile home and auto insurance with Progressive.
Progressive also has an endorsement option for “trip collision,” which covers your dwelling and personal property when it’s being moved from one location to another.
Pricing: you can get a quote after entering your information on its website or from an agent appointed with the company

## How To Find The Best Mobile Home Insurance Company For You
To find the best mobile home insurance and the right company for you, follow these steps
  * Select at least three companies we’ve reviewed to get quotes. Getting multiple quotes will help you become more knowledgeable about mobile home insurance and ensure you’re not going to overpay for your coverage.
  * Decide what perils to have covered. Having fire protection is standard in mobile home policies, but you need to consider if you live near water or mountains that could cause flooding, for which you might need a separate flood insurance policy, depending upon the insurer. Consult with an insurance agent if you’re unsure of the level of coverage that you need.
  * Think about any valuable or unique items you have. Adding up the value of these and your other possessions will help you arrive at the right policy limits, which will keep you from over-insuring and overspending.
  * Factor in upgrades, renovations, or other major work that could impact your mobile home’s value when you get a quote


Before or after you get quotes, take photographs and record serial numbers of valuables, appliances, and other items you’ll be insuring. Keep this information in a sturdy, fireproof container or at a different location. This information will come in handy in the event of a claim.
## Do You Need Mobile Home Insurance In Georgia?
We believe you need manufactured home insurance coverage in The Peach State.
First, if you’re going to have a mortgage when you buy your mobile home, your lender will probably require it.
Second, any home in Georgia, with or without a mortgage, faces the unpredictable perils of violent thunderstorms containing damaging winds, hail storms, tornadoes, tropical storms, and hurricanes coming in from Florida or off of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last, check with your mobile home park or community and see if mobile home insurance is required for residents.
## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Cover?
A standard manufactured home insurance policy generally features the following coverage:
### Dwelling Coverage
This coverage pays to repair or replace the physical structure of your mobile home if it’s damaged by events your policy covers, up to a limit you choose. You’ll also select a deductible, which you have to pay before the insurer pays any amount for an approved claim.
Events such as these are generally covered:
  * Fire
  * Lightning
  * Explosions
  * Vandalism
  * Falling objects
  * Wind and hail
  * Weight of ice and snow
  * Damage from wild or stray animals
  * Burst pipes


### Other Structures Coverage
Pays to repair a shed, fence, or other structure that isn’t attached to your mobile home if an event covered by your policy damages it.
### Personal Property Coverage
This coverage pays to replace or repair electronics, furniture, and other belongings if they’re damaged or stolen.
### Liability Insurance
Liability insurance provides financial protection if a visitor is hurt and sues you, or you accidentally cause property damage or injuries to others. Liability insurance often also covers related legal expenses and medical payments.
##  What Does Manufactured Home Insurance Not Cover In Georgia?
A manufactured home policy is similar to traditional homeowners insurance in that there are several major exclusions you should know about:
### Damage Caused By Natural Flooding
Mobile homes in Georgia are susceptible to flooding from the many rivers and lakes in the state that can cause damage when overflowing from the heavy summer rains that happen due to the summer heat and high humidity levels. If water from these overflows enters the mobile home, there is no coverage for the damage it causes.
With miles of Georgia being situated on the Atlantic coast, mobile home owners in coastal areas are not immune from damage caused by flooding caused by hurricanes. Mobile home insurance does not cover flood damage.
### Expensive Valuables & Collectibles
A standard mobile home insurance policy offers limited coverage for valuables, such as jewelry, guns, or other collectibles. If you have an extensive art collection or other collectibles, or a collection of fine wine or expensive jewelry, you’ll need to take out an endorsement increasing the coverage on these items since losses will not be covered over a dollar amount state in your policy.
### Identity Theft Protection
Identity theft protection is not covered under a standard mobile home policy in Georgia. If this is an area of concern for you, many credit card issuers offer identity theft protection as a cardmember benefit. You can also purchase standalone identity theft protection.
## Average Cost Of Home Insurance In Georgia
Though no insurers we reviewed provide prices on their websites, we estimate that mobile costs in Georgia will fall between $40 and $125 per month, depending on your coverage limits, deductible, options selected, and other factors detailed below.
Many factors affect your mobile home insurance cost, including:
  * Where you live (zip code)
  * The age of your home
  * The cost to replace your home
  * The limits and coverage you select
  * Your deductible
  * Your claims history


All of the insurers we’ve reviewed offer different types of discounts to mobile home insurance policyholders, such as bundling your coverage with auto insurance.
## How To Buy Mobile Home Insurance Online In Georgia
Following these steps will make buying a mobile home insurance policy online a simple and relatively quick experience.
  * Decide how much protection you need. In addition to your dwelling, add up the contents of your mobile home to calculate the property damage limits you need to replace your home and valuables.


  * Get an online quote. Most companies selling mobile home coverage in Georgia provide the ability for you to get an online quote. There are also some websites that will do a coverage and cost comparison making online shopping for coverage even easier.


  * Complete the application. Once you’ve arrived at the amount of coverage you need for a price you can afford, you’ll need to complete an application for coverage. Many insurers’ websites provide the ability for you to apply online, but some will require that you meet with an agent to complete the application.

## Unique Considerations For Manufactured Home Insurance In Georgia
Similar to its neighbor to the south, Florida, Georgia is susceptible to all kinds of rough weather, including:
  * Wildfires
  * Damaging winds
  * Lightning
  * Tornadoes
  * Hurricanes
  * Tropical storms
  * Hail
  * Flood damage


For this reason, we recommend that every mobile home owner in Georgia have adequate coverage.
## How To Find Cheap Mobile Home Insurance In Georgia
To find cheap manufactured home insurance coverage in Georgia, obtain quotes from at least three insurance companies. You’ll find rates vary by insurer for their basic coverage, as well as their options. Be sure to ask about any discounts that you can take advantage of.
We recommend that you not choose an insurer based on price alone. Make sure you have the right limits and that you’re getting an apples-to-apples comparison when you get quotes.
