## Average car insurance cost in Des Moines by coverage limits
Here’s a breakdown of [average car insurance rates](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-rates.html) in Des Moines by coverage type.

  * **Liability only coverage** : $540 per year (limits are $50,000 bodily injury liability per person, $100,000 total bodily injury liability per accident and $50,000 property damage liability per accident).

Minimum liability insurance only covers damage or injuries you cause to others – it won’t help with your own medical bills or car repairs.

## Average car insurance rates by gender in Des Moines
In Des Moines, female drivers pay an average of $2,236 per year for car insurance. In comparison, male drivers pay $2,243 annually, which is $7 more than what female drivers pay. Most [states consider gender when calculating premiums](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/gender-auto-insurance-rates/). However, states such as California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania don’t allow insurers to use gender as a rating factor to determine insurance rates.
According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/what-determines-price-my-auto-insurance-policy), or Triple-I, women tend to be safer drivers than men and are less likely to be involved in severe accidents. Insurers account for this risk by charging male drivers higher premiums.
