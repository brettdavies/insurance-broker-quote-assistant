# Does GEICO auto insurance cover rental cars?
## GEICO covers rental cars through its full coverage package. Rental car reimbursement doesn’t provide rental car insurance, but GEICO’s full coverage auto insurance policy covers rental vehicles. GEICO insurance extends your coverage limits to a rental car as if you owned it, but liability-only coverage may not provide this perk. Shop around and compare multiple insurance companies to get the best rental car insurance.

The Short of It
  * Geico extends your auto insurance policy to rental cars
  * Rental car reimbursement can provide a refund for fees from rental car companies
  * You can pay as low as $2 a month for rental car reimbursement


## Does Geico cover rental cars?
Yes, it does. Geico rental car insurance is an extension of coverage from your insurance policy. In other words, Geico car insurance provides the same coverage limits to rental cars as if you owned the vehicle.
If you want to make sure you’re covered, buy the car rental insurance from the company. Geico’s rental insurance will cover you, but purchasing more rental coverage guarantees that you’re covered for complicated situations.
Geico’s insurance for rentals expands your auto insurance policy to your rental vehicle. This can save you from out-of-pocket expenses that involve rental insurance fees.
Rental insurance policies vary by company. Some car insurance companies may not extend your insurance policy to a rental vehicle.
Therefore, it’s wise to buy insurance with a rental company. This prevents you from getting into situations where a car insurance policy may not cover specific incidents.
Rental car insurance is between $5 and $60 per day. However, the price of your rental insurance depends on the vehicle you’re renting.

## Can rental car reimbursement cover auto insurance rental fees?
Yes, it can. Geico’s insurance for rentals doesn’t cover refunds. But you can add rental car reimbursement to your policy to get money back that you spent on a rental vehicle.

## Is rental insurance included in full coverage auto insurance?
Yes, it is. [Full coverage](https://www.insurantly.com/coverage/full-coverage/ "Full coverage") car insurance is a combination of liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage.

## Does Geico Cover Rental Cars? The Bottom Line
Geico is one of the few companies that cover your [rental car](https://www.enterprise.com/en/car-rental/vehicles/us.html?icid=header.rent.vehicles-_-us.vehicles-_-ENUS.NULL), but you should also buy the rental coverage from the rental car company. This provides coverage from various angles.
