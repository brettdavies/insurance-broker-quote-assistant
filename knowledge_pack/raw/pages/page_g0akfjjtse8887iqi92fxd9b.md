Mobile home insurance often excludes certain risks — like floods or earthquakes. With [PolicyOwl](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/policyowl), you can upload your policy and instantly see if your coverage matches your needs.
## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Cover?
Mobile home insurance, also known as manufactured home insurance, offers a combination of [coverages to protect your home](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover), personal belongings, and liability similar to traditional homeowners insurance but tailored to the specific needs of mobile home owners. Here’s a breakdown of what mobile home insurance typically covers:
### Dwelling Coverage
This portion of the policy covers the physical structure of your mobile home against damage from covered perils such as [fire](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-fire), windstorms, hail, lightning, and vandalism. It helps pay for the repair or replacement of the mobile home itself. Dwelling coverage is crucial for mobile home owners as it ensures that the principal investment, the home itself, is protected against significant risks.
### Personal Property Coverage
Personal property coverage protects the contents of your mobile home, including furniture, electronics, clothing, and other personal belongings. If these items are stolen or damaged as a result of a covered event, this coverage will help pay to replace them.
### Liability Protection
Liability protection covers legal expenses, or damages, that you or family members may be responsible for causing to others. This can include bodily injury to others or damage to their property while they are on your property. Liability coverage is essential for protecting yourself against potential lawsuits or claims.
### Additional Living Expenses (ALE)
If your mobile home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, ALE coverage helps cover the cost of temporary housing and other living expenses while your home is being repaired or replaced. This can include hotel bills, meals, and other necessary expenses incurred as a result of being displaced from your home.
Optional Coverage | What It Covers  
---|---  
Trip Collision | This covers any damage incurred to a mobile home when it’s being transported. This could include both the initial transport of the mobile home post-construction and subsequent transport.  
Additional Structures | This type of coverage protects against damage to adjacent or separate structures near your mobile home, like a garage.

## What Does Mobile Home Insurance Not Cover?
Mobile home insurance, much like standard homeowners insurance, provides extensive coverage, but it doesn’t cover everything. Here are some common exclusions that mobile home insurance policies typically do not cover:
### Natural Disasters
Certain natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, are generally not covered by standard mobile home insurance policies. Coverage for these events typically requires additional, separate policies like earthquake insurance or flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
### Intentional Damage
Any damage that is caused intentionally by the policyholder or by someone else at the direction of the policyholder will not be covered. This also extends to any criminal activity that results in damage or loss.
### Wear And Tear
Normal wear and tear or deterioration of the mobile home is not covered. Insurance is designed to protect against sudden and accidental damage, not maintenance issues that occur over time.
### Pest Infestations
Damage from pests such as [termites](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-termite-damage), rodents, or insects is typically not covered. These are considered maintenance issues that the homeowner is responsible for managing.
### War And Nuclear Hazard
Events like war, nuclear hazards, or government action are not covered by mobile home insurance policies.
### Water Damage From Sewage Backup
Unless specifically added to a policy, [water damage](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) resulting from sewer or drain backup is not typically covered.
## Is Mobile Home Insurance Worth It?
Mobile home insurance, much like traditional homeowners insurance, is designed to protect against a variety of risks that can impact your home and financial well-being. It typically covers damages to your mobile home from events like fire, windstorms, theft, and vandalism.
It also provides liability coverage in case someone is injured on your property, and it can help cover additional living expenses if your home is uninhabitable after a covered loss. Personal property inside the home is also protected against covered damages or theft.
If you own your mobile home outright, purchasing insurance is not a legal obligation. However, considering the value of the home and its contents, plus the potential liabilities, going without coverage can be a significant risk. Mobile home insurance can be a financial safety net, guarding against the unexpected expenses that come from disasters and accidents which could otherwise be financially devastating.
On the other hand, if you’re financing your mobile home, insurance is usually required by the lender. Mortgage companies mandate this to protect their investment in your property until you’ve paid off your loan. The lender will typically want to see proof of insurance before the sales process is completed, and it may need to be maintained as a condition of your mortgage.
## How Much Does Mobile Home Insurance Cost?
The cost of mobile home insurance depends on a multitude of factors, including the value and age of the mobile home, its location, the coverage limits you select, the deductible amount, and any additional coverage options you choose.
Insurers will also consider the risk factors associated with the area, such as susceptibility to natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes, crime rates, and even the proximity to emergency services. Here’s a comparison chart detailing the average annual costs of mobile home insurance by coverage amount:
Coverage Amount | Average Annual Cost  
---|---  
$30,000 | $250 – $800  
$75,000 | $300 – $1,000  
$150,000 | $450 – $1,300  
$200,000 | $500 – $1,400  
Remember, these are [average insurance costs](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance/how-much-is-homeowners-insurance) and your actual premium could be higher or lower based on the specifics of your situation. To get the most accurate idea of what you’ll pay for mobile home insurance, it’s best to get quotes from several different insurers.

## Manufactured, Modular And Mobile Homes; What’s The Difference?
Manufactured, modular, and mobile homes are often confused, but they are distinct in their construction, regulations, and typically their permanence.
### Manufactured Homes
Manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory under federal building codes administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). They are constructed on a permanent metal chassis and can be moved to different locations, though they are often placed in a permanent location and can come with or without wheels.
Once they arrive at their location, they are typically set on a permanent foundation but retain the ability to be moved. They are designed to be a permanent living arrangement.
### Modular Homes
Modular homes are also factory-built in sections or modules, but they are assembled on-site on a permanent foundation. They must adhere to the same local building codes as site-built homes, rather than federal codes. Modular homes are considered real property, just like a site-built house, and are designed to stay in one place, often resulting in higher value retention than manufactured homes.
### Mobile Homes
The term “mobile home” refers to factory-built homes built before the HUD code was enacted in 1976. These are similar to manufactured homes in that they are built in a factory and can be moved to different locations. However, they are often less regulated than modern manufactured homes and can vary widely in quality and safety standards.
