# What to know about fire-resistant homes
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Simple maintenance, proper material choice and leading practices may help create a more fire-resistant home. 
When people hear the words "fire safety," they might often think of [in-home smoke detectors and fire extinguishers](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/fire-safety-equipment-for-home.html) or even [sprinkler systems](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/small-business/automatic-sprinkler-systems.html). However, it’s equally important to consider fire-resistant material for your home’s exterior to [help reduce the risk of starting or spreading fires](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/safety-for-home-fires.html). Fortunately, homeowners can take steps to help reduce fire hazards around their property.
## How to help fireproof your home from wildfires
No home can be completely fire-resistant. Hot embers can make their way into a home through tiny nooks and crannies. Once they've lodged themselves in an attic or floated through an open window, they can set the entire structure ablaze. To help keep embers out of the house, here are some materials you can use and steps you can consider to help make a more fire-resistant home:
  * **Roof** — use composite, metal, clay, tile or [impact-resistant roofing](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/impact-resistant-roofing-materials) to help deter fires. Close off gaps under the roof tiles, shingles and eaves to help block wind-blown embers. The same applies to patio covers.
  * **Gutters** — non-combustible metal drip edges and gutter guards may help protect from ember exposure. Regularly [clear debris from the gutters](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/stepbystep-guide-to-gutter-cleaning) and roofing — plant debris is especially vulnerable to ember ignition.
  * **Walls** — use stucco, fiber-cement siding, stone, brick or specially treated wood to help resist fires. Materials should extend from the foundation to the roofline to help prevent embers from finding their way into the fire-prone materials underneath.
  * **Windows** — use dual-paned glass, [tempered safety glass,](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/how-to-make-windows-more-energy-efficient) fireproof shutters and/or screens to help diminish the effects of fires.
  * **Vents** — cover vents with a noncombustible metal mesh about an eighth of an inch wide to help block embers from entering your home. Avoid using plastic, fiberglass or metal that can be corroded as those types of meshes may melt when a fire occurs. Consult local guidelines on ventilation requirements and consider hiring a contractor to perform the installation.
  * **Decks** — composite deck boards, fire-retardant-treated wood or lightweight concrete are commonly used as fire-resistant material for decks. You’ll also want to remove flammable materials from below the deck and the surrounding area as these can act as tinder.
  * **Fences** — concrete, stone, masonry and, in some cases, steel fences may act as a barrier in the event of a fire. Use these non-combustible materials or treatments to help limit the fence’s ability to spread fires, especially near parts of the fence that directly connect with the home.
  * **Garages** — seal the outline of your garage door with weather stripping to minimize gaps for embers to enter. You may also want to perform regular [yard maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/spring-yard-cleanup-safety-tips) next to your driveway to limit the number of plants close to your home structure.
  * **Chimneys** — use a non-flammable metal screen material to cover your chimney and stove pipe outlets. Close the fireplace when not in use and/or during [wildfire season](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/wildfire-safety-tips) and remember to [clean it and the chimney regularly](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/why-chimney-cleaning-is-important).

# Fire resistant homes
## Fire resistant materials
**Walls** – Stucco, fiber cement siding, brick or specially treated wood
**Roof** – composite, metal, clay, tile or impact-resistant roofing
**Chimneys** – non-flammable metal screen
**Gutters** – non-combustible metal drip edges and gutter guards
**Decks** – composite deck boards, fire-retardant-treated wood or lightweight concrete
**Vents** – one-eighth inch wide noncombustible mesh
**Fences** – concrete, stone, masonry or steel
**Windows** – dual-paned glass, tempered safety glass or fireproof shutters/screens
**Garages** – weather stripping
## Help reduce your home’s outside fire risks
**Grilling** – position grill at least 10 feet away from your home and hanging tree branches.
**Fireworks** – attend public fireworks shows instead of producing your own.
**Vegetation** – keep roofs and gutters clear of leaves, pine needles or other debris that could catch embers.
**Trees** – prune trees up to six to 10 feet from the ground or up to one-third of the overall height of shorter trees.
**Water** – position garden hoses so they are long enough to reach the roof and sides of your home.
**Fire pits** – place basin at least 10 feet away from the house and other flammable objects.

When possible, use a contractor to complete installations, or if you are [thinking about doing the renovations yourself](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/when-to-diy-and-when-to-go-pro), see that you follow safety guidelines carefully.
## Help reduce other outside home fire hazards
  * **Grilling** — position the grill [at least 10 feet away from your home](https://www.nfpa.org/news-blogs-and-articles/blogs/2019/05/31/nfpa-1-proper-use-and-location-of-grills-and-other-cooking-equipment-firecodefridays) and hanging tree branches. Maintain a watchful eye and keep children or pets away from your grill or fire pit. Clean your grill after each use. Avoid loose or dangling clothing. Should a fire occur, fully douse the flames with water, or cover with sand until completely cool.
  * **Fireworks** — according to the [U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)](https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Fireworks), in 2023 hospitals treated an estimated 9,700 injuries resulting from [fireworks](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/family/fireworks-safety-for-fourth-of-july). Additionally, the CPSC found that the sparks from at-home fireworks can burn as hot as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to risk of burns or embers landing on your home or other structures. Even in states where fireworks are legal, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) suggests [attending fireworks shows instead of producing your own](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20230425/fourth-july-fema-promotes-safety-and-preparedness).
  * **Vegetation** — fire can spread to a home from dead branches, dried leaves or even mulch. The [National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/preparing-homes-for-wildfire) advises homeowners to keep their roofs and gutters clear of leaves, pine needles or other debris that could catch embers. Anything that can burn (including flammable plants, mulch and firewood piles) should be moved away from exterior walls. Also, keep lawns trimmed to four inches to help prevent the potential spread of fire.
  * **Trees** — the NFPA suggests pruning trees up to six to 10 feet from the ground (or up to one-third of the overall height of shorter trees) to help prevent surface fires from reaching the crowns. Try to plant trees in locations where mature canopies will be at least 10 feet away from the home structure.
  * **Water** — garden hoses should be long enough to reach the roof and each side of your home if you need to put out a fire. Strategic placement of a sprinkler system may also help defend your home from an approaching fire.
  * **Fire pits** — place the basin at least 10 feet away from the house and other flammable objects. Only use fire pits outdoors to help avoid fire hazards and carbon monoxide poisoning and consider using a pedestal-style pit on decks for proper ventilation and protection from heat damage.


Fires aren’t the only risk homeowners face. To help prepare, check out some more [ways to help keep your home safe](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/prevention).
