State Farm just got approval to raise California homeowners’ insurance rates by 17%, and now it’s asking for another 11% increase less than a week later.

This appears to be their request for next year’s rate increase, which will not be approved until the end of this year at the earliest. 
What was more recently approved was a [rate increase](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=California+insurance+rate+increase&cId=74395413-6ab1-4730-8e8b-10140cd767b2&iId=9fcfd398-8ce6-4297-aa58-4f04b07629e0) for this year. 
[Insurance companies](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=California+Insurance+companies+rate+increase&cId=ae2f944c-3fe0-495a-a7f7-a715b2734e99&iId=5db14f0b-2b9c-45ba-9a20-0ddd1296048d) have to ask permission every single year to raise rates. That’s how Californians decided this should be done.

California can also choose to refuse State Farm increase the rate and risk State Farm exiting the market. 
The homeowners in California then can purchase the California FAIR Plan which makes it transparent that the coverage is less and it's not solvent enough to pay for all the potential claims that may come in.

California Fair Plan is a joke. The last big fire about 75 miles from me was around five years ago, and they raised my rates over 1k a year. I’m up to just under $5k a year for them.

That's cheap! I just got quoted $14k 
Edit: I should clarify that a chunk of that includes the supplemental insurance. But, as I'm required to purchase both, I don't think that distinction matters.

We need to just let fire insurance be freely priced based on sound scientific risk analysis underwriting. Everyone should be expected to pay a rate that reflects the actual risk of wherever they choose to live 
There needs to be a competitive marketplace so everyone pays a fair price. No broken market. No subsidies. No more bailouts to property owners

I understand your logic, but you also need to understand this is not where many residents "choose to live". Many of them live there because it's cheap – disabled folks or senior citizens, for instance, or are working class families. It's a lot more complex than what you make it sound, and I hate it when the residents of those areas are pictured as a bunch of wealthy folks. Those exists but they are a minority of residents (recent Palissades fire being the exception).

You don’t think people fitting that description also live outside the fire zone? Why should they subsidize people living in it? Can you see how this creates a bad incentive to move _into_ the fire zone? 
Are either of these groups well served by the current broken state of the insurance market?

Subsidizing fire insurance is encouraging people to live in areas where the fire risk is high.

Last year state farm paid out $6 billion more in claims than they collected in premiums. The $5 billion income is tiny compared to the total amount they insure and only happened because their investment portfolio rose with the rest of the stock market in '24.

State Farm is a coop. All excess income is returned to the policyholders in the segments that earned that income. So a net income seems okay?

This is the market place letting us know that: 
  * Climate change is real. Politicians and influencers can live in fairy tale land for now, but the people who have skin the game can't afford to be morons. 
  * Places that were already: wildfire prone, hurricane prone, flood prone, etc., are the canaries in the coal mine. This uninsurability issue will spread further as conditions deteriorate. 
  * If buyers can't get insurance banks won't finance the purchase of the home. People will be faced with cratering home value. 
  * Government will attempt to shore up this issue by offering state sponsored insurance so as not to see an exodus and loss of tax revenue. Eventually there'll be a big enough disaster that the state won't be able to cover it and confidence in this scheme will collapse. 
  * People will finally start to realize that not addressing climate change is **far** more expensive than the cost of mitigating it.

Actuary here that's worked on homeowners and auto insurance in California. It sucks, but this type of rate was realistically needed multiple years ago, it's also likely needed by every insurer and not just State Farm. Current premiums just aren't sustainable for it to make much sense for most insurance companies to write business in the state. 
If you're at another insurer, expect to see your premium to increase a good amount in the near future - this shouldn't just be isolated to State Farm. Rising repair costs and increased fire risk among other things are all naturally going to require more premium. The rate increase may also not be accounting for tariffs, which would lead to even further rate need in the future. 
State Farm is a large enough national carrier to survive the next big fire, but your smaller regional insurer may not be especially if they have too many policies concentrated in fire prone areas. The last thing we need is for California to become the next Florida where it's a yearly occurrence that regional insurers get wiped out due to hurricanes. This just leads to people not being made whole when their home is destroyed.

People are getting mad at State Farm. But why not just go to a different insurer if you think you’re getting screwed? It’s generally a competitive industry with a few big players and a lot of smaller players. 
What’s that, you say? They are all too expensive and/or cutting policies? I wonder why that might be…

Why isn't California investing more into fire protection and response to lower the risk side of the actuarial tables?
