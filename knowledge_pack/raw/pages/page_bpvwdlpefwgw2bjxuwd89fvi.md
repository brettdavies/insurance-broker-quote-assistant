About Us Hub 
Welcome to our about us hub! This is where you can find information about why TWIA exists and how it operates. TWIA provides access to wind and hail insurance that is essential to buying, selling, and owning property on the Texas coast.
[Get Windstorm Insurance](https://www.twia.org/property-owners/get-windstorm-insurance/)[make a payment](https://www.twia.org/payments/)[report a claim](https://www.twia.org/claimscenter/)
TWIA is governed by Chapter 2210 of the Texas Insurance Code. TWIA provides a source of insurance used as a last resort for property owners that have been denied windstorm and hail property insurance coverage in the private (voluntary) market. TWIA is not a private market competitor.
## What is TWIA?
Why does TWIA exist? Standard homeowner’s insurance companies often deny wind and hail coverage for property along the Texas coast. This leaves coastal property owners without the standard insurance coverage so often required by mortgage lenders and other financial institutions. When this wind and hail insurance is denied, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association becomes an option for coverage.
How does TWIA operate? TWIA is a not-for-profit insurance association that operates like an insurance company by issuing policies, collecting premiums, and paying losses (claims). TWIA policies only provide coverage for property damage caused directly by wind and hail. TWIA policies do not cover damage caused by flooding and storm surge.
