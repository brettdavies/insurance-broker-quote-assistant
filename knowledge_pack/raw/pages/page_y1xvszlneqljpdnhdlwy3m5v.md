## How does safe driving affect Geico car insurance rates?
Several factors affect car insurance rates, such as age, vehicle, credit score, and where you live. However, your driving history is the most significant factor that affects your rates.
Car insurance companies look closely at your driving record to see how likely you will cost them money by causing an accident.
For example, the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/index.html) reports that over 2.5 million people went to the hospital in 2019 due to car crashes. Since hospital visits are expensive, car insurance companies pay massive amounts for accident claims.
Car insurance companies reward safe drivers with low rates and additional discounts because of high costs.
This table shows Geico’s average car insurance rates based on driving records. Drivers with accidents, tickets, and DUIs see much higher rates.
**Geico Average Monthly Car Insurance Rates Based on Driving Records**
Driving Record | Average Monthly Rates  
---|---  
Clean | $178.83  
One Speeding Ticket | $220.45  
One Accident | $266.06  
One DUI | $406.32

  * [How long does a DUI stay on your insurance?](https://www.CarInsuranceCompanies.com/how-long-does-a-dui-stay-on-your-insurance/)
  * [How long does a ticket stay on your record?](https://www.CarInsuranceCompanies.com/how-long-does-a-ticket-stay-on-your-record/)
  * [How many points on your license is a speeding ticket?](https://www.CarInsuranceCompanies.com/how-many-points-on-your-license-is-a-speeding-ticket/)


Although one speeding ticket raises rates by around $40 a month, one accident raises them about $90 a month. So the best way to keep car insurance rates low is to maintain a clean driving record.
Geico drivers that maintain a clean driving record and take advantage of safe driving discounts have low rates.
## What other discounts does Geico offer?
Don’t worry if you aren’t eligible for a Geico safe driving discount. Many other discounts may be available to you.
Sadly, there aren’t any hidden discounts to search out, but Geico offers many discounts based on the driver, vehicle, and policy.
For example, suppose you have an accident and don’t qualify for a good driver discount. In that case, you may be eligible for a multi-policy discount based on your car’s safety features.
This table shows Geico car insurance discounts, with the savings amount listed if it is available.
