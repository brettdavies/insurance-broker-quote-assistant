## Average car insurance costs by age and gender in Pennsylvania
[Age](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/auto-insurance-rates-by-age/) is another contributing factor to how much car insurance is in Pennsylvania. While most states also use gender as a factor, Pennsylvania, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Carolina do not due to state regulations. Young drivers under 20 usually pay the most for car insurance as inexperienced drivers. Rates typically drop around 25 and continue to decrease until around age 70, when they begin to increase again as senior drivers often face age-related factors like delayed reaction and vision changes that make driving riskier.

**Bankrate’s take:** Male drivers are [more likely](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females) to cause accidents and engage in risky driving behavior. In most states, male drivers pay higher average car insurance rates than female drivers, especially when they're young. However, Pennsylvania does not allow the use of gender as an auto insurance rating factor. Your coverage rate is determined by dozens of other factors, including your age, vehicle type, location, marital status and driving history.
### Cost considerations for young drivers in Pennsylvania
Auto insurance premiums depend on risk assessments made by insurance underwriting. Age and experience are considered key indicators of a driver's risk level. A younger and less experienced driver may be more likely to be involved in an auto accident or traffic violation. As a result, car insurance premiums tend to be higher for younger drivers. One way that young drivers may save on premiums, despite their age, is to [remain on a parents' policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/can-i-be-on-my-parents-car-insurance/) even after turning 18, as long as they live in the same house. Drivers under 18 cannot have their own policies and must remain on a parent or guardian's policy. The table below shows average rates for young drivers and how much they might save by not getting their own policy at 18:

## How does driving record impact the cost of car insurance in Pennsylvania?
Having a clean driving record is one of the best ways to keep your insurance costs down. Tickets, at-fault accidents and DUI convictions are all indications that you could be a [high-risk driver](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-auto-insurance-pennsylvania/), which can significantly raise car insurance rates in Pennsylvania. For instance, a speeding ticket increases rates by 16 percent more, on average, while an at-fault accident shows an average increase of 26 percent more. A [DUI can cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/dui-101/) a thousand or more dollars a year in higher insurance premiums and fees, and the offense can stay on your driving record for life in Pennsylvania unless it is expunged. Our analysis shows an average annual premium increase of 103 percent more in Pennsylvania after a DUI.

## How to save on car insurance in Pennsylvania
Car insurance is mandatory if you own a car in Pennsylvania, but it doesn't have to break your budget. Here are a few tips that could help you save money on car insurance in Pennsylvania:
  * **Take advantage of telematics programs.** [Telematics programs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/telematics-insurance/?tpt=b) monitor your driving through a small device you install in your car or a mobile app, which assesses your speed, hard braking and other driving behaviors. If you prove to be a safe and careful driver, you might save up to 40 percent off on your policy premium. 
  * **Maximize your discounts.** Most insurers offer at least a small handful of[ discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/) and these can often save you a considerable amount on your car insurance rate. Many discounts are easy to earn. You may save money, for example, just for agreeing to receive policy documents via email rather than postal mail, or for going claims-free for a certain period of time.
  * **Consider your yearly mileage.** Many insurance companies use your [annual mileage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/low-mileage/) to determine rates, but if you put fewer than 12,000 miles per year on your car, it may pay to update your mileage with your carrier. Those who drive considerably less, like remote workers, may save even more with [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/pay-per-mile-insurance/).
  * **Improve your credit score.** Car insurance companies in Pennsylvania are permitted to use a driver’s [credit-based insurance score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/insurance-score/) when determining rates. Improving your score might take time and may not be immediately reflected in your car insurance policy, but it could still be useful in the long term to help you save money and improve your financial opportunities.

Caret Down Icon
The average cost of [minimum coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) in Pennsylvania is $521 per year.

    * $30,000 bodily injury liability per accident
    * $5,000 property damage liability per accident

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:

Caret Down Icon

The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
