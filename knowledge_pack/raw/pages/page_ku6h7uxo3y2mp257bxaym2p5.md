[Teen](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-teens) and [young drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) often pay the highest car insurance rates. But taking advantage of discounts can help you lower your premium, and GEICO has policy discounts specifically for students. Its good student and student away at school discounts can save eligible drivers up to 15% on their auto insurance.
In this guide, we’ll explain how GEICO’s student discounts work, how much you can save, how they compare to other [top insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-comparison-sites), and how to maximize your savings.
## **What Is the GEICO Student Discount?**
GEICO offers two student discounts: the good student and student away at school discounts. The company awards students who maintain at least a B average a [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount). You can prove this by submitting official documentation, like a transcript or report card. The discount typically expires when you reach age 23.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-student-discount#cite-1)
The [student away at school](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/student-away-at-school-discount) discount is for students who attend school full time at least 100 miles awayand leave their car at home. Because these students don’t drive while at school, they have a lower accident risk.
GEICO also offers other discounts suitable for students. For example, the company recommends students take advantage of the [good driver discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/safe-driver-discount), which earns drivers a price reduction for accident-free driving for at least five years.

## **How Much Can You Save With the GEICO Student Discount?**
![Smiling girl with curly hair driving a car, wearing a white shirt, looking forward through the windshield on a sunny day.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/7123dea4c5/teen-driver.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
GEICO’s student discounts can save you up to 15% off your monthly insurance premium. The student away at school discount amount varies depending on your location, while the good driver discount can save you up to 22%.
Few GEICO customers have reported their experience with the company’s student discounts, so it’s difficult to determine the average savings. But at least one student earned $40 off their monthly premium with a good student discount.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-student-discount#cite-2) And a parent was able to reduce their costs by $600 annually with the student away at school discount.[[3]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-student-discount#cite-3)
Combining good student and student away at school discounts can [save you the most money](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks).[[4]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/geico-student-discount#cite-4)

## **How to Get the GEICO Student Discount**
![Students sitting in a classroom, focused on writing in notebooks, with desks and windows in the background.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/f7dbc92e56/students-in-class.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Insurance companies apply some discounts automatically, but others require more work. You usually need to provide proof of eligibility to get a good student discount. GEICO offers a student discount to high school, college, and graduate students younger than 23 who maintain at least a B average.
GEICO doesn’t provide many specifics about this discount, but some customers report getting the discount without providing proof of good grades or enrollment. But have your school transcript or other official documentation ready to show that you meet the eligibility requirements(the company can request proof at any time).
Remember that lying to your insurer — even if only about your grades — is considered insurance fraud. That means your insurer can drop your insurance policy or refuse to pay a [claim](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/claims-explained) if it discovers you withheld the truth.
Don’t forget to combine your good student discount with other discounts to maximize your savings and get the cheapest possible premium.
You can verify your discount by reviewing your policy online. Contact GEICO customer service if you need help with the good student discount.
## **Other GEICO Discounts to Consider**
