### Allstate vs. Farmers: rates for high-risk drivers
If you've got an [at-fault collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/how-is-fault-determined-car-accident/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation, or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, Farmers could be a better choice than Allstate. Each car insurance company enacts rate penalties differently, so it's worth comparing quotes to understand which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: FARMERS VS. ALLSTATE
**Citation** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $3,006 | $2,334  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $1,699  
DUI/DWI | $3,637 | $3,239  
Reckless driving | $3,388 | $4,636  
Speeding ticket | $2,256 | $2,045  
### Allstate vs. Farmers: rates by age
Insurance companies rely on age to outline potential risk, assigning rates on a sliding scale. Insurance is commonly priciest for teen drivers — due to their inexperience — and relatively affordable for drivers aged 25 or older. Since every insurance company rates ages uniquely, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose Allstate instead of Farmers: ALLSTATE offers average yearly savings of $76, compared to Farmers.
##### RATES BY AGE: FARMERS VS. ALLSTATE
**Age tier** | **Allstate avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $6,442 | $6,518  
**20s** | $2,636 | $2,020  
**30s** | $2,636 | $2,020  
**40s** | $1,912 | $1,511  
**50s** | $1,893 | $1,507  
**60s** | $1,768 | $1,402  
Costs aside, Allstate and Farmers each have pros and cons: ranging from their customer satisfaction ratings to their discount programs and various policy extras.

## Telematics options: Allstate vs. Farmers
Both insurers offer [telematics](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/)-powered policies. The companies' offerings are similar, offering initial savings with the opportunity for a higher discount with good driving practices. Also worth noting is Allstate's pay-per-mile program, Milewise, which works in a similar fashion but is intended for [low-mileage drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/other-factors/car-insurance-low-mileage-drivers/). See more information about each company's [mobile app](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-apps-websites/) below. 
Allstate Drivewise
Allstate Drivewise relies on a mobile app to track customers' driving. In addition to receiving 3% cashback for signing up, drivers can potentially earn discounts and rate reductions by driving safely. Interestingly, Allstate's app is available to both policyholders and "non-customers" alike to view driving data and receive feedback.
Allstate Milewise
Allstate's [pay-per-mile insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/) program, Milewise, could benefit low-mileage drivers. Mileage is tracked using a plug-in device. Allstate plans to expand Milewise to additional locations.
Farmers Insurance Signal
Signal is the telematics option from Farmers. The company advertises a 5% discount for signing up, with the promise of up to 15% savings for qualifying drivers. The company also offers an additional 10% savings for drivers under the age of 25 who enroll. 
Unique amongst telematics programs, drivers enrolled in Farmers Signal — with a driving score of at least 80% — are also eligible to win up to $100 in rewards every month. Signal is not available in every state, and further restrictions may be imposed depending on where you live. 
### Zebra Tip: Opt for Allstate if you're looking for telematics
* * *
Allstate's combination of pay-per-mile and telematics-powered insurance policies — along with its wider availability — makes it a better option for most drivers. If you're a low-mileage driver, you'll definitely want to look into Allstate's options.

## Roadside assistance: Allstate vs. Farmers
No one wants to find themselves broken down on the side of the road. A good roadside assistance program can help you get back on the road. Compare the [roadside assistance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/roadside-assistance-comparison/) programs available from both Allstate and Farmers below.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
