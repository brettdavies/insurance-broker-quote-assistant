Whether you're taking a road trip on Route 66 or heading to work, car insurance in Oklahoma can help protect you and your vehicle. Explore Oklahoma's auto insurance requirements and optional coverages and discounts available through Progressive.
## What are Oklahoma's minimum auto insurance requirements?
Drivers in Oklahoma are required to have [auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) ([BI liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/) and [PD liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/)) at the following minimum car insurance limits:
### Coverage
Coverage |  What it covers |  Minimum amount  
---|---|---  
**Bodily injury liability** |  What it covers Injuries you cause to others in an accident |  Minimum amount $25,000 per person   
$50,000 per accident  
**Property damage liability** |  What it covers Damage you cause to other people's property in an accident |  Minimum amount $25,000 per accident  
Oklahoma also requires insurers to offer [uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM)](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) bodily injury coverage with the following limits, though you may reject or lower these coverages via a signed form if you do not want them.
### Coverage
Coverage |  What it covers |  Minimum amount  
---|---|---  
**UM/UIM bodily injury** |  What it covers Your medical expenses an uninsured or underinsured driver causes |  Minimum amount $25,000 per person   
$50,000 per accident  
While these are Oklahoma's minimum [required car insurance limits](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-limits/), higher coverage amounts may better protect your family's financial well-being. Learn [how much car insurance you may need](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) based on your circumstances and preferences.
### Is Oklahoma a no-fault state?
No. Oklahoma is an at-fault state, which means the party responsible for an accident must cover the injuries of the other driver and their passengers. Learn more about [what happens if you're at fault in an accident](https://www.progressive.com/answers/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/).
## How much is car insurance in Oklahoma?
The average cost of a liability-only Progressive auto policy in Oklahoma (single driver/single car) was $87.15 per month in 2022-2023.[*Read the associated disclosure for this claim.](https://www.progressive.com/auto/state/oklahoma-car-insurance/#ToolTipDialog) However, your car insurance premium in Oklahoma will ultimately depend on unique factors like your driving history, address, coverage selection, and discounts. Learn more about common [car insurance cost factors](https://www.progressive.com/answers/average-car-insurance-cost/).

## Additional car insurance coverages to consider
If you're leasing or financing a vehicle, most lenders require you to carry [comprehensive auto coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) in addition to Oklahoma's state-required coverages. Comprehensive and collision pay to repair or replace your car, regardless of fault, if it's in an accident, stolen, or otherwise damaged as the result of a covered accident. It also makes sense to add these physical damage coverages if you're not sure you could afford a new car or major repairs after a collision.
Explore all our [car insurance coverages](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/), and our [car insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/calculator/) to find which ones are recommended for you.
