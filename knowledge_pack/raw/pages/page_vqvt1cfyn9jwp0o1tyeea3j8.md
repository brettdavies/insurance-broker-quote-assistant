## Resources & Methodology
## Methodology
In the fall of 2024, Insure.com surveyed more than 1,750 insurance consumers (1,199 people with auto insurance). Online market research company Slice MR conducted the survey. Respondents were asked to name their auto insurer and then grade it in the following categories: 
  * Customer satisfaction
  * Ease of service
  * Policy offerings
  * Claims satisfaction
  * Digital experience (website/app)
  * Discounts offered
  * Fair rate increases over time
  * Insurance for young drivers/teenagers
  * Insurance for college students
  * Insurance for senior drivers
  * Insurance for drivers with tickets or accidents
  * Auto and home bundling


The percentage of respondents who said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their insurer is presented in the results.
We then asked respondents to provide a yes or no response to indicate their agreement with the following statements: 
  * I plan to renew with my current auto insurance company
  * I would recommend my auto insurance company to others
  * I trust my auto insurance company


The percentage of respondents who said yes is presented in the results.The editors compiled the survey results and then selected – based on the number of survey responses – the top companies for further evaluation. 
They then collected AM Best data, which measure financial strength, and National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ complaint data, which ranks a company by the number of customer complaints it receives. The Insure.com team identified the NAIC codes of each underwriting company for each carrier and calculated a weighted average complaint index, weighted by the annual written premium. The associated NAIC complaint index score was used in the calculations. 
They also collected insurance rate data from Quadrant Information Services. With the help of Prof. David Marlett, Ph.D., Managing Director of the Brantley Risk and Insurance Center at Appalachian State University, the editors created a rating system to determine which insurance companies were best in each sector. For auto insurers, we took the following and gave each a weight. 
  * Survey: 40% of the total score (10% customer satisfaction, 10% recommended, 10% renewal rate and 10% claims handling)
  * AM Best: 25% of total score
  * Annual premium: 20% of total score
  * NAIC: 15% of total score


Each insurer was awarded between half a star and 5 stars. No company in the ranking received less than half a star in any category, and 5 stars was the most any insurer could receive.
