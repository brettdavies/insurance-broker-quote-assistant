# Student Car Insurance Discounts
UPDATED: June 20, 2025 
Share:
[ ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fstudent-car-insurance-discounts%2F) [ ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Student+Car+Insurance+Discounts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fstudent-car-insurance-discounts%2F)
Students can save on car insurance through special discounts like good grades, completing driver education courses, and living away at school. For example, maintaining a “B” average (3.0 GPA) can earn a good student discount of 10%–25%, potentially saving hundreds of dollars annually.
Other discounts are available for safe driving programs and when a student driver lives over 100 miles from home without a car. In short, responsible students are viewed as lower-risk, which results in lower insurance rates. 
Call[773-202-5060](tel:773-202-5060) to learn more or get a quote.
## **Who Qualifies for a Student Discount?**
Student car insurance discounts are typically available to young drivers (high school or college-aged) who meet specific criteria. The main qualifications include:
  * **Age & Status**: Generally, students aged 16–24 who are full-time high school or college students (undergraduate or sometimes graduate). Students must be unmarried.  

  * **Academic Performance** : A “B” average (3.0 GPA) or higher is often required. Insurers may also accept equivalent achievements like being on the honor roll, dean’s list, or achieving top percentiles on standardized tests.  

  * **Verification** : Proof of grades is necessary. This can be a report card, transcript, or a letter of enrollment (for college students).  

  * **Home-Schooled Students** : Homeschoolers can qualify by providing standardized test scores (like SAT or ACT) in the top 20th percentile or a certification of academic achievement.  

  * **Additional Criteria** : Some insurers require students to be listed on their parent or guardian’s policy, and others may ask for a clean driving record (no recent accidents or violations).  



**Why do insurers offer these discounts?****  
**Insurers view students who excel academically as responsible individuals, thus reducing the risk they pose on the road. They offer discounts as a reward for good habits.
## **Types of Student Discounts Available**
### **Good Student Discount**
The **Good Student Discount** rewards students with strong academic performance.
  * **Eligibility** : Full-time high school or college students under 25 with a GPA of 3.0 or better, or equivalent achievements (honor roll, top 20% of the class, etc.).  

  * **Typical Savings** : Discounts typically range from 5% to 25%. For example, State Farm offers up to 25%, while GEICO’s discount is about 15%. The average discount is around 10–15%.  

  * **How to Get It** : Submit report cards or transcripts when starting the policy or adding a student driver, and again at renewal. If the grades fall below the requirement, the discount will be removed at the next renewal.  



### **Distant Student Discount (Student Away at School)**
If a college student lives more than 100 miles away from home and doesn’t take a car to campus, they may qualify for an **away-at-school** discount.
  * **Eligibility** : The student must attend school 100+ miles from home and leave the car behind.  

  * **Typical Savings** : Expect a discount of 10%–30% for the student’s portion of the premium, depending on the insurer.  

  * **How it Works** : Notify the insurer that the student is away at school and does not use the vehicle. This reduces the frequency of use and, in turn, the risk.  

  * **Verification** : Provide proof of enrollment and the student’s college address.  



### **Driver’s Ed or Safe Driving Program Discounts**
Insurance companies offer discounts for young drivers who complete driver education or safe driving programs.
  * **Driver Education Discount** : After completing an approved driver education course or defensive driving class, young drivers can get discounts of 5% to 15%.  

  * **Safe Driving Programs** : Insurers may offer discounts for completing safe driving programs like State Farm’s Steer Clear or Allstate’s teenSMART.  



## **How Much Can You Save?**
Student discounts can result in significant savings, and the amount depends on the insurer, the discounts you qualify for, and your location. Here’s an overview:
  * **Good Student Discount** : Save 10%–25%, with an average of 12%.  

  * **Distant Student Discount** : Save 10%–30%.  

  * **Driver’s Ed Discount** : Save 5%–15%.  



Combining discounts (like good student and distant student) can result in up to 30% off or more.
## **How to Apply for a Student Discount**
To secure these discounts, follow these steps:
  1. **Ask During Quotes or Renewal** : Mention that the driver is a student when getting a quote, and ask about available discounts.  

  2. **Provide Academic Documentation** : Submit recent transcripts or report cards to prove eligibility.  

  3. **Show Enrollment (if needed)** : Provide proof of enrollment for college students.  

  4. **Submit Driver Training Certificates** : If completing a driver’s ed or safe driving program, send the certificate to your insurer.  



Ensure eligibility is maintained, and update your insurer with new grades or enrollment status at each renewal.
## **Frequently Asked Questions**
