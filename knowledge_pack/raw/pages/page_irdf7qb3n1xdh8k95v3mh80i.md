# How roadside assistance coverage may help save you money in the long run
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Consider the estimated out-of-pocket costs for emergency roadside services with the price of roadside assistance coverage. 
**_Overview:_**_Adding roadside assistance coverage to your auto policy may help save you money in the long run by turning unpredictable roadside emergencies into manageable expenses. Instead of facing high out-of-pocket charges for services like towing, lockouts or jump-starts, this coverage may offer financial advantages and help ensure greater confidence behind the wheel._
When it comes to managing your auto expenses, one question often comes up: Is [roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/emergency-road-service-coverage) worth the cost? While it can be easy to see the sense of security it may offer, many drivers may overlook its potential as a smart financial choice. Let’s dive into how roadside assistance coverage can be a cost-effective choice by helping shield you from unexpected expenses.

## The cost of roadside emergencies without coverage
Imagine you're on a road trip and your [car suddenly breaks down](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down). Without roadside assistance coverage, you might find yourself facing hefty out-of-pocket costs for services like towing, [jump-starts](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car) or lockouts. Here’s a peek at what [these expenses could look like](https://www.marketwatch.com/insurance-services/auto-insurance/how-much-is-roadside-assistance/):
Emergency service type
Estimated out-of-pocket cost*
Towing (local)
$75 - $200+
Flat tire change (labor)
$50 - $100
Lockout service
$50 - $150
Jump-start
$50 - $100
[Fuel delivery](https://www.yelp.com/costs/roadside_assistance)
$50 - $75 (+ cost of fuel)
(*These costs can vary widely based on your location, the time of day and the service provider.)  
  

Consider how these possible one-time repair costs stack up against the average price of roadside assistance coverage. In many cases, you can add roadside assistance to your auto insurance for a modest extra fee. The average cost for roadside assistance from State Farm is $10-$20 per year. This more affordable expense can help you avoid the risk of much higher, unexpected costs if roadside problems arise.
## Helping keep your car budget predictable
One advantage of roadside assistance coverage is the predictability it may bring to [your budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown). Rather than worrying about a sudden big bill for a single incident, you pay a small, regular premium that can help protect you from surprise expenses and can offer more confidence on the road.
Roadside assistance typically covers common incidents like towing, dead batteries, [flat tires](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care) and lockouts, making it a practical choice for many drivers. By transforming unpredictable, often costly emergencies into manageable expenses, roadside assistance coverage may be a smart addition to your auto policy.
## Is roadside assistance coverage worth the investment?
While there are many [reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/reasons-you-might-want-roadside-assistance-coverage), the optional add-on also has benefits that may outweigh the cost. Though it may be tempting to consider a [DIY car repair](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/benefits-of-roadside-assistance), coverage can help you avoid hidden safety risks. Further, it’s not just about having a sense of security — it's about making a decision that may help protect you from the unpredictable.
So, the next time you’re reviewing your [auto insurance options](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options), consider how roadside assistance coverage can be a valuable addition to your policy. When you use this coverage, a claim will likely be filed. Talk to your insurance company about how this may impact your policy.
