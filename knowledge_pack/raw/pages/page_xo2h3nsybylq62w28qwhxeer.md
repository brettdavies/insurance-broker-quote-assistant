## Large hail, damaging winds possible after midnight
The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/ewx/) is warning that more severe storms could develop late Thursday and continue into early Friday morning. This is because a weather disturbance — basically a ripple of energy in the upper atmosphere — is moving through northwest Texas.

This disturbance will interact with a cold front that’s moving south, helping to trigger scattered thunderstorms across West Texas during Thursday afternoon and evening, and will move into the southern Edward Plateau and Hill Country after midnight.
Severe storms within the complex may produce large hail and damaging winds.
"In addition to the severe threat, pockets of high [rainfall](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=rainfall) rates are [likely](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=likely) but impossible to determine exactly where in this [mesoscale](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=mesoscale) environment," the National Weather Service office wrote in the forecast. "This could lead to [isolated](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=isolated) instances of [flash](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=flash) flooding, especially if the heavier rates set up across any areas that have received heavy [rainfall](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=rainfall) the past few days (eastern Hill Country and I-35 corridor from San Antonio through Austin)."

Chances for showers and thunderstorms continue Friday night into Saturday as mid-level moisture from Tropical Storm Alvin, the first named storm of 2025, over the eastern Pacific is expected to stream northward across Mexico toward the Rio Grande and potentially reach Central Texas.
"Some of this [moisture](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=moisture) may reinforce shower activity along a stalling frontal boundary, and [ensemble](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=ensemble) guidance indicates that a transient west-east oriented [trough](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=trough) axis over northern Mexico may also help enhance [divergence](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=divergence) aloft over our area," the forecast states. "While the bulk of the tropical [moisture](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=moisture) is more [likely](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=likely) to be to our south given generally northwesterly mid-level [flow](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=flow), there is decent medium-range support for [isolated](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=isolated) to [scattered](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=scattered) showers and storms over our region Saturday."
