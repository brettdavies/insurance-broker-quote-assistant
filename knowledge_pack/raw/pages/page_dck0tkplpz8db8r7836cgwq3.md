If you want to buy auto insurance the old-fashioned way, meaning through a human being, then you have two options: an auto insurance agent or broker.
Brokers survey all of the insurance carriers out there, get quotes from each, and make a recommendation for you. Thave the distinct advantage of being loyal primarily to you, the customer. Insurance agents work for specific insurance providers and can present policies from those providers only. Of course, brokers also have some disadvantages, like broker’s fees.
We’ll help you figure out if using a broker is worth it.
## Auto Insurance Brokers
First, let’s define what an insurance broker is.
### What Is a Car Insurance Broker?
A car insurance broker is someone who acts as a middleman between the customer and insurance companies. They get car insurance quotes from different companies, compare the terms and rates, and then present their findings to the customer to help them make an informed decision.  
![What Is a Car Insurance Broker](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2F23210328%2FWhat-Is-a-Car-Insurance-Broker.png&w=1920&q=75)
### Types of Car Insurance Brokers
While you’re most likely work with a retail broker, there are three types of brokers:
  * **Retail brokers** : Retail brokers work with buyers directly, soliciting policies from many different [auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/).
  * **Wholesale brokers** : Wholesale brokers are the middlemen between retail brokers and auto insurance companies to help them find more specialized policies, like a high-limit commercial policy. By definition, you won’t work with a wholesale broker as a regular auto insurance customer.
  * **Surplus-line brokers** : Finally, surplus-line brokers are the middlemen between wholesale brokers and surplus-line and excess insurance carriers. They look for policies with complex coverages and high limits, as well as those that cover new ventures or dangerous activities like long-haul trucking. Similar to wholesale brokers, you’ll never work with a surplus-line broker to buy personal auto insurance.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/brokers/#citation-1)


### Who Pays Car Insurance Brokers?
Brokers make money in two ways:
  * **Commissions** : When you buy an insurance policy, the broker will receive a percentage of the premium. Companies pay brokers’ commissions, not customers.
  * **Fees** : Some brokers charge broker fees on top of the commissions. In contrast to commissions, customers pay broker fees, not companies.


## Pros and Cons of Using an Auto Insurance Broker
While it may make sense to use an auto insurance broker, an [agent](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agents/) might be a better choice for some people. Let’s break down the advantages and disadvantages of using a [broker versus an agent](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/agent-vs-broker/). 
### Pros
  * **Compare rates** : Brokers let you compare insurance from many different companies without having to [obtain the quotes](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/compare/) yourself. As anyone who’s tried to switch auto insurance knows, this can be a pretty time-consuming process.
  * **Has your best interests** : Since the broker isn’t tied to any particular company, unlike a captive agent, they have your best interests in mind. A captive agent is an agent that works with a single carrier, such as State Farm.
  * **More specialized** : By working with wholesale and surplus-line brokers, brokers can offer more niche policies that regular independent or captive agents cannot. 


### Cons
  * **Broker’s fees** : While agents don’t cost anything to the customer, some brokers charge additional fees on top of their commissions, which can be as high as $250. 
  * **Confusing options** : Sometimes having too many choices can be a bad thing, especially if your broker isn’t explaining them clearly. Of course, this will differ based on the broker you’re working with. 


## Do I Need a Broker to Buy Car Insurance?
You do not need a broker to buy car insurance; rather, you can use an agent or buy from a car insurance carrier directly either over the phone or online. But if you’ve decided to use a broker to buy your insurance, keep reading below to learn how to pick one.
More and more carriers are offering auto insurance online, where you can complete the entire transaction without interacting with a human. Get an [online quote](https://www.autoinsurance.com/quotes/online/) today.
## How to Choose an Auto Insurance Broker
![How to Choose an Auto Insurance Broker](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2F23210443%2FHow-to-Choose-an-Auto-Insurance-Broker.png&w=1920&q=75)  
Thanks to the internet, you can find a reliable auto insurance broker in no time. Here’s how:
  1. **Do your research**. Research brokers in your area by reading customers’ reviews on Yelp or Google. Also, check the Better Business Bureau for ratings and customer complaints.[2](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/brokers/#citation-2)
  2. **Verify credentials**. Before you contact them, verify the broker’s credentials with your state’s insurance department. See below for the contact information.

  1. **Hire someone** : Once you’ve verified that your insurance broker has good reviews and is accredited, contact them and set up an appointment. From there, they can help you find the right policy for you.[3](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/brokers/#citation-3)


Some examples of insurance brokers that we have reviewed on AutoInsurance.com include [Insurify](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/insurify/reviews/) and [Experian](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/experian/reviews/).
## Agents vs. Brokers
What does an insurance agent do, and how does it differ from what brokers do? See the major similarities and differences between agents and brokers below.
### Key Similarities
  * **Help you find insurance** : Both agents and brokers help you find auto insurance. Captive agents work for one company, while independent agents work with multiple carriers, similar to brokers.
  * **Advise you** : Both agents and brokers are experts on auto insurance and can help you find the best policy for your vehicle.
  * **Make commissions** : Both agents and brokers earn commissions when policies are underwritten. The companies pay these commissions at no cost to you, the customer.


![Agents vs. Brokers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2F23210612%2FAgents-vs.-Brokers.png&w=1920&q=75)
### Key Differences
  * **Whom they work for** : While agents work for insurance carriers directly, brokers work for consumers.
  * **Which carriers they represent** : Agents can present quotes only from insurance providers they’re associated with, while brokers can present quotes from all carriers. That means that you’ll get a wider range of choices through a broker than through an agent.
  * **Broker’s fees** : Only brokers charge fees, while agents are paid commissions only. That means that you may have to pay for a broker, while agents are always free to the customer.
  * **Completing vs. facilitating transactions** : Only agents can actually put policies in force; brokers merely act as middlemen.[4](https://www.autoinsurance.com/articles/brokers/#citation-4)
  * **Customer service** : With an agent, even after you’ve purchased your policy, you’ll still work with them if you have any questions, need to [file a claim](https://www.autoinsurance.com/claims/), or need to add coverages. With a broker, you won’t work with them when the transaction is over, so the customer service post-sale might be limited. For higher average rates of claims satisfaction, look for agents over brokers.


If you’re looking for the cheapest auto insurance but don’t mind paying a one-time fee, go with a broker, who can show you more options than an agent. But if customer service is more important to you post-sale, agents are a better choice.

## FAQs
Keep reading to get all of your insurance broker questions answered.
What does an auto insurance broker do?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
An auto insurance broker connects auto owners and lessees and auto insurance companies, helping customers find the right insurance products and services for their vehicles. They will provide quotes and let customers know which companies offer discounts.
Is insurance cheaper if you go through a broker?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Auto insurance probably may or may not be cheaper if you go through a broker. It may be cheaper because they can present every carrier available to you, not just the ones they’re appointed with, unlike agents. However, you may have to pay a broker’s fee to a broker, which could make it more expensive than buying insurance from an agent, paid by commissions solely.
When should I use an auto insurance broker?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
You should use an auto insurance broker if you want to see policies from every carrier on the market. Agents can show you quotes only for the carriers they’re appointed with, so your options are more limited.
Who pays an insurance broker?
![Navigation chevron](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-chevron-down.svg)
Insurance brokers receive commissions from insurance companies and, in some cases, broker’s fees from customers.
