## What do people ask about GEICO Insurance?
### Why does GEICO keep raising prices?
If your GEICO car insurance rate is going up on every renewal, there are number of possible culprits, including changes in your driver profile or household. If there are no changes, however, the rate increases are likely due to across-the-board rate hikes that are being seen with every company as a result of the increased costs of parts and labor as well as increased severe weather. As insurance companies have to pay out more in claims, they raise their rates to make up for it.
### Why can’t I get auto insurance with GEICO?
Car insurance companies turn down applications when the driver doesn’t meet the company’s requirements for coverage. This is usually due to risk; a driver who presents a risk that’s unacceptable to the company’s underwriting department will be declined. If you have been turned down online, call GEICO directly to discuss the issue and find out if the decision can be reversed.
### Is GEICO a good insurance company?
In our survey, GEICO ranked very well for customer satisfaction.
Although the company did not rank in the top half for auto claims satisfaction in the [2024 J.D.
