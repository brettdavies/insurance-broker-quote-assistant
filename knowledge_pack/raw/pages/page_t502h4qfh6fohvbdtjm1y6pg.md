Comprehensive insurance is auto insurance that covers damage to a vehicle from non-collision events.
##  What Is Comprehensive Insurance? 
Comprehensive insurance is a type of automobile insurance that covers damage to your car from causes other than a collision. This type of insurance will cover your vehicle if it is hit by a tornado, dented by a run-in with a deer, spray-painted by a vandal, damaged by a break-in, or many other losses. 
This type of insurance is usually required when financing a car from a lender, but it may not make financial sense for vehicles owned outright. Read on to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of comprehensive insurance coverage. 
### Key Takeaways
  * Comprehensive insurance covers damages to a car from non-collision events, such as natural disasters, theft, vandalism, and animal encounters, making it an essential coverage for various uncontrollable situations.  

  * While comprehensive insurance is optional if you own your vehicle outright, it is often required by lenders if the car is financed, ensuring the asset is protected until the loan is repaid.  

  * The cost of comprehensive insurance can vary significantly based on factors like vehicle value, location, and personal driving history, with average premiums ranging from $134 to approximately double that amount annually.  

  * Opting for higher deductibles in comprehensive insurance can lead to lower premiums, a strategy that can be beneficial if you believe the likelihood of filing a claim is minimal.  

  * Comprehensive insurance does not cover collision-related damages or personal property theft from inside the car, which are important exclusions to be aware of when choosing coverage.  



##  Comprehensive Insurance Explained 
Comprehensive insurance, [collision insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collision-insurance.asp), and [liability insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability_insurance.asp) are the three components of an automobile insurance policy. In most states, the law requires drivers to carry a stated amount of liability insurance, but collision and comprehensive insurance are optional if someone owns a vehicle outright.1 If a person has financed the vehicle, the auto loan company might require comprehensive insurance, plus perhaps [uninsured motorist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uninsured-motorist-coverage-um.asp) or [gap insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapinsurance.asp).2

##  Comparing Comprehensive and Collision Insurance 
It can make sense to have comprehensive car insurance if you're buying a brand-new car, regardless of whether you finance it or pay cash. Comprehensive coverage can protect you against minor and major damages caused by things beyond your control, regardless of whatever coverage you may have that extends to accidents. Collision coverage costs an average of $290 a year.4
Your location can influence the decision to get comprehensive coverage. Consider comprehensive insurance if you live in rural areas with frequent animal collisions or stormy regions with hail. The same is true if you live in a higher-crime part of town where break-ins and theft occur regularly. 
Collision insurance protects you in a single-car rollover, a collision with another vehicle, or a collision with an object. It does not cover break-ins, thefts, or weather-related damage. If you lease a car, you'll be required to purchase collision insurance. Collision insurance comes in handy when you get into an accident to help pay for your vehicle's repair, and it covers any damage to your car due to potholes in the road.5
Sometimes comprehensive insurance is referred to as "other than collision." Neither insurance will cover medical bills from an accident or damage to another person's vehicle if you are in an accident.56
### Tip
When purchasing comprehensive coverage or any other type of car insurance, be sure to compare the [best car insurance companies](https://www.investopedia.com/best-car-insurance-companies-4783675) to find the most affordable rates.
##  Understanding the Cost of Comprehensive Insurance 
Comprehensive covers damage from non-accident events and disasters. The average cost of comprehensive insurance is about $134 per year and can be higher depending on your state.3
Collision and comprehensive insurance each have their own [deductibles](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-a-deductible-in-car-insurance-7486896), so a driver can choose different deductibles based on perceived risk levels in each of these areas. (Liability insurance has no deductible.) 
If someone thinks they’re not likely to file a comprehensive [claim](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp), but they don’t want to forego comprehensive insurance altogether, they could choose a relatively high $1,000 deductible to lower the [premiums](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp). The higher a vehicle’s cash value, the more expensive a comprehensive insurance policy will be. 
Understanding how insurance companies determine driver [risk classes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-risk-class.asp) can help you estimate what you might pay for comprehensive coverage. Where you live, your driving record, and your coverage amounts can determine how much you pay for car insurance, including comprehensive coverage. 
### Fast Fact
The most expensive state to insure a car in is New York, where the average driver spends $1,511 on full car insurance each year. The least expensive stateis North Dakota, where drivers pay just $692 per year on average to insure their vehicles.
##  Pros and Cons of Comprehensive Insurance 
Comprehensive auto insurance [protects you financially](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance-7496593) from theft, natural accidents, and weather-related damage. This means you won't end up paying out of pocket if a tree falls on your car or a thief steals your catalytic converter. 
There are downsides. If you are in an accident, comprehensive insurance won't pay for the damage: collision coverage does. Buying comprehensive and collision insurance together can be costly. If your vehicle is older and paid off, you could save money by not purchasing comprehensive coverage, especially if theft and weather-related events are not concerns where you live. 
Pros
  * Comprehensive coverage protects you against theft, weather-related events, and other major losses beyond your control.
  * It often covers "unforeseen events" like break-ins and windshield damage from hail.
  * If you own a new car and live in a high-crime area, comprehensive insurance will cover the damages caused by any break-ins or thefts.
  * Comprehensive coverage pays for covered losses regardless of who is at fault.  



Cons
  * Comprehensive insurance doesn't cover damage caused by a collision.
  * It may not be necessary to have for an older car with high mileage.
  * Comprehensive insurance doesn't cover anything personal stolen from your car.
  * It doesn't cover damage due to potholes.
  * Comprehensive coverage might cost more than it is worth in certain situation (such as your car's value falling below the deductible)


##  Example of Comprehensive Insurance 
Comprehensive insurance works similarly to other types of auto insurance if you need to file a claim. If you've never had to do so, here’s an example showing how comprehensive insurance works if a driver files a claim for vehicle damages. 
Say someone owns and drives a Honda Accord worth $10,000, with a $1,000 comprehensive deductible. If a tornado destroys the car, the driver will receive $9,000 from the insurance company. If they don’t have comprehensive coverage and a tornado destroys the vehicle, the collision and liability portions of the policy won’t cover the damage. 
The owner will be responsible for the entire $10,000 loss. The driver might have to get a loan to purchase a replacement vehicle or settle for something less expensive if they don’t have $10,000 to spend on an equivalent replacement. 
This example shows how valuable comprehensive insurance can be. If you're leaning more toward the "when to drop comprehensive insurance" side, it's helpful to know how much damages may cost you to repair out of pocket. 
## How Does Comprehensive Insurance Work?
Like other forms of auto insurance, comprehensive coverage pays for part of the loss if your car is damaged. The vehicle owner will also have to pay a stated portion of the cost (known as the deductible). The insurance payment can be used for repairs or to purchase a replacement vehicle.
## What Does Comprehensive Auto Insurance Cover?
Comprehensive auto insurance covers any damage to a car [_except_ for damage from a collision](https://www.investopedia.com/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance-7496831). This includes natural hazards (such as deer strikes and falling limbs), as well as fire, weather, natural disasters, theft, and acts of vandalism. However, it does not cover damage caused by a collision with another vehicle, liability when you are at fault for an accident, or injuries to a passenger or another person.3
## How Much Does Comprehensive Auto Insurance Cost?
The cost of a comprehensive insurance policy will vary, based on the value of the vehicle, the zip code where it is registered, and the driver's past insurance history, among other factors. Costs can range from about $134 annually to about twice that much.3
## Is Comprehensive Insurance Worth It?
If you have a car loan, you probably have no choice in the matter. Also, it may not be worthwhile if your vehicle's cash value is low and you have a low deductible. Still, if you can't afford to pay for repairs or replace a damaged car out of your own pocket, it may be worthwhile to add comprehensive coverage.7
## Does Comprehensive Insurance Cover Damage From Potholes?
No, comprehensive insurance doesn't cover any damage to your car due to potholes in the road. However, collision insurance does, since it covers any damage due to collision with an object.8
##  The Bottom Line 
You might decide to skip comprehensive insurance if you've paid for your vehicle in full, you can’t afford the coverage, you own an older automobile that a low value, or you prefer to self-insure. 
However, remember that forgoing comprehensive coverage means you could end up with a steep repair bill if your car is damaged. In addition, lenders require it for financing. Buyers should carefully consider the risks in their area, as well as the costs, before determining what type of insurance to get.
