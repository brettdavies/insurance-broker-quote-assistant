**Bankrate’s take:** Broadly, car insurance rates are a calculation of risk: if you pose a higher risk of filing a claim with your insurance provider, it is likely your insurer will charge you more for your policy. That is why men typically pay more for car insurance than women: [statistics](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females) show that men are more likely to drive dangerously and engage in risky practices, which in turn could lead to an expensive claim.
### Cost considerations for young drivers in Oregon
Car insurance rates vary for young drivers on their own policy compared to drivers on their parents’ policy. The average cost of car insurance in Oregon will likely be cheaper for younger drivers if they choose to remain on their parents’ policy instead of purchasing their own.

## How to save on car insurance in Oregon
Car insurance rates in Oregon are not overly expensive, on average, but there are ways you may be able to save even more money and earn a lower premium. Here are some suggestions for getting [cheap car insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheap-car-insurance-companies/):
  * **Get several quotes:** To find the best rate for your coverage preferences, you may want to request multiple car insurance quotes from different carriers. This way, you can evaluate coverage options and pricing to find the right carrier.
  * **Improve your credit score:** If you have a [poor credit score](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-bad-credit/), you may pay a higher car insurance premium. Raising your credit score, even by a few points, can help you get a lower rate.
  * **Pay your premium in ful** l: Paying your premium upfront and in full may help you get a cheaper rate, if you can afford the out-of-pocket cost.
  * **Take a defensive driver course:** Many insurance companies offer a discount to drivers who complete an approved defensive driver or driver safety course.
  * **Raise your deductibles:** Increasing your [comprehensive and collision deductibles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-deductible/) can lower your premium. Just make sure you can afford a higher deductible if you need to file a claim.
  * **Switch carriers:** If you find a different insurance company that can offer you a better deal, you can usually [switch carriers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/switching-carriers/) during your policy period. You’ll want to check if your current insurer has any fees associated with policy cancellation.


## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company in Oregon?
Caret Down Icon
There’s no single [best car insurance company in Oregon](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/oregon/) since insurance is unique for every driver. To help you identify the best provider for you, consider what you value from an insurance company. For instance, if you have a prior incident on your driving record, you might want a company that offers affordable coverage to high-risk drivers. If you work from home, you might look for a company that offers usage-based insurance or a good telematics discount. Once you’ve narrowed down providers, you can request several quotes to compare coverage and cost.
  * ###  What is the cheapest car insurance company in Oregon?

Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.

We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
