#  Just got denied renter's insurance by Geico--anyone else? 
[ Living  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/?f=flair_name%3A%22Living%22)
Given everything that's happened, I realized how crazy I've been to not have renter's insurance. It's so cheap, and will give me a lot of piece of mind, not so much because I think my area is going to be affected by the fires (I live on Wilshire and La Brea, nowhere near any parks or brush) but because anything crazy could happen at any time and I'd like to have money to replace my stuff. I have auto insurance through GEICO, so I called them, and after being on hold for quite a while, the agent told me there is a restriction in my area and she couldn't offer me a policy at this time. I got a little angry, and all she did was repeat "I can't off you a policy at this time." 
Is this even legal?? Has anyone else tried to get renter's insurance recently? What a shitty, greedy company. I want to file a complaint but don't know who I should call.

Many carriers will be in a moratorium on writing new policies until the fires reach X% containment (X may differ by carrier). There’s no legal requirement for GEICO to issue you a policy, ergo no basis for a legal complaint. It’d be much different if you’d had a policy with them and they were non renewing or so on. 
  1. Call an independent insurance broker, who reps multiple companies. Hit Google Maps to find a couple, call them see who you gel with. They may know a carrier willing to write coverage. 
  2. Call California Dept of Insurance. Google the site. They have a help line. Be prepared to wait, as people with claims are likely calling non stop to get help. They may know carriers willing to write you a policy. 


YMMV. Good luck. 
_edit to add_ CA DOI site to help you find carriers AND brokers; geared to homeowner coverage but similar concept for renters. <https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/5-residential/Top10Tips_FindingResidentialIns.cfm>

There’s an active disaster happening here, of course they’re not going to insure you right now. There’s most likely a Moratorium to prevent new insurance policies. If they insured during an active disaster, they could face huge losses from fraud and/or major damages. It sucks but I don’t think it’s illegal. Double check with our state law though.

Hello, I’d like health insurance please! 
Sir, your intestines are hanging out of your body 
Oh these? They’re always like this, I just like to get them some fresh air every once in a while, so what’s the monthly, like 400? Great, I’ll take it. 
Do you want to pay monthly or annually? It’s cheaper if you pay annually. 
Monthly please

No one is going to give you a policy right now. You must not have been here for the Northridge Quake - it devastated insurance companies. This will be worse. Try again in six months when we see which insurance companies survive. (And there’s little chance they’ll be offering fire policies.)

I'm surprised you were able to lease your apartment without it? I was required to obtain a renter's insurance policy when I signed my lease and my apartment had a carrier they work with so they just signed me up for me.

Calling the company shitty or greedy for not willing to take a losing bet is infantile. As for getting angry at the hapless agent who was only communicating their policy to you... you should be grateful that they don't kick you off their auto insurance too.

Just tried Resident Shield after being denied by Progressive, AAA, and Geico. I got a policy!! It's about $250 more a year than the initial quote from GEICO, but that's fine, it will help my anxiety a lot.

I pay like an additional $15/mo to my auto insurance for renters, both with State Farm. There’s no reason not to have it. We throw away money on all types of “insurance”, it’s just another one to add to the pile. That being said, if you don’t have health or car insurance, it’s time to join that scam as well! 💕🫶🏼

I actually just got approved through Geico this week. Ive had renters insurance forever but apparently Progressive dropped it at some point. So great. Progressive denied me despite not notifying me my policy was cancelled. Lord knows how long ive been without it. Maybe try applying directly from Assurance, which is who Geico uses for renters I think. I live close to your area as well;;

I have renters insurance through Geico. Currently pay $440 a year for a $40k policy with earthquake insurance and sewer back-up. I have had the policy for 8 years now though. Totally understand why they aren't issuing new policies right now. Wait 3-6 months and try again once the insurance companies have a better idea of how much these fires are going to cost them.

Even when LA isn’t in an active disaster, some insurance carriers don’t offer renters insurance because of the fire risk. I had to shop around and when I’ve moved to different neighborhoods I have switched renters insurance because my insurance didn’t cover the area I moved to.

A tenant-friendly space meant for posting about both the individual and systemic problems caused by landlordism or, simply put, terrible things landlords do and/or cause. Post personal experiences, articles, memes, etc. Posts seeking advice are also welcome. The sub name is ironic. Landlords are not welcome in this sub. We subscribe to the socialist ideal that housing is a human right.
