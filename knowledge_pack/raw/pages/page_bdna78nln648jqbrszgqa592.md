At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

Very Happy with a Little Trouble Understanding Age-Based Rates

I was told that my insurance goes up due to my age. Isn't that discrimination? They said that my reflexes aren't as good. I have been driving for 64 years with no accidents. I am a safe driver and am on the road daily. I feel this is unfair. No other issues.

Why we picked this company
Safeco, a Liberty Mutual company, has been in business for nearly 100 years. Safeco stands out for some of its optional offerings. If your new car is less than a year old with under 150,000 miles, Safeco’s new vehicle replacement coverage pays the value of a comparable new car if yours is stolen or totaled. Safeco also offers cash back for policyholders who remain claims-free over a six-month review period, as well as a diminishing deductible for being claims-free. The company also scored above average for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.
Pros
  * Pays cash back to customers who remain claims-free
  * Many options for customizing car insurance
  * Accident forgiveness available


Cons
  * May not be the cheapest option for drivers with infractions on their records
  * Customer reviews indicate room for improvement in customer service
  * Higher-than-average number of complaints with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners

## Compare coverages: Safeco vs. State Farm
When shopping for car insurance, you’ll want to consider the type of coverage options you have. Safeco and State Farm offer essential insurance products like [**bodily injury liability**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/), property damage liability, [**personal injury protection**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/pip-insurance/), collision, comprehensive, and uninsured/underinsured motorist policies.
The most significant difference between Safeco and State Farm is that Safeco offers [**gap insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/gap-insurance/), but State Farm doesn’t. Drivers insured with State Farm must purchase gap coverage from another company. While this may not seem like a big issue, having gap coverage through another company can create extra steps for resolving payouts following an accident.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible
