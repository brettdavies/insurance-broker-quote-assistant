If you rent, [renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-renters-insurance/) can cover your belongings from damage, loss or theft and protect you if a visitor gets hurt in your apartment or if you damage their property.
The average renters insurance policy is only about $14 per month, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-renters-insurance).
[CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) has picked [the best companies for renters insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-renters-insurance-companies/#s4qdmSy5mB) based on cost, coverage and more. 
##  What does renters insurance cover?
While homeowners insurance covers damages to the physical dwelling, renters insurance protects your belongings, including clothes, furniture and electronics.   
  
In many cases, your policy is in force even when you’re not at home: If your laptop is stolen from a hotel room, for example, you may be covered.
Coverage | What is does it do?  
---|---  
Personal property | Reimburses the cost to repair or replace clothes, furniture, electronics and other possessions that have been damaged or stolen.  
Liability | Pays for medical expenses or repairs if you are held responsible for damages or injuries to someone else.  
Additional living expenses | Pays for accomodations, meals and other expenses if you are forced to temporarily relocate. Also known as “loss of use” coverage.  
  

Renters insurance typically doesn’t pay out for damages caused by flooding, earthquakes or other natural disasters, nor does it protect your possessions from pests, mold or normal wear and tear.   
  
Physical damage to the dwelling is also not covered and your roommate’s stuff isn’t protected unless you add them to your plan. While a policy can protect your belongings if they’re taken from your car, that doesn’t extend to the vehicle itself.
Like all insurance, a renters policy comes with coverage limits: If you have a high-value bike, camera equipment or other items that exceed your limit, you’ll need to get extra coverage.

##  How much is renters insurance?
The average cost of a renters insurance policy is about $14 a month or $170 a year, according to the most recent data from the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-renters-insurance).
Rates can vary greatly depending on where you live: In New York State, for example, renters insurance averages $25 per month for $50,000 worth of personal property protection, according to the [New York State Department of Financial Services](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/help_for_homeowners/renters_tenants/renters_insurance).
Your specific rate will also depend on the size of your home, the value of your belongings, your claims history and credit score, as well as the coverage limits and deductibles you choose and any add-ons you select.
##  Is renters insurance required?
There are no state or federal laws mandating renters insurance. However, many landlords require tenants to take out a policy and show proof of insurance before moving in, as a part of the lease.
Even if it’s not required, though, renters insurance can be helpful if your belongings are damaged or stolen or if you need to temporarily relocate while your home is being repaired.
Remember, your landlord’s insurance policy doesn’t cover your belongings, just the physical structure of the dwelling.
##  How to save on renters insurance
Renters insurance is generally affordable to begin with, but there are always ways to pay less.
  * **Ask about discounts** : Getting renters insurance from the same provider you have [auto insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance/) or another policy can earn you a discount. Many insurers also offer rate reductions for renters who pay their premiums in whole up front, who haven’t filed a claim in a certain timeframe or for installing safety and security devices.
  * **Raise your deductible** : A higher deductible usually means lower monthly premiums. Just be sure you can afford the additional out-of-pocket cost if you have to file a claim.
  * **Select actual cash value over replacement cost:** A policy that offers replacement cost will pay out more, but it will also cost more. If you live modestly, ACV may be enough to replace lost items.
  * **Improve your credit score** : Insurers in most states are allowed to consider your credit history when deciding on approvals and rates. Paying your bills on time and in full [can boost your credit score](https://www.cnbc.com/select/easy-tips-to-help-raise-your-credit-score/) significantly. And be sure to check your credit reports for errors or fraud.
  * **Shop for the best rate** : Every insurance company considers applicants differently, so get rate quotes from at least three providers available in your area. Make sure they offer the same amount of coverage so you can accurately compare prices.


## Renters insurance FAQs
### How do you file a renters insurance claim?
The process for [filing a renters insurance claim](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-file-renters-insurance-claim/) varies by company but, typically, you’ll need to reach out to your provider with your policy number and photos and other documentation of the damage. If items were stolen, you may need to file a police report.
### Does renters insurance cover bed bugs?
A standard renters insurance policy won’t cover bed bugs or other pests because they’re considered a maintenance issue and not an unexpected event. Depending on where you live, however, your landlord may be responsible for paying for an exterminator or reimbursing you for losses.
### Is renters insurance worth it?
A renters policy can be a lifesaver in the event of a disaster or robbery. Your landlord’s insurance policy only covers the building itself, not your belongings or the cost of a hotel room if you’re displaced. Replacing just a few possessions after a fire could be more expensive than your annual premiums.
