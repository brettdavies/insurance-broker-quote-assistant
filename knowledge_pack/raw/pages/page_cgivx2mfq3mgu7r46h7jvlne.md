# What Vehicle Insurance is Legally Required in Texas?
![](https://www.injurylawyerhouston.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/vehicle-insurance-requirements.jpg)
Checking off the right auto insurance boxes is one of the first steps toward lawful driving in the Lone Star State. Texas uses [a fault system](https://www.injurylawyerhouston.com/how-do-you-prove-fault-in-a-car-accident-lawsuit/), so the driver who causes a crash is on the hook for damages. 
Without proper coverage, even a minor collision can leave you facing tickets, fines, and stiff repair bills. Below, we break down the minimum policies the state demands, explain optional protections that bring added peace of mind, and outline the penalties that come with rolling the dice on [uninsured driving](https://www.injurylawyerhouston.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-accidents-houston-tx/).
## Overview of Mandatory Vehicle Insurance Coverage in Texas
Texas law requires every driver to maintain a liability policy at all times. Proof of that policy must be shown when a vehicle is registered, when plates are renewed, and whenever a police officer requests it. State agencies also use an electronic verification system, so driving without valid insurance can trigger penalties even if you are never pulled over.
If proof cannot be produced, officers issue tickets on the spot. Repeat violations can suspend registration and force drivers to file an SR-22 form for two years. Keeping insurance in force, then, is both a legal and financial safeguard.
## Minimum Liability Insurance Requirements in Texas
A short pause on the road between reading and driving: below lie the dollar amounts every policy must carry. These figures appear on insurance cards in the familiar 30/60/25 shorthand.
  * $30,000 for bodily injury to one person
  * $60,000 for bodily injury per accident
  * $25,000 for property damage per accident


These limits meet the letter of the law, but hospital stays and late-model vehicles often push losses far beyond them. When that happens, an at-fault driver is personally responsible for the balance. Higher limits, such as 100/300/100, cost only a few dollars extra each month yet protect income, savings, and homes from lawsuits.
## Exploring Additional Recommended Coverages
Liability coverage protects others. The next set of options shields you and your car, and many lenders require them until the loan is paid.
### Collision Coverage
Collision pays to fix or replace your car [after a wreck,](https://www.injurylawyerhouston.com/houston-tx-car-accident-lawyer/) even if you caused it. Drivers often lean on this coverage when the other motorist is uninsured or flees the scene.
### Comprehensive Coverage
Comprehensive handles non-crash losses such as hail, flooding, vandalism, fire, or theft. Given Texas’s frequent hailstorms and hurricane activity, this layer often proves its worth.
### Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage
Roughly one in eight Texas drivers carries no insurance. This protection steps in when that uninsured driver hits you, covering both medical bills and car repairs up to the limits you choose.
### Medical Payments Coverage
Medical payments coverage takes care of [health bills for you and your passengers](https://www.injurylawyerhouston.com/how-is-pain-and-suffering-calculated-in-texas-personal-injury-claims/), no matter who caused the crash. It can pay deductibles and co-pays that health insurance leaves behind.
### Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
PIP adds wage loss and certain household expenses to the medical benefits above. [Texas](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/IN/htm/IN.1952.htm) includes $2,500 of PIP by default, though you can sign a waiver to drop it. Keeping the coverage is often the more brilliant financial move.
### Other Optional Coverages
Extra layers, such as rental reimbursement or roadside assistance, save out-of-pocket cash while a car sits in the shop or on the shoulder.
## Consequences of Driving Without Insurance in Texas
Skipping insurance is not a harmless gamble. The state has lined up escalating penalties that quickly dwarf the cost of a basic policy.
  * First offense: $175–$350 fine plus court costs
  * Second or later offenses: $350–$1,000 fine, possible car impoundment, and license suspension
  * SR-22 filing: Required for up to two years after certain convictions, raising premiums
  * Registration suspension: Reinstatement fees and proof of insurance needed before tags return to good standing


One crash while uninsured can also bring civil judgments that empty bank accounts or lead to wage garnishment. Staying covered is the cheaper route by far.
## Texas’s Fault-Based Insurance System
Texas follows a fault model called “modified comparative responsibility.” Each driver is assigned a percentage of blame. If you carry 51 percent or more of that blame, you cannot collect damages from the other party. Strong liability limits and optional first-party coverages therefore provide a safety net when disputes arise over who caused the collision.
