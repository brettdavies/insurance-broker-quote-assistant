## What are the main types of insurance policies?
The main types of insurance you should own typically cover your most valuable assets: your home, car, health, and life. These are the common types of insurance people have:
  * ### Car insurance
[Car insurance](https://www.progressive.com/auto/) may be the most common type of insurance policy, as a minimum of [auto liability coverage is required by law in most states](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/). Depending on your coverages, your auto insurance may pay for non-maintenance vehicle repairs, medical expenses, and damages or injuries you cause to another driver. Learn more about [how car insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-101/).
  * ### Homeowners insurance
[Homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) protects against damage to your home and belongings from covered [perils](https://www.progressive.com/answers/perils-and-hazards/), like theft or hail, and it may pay if you have to live elsewhere while your home is uninhabitable due to a covered loss. It also protects your assets if you're responsible for someone else's injuries or property damage. Find out [how home insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/homeowners-101/).
  * ### Health insurance
Health insurance covers treatment for injuries, illnesses, and health conditions, often including preventative care like annual checkups. Health care costs can add up quickly, so having health insurance is important for helping you afford the care you or your family members may need.
  * ### Life insurance
[Life insurance](https://www.progressive.com/life-insurance/) policies provide financial support to your [beneficiaries](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-beneficiary/), typically your family or loved ones, if you pass away while the policy is active. Your beneficiaries can use the [death benefit](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-death-benefit/) payout they receive any way they wish — to cover your funeral or end-of-life costs, to pay off debt, or to pay for education or daily living costs. There are plenty of [types of life insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-types/) to fit your budget and needs, so learn more about [how life insurance works](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-101/).

## Why do I need insurance?
Insurance is a way to protect you and your loved ones from financial distress — and in many cases it's required by law or financial institutions. These situations commonly require insurance:
  * **To legally drive in most states** : You're required to carry vehicle insurance (auto, motorcycle, or RV), usually a minimum amount of [liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/liability-insurance/) and sometimes [uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/uninsured-motorist-insurance/) and [personal injury protection](https://www.progressive.com/answers/personal-injury-protection/) or [medical payments coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/medical-payments-coverage/).
  * **To get a car loan or lease** : Most car loans require you to carry [auto comprehensive coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/comprehensive-car-insurance/) and [auto collision coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-collision-coverage/) before you qualify for the loan. The same may go for buying an RV, boat, or motorcycle.
  * **To get a mortgage** : Most home mortgage lenders require you to get homeowners insurance or [condo insurance](https://www.progressive.com/condo-insurance/).
  * **To rent an apartment** : Many leasing companies and landlords require their tenants to carry renters insurance.
  * **To get a business loan** : If you own a business and apply for a business loan, the lender may require you to get a [life insurance policy with collateral assignment](https://www.progressive.com/answers/life-insurance-collateral-assignment/).


While not required, health insurance and life insurance are also often considered musts for protecting your family's financial security.
## How does insurance work?
Your policy will cover specific people, property or vehicles (if applicable), and circumstances, depending on your coverages. How each insurance policy works will be detailed in the [insurance declarations page](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-declaration-page/) or the terms and conditions provided when you purchase the policy. You can use this page to learn more about the cost and term length of your policy, the types of coverage you have, and any deductibles, limits, co-pays, and coverage exclusions.
## How do I choose a good insurance policy?
A good insurance policy is one that meets your coverage needs, fits in your budget, and is underwritten by a reputable and financially secure insurer.
Start by researching how much insurance you need, compare quotes and customer reviews, and make sure there's a knowledgeable customer service team ready to answer your questions. You can even check an insurer's financial security rating with independent agencies like A.M. Best and Fitch Ratings.
