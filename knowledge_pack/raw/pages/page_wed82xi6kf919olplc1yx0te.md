## How Much Is High-Risk Car Insurance In Florida?
In Florida, high-risk car insurance rates can range anywhere from $40 to $500 monthly, depending on what high-risk category you fall into and what specific rate factors went into calculating your premium.
## Who Is Considered A High-Risk Driver?
A high-risk driver is someone considered by [auto insurance companies](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) to have a greater likelihood of being involved in an accident or filing a claim. There are several ways a driver can be classified as high-risk, often resulting in higher premiums.
Common reasons include [speeding tickets](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/does-a-speeding-ticket-affect-your-car-insurance), which indicate risky behavior, and distracted driving, such as [texting or using a phone while driving](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/does-texting-while-driving-affect-your-auto-insurance-rates). Both suggest a lack of attention to the road, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Reckless driving, which includes dangerous actions like running red lights or excessive speeding, further raises the risk profile.
One of the most severe offenses is Driving Under the Influence (DUI). A DUI conviction significantly increases a driver’s risk rating, as it shows a disregard for road safety and legal regulations. Drivers with a history of multiple accidents or frequent [insurance claims](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/definition/41/claim) are also considered high-risk, as they demonstrate a pattern of risky behavior on the road.
Additionally, [teen drivers](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance-for-teens) and those with bad credit can fall into the high-risk category. Teenagers are inexperienced, while drivers with bad credit are statistically more likely to file claims. All of these factors lead to higher insurance rates and fewer coverage options for high-risk drivers.
## How To Lower Your Rates If You Are A High-Risk Driver
If you’re classified as a high-risk driver, your car insurance rates will likely be higher, but there are several steps you can take to reduce your premiums. By following these five strategies, you may be able to improve your driving record and lower your rates over time.
  1. ### Take a Defensive Driving Course
Enrolling in a state-approved defensive driving course can help demonstrate to insurers that you’re serious about improving your driving habits. Some insurance companies offer discounts for completing these programs.
  2. ### Shop Around for Better Rates
Different insurance companies evaluate risk differently, so it’s essential to compare quotes from multiple insurers. You may find a provider that offers more affordable coverage for high-risk drivers.
  3. ### Consider Increasing Your Deductible
Opting for a higher deductible can lower your monthly premium. This means you’ll pay more out of pocket if you have an accident, but your upfront costs will be reduced.
  4. ### Bundle Insurance Policies
If you have other insurance needs, such as home or renters insurance, bundling these policies with your car insurance could lead to discounts. Many insurers offer savings for combining policies.
  5. ### Maintain Continuous Insurance Coverage
Gaps in coverage can lead to even higher premiums. Maintaining continuous coverage, even if it’s just minimum liability, can help you avoid further rate increases.


By taking these steps, you can potentially lower your insurance rates while working toward improving your driving history and reducing your overall risk profile.
## How To Find High-Risk Car Insurance
Finding car insurance as a high-risk driver can be a challenge. However, if you take the right steps, you can simplify the process.  
  
Here is a short guide to help you.
### Understand Why You’re High Risk
Knowing what “high risk” category you fall into is crucial, as it can push you into non-standard insurance markets. Whether it’s a DUI, having speeding tickets, poor credit, or being involved in an accident, you should have a firm grasp on why you’re considered high-risk.
1 
### Know Your Coverage Requirements
Before you start researching quotes, you need to understand what coverage you actually need. Pick coverage limits that suit your needs. If you need to file an [SR-22](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/sr-22-insurance), then confirm the liability limits that it mandates and how long you’ll need them for.
2 
### Look For Discounts
Discounts can be a great way to lower your car insurance costs. Look into state-certified defensive driver courses, usage-based programs, bundling options, or other methods that can earn you a nice discount on your premium.
3 
### Compare Quotes
You should shop around when looking for a quote. Don’t just settle for the first one you find. Talk to an insurance agent or independent broker who works with non-standard carriers and search online comparison sites to find different rates. Be sure to compare quotes for the exact same coverage, so that you’ve got an ‘apples to apples’ comparison.
4 
### Secure Your Policy
When you’ve found a rate that suits you, secure your new car insurance policy.
5 
### Clean Up Your Record Where Possible
Complete any court-ordered programs, satisfy any license reinstatement steps, and keep proof of everything that you’ve done to clean your record. Some insurers will lower your rates when you’ve met your requirements.
6 
## What Should I Do If I’m Denied Coverage?
High-risk drivers in Florida may struggle to find coverage through standard auto insurers. However, they may be able to get coverage through the Florida Automobile Joint Underwriting Association (FAJUA), which is Florida’s “insurer of last resort”.
While coverage through FAJUA is typically more expensive than a regular insurance policy, it will ensure that you meet the legal liability requirements to be on the road.
Any licensed insurance agent in Florida can submit your application to FAJUA (you cannot apply directly to FAJUA). You will then be put on a FAJUA plan. Once your record improves, you can then reapply to a standard auto policy.
