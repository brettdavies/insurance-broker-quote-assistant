## **State Farm Driving Record Discounts**
The most common savings opportunity that car insurance companies offer are driving-related discounts. Here’s how you can qualify for driving record discounts from State Farm:
  * **Driver education course discount:** In some states, drivers older than 55 who take a state-approved defensive driving course can qualify for a driver education course discount.
  * **Driver training discount:** Drivers younger than 21 can get a driver training discount after completing a company-approved driver education course.
  * **Good driving discount:** The safe driving discount is available if all household drivers have been [ticket](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/tickets)- and accident-free for the last three years.
  * **Steer Clear safe driving discount:** [Drivers younger than 25](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-insurance-under-25) with a clean driving record who complete State Farm’s Steer Clear program can qualify for this discount. 
  * **Low mileage discount:** Drive less than 7,500 miles per year to get the low mileage discount.


If you’ve been a State Farm policyholder for at least nine years and have no at-fault accidents, you can also qualify for [accident forgiveness](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-accident-forgiveness-insurance). It prevents a surcharge and preserves your accident-free discount if you get into an [at-fault accident](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/at-fault-collisions).
## **State Farm Vehicle Discounts**
![A woman talking on the phone](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/c8c1bd00db/young-woman-talking-on-cell-phone.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
You may be eligible for a State Farm vehicle discount depending on the type of car you drive and the equipment installed. Here are the vehicle-related discounts State Farm offers:
  * **Vehicle safety discount:** You may qualify for a vehicle safety discount if your car is model year 1994 or newer and has certain safety features. The discount you receive depends on your make and model’s specific safety record.
  * **Anti-theft discount:** You can receive an anti-theft discount if your car has a qualifying anti-theft device,
  * **Passive restraint discount:** The passive restraint discount is for cars from 1993 and older vehicles with factory-installed airbags or another passive restraint system, like automatic seat belts. You can save as much as 40% on medical-related coverages such as [personal injury protection](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/personal-injury-protection) (PIP) and [medical payments coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/medical-payments-coverage).


## **State Farm Age-Related Discounts**
Some discounts are available for specific age groups, mainly [young drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-for-young-drivers) and [seniors](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-seniors). State Farm offers the following age-related discounts:
  * **Good student discount:** Full-time students younger than 25 with a B or better high school or college GPA can qualify for up to 25% in savings.
  * **Student away at school discount:** If you’re younger than 25 and go to school at least 100 miles away from home and don’t take a vehicle, you may be eligible for the student away at school discount.
  * **Senior discount:** Get savings on your basic PIP coverage in some states if you’re older than 65 and have drivers younger than 25 on your insurance policy.


## **State Farm Payment Discounts**
Payment flexibility can help you save on your car insurance policy. Although many insurance companies offer discounts for going [paperless](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/paperless-discount) or setting up [automatic payments](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/automatic-payments-discount), State Farm only offers a discount for paying your bill in full rather than making monthly installment payments.
## **State Farm Loyalty Discounts**
![A man typing on a desktop computer](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/fae6cf4e08/young-man-using-desktop.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Being loyal to one insurance company has its perks with some insurers, including State Farm. Here’s a look at loyalty discounts available from State Farm:
  * **Multi-car discount:** Insure more than one vehicle with State Farm to save up to 20%. Vehicle owners must be related to qualify.
  * **Multi-policy discount:** [Bundle your auto and home](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/bundle-home-auto-insurance), condo, renters, or life insurance with State Farm to qualify for the multi-policy discount and get up to 17% in savings.
  * **Loyalty discount:** If you have an eligible vehicle insured with State Farm for at least three years, you can earn a loyalty discount. The discount may increase every year you stay insured, for up to six years.


## **State Farm Telematics Discounts**
[Usage-based programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) are becoming increasingly common in the auto insurance industry. You can earn a discount in exchange for letting your insurance company track your driving habits and [mileage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/annual-mileage).
Enroll in State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount) to get an initial discount of 10%. You can earn an additional discount of up to 30% depending on your driving habits and how many miles you drive. The discount may change at each policy renewal based on your driving habits from the previous year.
[![See if Drive Safe & Save is Right for You](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/efa5d9a058/state-farm-insurance-building.jpg/m/400x300/smart/filters:quality\(90\)) See if Drive Safe & Save is Right for You](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save)
## **How to Add Discounts to Your State Farm Policy**
![A woman driving with earbuds in](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/c6699d2861/woman-driving-with-earbuds.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
State Farm will automatically add some discounts to your auto policy when you qualify for them, like loyalty, safe driving, multi-car, and multi-policy discounts. But some discounts have requirements you must meet to add them to your State Farm policy.
For example, to qualify for the Steer Clear discount, young drivers must complete the Steer Clear safe driving program, which includes trip tracking and watching driving behavior videos. You must also have no tickets or at-fault accidents in the past three years.
To get State Farm’s defensive driver course discount, you must complete a state-approved defensive driving course, provide the completion certificate to State Farm, and live in a qualifying state.
## **Other Ways to Save With State Farm**
Although State Farm offers an extensive list of car insurance discounts, it’s not the only way to save on your insurance policy. Here are other [ways to save](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks) with State Farm:
  * **Improve your credit.** Most [states](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/states-prohibiting-credit-score) allow insurance companies to use your credit and bill-paying history to determine your car insurance premium. Improving your [credit](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-and-credit-score) may help you save on your auto policy.
  * **Consider dropping full coverage.** If your vehicle is older and paid off, and you can afford to repair or replace it if you get into an accident, you may no longer need [comprehensive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/comprehensive-insurance) and [collision](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance) insurance.
  * **Buy an affordable vehicle.** Insurance costs can vary widely by [vehicle make and model](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/vehicle-model).

  * ### How many car insurance discounts does State Farm offer?

  * ### How much can you save with State Farm car insurance discounts?
Savings vary for State Farm car insurance discounts. For example, you could save up to 20% by insuring more than one vehicle or up to 17% if you insure your homeowners and car insurance with State Farm. Most discounts are stackable to maximize how much you can save.
  * ### Can you stack car insurance discounts with State Farm?
Yes. You can stack State Farm discounts to get more savings on your car insurance policy. For example, if your child is in college more than 100 miles away from home and has a B or above GPA, they can qualify for the good student and student away at school discount.
  * ### What are some of the best car insurance discounts?
The best car insurance discounts can vary based on your state and eligibility requirements. That said, the largest discount savings are typically from telematics programs and insuring multiple vehicles and insurance policies with the same insurance company.
  * ### Does State Farm offer a discount if you have a dash cam?
No. Although a dash cam can record critical car accident information to help determine fault, most insurance companies, including State Farm, don’t offer a discount if you have a dash cam in your vehicle.
