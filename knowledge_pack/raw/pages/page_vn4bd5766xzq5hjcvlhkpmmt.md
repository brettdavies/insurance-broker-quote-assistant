Geico insurance will go up by about 79% after your first accident resulting in a claim of $750 or more. If this is your second accident in less than three years, your insurance will go up at least twice as much , depending on the total cost of the claim. If you have more than two accidents in a three-year period, you can expect to pay 225% more. These surcharges will be in effect for three years after the claim. 
Your rate won’t increase if the accident is not your fault and the other driver’s insurance pays for your claim, or if the damage is less than $750. Keep in mind that Geico also assigns points for other traffic offenses. A DUI conviction is three points, for example, and a speeding ticket of 20 MPH over the posted limit is one point. Your first accident resulting in a claim of $750 or more also gets one point. Your total number of points determines your final surcharge.
## Will my Geico insurance go up after an accident if I...
  * **Wasn’t at-fault?** No, if your claim is reimbursed by the other driver or their insurance company, the cost of your insurance will not go up. If you aren’t cited by law enforcement and the other driver is, your premium won’t be affected, either.
  * **Use my Personal Injury Protection?** If you need PIP to cover your or your passengers’ medical bills but don’t need to use your liability or collision coverage, your rates won’t be affected.
  * **Was involved in a hit and run?** A hit and run will not affect your rates as long as you file a police report with 24 hours.
  * **Hit a deer?** Most comprehensive claims are considered beyond your control and do not count against you. But if you’ve filed another claim of any kind in the last three years, hitting a deer could raise your rates.
  * **Was hit by flying or falling objects?** If gravel on the highway shatters your windshield or a tree branch lands on your car, it won’t increase your premium unless you’ve had another claim in the last three years.


## Geico accident forgiveness
Geico has two [accident forgiveness programs](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/geico-accident-forgiveness-2140684191/), which waive the surcharge following an at-fault accident. The first works like a loyalty program for safe, long-time customers. To be eligible, you must have been insured by the company and accident-free for at least five years.
The second way to get accident forgiveness is to pay for it as supplemental coverage. Geico’s website says you still have to meet certain driving-record requirements to be able to buy accident forgiveness, but the rules and terms vary by state. You must also be 21 or older to qualify.
Ultimately, Geico’s policies mean your premiums might not be affected by a single accident if you stick with Geico over time. Since car insurance industry estimates show the average driver files a claim for a car accident about once every 18 years, it’s possible loyal customers’ premiums could never be affected by an accident with Geico.

It’s not necessarily true that your rates won’t increase if you’re not at fault. My rates increased after getting rear ended because they said I had an “increase in activity.”

Two corrections to the other post. 
  1. Multiple not at-fault claims can increase your rate depending on the time frame between claims and the number of them.
  2. Comprehensive claims will not increase your rates.

##  [Does GEICO have accident forgiveness?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/geico-accident-forgiveness-1000036-2140684191/)
Yes, GEICO offers accident forgiveness in 47 states and the District of Columbia, with the exceptions being California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. GEICO accident forgiveness protects you from increases to your car insurance premium after your first at-fault accident.
The accident forgiveness feature may only be used once. How much your premium would rise without accident forgiveness depends on your state, driving record, and claim payment amount. The increase could range from 2% to 50%,...

##  [Why did GEICO raise my rates?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/geico-rate-increase-1000139-2140699501/)
[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) may have raised your rates because of changes to your policy or circumstances. Examples include adding a new type of coverage, becoming eligible for an additional type of discount, being involved in an accident, or buying a new car. Recent economic trends have also driven up auto insurance costs overall, and GEICO’s average premium has increased over the past few years.

##  [Why is GEICO so cheap?](https://wallethub.com/answers/ci/why-is-geico-so-cheap-1000109-2140684827/)
[GEICO](https://wallethub.com/profile/ci/geico-13014474i) is so cheap because it sells insurance coverage directly to consumers without middlemen and offers a [lot of discounts](https://wallethub.com/edu/ci/geico-discounts/76834). Direct-to-consumer insurance allows GEICO to have significantly fewer local offices and agents, making them cheaper than companies like State Farm and Progressive. Having a smaller agent network lowers GEICO's overhead costs so they can pass those savings on to consumers.

Advertising impacts how and where offers appear on this site (including, for example, the order in which they appear and their prevalence). At WalletHub we try to present a wide array of offers, but our offers do not represent all financial services companies or products. 
Advertising enables WalletHub to provide you proprietary tools, services, and content at no charge. Advertising does not impact WalletHub's editorial content including our best picks, reviews, ratings and opinions. Those are completely independent and not provided, commissioned, or endorsed by any company, as our editors follow a strict [editorial policy](https://wallethub.com/edu/wallethub-editorial-policy/25756). 
WalletHub is not a financial advisor. Our goal is to provide you with top-notch content, data, and tools. You are responsible for deciding what financial products and providers are best for your needs. 
WalletHub members have a wealth of knowledge to share, and we encourage everyone to do so while respecting our [content guidelines](https://wallethub.com/community/guidelines/). This question was posted by WalletHub. WalletHub does not endorse any particular contributors and cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of any information posted. 
Irrespective of whether an institution or professional is a paid advertiser, the presence of information on WalletHub does not constitute a referral or endorsement of the institution or professional by us or vice versa. 
We work hard to show you up-to-date product terms, however, this information does not originate from us and thus, [we do not guarantee](https://wallethub.com/information-guarantee/) its accuracy. Actual terms may vary. Before submitting an application, always verify all terms and conditions with the offering institution. Please [let us know](https://wallethub.com/feedback/) if you notice any differences.
