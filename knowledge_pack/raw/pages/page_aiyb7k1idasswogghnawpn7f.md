# What Should Chicago Drivers Know About SR22 Insurance?
UPDATED: June 23, 2025 
Share:
[ ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fchicago-sr22-insurance-all-you-need-to-know%2F) [ ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+Should+Chicago+Drivers+Know+About+SR22+Insurance%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fchicago-sr22-insurance-all-you-need-to-know%2F)
**TL;DR:** Chicago drivers who are required to get **SR22 insurance** must have their auto insurer file an **SR-22 certificate** with the state. This document proves you carry at least Illinois’ minimum liability coverage. Typically, an SR22 is mandated for **high-risk drivers** (e.g. those with suspended licenses, DUI convictions, or multiple insurance violations) and it must be maintained **continuously for three years** to keep your license valid. Filing an SR22 usually involves a small one-time fee (~$15–$50), but keep in mind that insurance premiums will be higher for these high-risk policies. **Need help fast?** Call [773-202-5060](tel:773-202-5060) for guidance on securing a Chicago SR22 insurance policy.
Finding out that you need an SR22 can be overwhelming, especially if you’re unfamiliar with what this requirement means for you as a driver. This article will explain exactly **what SR22 insurance is** , **why Illinois might require it** , and **how you can obtain an SR22 certificate** so you can get back on the road legally. We’ll also cover edge cases, like what to do if you **don’t own a car** or if you **move out of state**
## What Is SR22 Insurance in Illinois (and Why Might You Need It)?
**SR22 insurance** is actually a **certificate of financial responsibility.** This certificate is the state’s way of confirming that you carry at least the **minimum auto liability insurance** required by Illinois law. If you’re labeled a “high-risk” driver due to certain violations or license suspensions, the Illinois **Secretary of State (DMV)** requires this extra proof of insurance before you can _keep or regain_ your driving privileges.
You might need an SR22 in Chicago if any of the following situations apply:
  * **License Suspension or Revocation** : Your driver’s license was suspended or revoked (often due to serious offenses like a **DUI** or reckless driving). Before reinstating your license, Illinois will demand proof of insurance via an SR22 filing.  

  * **Multiple Insurance Violations** : You have a record of driving without insurance. For example, Illinois mandates SR22s for drivers with **three or more insurance-related violations**.  

  * **Serious Traffic Offenses** : Major moving violations or at-fault accidents can trigger an SR22 requirement as part of the penalties.  

  * **Unsatisfied Judgment** : You owe damages from an accident and haven’t paid (a court judgment), leading to a “Safety Responsibility” suspension.


## What Are the Minimum Insurance Requirements for an SR22 in Illinois?
Illinois law requires at least the following coverage on your auto policy:
**Coverage Type** | **Illinois Minimum Limit**  
---|---  
Bodily Injury Liability (per person) | $25,000  
Bodily Injury Liability (per accident) | $50,000 (for all persons injured)  
Property Damage Liability (per accident) | $20,000  
These 25/50/20 liability limits are the minimum needed for any driver in Illinois. An SR22 **does not add any extra coverage** , rather just confirms you have at least this much insurance in force. (In fact, Illinois also requires uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage of $25,000/$50,000, which most policies include automatically.) If you only carry the minimum limits, your SR22 filing will reflect that you have a **minimum-liability policy**. You can certainly choose higher coverage limits or full coverage, but you **cannot get an SR22 without a valid insurance policy**. 
**Note:** Not every insurance company is authorized to issue SR22 certificates in Illinois. Insurers must be licensed in Illinois and have authority to file SR22s (with a power of attorney on file with the state). **Insure on the Spot** , for example, is an Illinois provider familiar with SR22 filings. If your current insurer cannot file an SR22, you’ll need to switch to one that can issue the SR22 certificate **along with an insurance policy** that meets the minimum requirements.
## How Do You Get SR22 Insurance in Chicago?
Getting **SR22 insurance** in Chicago is easy and involves only a few steps with your insurance company. Here’s how it works:
### Purchase an Auto Insurance Policy
First, you need to have an active auto insurance policy that meets Illinois’ minimum liability requirements (at least 25/50/20 coverage). If you already have insurance, you’ll inform your insurer that you need an SR22 filing. If you’re currently uninsured, you’ll have to buy a new policy – companies like Insure on the Spot specialize in helping high-risk drivers get coverage quickly.
### Request the SR22 Filing
When setting up your policy, **tell the insurance company you need an SR22**. There is usually a **one-time filing fee** charged by the insurer, typically around $15 to $50, for them to file the SR22 with the state.
### Insurer Files with the State
**You do not file the SR22 yourself**. Only an authorized insurance company can submit it. The SR22 certificate from the insurer’s home office is sent directly to the state’s database.
### Receive Confirmation
The state will process the SR22 (it may take up to a few weeks to be fully processed by the Secretary of State). You will receive a copy of the SR22 from your insurer and a confirmation letter from the state once it’s on file. It’s recommended to **not drive until your license is officially reinstated or the state confirms the SR22 filing** , as driving before the SR22 is in effect could lead to further penalties.
### Maintain Your Coverage
Once filed, you must **keep the insurance policy active** for the required period (usually 3 years). If your policy cancels or lapses, the insurer is legally obligated to notify the state via an SR-26 cancellation notice, and your license will be suspended again.
**Edge Case: Can you get SR22 insurance without owning a car?** If you **don’t own a vehicle** but need an SR22 (for instance, to reinstate your driver’s license), you can get a special policy called **non-owner SR22 insurance** (a liability policy for motorists who **borrow or occasionally drive cars they don’t own)** , combined with an SR22 filing. Illinois offers an “**Operator’s Certificate** ” SR22 form, which **covers the driver when operating any non-owned vehicle**. In practice, a non-owner SR22 policy will satisfy the state’s requirement so you can get your license back **without having to buy a car**. It’s typically cheaper than an owner’s policy since it excludes owned vehicles, but it still provides liability coverage when you drive someone else’s car. In fact, an “SR22-only” policy usually refers to this kind of **non-owner SR22 insurance** , a solution that allows you to meet the SR22 mandate even if you don’t currently have a car of your own.
## How Long Do You Need to Carry SR22 Insurance in Illinois?
In Illinois, an SR22 requirement typically must be kept for **three years** from the date it’s imposed (for example, three years from your license suspension reinstatement). During this period, you **must continuously maintain insurance coverage** with an SR22 on file. If your policy is canceled or even lapses for a short time, the clock may reset and your three-year period could start over once you re-file, so it’s crucial to avoid any interruption. The state **monitors your coverage** in real time, so, if your SR22 insurance expires or is canceled mid-term, your insurer will send an alert (called an SR-26) to the Secretary of State, and your **driver’s license will be suspended again immediately**. To prevent this, plan to **renew your policy well in advance** of its expiration. Illinois officials actually recommend renewing at least **45 days before** your policy’s end date to ensure the SR22 stays active without a gap.
After you’ve successfully maintained the SR22 for the required time (e.g. full 36 months with no lapse), the SR22 filing requirement will be lifted. Your insurer can then remove the SR22 from your policy at renewal if it’s no longer needed. It’s a good idea to confirm with the Illinois Secretary of State or DMV that your SR22 obligation is fulfilled once the term is up. **Do not cancel your SR22 policy until you are certain the requirement period has ended** , or you risk a re-suspension.
**What happens if your SR22 insurance lapses or is canceled?** If you allow your SR22-required insurance to lapse _even for a day_ , the consequences are severe. As mentioned, the insurance company must inform the state right away if an SR22 policy terminates. The Illinois Secretary of State will then suspend your driving privileges again, and you’ll be back to square one where you’ll be unable to drive legally until you obtain a new policy and file a new SR22. Additionally, a lapse or cancellation could **extend your SR22 requirement** (for example, the three-year count may restart) and it may make it harder or more expensive to get insured again (since it’s another mark on your record). 
**Edge case: What if you move out of Illinois during your SR22 period?** Moving to a new state does not automatically eliminate your Illinois SR22 obligation. Illinois will still expect proof of insurance for the remainder of the term. Typically, you would have to maintain an equivalent SR22 (or the new state’s version of it) in your new state. However, Illinois does allow out-of-state residents to **request an SR22 waiver** if they will not be driving in Illinois. You can file an “Out-of-State Affidavit” to waive Illinois’ SR22 requirement, but this is only effective as long as you remain out of Illinois. If you move back within the three-year window, the SR22 requirement gets reinstated. In any case, if you relocate, you must still comply with insurance laws in your new state (which may have its own similar **financial responsibility** filing rules).
## How Much Does SR22 Insurance Cost in Chicago?
**SR22 insurance** in Chicago does not have a set price tag on its own—the cost is essentially the **auto insurance premium** for the policy you must carry, plus a small filing fee. The **SR-22 filing fee** charged by insurers is usually **between $15 and $50**. This is a one-time administrative fee for submitting the certificate to the state. The **real cost** comes from the fact that drivers needing an SR22 are considered **high-risk** , which means insurance companies will charge higher premiums for the underlying policy. How much your insurance rate increases depends on the violation that led to the SR22 and your overall driving history.
As a rough range, one recent analysis found that the **average SR22 insurance cost in Illinois** is about **$67 per month for minimum coverage** (approximately $800 per year). This assumes a scenario of a relatively minor offense. On the other hand, serious offenses like **DUIs** can cause rates to skyrocket — another study reported average SR22 premiums of around **$3,400 per year** in Illinois. Your actual price will vary based on factors such as your age, vehicle, location in Chicago, and which insurer you choose. Because each company evaluates risk differently, it’s wise to **compare quotes** from multiple insurers if you need an SR22 policy. Insure on the Spot, for example, can shop among various carriers to find an affordable SR22 solution for you. Over the three-year period, maintaining an SR22 can be costly, so look for discounts (good driver, defensive driving courses, etc.) that might help offset the higher premium.
On a good note, you should know that simply having an SR22 filing on your policy **does not typically add a huge surcharge by itself.** It’s the violations behind it that raise your rate. The filing fee is minimal, and if you keep a clean record moving forward, your insurance costs should gradually go down over time. After the SR22 requirement is over and the endorsement is removed, you may see a significant drop in your insurance rate (assuming no other incidents occur).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about SR22 Insurance in Chicago, Illinois
**Q: What exactly is an SR22, and is it a type of insurance policy?****  
****A:** An SR22 is **not a separate insurance policy** – it’s a **certificate filed with the state** to prove you have the required liability insurance coverage. You still need to buy auto insurance; the SR22 is just an _add-on_ form your insurer files with Illinois to confirm you’re insured. It’s often called “SR22 insurance,” but it doesn’t provide any coverage itself (it won’t pay for damages). Think of it as a DMV-required paperwork attached to your policy to monitor high-risk drivers.
**Q: Who is required to get an SR22 in Illinois?****  
****A:** In Illinois, drivers are required to get an SR22 if they’ve been classified as “high-risk” due to certain incidents. This includes drivers with a **suspended or revoked license** , usually from serious violations like DUIs or reckless driving, or those with multiple offenses for driving uninsured. The Illinois Secretary of State specifically requires SR22 filings for anyone who has had a **safety responsibility suspension, an unsatisfied judgment, a mandatory insurance supervision, or three or more insurance violation convictions**. 
**Q: How can I get an SR22 certificate filed quickly?****  
****A:** The fastest way is to **contact an insurance company authorized in Illinois to issue SR22s**. Many insurers can file the SR22 electronically the same day you purchase a policy. For example, Insure on the Spot can often **file your SR22 immediately** once you’ve signed up for the required coverage. You’ll pay the small filing fee, and the insurer sends the SR22 to the state. While the state’s processing might take a little time (sometimes up to 30 days for the record update), your proof of insurance is in effect once the policy is active. Always verify with the DMV or your insurer that the SR22 has been received and your license is valid _before_ you resume driving.
**Q: How long do I need to maintain the SR22, and can it ever be shorter than 3 years?****  
****A:** Generally, Illinois requires the SR22 for **three years**. In most cases, there’s no early termination – you must keep the SR22 for the full term. During that time, if you have any lapse in coverage, the countdown may reset, meaning you could effectively extend the requirement beyond three years. Only after you’ve met the time obligation **with continuous coverage** will the state allow the SR22 requirement to be removed. It’s crucial to check with the Secretary of State before canceling your policy at the end of the term. **Exception:** If the state specified a different term (in rare cases or court-specific situations), then you’d follow that, but three years is the standard for Illinois.
**Q: How much will my car insurance go up with an SR22?****  
****A:** It depends on the violation that led to the SR22. The SR22 filing itself is cheap (around $20 fee), but if you needed an SR22, you likely had a serious incident (accident, DUI, etc.) that makes you a higher-risk customer. On average, Illinois drivers with an SR22 might pay about **50–100% more** for insurance than before. For example, a clean-record driver might pay $100 per month for basic coverage, whereas a similar driver with a DUI (requiring SR22) could pay $200 or more per month. One source estimates ~$67/month as an average minimum SR22 policy in Illinois, but it can be several hundred dollars per month in worse scenarios. Shopping around and maintaining a safe driving record going forward are your best strategies to manage the cost.
**Q: Can I get an SR22 removed if I no longer need it (for instance, I sold my car or moved)?****  
****A:** Simply selling your car doesn’t remove the SR22 requirement—you’d still need to keep an insurance policy (a non-owner policy if necessary) with an SR22 filing until your term is over. If you **move out of state** , Illinois might allow you to suspend the SR22 obligation _for Illinois_ by filing an affidavit (since you won’t be driving here). However, you’ll likely need to meet the insurance requirements of your new state, and if you ever return to Illinois during the three-year period, the SR22 requirement **comes back**. To fully remove an SR22 from your record, the only real solution is to **wait out the required time** and make sure you don’t have any lapses or new violations. After that, your insurer can cancel the SR22 filing and you can continue with regular insurance without the SR22 endorsement.
**Q: Is there any alternative to filing an SR22 if I don’t want to get insurance?****  
****A:** Illinois provides a few extreme alternatives to meet **financial responsibility** requirements _without insurance_ , but they are not practical for most people. For instance, you could **deposit $70,000 in cash or securities with the state** or file a surety bond for the same amount. These methods are effectively pledging money to cover future accidents instead of buying insurance. Another option is a real estate bond (using property equity as collateral) in some cases. These alternatives are rarely used – they require a lot of money upfront and approvals by authorities. The vast majority of drivers find it far easier to simply carry an insurance policy and let their insurer handle the SR22 filing. If you’re considering an alternative, it’s best to consult legal counsel or the Illinois Secretary of State’s office for guidance.
