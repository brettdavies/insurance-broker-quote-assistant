## Auto insurance discounts for teachers
If you're a teacher looking for car insurance deals, check out the following companies, which offer discounts for teachers:

  * **Horace Mann** : Teachers and educators can get a discount at Horace Mann. So can members of some education-related groups. 
  * **[Liberty Mutual](https://www.valuepenguin.com/liberty-mutual-insurance-review "Liberty Mutual insurance review")** : Depending on your state, Liberty Mutual offers teachers savings on auto insurance. 
  * **Meemic** : You can save up to 35% with Meemic. Discounts include one for newly certified teachers. It applies for the first seven years of your career.

## Cheap auto insurance for teachers
Many companies take a driver's job into account when setting rates. Your education level can impact your rates as well, which benefits the many teachers with advanced and graduate degrees.
Teachers pay 6% less for auto insurance than service workers do. Progressive charged teachers $63 less per year than service workers, while Geico charged $114 less.
Insurance companies usually consider drivers with more education and certain jobs less risky, which means these drivers often receive lower rates.
Bear in mind that not every company will ask for your profession when you search for quotes online. You might have to talk to an agent to confirm if you can receive discounts for being a teacher.

## How to get cheaper car insurance rates as a teacher
There are other ways for teachers to get affordable auto insurance besides discounts. Companies reward drivers with discounts for a number of different behaviors and features:
  * [Multipolicy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "The Best Home and Auto Insurance Bundle"). Getting more than one policy from the same company can often score you a discount. 
  * [Safe driving](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts"). Drivers who have maintained a clean record will often score discounts. 
  * [Good student](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "Good Student Insurance Discount"). Teachers who have a child with good grades listed on their policy can get discounts on auto insurance. 
  * [Defensive driving discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses"). Take a defensive driving class to earn a discount off your premium. 
  * Safety features. Get a lower rate if your car has certain safety features. This includes air bags or anti-lock brakes. 
  * Pay-in-full. Teachers who buy their entire annual policy up front, rather than opting for monthly installments, can net a discount. 
  * [Telematics](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-usage-based-car-insurance "Usage-Based Insurance"). Share your driving data with your insurance company, and the more safely you drive, the larger your discount will be. 


Teachers should [compare quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") from multiple insurance companies to get the best rates.
