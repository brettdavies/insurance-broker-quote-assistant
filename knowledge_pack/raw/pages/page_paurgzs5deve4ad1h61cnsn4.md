If you need more coverage than the state minimum, you can increase your liability limits to protect your assets.

## Do you need insurance on a camper in Virginia?
If you're pulling a travel trailer, Virginia law requires that you carry [auto liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/auto-liability-insurance/) for the vehicle pulling your camper. Your auto liability coverage, however, won't cover damage to your travel trailer. RV comprehensive and collision coverage are available options for those who want further protection. Learn more about [travel trailer insurance](https://www.progressive.com/rv-insurance/travel-trailer-insurance/).
### Comprehensive and collision coverage
[RV collision and other than collision coverages](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-collision-comprehensive-coverage/) are optional if you own your RV outright. But we understand the value that many motorhome or travel trailer owners place on their home away from home. It may be worthwhile to add collision and other than collision coverage if you want to protect your RV against damage and loss. If you're financing or leasing your RV, your lender likely requires collision and other collision coverages.
Other than collision coverage, "comprehensive" coverage as called in most other states, covers events out of your control, including [RV theft](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-theft-insurance-prevention-tips/), vandalism, fire, hitting an animal, and weather-related issues. Collision covers your RV if you collide with another vehicle, tree, fence, guardrail, or any object.

The average premium for a 12-month Virginia RV insurance policy at Progressive for 2024 was $1,011.86 for a motorhome and $437.41 for a travel trailer. Progressive offers RV liability-only policies starting at just $125/year*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. but your [cost for RV insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/rv-insurance-cost/) depends on many factors, such as:
  * **Type and model** : The more expensive your RV is to repair or replace, the more you pay to insure it. Larger, newer RVs often cost more than smaller, used RVs; and motorhomes typically cost more than travel trailers or pop-ups.
  * **Claims history** : Your history of filing insurance claims may affect your rate.
  * **Driving record** : Violations can increase the price of your policy.
