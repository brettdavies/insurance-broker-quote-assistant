# What is SR-22 insurance in California?
![reviewer icon](https://www.carinsurance.com/images/blueberry/highlight.svg) Updated on: Mar 12, 2025
In California, if you're deemed a high-risk driver, you may be required to get an SR-22 form. If your insurer requires an SR-22, it could raise your insurance rates.Skip to article
[SR-22 insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/sr22.aspx) in California isn’t a type of insurance but rather a certificate of financial responsibility that some drivers must file. It’s often required for individuals who have been convicted of certain driving-related offenses, such as DUI, driving without insurance, reckless driving or multiple traffic offenses.
The SR-22 form is filed by your insurance company with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to prove that you have the state-required minimum liability coverage. This form verifies that you have the necessary insurance coverage in place. If your driving privileges were suspended or revoked and you must carry an SR-22, you must maintain continuous coverage for the period specified by the court or DMV.
In this guide, you’ll find what SR-22 insurance covers in California and how it affects your annual premiums should you need one.

## Who needs an SR-22 in California?
In California, if your driver’s license gets suspended or revoked because of certain violations, you might need SR-22. It is a form that proves you have car insurance.
**Here are some reasons why a driver might need an SR-22:**
  * [DUI or DWI](https://www.carinsurance.com/dui-vs-dwi/) (driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated) conviction
  * [Reckless driving](https://www.carinsurance.com/risky-and-dangerous-driving-behaviors/)
  * [Driving without insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/driving-without-insurance-penalties-state.aspx)
  * Multiple traffic offenses within a short period
  * If you’re involved in an accident and don’t have car insurance, the DMV may suspend your license and require you to file an SR-22
  * Nonpayment of fines or penalties if you’re sued after an accident


In California, an SR-22 is generally needed for 3 years, but this duration can differ based on the specific violation. Throughout this period, it’s crucial to maintain at least the [minimum car insurance required by California](https://www.carinsurance.com/state/state-minimum-car-insurance-in-california/) law.

## How do I get an SR-22 in California?
Getting insurance in California involves purchasing a car insurance policy and having the insurance company file an SR-22 form with the [Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.carinsurance.com/MotorVehicle.aspx) (DMV)on your behalf.
Getting the right auto insurance:
  * **Contact your current insurance company:** Many insurance companies file SR-22 forms, but keep in mind that your rates will go up.
  * **Comparison shopping:** It’s a good idea to [compare rates from other insurance companies](https://www.carinsurance.com/car-insurance-comparison.aspx). Tell them you need an SR-22 so they give you accurate quotes.
  * **Meet**[**state minimum car insurance requirements**](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/minimum-liability-car-insurance-requirements-by-state.aspx)**:** You’ll need to purchase minimum liability coverage with limits of 30/60/15.


Filing the SR-22:
  * **Inform your insurer about your SR-22 requirement.** They’ll handle the paperwork and submit the form to the DMV.
  * **Pay any associated fees.** Expect an SR-22 filing fee from your insurance company on top of the increased premium for your high-risk status.
  * **Maintain continuous insurance.** A [lapse in coverage](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/lapse-in-coverage-penalties-by-state.aspx) may result in the DMV suspending your license again.


Remember, an SR-22 requirement could lead to higher premiums based on your driving history. It’s important to shop around for quotes and practice safe driving to help lower the elevated rates.

## How long do I need SR-22 insurance in California?
You will need an SR-22 in California for a period of 3 years. This document proves to the California DMV that you are maintaining state-mandated coverage.
SR-22 insurance varies by state and the reason you need it. Usually, it’s required for three years but in some cases, it might be longer. For example, if someone has repeat violations, the requirement could extend out to five years, says Dr. James Brau, Joel C. Peterson professor of finance at Brigham Young University.
## How do I check my SR-22 status online in California?
You can easily check your SR22 status by visiting the official website of the California DMV and using their online services. Alternatively, you can contact the California DMV by phone to inquire about your SR-22 status, and they can provide you with the required information.
## What happens if I cancel my insurance?
If you discontinue your SR-22 insurance in California before the mandated period ends, you could face severe consequences.
  * **Driver’s license suspension:** If your SR-22 policy is canceled, your insurance provider will notify the state. This typically leads to a suspension of your driver’s license since insurance coverage must be maintained for the mandated period.
  * **Fines and penalties:** In some states, you might face additional fines or penalties for not complying with the SR-22 requirement.
  * **Extended probationary period:** If your SR-22 is part of a probation period for a driving offense, canceling it might restart your probationary period.
  * **Increased insurance costs:** A lapse in coverage and violations on your driving record resulting from SR-22 policy cancellation can lead to significantly higher insurance premiums in the future.


It’s important to fulfill the SR-22 requirements for the specified duration without any lapses or cancellations to avoid legal repercussions and maintain driving privileges.
## How to get an SR-22 removed in California
The most common [way to get your SR-22 removed](https://www.carinsurance.com/kb/how-to-cancel-SR-22-after-3-years) is to wait until the required filing period is over. In California, the standard SR-22 filing period is 3 years from its filing date.
Brau explains that you should maintain continuous insurance coverage without any lapses. If you cancel your policy or let it expire, the SR-22 will no longer be valid. Wait out the required period. During this time, drive responsibly and maintain your insurance coverage.
“Check with your state’s DMV and confirm the exact duration and any additional requirements for removal. Some states may require you to submit a formal request or provide proof of good driving behavior,” he says.
“Once the required period has passed, ask your insurer to file an SR-26 form with the DMV. This form notifies them that you no longer need an SR-22. After your insurer submits the SR-26, check with the DMV to ensure the SR-22 is officially removed from your record.”
## How does an SR-22 affect car insurance rates in California?
The requirement of an SR-22 certificate can increase your car insurance premiums significantly. Most insurance companies consider drivers with SR-22 high risk, resulting in premium hikes.
Your [specific increase in rates will vary based on various factors](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/10-factors-that-affect-your-car-insurance-rates.aspx), including your [driving record](https://www.carinsurance.com/how-to-check-your-driving-record) and the reason for the SR-22.
Don’t settle for the first offer. Compare quotes from multiple insurers to get the best deal on car insurance with an SR-22. If you stay violation-free and comply with the SR-22 requirements, your rates could go down over time.

## Frequently asked questions: SR-22 insurance in California
Collapse allExpand all
### Do I need an SR-1P or SR-22 in California?
Both the SR-22 and SR-1P are forms your insurance company submits to the California DMV, ensuring you meet the mandated liability coverage. For motorcycle riders, mopeds, and scooter users, the SR-1P is the relevant form. If you’ve been caught riding your two-wheeler without insurance or have had your license suspended, you’ll require an SR-1P.
### What happens to your SR-22 insurance in California if you move?
An SR-22 requirement stays even when you move to a new state. Find a new insurance company licensed in your current state to file a new SR-22. They must submit the form with both the California DMV and your new state’s DMV to transfer the requirement. Maintain continuous coverage until the new SR-22 is in effect.
SR-22 requirements can vary from state to state, so it’s essential to consult with your new insurance company and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in your new state to determine the necessary steps.
### Does GEICO offer SR-22 in California?
GEICO provides SR-22 in California, ensuring you meet the state’s insurance requirements and offer adequate coverage required by the state.
