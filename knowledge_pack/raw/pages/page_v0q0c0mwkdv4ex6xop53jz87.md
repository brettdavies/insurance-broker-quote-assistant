California’s auto insurance rates vary significantly across the state, influenced by factors such as coverage type, location, and driving records.

The average cost for car insurance significantly varies across different cities in California. **Mount Shasta** tops the list as the cheapest city for car insurance with an average rate of **$126 per month**. Other cities with relatively low car insurance premiums include **Weed** and **Yreka** at **$128** , **Montague** at **$131** , and **Dunsmuir** at **$132**.

Additionally, anticipated tariffs on imported car parts could potentially result in a 7% increase in auto insurance rates in California by the latter half of 2025. The annual average auto insurance premium throughout California stands at approximately **$1,910** , although drivers qualifying for California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance program may pay around **$450** annually, which is designed for those with good driving records and specific income limits.
Eligibility for California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance program includes individuals with an income of up to **$39,125** and families of four with a limit of **$80,375**.
