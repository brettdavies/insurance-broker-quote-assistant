The average home insurance rate is currently $211 per month for $300,000 in dwelling coverage, according to Insurify data. Your home’s age, condition, and location affect insurance rates significantly. The coverage and deductible you choose will also influence what you pay month to month and out of pocket if you file a claim.
You might also need disaster coverage, like earthquake or wildfire insurance, if your home is in a vulnerable region. For example, if you live in a high-risk flood zone and have a federally backed mortgage, your lender will require you to purchase flood insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance/#cite-1) Even if you have a conventional mortgage, your lender will likely have specific requirements for [**insuring your home**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/).

Homeowners insurance rates can vary widely by state and even by ZIP code. Severe weather risk and high property crime rates will raise regional premiums, but the local insurance market and state legislation can also affect rates.

By contrast, Vermont — the cheapest U.S. state for home insurance — experienced 19 $1 billion-plus weather disasters during the same time period.

### Cheapest states for home insurance
Vermont has the cheapest average home insurance premiums in the U.S. It has some of the lowest property crime rates and fewer natural disasters.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance/#cite-2) It’s not immune, though: Vermont has faced many significant flooding events, including three in the last year.
Here are the five cheapest states for a $300,000 homeowners insurance policy, along with their average annual premiums:
  * **Vermont:** $936
  * **New Hampshire:** $1,128
  * **Delaware:** $1,212
  * **Alaska:** $1,224
  * **Hawaii:** $1,380


Fewer costly weather events and comparatively lower crime rates contribute to a state’s lower cost of home insurance.
### Most expensive states for home insurance
The five most expensive states for homeowners insurance all have average costs that are well above the national average. They also share a high risk of damage from severe weather, like hurricanes and tornadoes, or from wildfire.
Here are the states with the highest annual costs for a home insurance policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage:
  * **Florida:** $5,640
  * **Louisiana:** $5,136
  * **Oklahoma:** $4,560
  * **Texas:** $4,140
  * **North Carolina:** $3,444


### Why homeowners insurance rates are rising
Inflation and climate catastrophes contribute to rising homeowners insurance rates, according to Insurify’s [**home insurance report**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/report/home-insurance-price-projections/). Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma have the highest average home insurance rates in the U.S. and face increasingly frequent and severe weather. The 10 most expensive states are all prone to severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires.
Insurance companies set rates based on risk, so if you’re in a vulnerable area, your premiums will be higher to reflect the increased likelihood you’ll file a claim. The rising cost of labor and repairs contributes to higher premiums because it’s become more expensive to fix the damage from accidents and weather events.

## **Average cost of home insurance in major U.S. cities**

## Average cost of homeowners insurance by dwelling coverage amount
[**Dwelling coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/dwelling-insurance/) is the part of an insurance policy that pays to rebuild your home. A lower dwelling coverage amount usually means cheaper rates, while a higher one means more expensive rates. It’s not the same as your home’s market value and depends on square footage, building materials, and how inflation is affecting labor and material costs.
Dwelling coverage is just one part of a home insurance policy, which also typically includes personal property, liability, other structures, loss of use, and other types of coverage.
This table shows the national average annual home insurance premium for different dwelling coverage amounts.

## Average cost of condo insurance
[**Condo insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/condo-insurance/), also called HO-6 coverage, is a type of homeowners insurance specifically for people who own and live in a condominium unit. Condo insurance covers a condo’s interior, some fixtures, your personal property, and your liability as a property owner. 
It doesn’t cover a building’s roof, exterior, or landscaping. A condominium association master policy covers those things.
Like a standard HO-3 homeowners insurance policy, condo policy premiums can vary based on location. Condos are susceptible to weather-related damage and property crimes just like single-family homes.
Here’s how much [**condo insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-is-condo-insurance/) costs for different levels of dwelling coverage.

$500,000 | $1,257  
$750,000 | $1,802  
## **Average cost of homeowners insurance by credit tier**
Insurers typically review credit history to inform home insurance premiums. Insurance companies do a “soft” credit pull that won’t affect your credit score, so applying for multiple policies or switching insurers for a better rate won’t ding your credit score.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance/#cite-4)
Insurers typically generate a credit-based insurance score, which can predict your likelihood of filing a claim and its cost, according to credit-reporting agency Experian.
Since credit history is just one of many factors affecting rates, the average rate difference between someone with excellent and poor credit is only about $300 per year, according to Insurify data. These are the national average annual home insurance premiums by credit tier.
The below rates are estimated rates current as of: Tuesday, October 7 at 12:00 PM PDT. 
Excellent | Good | Fair | Poor  
---|---|---|---  
$2,339 | $2,554 | $3,025 | $3,185  
## How to get cheaper homeowners insurance
Home insurance costs are rising. The good news is that you can take action to keep your insurance costs on the lower side. Consider these strategies as you seek cheaper rates:
  * **Shop around.** Every insurance company offers different premiums. As a homeowner, it’s a good idea to shop around to lock in the best rates.
  * **Increase your home insurance deductible.** A higher deductible typically leads to a lower insurance premium. This could work for you if you can afford to pay more out of pocket when you file a claim.
  * **Bundle your insurance policies.** If you need home insurance, you likely need other types of insurance, like life insurance or auto insurance. Consider bundling your policies through the same insurance company to snag a better rate on each.
  * **Ask for a discount.** Many insurance companies offer discounts. Don’t be afraid to ask if you qualify for a discount on your homeowners insurance policy. You may qualify for something you weren’t aware existed.
  * **Work on your credit.** In many states, insurers can consider your credit history when determining rates. Generally, better credit translates to lower insurance premiums. You can build your credit by paying bills on time and paying off credit cards.
  * **Limit your insurance coverage.** Buying less liability insurance could help you lower your insurance costs. Still, try not to skimp on the dwelling coverage amount; otherwise, you could be in a tough situation if your home is destroyed and you need to file a claim.

## What home insurance covers
The level of home insurance coverage you need varies based on your unique situation. For example, an older, more expensive home may be more likely to have structures and systems that break down and need repair. 
This table outlines some home insurance coverage options and potential coverage amounts.
**Coverage Type** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Amount Covered** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **What’s Covered** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---|---  
Dwelling coverage | Varies (should be based on the cost of rebuilding your home) | The cost to repair or replace the physical structure of your home, including damage from fire or theft  
[Other structures coverage](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/other-structures-coverage/) | Varies (usually 10% of the insurance value on your home) | The cost to repair or replace separate structures on your property, like a shed or fence  
[Personal property coverage](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-coverage/) | Varies (usually 50% of the insurance value on your home) | Funds to repair or replace personal belongings you store in your home (for example, items lost in a fire)  
[Personal liability coverage](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability/) | $100,000+ | If a guest is injured on your property and you’re liable, this coverage can help pay for your legal expenses and their medical care  
Medical payments coverage |  Varies (usually $1,000– $5,000) | If someone is injured on your property, this can help cover their medical bills, regardless of fault  
[Loss of use coverage](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/loss-of-use-coverage/) | Varies (usually 20% of the insurance coverage value on your home) | If damage makes your home unlivable, loss of use coverage can help you pay for living expenses elsewhere, like hotel bills and restaurant meals  
### What homeowners insurance doesn’t cover
Home insurance has some notable exclusions, so depending on your home’s age, condition, and location, you may want to consider buying additional coverage. Regardless, reading your policy is extremely important so you know what it includes and in which areas you may need to purchase more coverage.
Cause matters when it comes to what homeowners insurance covers. For example, water damage from a burst pipe is covered if you keep the home properly heated, but damage from a flood isn’t. These are some common home insurance coverage exceptions:
  * **Floods:** You’ll need a separate policy to [**cover flood damage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/) from severe weather.
  * **Earth movement:** Standard home insurance policies don’t cover damage from landslides, mudslides, sinkholes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.
  * **Pest damage:** If rodents or insects chew on your home, your home insurance won’t cover the damage.
  * **Routine wear and tear or neglect:** Insurers expect you to maintain your home, so homeowners insurance won’t cover damages like worn roofing and rotting boards.
  * **Expensive valuables:** Your policy likely includes some personal property coverage, but if you have pricey items to insure, check your limits to confirm you have enough coverage.

## Other types of home insurance coverage
You can buy certain additional coverages as an add-on through your home insurer, but for some things, you’ll need an entirely separate policy.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/0194b78427/weather-96x96-orange_043-flood.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/0194b78427/weather-96x96-orange_043-flood.svg)
#### Flood insurance
If the Federal Emergency Management Agency designates your area as a special flood hazard zone, your lender will likely require you to get flood insurance either from a private insurer or the National Flood Insurance Program. NFIP flood insurance can cover your home’s structure and contents, but private insurers may offer higher coverage limits or additional coverages you need to fully insure your home.

#### Earthquake insurance
[**Earthquake insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/earthquake-insurance/) covers damage or costs an earthquake directly causes, such as home repairs, personal property damage, debris removal, and extra living expenses. Your insurer may offer earthquake insurance as a policy add-on, or you may need to purchase coverage through another private or public insurer, like the California Earthquake Authority.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/68ed522f01/windstorm-and-hail.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/68ed522f01/windstorm-and-hail.svg)
#### Windstorm insurance
[**Windstorm insurance**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/windstorm-insurance/) covers hail or wind damage from a tornado, thunderstorm, or hurricane. This coverage could be important if you have a coastal home in an area with a high storm risk. Your insurer may include coverage in your standard policy or offer it as an additional coverage option, or your state may have a public plan, like the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association.

  * ### What’s a reasonable price for homeowners insurance for a $750,000 home?
If you can secure a home insurance policy for less than the average cost in your area for the dwelling coverage amount you need, that may be a good price. But many factors influence the cost of home insurance, including location, the age of the home, your credit history, and the insurance company you choose.
  * ### Is $3,300 per year normal for California homeowners insurance?
The average annual cost of home insurance in California for a policy with $500,000 in dwelling coverage is $3,060, according to Insurify data. But the average home value in the Golden State is $773,263, according to Zillow. So if your home’s value is average or higher, $3,300 might be a reasonable price for a home insurance policy.
  * ### How much is the average cost of home insurance per year?
The national average cost of homeowners insurance is $2,532 for $300,000 in dwelling coverage. Averages can also vary by state, city, and even ZIP code, so it’s important to compare quotes from multiple insurance companies before choosing a policy.
  * ### What is the cost of home insurance in Massachusetts?
Average home insurance costs in Massachusetts range from $1,260 per year for a policy with $200,000 in dwelling coverage to $3,828 annually for $750,000 in dwelling coverage.
  * ### Over a 10-year period, is home insurance really worth it?
Homeowners insurance is always worth having. First, if you have a mortgage, your lender will almost certainly require you to have home insurance as a condition for getting and keeping your home loan. And your chances of needing to file at least one claim per decade are fair. Annually, about one out of every 18 insured homes has a claim, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
  * ### How much is home insurance for a rental property?
If you rent out a house you own, your property insurance will cost about 25% more than it would if you lived in the house yourself.[[5]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/average-cost-of-homeowners-insurance/#cite-5)


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000


Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.
