### GEICO vs. Progressive: rates for high-risk drivers
If you have infractions like an [at-fault collision](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/) or reckless driving violation in your driving history, GEICO could be more budget-friendly for insurance coverage than Progressive. DUIs were the only exception — on average, Progressive offers a cheaper rate than GEICO [after a DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/car-insurance-after-dui/). Every car insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't hesitate to shop around to figure out which insurer is best for you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: PROGRESSIVE VS. GEICO
**Violation** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Progressive avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,857 | $2,720  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,580 | $2,245  
DUI/DWI | $2,550 | $2,201  
Reckless driving | $2,238 | $2,457  
Speeding ticket | $1,395 | $2,091  
#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/). 
Auto insurance data methodology Chevron down icon
### GEICO vs. Progressive: rates by age
Insurance companies use a driver's age as an estimator of risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is usually priciest for teen drivers — due to their increased odds of being involved in an accident — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every car insurance company prices age brackets differently, it's worth doing some comparison shopping.
According to our data, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose GEICO instead of Progressive: GEICO offers average yearly savings of $4,740 compared to Progressive. At all ages, GEICO was the cheapest.
##### RATES BY AGE: PROGRESSIVE VS. GEICO
**Age bracket** | **GEICO avg. annual premium** | **Progressive avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $3,508 | $8,248  
**20s** | $1,438 | $2,287  
**30s** | $1,218 | $2,287  
**40s** | $1,189 | $1,644  
**50s** | $1,160 | $1,542  
**60s** | $1,065 | $1,403  
Costs aside, GEICO and Progressive both have pros and cons, including discount programs, customer satisfaction ratings, policy add-ons and financial stability. Make an informed decision by getting quotes and [comparing auto insurance rates](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/) before finalizing a policy.

## Telematics options: GEICO vs. Progressive
GEICO and Progressive both offer [telematics car insurance programs](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/) that can be beneficial to certain types of drivers. Have a look at the comparison below to see if one stands out as a better option for your insurance needs.
GEICO DriveEasy
[GEICO Drive Easy Pro](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/geico-driveeasy/) is an app that tracks your driving habits to better assess your level of risk. For safe drivers, this can sometimes result in cheaper rates. Currently, the app is rated on app stores at 3.5 out of 5 stars (both Google Play and the Apple Store).
Progressive Snapshot
[Snapshot](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/car-insurance-telematics/progressive-snapshot-review/) is Progressive's telematics option.

Good drivers stand to save an average of $145 on their premium according to the company.
### Zebra tip: Explore both companies for telematics options
* * *
The telematics options from both Progressive and GEICO could offer savings for safe drivers. However, keep in mind that depending on your driving habits, you may not save as much as you'd expect — but nonetheless, these programs are worth exploring to potentially save money on your premium.

Progressive has a much larger presence in the auto insurance space than it does homeowners, and some policyholders may find its policy options limiting. GEICO offers homeowners insurance through a number of partner companies instead of under its own banner.

### Which company comes out on top?
#### GEICO
* * *
Both GEICO and Progressive can provide customers with good [homeowners policies](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/policies/). While it's important to remember that GEICO doesn't actually underwrite its own policies, the company still ranked above Progressive in The Zebra's Customer Satisfaction survey and has logged fewer complaints according to the NAIC.
* * *
### GEICO vs. Progressive: home insurance rate comparison
Progressive's [average annual homeowners insurance rate](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/rating-factors/average-cost/) is $1,355, or just under $113 a month. Because GEICO does not underwrite its own homeowners policies, it's more difficult to provide accurate rate data.
Your individual rates will vary from one company to another. This is because every insurance company has different methods for underwriting. Your rates are highly dependent upon both where you live and your individual profile, and each company will weigh factors such as area crime, proximity to fire-fighting services and the age of your home differently.
For this reason, it's highly recommended that you shop for homeowners quotes from a number of different sources, as this will likely lead you to the best rate. While cost is an important factor when shopping for homeowners insurance, it's most important to have good coverage from an insurer that you can trust.
Cheapest average rates
Based on the data we have available, **Progressive has the cheapest home insurance rates at around $113 per month**.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global.
