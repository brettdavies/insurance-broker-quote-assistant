#  State Farm raised policy $956 month! 
We’ve already gotten the typical raise of $200 the past year. Now they’ve raised my policy over $956 per month! We went from $499.98 to $1456.29. They claim it’s due to adding a youthful driver. I have two other children that were added as youthful drivers and our policy went up around $70, yes it was pre-Covid so I expected it to be higher this go round. $956!?! Is anyone else experiencing this? 
I don’t even see my son listed on the policy anywhere and the only change I see is the 81 el Camino went from $186 month to $1116 a month.

Time to shop around. SF apparently isn't all that interested in insuring new drivers in your area at the moment and they've given you a "maybe you should shop around" price. Of course, if your new driver has tickets or claims already, then maybe you're stuck with high premiums for awhile. 
If you have an agent, might be a good idea to ask them to review your policy and file and make sure there's no misinformation there.

Good point. I work in the group health insurance space. Sometimes a carrier will give a crazy renewal basically saying what you said. In a way firing the insured.

Progressive did that to me last year doubled my side by side insurance from 400 to about 800 so I went with someone else got it for 194 a year same coverage. I checked Progressive again because my policy is due next month and they're offering it to me again for 300. My current policy renews about I think I'll just stick with them

Anything precovid no longer matters… this is a common theme amongst the older gen’s, the market out paces you now. Younger drivers aren’t driving well anymore, distracted driving, dui, dwi, curfews statistically have risen. Un/underinsured motorists are at all time high. So many variables that it’s hard to pin point one option you can shop it around, State Farm is a middling carrier now for youthful drivers in terms of rating priority.

The other thing out pacing people is cars are both more expensive to buy and to repair. A literal fender bender used to be "unbolt bumper, bolt new bumper on. Maybe replace a light housing or two." Now with integrated sensors and larger unitized plastic designs, even a small accident can cause thousands in damage. 
Yes, the cars are much safer in a dramatic crash, but most insurance payouts are for smaller incidents that add up. Add in a teen driver who is more likely to cause these, and premiums can jump dramatically.

Insurance everywhere is going up. Shop around but also call your agent, not just someone in their office, and ask them to review your policy with you to see where the differences are. The difference on the el Camino is 930, which is almost all of your increase so you need to find out what is causing the increase on this car specifically.

It's that the youth driver is listed on an _old_ car. The biggest expense with any car crash is medical. A young person, driving a pre-airbag, pre collision warning, pre lane assist (a truly old car) vehicle, gets into an accident and is _much_ more likely to sustain serious injury. 
OP should consider purchasing a used mid-2010s suburu with high mileage, that has airbags and some more advanced safety features. Pay cash, put liability only. 
He's going to see a major difference.

Sounds like it's a good time to shop your insurance - call some local agents. You might find that the market is all similar to the State Farm premium, or you might find significant savings.

Depending on your state, SF has multi car policies now. Likely your new driver is not just being rated on the El Camino, but rather all the cars on that policy. If they literally aren’t going to drive any of the other cars AT ALL (this is important or they will not be covered if there’s an accident) you can ask them to peel the car off the multi car policy that the kid will drive and rate him only on that car.

You’ve gotten some answers on the youthful drivers - high risk, high rates. 
One aspect I will say is you need to check and see what kind of policy the el Camino is written on. SF can either write it under a regular auto policy which is treated just as any other car in the household and you’d be paid ACV at the time of a claim. Or you can write it under an antique auto policy which gives the vehicle a specified value of coverage. The antique auto used to be slightly cheaper because it’s considered an ‘occasional’ car and not driven as much. The problem that always happened was that there is an entirely separate application for those policies and you basically have to pay to get it valued by a third party in order to get the policy reviewed by an underwriter. 
If you already have it on the antique policy is guessing that SF adjusted their base rates for those policies because they were DIRT cheap compared to the coverage they provided. When I worked for them about 10 years ago I quoted my own antique vehicle and for $50,000 in value the policy was about $30 a month, including comp and collision. If it’s already on the SF antique policy you can try getting a quote from Haggerty.

You might check with Hagerty for the El Camino, they specialize in classic cars and might be significantly cheaper. I know when I checked for my Z3 they offered much better coverage, but it was about the same price as my current coverage, so I didn’t end up changing

Yeah mine went up. Turns out my agent quietly did not adjust the premium when they turned 16. Now I think corporate is making sure those teen drivers are fully accounted for. Doubling or tripling when you have teens is quite normal. The worse drivers they are the higher it goes.
