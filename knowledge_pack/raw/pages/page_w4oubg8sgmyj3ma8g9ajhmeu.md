## How much is motorcycle insurance for 20-year-olds?
The average motorcycle insurance price for 20-year-olds is $62 per month, or $743 per year.
The cost of motorcycle insurance for 20-year-olds is 21% less expensive than the [average cost of coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-of-motorcycle-insurance "Average Cost of Motorcycle Insurance") for an 18-year-old. But it's still 14% more than for a 21-year-old. A 20-year-old motorcycle rider's rates can greatly depend on location, provider and even gender.
You can pay hundreds more for motorcycle insurance based on where you live. The cost of motorcycle insurance in Pennsylvania averages just $588 annually — that’s $241 less than the rate we found in Georgia.

Find Insurers
We found a very small difference across genders in the price of motorcycle insurance for 20-year-olds. Many companies quote the same rates regardless of gender, but that’s not always the case.
Young women sometimes pay slightly more than young men for motorcycle insurance. This might come as a surprise, since women often pay less for car insurance than men.
For example, Dairyland charges female riders in New York $20 per year more for coverage than men. Allstate also charges its female applicants more.
| Men | Women  
---|---|---  
California | $805 | $805  
Georgia | $830 | $829  
New York | $699 | $700  
Pennsylvania | $588 | $588  
Texas | $788 | $793  
In the locations surveyed for this article, the gender of the applicant only accounted for a difference of $1 per month. While this data indicates that gender matters less to motorcycle insurers than it does to [car insurance providers](https://www.valuepenguin.com/20-year-old-car-insurance "Car Insurance Costs for 20-Year-Old Males and Females"), it's a good idea to compare the price you're quoted with a few different providers' rates.
## Who has the cheapest motorcycle insurance for young riders?
Dairyland charges the lowest motorcycle insurance price for 20-year-olds at $574 per year, or about $48 per month.
The cheapest motorcycle insurance provider for young riders is commonly **Dairyland**. This insurer's rate is significantly cheaper than the average price for most riders this age and 29% cheaper than the most expensive company's rate.

## How to save on motorcycle insurance as a 20-year-old
As you age, your motorcycle insurance rates decrease. We've found that the price of motorcycle insurance for 20-year-olds is cheaper than [bike insurance for 18-year-olds](https://www.valuepenguin.com/motorcycle-insurance-cost-for-18-year-old "How Much Is Motorcycle Insurance for 18-Year-Olds?"), who can pay nearly $1,000 a year for coverage. However, [21-year-olds](https://www.valuepenguin.com/motorcycle-insurance-cost-21-year-old "Average Motorcycle Insurance Costs for 21-Year-Olds") save over $100 on motorcycle insurance per year compared to 20-year-olds.
The best way to save money is to compare prices offered by multiple motorcycle insurance companies. Rates can fluctuate drastically depending on your provider, and you may miss out on savings if you purchase the first policy you find just to satisfy your state's legal requirements. You could also save by qualifying for discounts offered by providers, including discounts for:
  * Electing to pay your bills electronically 
  * Paying your premium in full 
  * Renewing your policy with the same company 
  * Shopping with the company you already have another policy with 


## Is motorcycle insurance cheaper than car insurance?
Motorcycle insurance is much cheaper than car insurance. The average cost of car insurance for a 20-year-old is $5,517 per year, more than seven times the average cost of coverage for motorcyclists of the same age.
The cost difference between the two forms of insurance is due to vehicle size: In most cases, cars inflict far more damage or injury than motorcycles. Motorcycles are also worth much less than cars, meaning there are fewer expenses for your insurer if your bike is damaged and needs repair.
## Methodology
To find the cheapest motorcycle insurance for 20-year-old riders, we collected quotes from four top motorcycle insurers: Progressive, Geico, Allstate and Dairyland.
The quotes were all for full coverage and were gathered across five locations: San Jose, California; Augusta, Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Austin, Texas. The sample customer has been licensed to use a car and a motorcycle since they were 16, and they ride a 2020 Harley-Davidson Street 500.
