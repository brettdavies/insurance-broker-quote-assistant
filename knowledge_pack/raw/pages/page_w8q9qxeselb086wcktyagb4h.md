## How to lower car insurance rates in 2025
[Car insurance is expensive](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/why-is-car-insurance-so-expensive.html), but there are a lot of ways to get a better rate. While choosing lower coverage limits or carrying [state minimum liability](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/coverage/understanding-minimum-car-insurance-requirements.html) will get you [cheaper car insurance](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance.html), there are better ways to save without sacrificing coverage:
  1. Raise your deductible. A higher deductible means lower rates; just ensure you can afford it if you have to pay it.
  2. Ask about discounts. There are a lot of car insurance discounts out there, including for taking a defensive driving course, paperless billing, good student, automatic payments and more.
  3. Bundle your [auto with home](https://www.insurance.com/auto-insurance/home-and-auto-insurance-bundle.html) and other policies. One of the biggest discounts you can get is for buying your home and auto insurance with the same company; you'll save on both policies.
  4. Shop around and compare companies. Shopping around is the most effective way to save money on car insurance.


Car insurance rates vary widely by company, so shopping around is the easiest way to find a better deal.
## Methodology
We partnered with Quadrant Information Services to field average auto insurance rates in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. National and state average rates are based on three coverage levels: state minimum, 50/100/50 liability-only, and full coverage with 100/300/100 liability and $500 deductibles. 
Unless otherwise indicated, averages are based on our full coverage data set. This data set is based on:
  * Bodily injury liability of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident
  * Property damage liability of $100,000 per incident
  * Comprehensive and collision deductibles of $500
  * 40-year-old driver
  * Honda Accord LX
  * Good credit
  * A clean driving record
  * 12-mile commute, 10,000 annual mileage


Additional rate data is drawn based on:
  * All available year, make and model data 
  * Ages ranging from 16 to 75
  * Excellent, fair and poor credit
  * All available traffic violations
  * One or more at-fault accidents
