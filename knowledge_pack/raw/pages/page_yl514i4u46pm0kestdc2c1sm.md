# Auto insurance after a DUI
At Progressive, we insure drivers with a DUI violation and can file an SR-22 immediately, if necessary. A DUI doesn’t always mean you need an SR-22. But, if you need one, you’ll know for sure because a court or your state will tell you if it’s required.

## What is “DUI insurance”?
There is no official policy called “DUI insurance.” But, because many companies won’t insure a driver after a DUI, the phrase is commonly used to call attention to the incident when shopping for auto insurance. No worries! At Progressive, you can likely still get insurance if you’ve had a DUI.
Depending on the state, a DUI may be referred to as a DWI (driving while intoxicated), OMVI (operating a motor vehicle impaired), or OVI.

## How long does a DUI stay on your driving record?
You’re looking at three to five years in most states. In some states, a DUI will fall off after just three years like any other traffic violation. In California, it will stay on your driving record for 10 years.
Please note that a driving record is separate from a criminal record. A DUI may stay on your criminal record for life.
## How does a DUI affect your insurance rate?
If you have a DUI violation, your rate will go up. Insurance companies may consider DUI drivers as riskier to insure or even refuse coverage. Some insurers will refer customers with a DUI to Progressive, as we accept DUI drivers and only raise rates by a countrywide average*Read the associated disclosure for this claim. of about 13% after one DUI.
Your first DUI increases your rate by 13%.
The amount of time passed since the DUI as well as your age and driving history will factor in to the amount of the increase. For example, if you’ve never had any accidents and speeding tickets, and your DUI is the only hit on your record, your rate likely won’t go up as much.
Once the DUI violation no longer shows on your motor vehicle report, you should see a decrease in your car insurance rate.
### If I’m in an accident while driving drunk, am I covered?
Yes. You’re covered up to the limits of your policy for any accident, regardless of fault or if you were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. That includes damage to your car or someone else’s property as well as their injuries.
