## Our Editor Take
## Our Editor Take
State Farm is a mixed bag when it comes to rates. It has good rates for certain types of drivers and very high rates for others. And unfortunately it lacks a lot of coverage types that are easy to find from its top competitors, which pushed down its rating in our analysis.
On the upside of rates, State Farm generally has good rates for drivers who have caused an accident with injury or property damage. It also has lower-than-average rates for drivers with poor credit or a speeding ticket. There are a good number of discounts available, including a bundling discount averaging a generous 23% when you buy State Farm auto and homeowners insurance.
If you have poor credit you’ll likely want to look elsewhere for auto insurance: We found that State Farm’s rates for drivers with poor credit were the highest among all the companies we evaluated, coming in at over $4,000 a year higher than the national average.
If you’re interested in usage-based insurance that tracks your driving, you can get a 10% enrollment discount for State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save program. You can earn up to 30% discount at renewal time if your driving scores well, and your rates won’t go up if your driving isn’t great.
On the downside, State Farm does not offer accident forgiveness, new car replacement, a pay-per-mile insurance program or a vanishing deductible.
Also, in our survey of State Farm customers, only 76% of customers who have made claims report that they are somewhat to completely satisfied with the claims process, compared to our survey average of 83%. The main pain points were a lack of communication about claims and lack of a timely resolution to claims.
However, we found that 89% of State Farm customers had some level of satisfaction with customer service and pricing, which was slightly above average (86%).
  * Will provide SR-22s.
  * Low level of complaints about State Farm auto insurance made to state insurance departments over the last three years.
  * Offers a good digital experience, including a mobile app with high user ratings, online quotes and the ability to buy a policy online


  * Received only a C grade for the last four years from auto repair experts for its collision claim processes.
  * You can find better rates elsewhere for adding a teen driver.

State Farm’s rates for drivers with poor credit are 295% higher than its rates for those with good credit.

## Why You Might Choose State Farm Car Insurance
State Farm didn’t make our list of the [best car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) companies in our nationwide analysis, but it can still be a good choice for some drivers, especially those who like talking to an agent. Some advantages of State Farm are:
  * **You’ll be assigned an agent.** State Farm assigns you one of its 19,000 agents to be a point of contact for quotes and policy questions. This may be one reason it has a low complaint level with state insurance departments.
  * **It’s available nationwide.** State Farm operates in all 50 states. That makes it easy to keep State Farm if you move states (although it is not currently selling new policies in Massachusetts or Rhode Island).
  * **Its usage-based insurance (UBI) won’t raise your rates.** Using its Drive Safe & Save UBI program won’t result in higher rates if you show risky driving behaviors. With competitors such as Geico and Progressive, your rates may increase if your driving score is poor.


* * *
## State Farm Car Insurance Drawbacks
State Farm isn’t a great fit for all drivers due to drawbacks that include:
  * **Coverage options lacking.** State Farm doesn’t offer accident forgiveness, a diminishing deductible, gap insurance or new car replacement. For those options you’ll need to look to one of its many competitors.

## Methodology
To identify the [best car insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/) we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, customer satisfaction and collision repair grades from auto body professionals.
To identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, collision repair grades from auto body professionals and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
**Auto insurance rates (40% of score):** We analyzed average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit and drivers caught without insurance.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
  * $100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
  * Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
  * Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.


**Source:** [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/).
**Car insurance coverage options (20% of score):** Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer:
  * Accident forgiveness
  * Gap insurance
  * New car replacement
  * Nonowners policies
  * Usage-based insurance
  * Pay-per-mile insurance
  * Rideshare insurance
  * SR-22s
  * Vanishing deductibles

**Complaints (15% of score):** We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.
**Source:** [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm).
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
**Collision repair (5% of score):** We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
**Source:** CRASH Network’s [Insurer Report Card](https://www.crashnetwork.com/irc/) provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.
**Digital experience (5% of score):** We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated car insurers on:
  * Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple.
  * If there’s a useful website search function.
  * If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
  * If there’s a Spanish version of the website.
  * If you can get a quote online.
