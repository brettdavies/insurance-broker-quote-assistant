Do you have a homeowners policy? If so, usually purchasing an umbrella policy is relatively low and will increase your personal liability and your auto liability limits. Edit to add that I’m an insurance broker with 20+ years of experience.

From Ottawa, GH plat hybrid max - with CAA, and topped everything to the max ($2M liability, medical, etc) $220 a month. We have the house and I have an at fault accident. 
Edit: forgot to mention, we got a letter that if we do not install an after market engine immobilizer, our policy will have a surcharge of $1500 at renewal.

Get quotes. Your liability limits are okay, but I would get $500k combined single limits for liability. I would avoid deductibles on the UM/UIM coverage. Increase your comp and collision deductibles. Seattle is a bit higher than the rest of the country. But you should be able to get higher limits for at least what you are paying now.

Why stop there. Get $1MM combined single limit lol. JK I don't recommend increasing deductibles for comp and collision. 500 is good. I would personally add a glass coverage at 0 deductible

Clean records - safe driver discount (just having clean records) - defensive driver discount (took a defensive driving course) - go green discount (paperless, digital notifications only) - multi car discount - auto pay discount - new car discount. That’s every discount available to me with my policy with the exception of bundling in homeowners insurance. 
Live in NJ and these are our maximum coverages possible before adding umbrella policy. Old lady is primary driver on this vehicle and this cost is for 12,000 miles per year. $2,332 the year.

If I read that right, you property damage (caused by you) is $100K per accident. 
And your rental coverage is $40 per day up to 30 days. 
That is severely underinsured if you don't have an umbrella policy. You cause an accident (not that you plan to but accidents happens and why you have coverage), and your insurance will only pay $100K in property damage total. Depending on how many cars are involved, you are opening yourself to liability. You could easily hit two cars (or one car pushed into another) and cause more than $100K in damage. Add in image to a public utility pole or guardrail and you are $2)k in for that alone. 
And I suggest you call your local rental companies and ask their contracted rates with your insurance company. $40 a day is a subcompact car.

My insurance broker said that all insurance is increasing for a variety of reasons: 1- Hyundai / Kia thefts and 2- hurricanes and fire damage (when it was covered). Basically, we are all helping the insurance companies mitigate their losses.
