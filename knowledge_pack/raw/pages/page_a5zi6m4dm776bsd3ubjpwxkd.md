# What is aggressive driving?
The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's (NHTSA) definition of aggressive driving is "a combination of moving traffic offenses to endanger other persons or property." Aggressive drivers engage in risky behavior that ignores the safety of others. This behavior can occur at any speed and isn't necessarily habitual. For instance, someone can become an aggressive driver in a moment of stress or when they're in a hurry.

## What's the difference between aggressive driving and road rage? 
**Aggressive driving** is when a driver endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property. **Road rage** is an aggressive reaction to other drivers, pedestrians, or cyclists. It usually results in an escalation of angry behavior. Although aggressive driving and road rage can go hand in hand, they don't have to. While aggressive tendencies on the road can lead to a traffic violation and a citation for reckless driving, road rage may not have been the cause.
### Examples of aggressive driving
These behaviors aim to provoke other drivers, such as honking the horn excessively, flashing headlights at drivers traveling slowly, or any action that might create tension or fear on the road.
Behaviors that meet the NHTSA's definition of aggressive driving include:
  * Speeding, especially in heavy traffic
  * Weaving in and out of traffic
  * Passing on the right
  * Running stop signs or red lights
  * [Tailgating](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-deal-with-tailgaters/)
  * Ignoring the right of way
  * Cutting in front of another driver and then slowing down
  * Changing lanes without signaling
  * Blocking others from changing lanes


### Examples of road rage:
  * Verbal insults
  * Yelling
  * Rude gestures
  * Horn honking
  * Reckless driving, such as tailgating
  * Fights or dangerous confrontations


## Can aggressive driving or road rage affect insurance rates? 
Everyone loses their cool occasionally while driving, but becoming angry or frustrated with another driver won't impact your cost for insurance. However, if your aggression or road rage results in a [traffic violation or accident](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-accidents-impact-insurance/), your auto insurance rate could be affected. If you've racked up multiple driving citations, you could be considered more of a risk by your insurer and be issued a court-ordered [SR-22](https://www.progressive.com/answers/sr-22/), which may have an impact on your policy. Moreover, having multiple reckless driving violations within a certain timeframe may cause an insurance company to cancel your coverage entirely.
### Pro tip:
Driving erratically can affect your rate if you use an app or device from your insurer that monitors your driving habits. Braking hard or quickly accelerating are a couple of examples that may have an impact when using those programs.
## What can I do to improve if I'm an aggressive driver? 
If you think you're an aggressive driver, a [defensive driving course](https://www.progressive.com/answers/defensive-driving-insurance-discount/) might help reset your driving habits. Learning to control your emotions is important. When you have an impulse to make an aggressive driving maneuver, remind yourself that others can see you, and it may be someone from your community or workplace. Also, knowing and practicing [basic driving etiquette](https://www.progressive.com/answers/driving-etiquette-tips/) can help you become a better, safer driver. 
### How can I handle getting angry while driving?
Here are some techniques to help defuse your anger and calm yourself:
  * **Interrupt negative thoughts** : When you start to get angry at another driver, remind yourself that it's not personal, and you don't know what the other driver is dealing with. For instance, if someone cuts you off, they might be rushing to the hospital. A slow driver might be lost or just learning to drive.
  * **Practice calming breathing** : When our fight-or-flight system activates, we tend to take fast, shallow breaths from our chest. In contrast, diaphragmatic breathing — deep breathing where your belly inflates — is calming. Taking a few deep belly breaths can lower your heart rate and calm you down. [Studies show](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5455070/) it can even reduce the levels of stress hormones in your body, promoting relaxation.
  * **Check for tension in your body** : The body tenses up under stress. Do a quick check to see if you're gritting your teeth, gripping the steering wheel too tight, or holding other tension. If you are, try to relax those muscles. Letting go of tension makes it easier to calm down.
  * **Lay off the horn** : Your car's horn is a signal for alerting others to your presence, not a tool for berating drivers. Excessive honking can cause the other driver to get angry, making the situation worse.


##  How can I avoid aggressive drivers and road rage from others?
The key is to not escalate the situation, such as blocking the lane the angry driver is trying to get into. Instead, you should focus on getting them out of your personal space as fast as possible. These strategies can help you stay safe when dealing with aggressive drivers and road rage:
  * **Let the other driver pass** : Road rage drivers are usually in a hurry, so get out of their way without engaging. Pull over after they pass if you need to calm down.
  * **Don't make eye contact** : Angry drivers may want to intimidate you. Ignore them, and focus on the road.
  * **Contact authorities** : Contact the police to report the angry driver if it's safe to do so. Be prepared to provide identifying information, such as their license plate number.
  * **Don't go home** : If the offending driver follows you or engages in more aggressive behavior such as ramming your car, don't go to your home, work, or other places you frequent. Instead try to drive to a police station or busy public place. Keep the windows up and the car doors locked.
