## Coverages High-Risk Drivers Should Consider
For high-risk drivers, having the right auto insurance coverage is essential, not just to meet state requirements but to protect against the financial risks that come with a higher likelihood of accidents or claims.
#### High-risk drivers should start with required liability coverage, then consider adding collision and comprehensive if their vehicle is financed or hard to replace out of pocket.
Michelle Robbins **Licensed Insurance Agent**
Because insurers view high-risk drivers as more likely to file claims, securing adequate coverage is a key part of regaining financial and legal stability on the road. Important types of coverage for high-risk drivers include:
  * **Liability Insurance** : Required in nearly every state, this covers injuries and property damage you cause to others. It’s the minimum legal requirement, but often not enough on its own.
  * **Collision Coverage** : [Collision auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/collision-auto-insurance/) pays for repairs to your own vehicle after an at-fault accident.
  * **Comprehensive Coverage** : [Comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) covers damage from non-collision incidents like theft, vandalism, or weather.
  * **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage** : Protects you if you’re hit by someone without enough insurance, which can be especially valuable when you’re already considered high-risk.
  * **SR-22 or FR-44 Certification** : Not technically a coverage type, but a filing often required for high-risk drivers after a DUI or license suspension to prove financial responsibility.


Choosing the right combination of coverage ensures that high-risk drivers are protected from large out-of-pocket expenses and potential legal consequences. While it may cost more upfront, full coverage can provide peace of mind and financial protection that far outweighs the risk of going underinsured.
## Top Auto Insurance Discounts for High-Risk Drivers
High-risk drivers can still find ways to lower their auto insurance premiums by taking advantage of discounts offered by top providers. Progressive stands out with a 30% discount for completing a defensive driving course, which is especially beneficial for drivers with prior violations looking to rebuild their driving record.

Geico and State Farm both offer up to 15% off for defensive driving as well, and also provide strong safe-driver and safety feature discounts—State Farm offering 20% off for each. These companies reward consistent safe driving behavior and the use of safety technology, which can lead to significant long-term savings.

#### High-risk drivers can lower their insurance by comparing quotes, taking a defensive driving course, and avoiding lapses in coverage.
Brad Larson  **Licensed Insurance Agent**
By combining multiple discounts—such as claims-free status, use of vehicle safety features, or enrolling in usage-based programs—high-risk drivers with companies like State Farm, Geico, and Progressive can offset the elevated costs of their higher-risk profile and work toward more affordable premiums over time.

## How High-Risk Drivers Can Save on Car Insurance
High-risk drivers looking to cut their insurance costs have several effective options beyond standard discounts:
  * **Complete a Defensive Driving Course:** This shows insurers you’re committed to safer driving and can reduce your risk profile.
  * **Maintain Continuous Coverage:** Keeping an active policy helps avoid rate hikes due to insurance lapses.
  * **Improve Your Credit Score:** Better credit can lead to lower premiums since many insurers consider credit history when pricing policies.
  * **Choose a Low-Risk Vehicle:** Driving a car with strong safety ratings and lower repair costs can result in cheaper insurance.
  * **Raise Your Deductible:** Increasing your deductible lowers your monthly premium if you’re confident in avoiding frequent claims.


By taking these proactive steps, high-risk drivers can begin rebuilding trust with insurers, lower their overall costs, and work toward qualifying for better rates in the future.

### Who has the best auto insurance?
The best car insurance for high-risk drivers depends on the situation, but State Farm, Progressive, and AAA rank highest due to their competitive pricing, strong discounts, and flexible coverage for drivers with past violations.
### What is the best way to get cheap auto insurance?

### Which insurance type is cheaper?
