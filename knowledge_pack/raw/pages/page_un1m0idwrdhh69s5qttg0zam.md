## Does car insurance go down at 24?
24-year-olds pay $287 less each month, on average, than 18-year-old drivers for full coverage car insurance.
That's because, by the time you turn 24, you likely have several years of driving experience. Insurance companies believe you're less likely to be in accidents compared to younger drivers. By the time you turn 30, your rates could be $329 per month cheaper than an 18-year-old.

**Car insurance is cheaper for 24-year-olds compared to younger drivers.** But 24-year-olds still pay more than older drivers. Rates usually drop as you age and gain more driving experience. When you reach your mid-to-late 60s, prices start to ramp up again.
**However, if you get your license for the first time when you're 24, you'll probably pay more than 24-year-olds who have been driving for several years.** As you get older and gain more experience behind the wheel, your rates will probably go down, unless you [file a claim](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-does-accident-affect-my-car-insurance-rates "How Much Will My Car Insurance Rates Go Up After a Crash?") after an accident you cause.
## Cost of car insurance for 24-year-old female vs. 24-year-old male
Men who are 24 pay an average of $9 more per month than 24-year-old women for full coverage car insurance.
At age 24, men pay an average of $250 per month for full coverage, while women pay $241 per month.
**Car insurance is usually[more expensive for men](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-gender-impacts-car-insurance-rates "Which Gender Pays More for Car Insurance?") than it is for women.** Men are statistically  more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors like speeding and driving drunk. That means they're more likely to get into accidents, so insurance companies charge men higher rates.

## How to get cheap car insurance as a 24-year-old
To find the cheapest car insurance, 24-year-old drivers should shop around for quotes and take advantage of discounts.
**You should always compare quotes from multiple insurance companies to find the best car insurance plan.**
Companies consider lots of factors when deciding how much to charge for car insurance. Depending on where you live, this may include your age, driving record, claims history, the type of car you drive and where you live.
That's why the company that offers you the cheapest car insurance rate could be different from your parents, friends or neighbors.
**You can also lower your insurance costs by taking advantage of[discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts").**
Common car insurance discounts 24-year-old drivers can get include:
  * [Good student discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/good-student-auto-insurance-discount "How to Get Good Student Discount") for full time students with a B grade point average or higher. 
  * [Defensive driving discount](https://www.valuepenguin.com/defensive-driver-training-car-insurance-discount "Defensive Driver Courses: What's Covered, and How To Get an Insurance Discount") for young drivers who take an approved training course. 
  * Safe driver discount for people who avoid accidents or tickets for three to five years. 


The discounts available and how much you'll save may vary depending on the insurance company. So it's important to see which discounts you're eligible for when you're comparing quotes.
