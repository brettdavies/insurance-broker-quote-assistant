## USAA vs. State Farm car insurance coverage options
As two of the biggest insurance companies in the country, USAA and State Farm offer all the [basic coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance") you'd typically see in an auto insurance policy. Both also have a number of common coverage add-ons, such as roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement and rideshare insurance.
Coverage | State Farm | USAA  
---|---|---  
[Roadside assistance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/roadside-assistance-car-insurance "Roadside Assistance: What Is It, and Do I Need It?") |  |

### State Farm auto insurance features
State Farm only offers one type of coverage not available from USAA: **nonowners insurance**. This protects drivers who don't own a vehicle but often drive a borrowed car and drivers without a vehicle who need to file an SR-22.
Although State Farm doesn't have individual coverage add-ons for essential services expenses, funeral expenses and work loss benefits, they're all a standard part of personal injury protection (PIP insurance), which is available. So buying PIP from State Farm gives the same protections as USAA. (Funeral expenses benefits are also available if you buy medical payments coverage, or MedPay.)
But PIP insurance isn't available in every state. Also, it may be cheaper for some drivers to buy these coverages separately.
State Farm's rideshare coverage for drivers who work for a company like Uber or Lyft is more comprehensive than USAA's.
With State Farm rideshare insurance, you'll be covered:
  * When your rideshare app is on and you're available to pick up customers 
  * When you're matched with a customer who needs a ride 
  * While you're transporting a customer 


In comparison, USAA offers rideshare gap protection, which only covers the first stage listed above: the time when you're on duty and waiting to pick up customers. But USAA does not cover you after you've accepted a rideshare request.
### USAA auto insurance features
USAA has a few coverage options that State Farm doesn't. The most useful one is **car replacement**. This coverage helps replace your car after a total loss by paying an extra 20% over than the actual cash value of your vehicle. This is unusual, because it's not limited to new cars. Drivers can add the coverage to any vehicle that has comprehensive and collision coverage.
USAA also offers essential services expenses coverage, funeral expenses coverage and work loss coverage. PIP already includes these coverages. But they may be useful for drivers who live in a state where you can't buy PIP insurance.
* * *
## USAA vs. State Farm availability
State Farm and USAA are the largest and fifth-largest auto insurance companies in the U.S., respectively. And both offer coverage in all 50 states.
But auto insurance from USAA is not available to all drivers.
To purchase a USAA policy, you have to be an active-duty military member, a veteran or a family member of a policyholder.
For that reason, State Farm auto insurance is more obtainable for drivers than USAA.
* * *
## USAA vs. State Farm customer service
Both State Farm and USAA provide an excellent customer experience. But USAA received slightly higher scores from industry reviewers.
Industry reviewer | State Farm | USAA  
---|---|---

J.D. Power | 892 | 909  
NAIC complaint index | 0.97 | 0.85  
AM Best financial strength rating | A++ | A++  
USAA earned top marks on J.D. Power's car claims satisfaction study. That means drivers are happy with their claims process. USAA also receives fewer customer complaints than insurance companies of a similar size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
Though State Farm's scores aren't as high as USAA's, they're still excellent. The company was ranked above average by J.D. Power's satisfaction study. State Farm also gets fewer complaints than most of its competitors.
Both companies earned an A++ financial stability rating from AM Best, indicating they have the ability to pay out claims, even in difficult economic situations.
