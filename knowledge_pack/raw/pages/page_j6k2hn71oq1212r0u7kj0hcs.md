[GEICO](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/geico/116487/), a subsidiary of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/berkshire-hathaway/535041/), is expanding its presence in Florida and North Texas, adding more than 2,000 jobs with new offices in Tampa and Richardson. These expansions are expected to enhance customer service capabilities in both regions.
## **New Tampa campus to bring over 1,000 jobs**
GEICO will open a new campus in Tampa, its third location in Florida, alongside existing offices in Jacksonville and Lakeland. The expansion is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs.
“Tampa’s robust talent pool and dynamic business environment make it the ideal location for our newest office, allowing us to better serve our growing customer base with various insurance products while creating significant employment opportunities in the region,” said Angela Rinella, GEICO’s senior vice president.
The 190,000-square-foot campus, located near Tampa International Airport, will house employees in sales, customer service, and claims roles. Hiring is set to begin in April.
## **Opening of a second Richardson office**
GEICO is also growing its North Texas operations, opening a second office in Richardson. This expansion follows the company’s [December 2024 announcement](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/geico-adds-500-jobs-in-north-texas-516960.aspx) of 500 new positions, bringing the total number of new jobs in the region to over 1,500.
“The outstanding talent pool in North Texas has been instrumental in driving GEICO’s success, and we are thrilled to expand our presence in Richardson,” said Melissa Gallaro, GEICO senior vice president. “The skilled workforce in the region has enabled us to achieve significant growth.”
The new 165,000-square-foot building, set to open in fall 2025, will support sales, service, and claims operations. Once complete, GEICO will occupy nearly 400,000 square feet of office space across its two Richardson locations.
A news release highlighted that, since designating Richardson as a key hub for its commercial insurance operations, GEICO has seen substantial growth in the area.
Founded in 1936, GEICO operates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, offering commercial auto, homeowners, renters, and other insurance products through its affiliated partners.
