# Sinkholes in Florida Explained
Written By [Ted Dryce](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/foundation-repair/sinkholes-in-florida/#author-bio-139)Published on 02/17/2025Updated on 10/27/2025

Sinkholes are a common problem in Florida because of the state’s unique geology. A common variety of bedrock in Florida is limestone, a type of rock that dissolves over time when exposed to water. This can create underground voids that lead to sudden collapses in the ground, called sinkholes. 
These collapses can damage homes and roads and even put people’s safety at risk. Knowing the warning signs and how sinkholes form can help you protect your property and family.

## What Is a Sinkhole?
A sinkhole occurs when the ground collapses into an underground cavity. This process typically begins with the erosion of limestone bedrock, a natural feature of Florida’s geography. Rainwater, often slightly acidic, seeps into the ground and dissolves the limestone, gradually creating voids beneath the surface. 
When the ground above can no longer support itself, it collapses, forming a sinkhole. The development of Florida sinkholes are accelerated by the state’s heavy rainfall, high water tables, and human activities such as construction and groundwater pumping.
[Schedule free Inspection](https://www.alphafoundations.com/contact-us/)
## What Causes Sinkholes in Florida?
Several factors contribute to sinkhole formation, including:
  * **Heavy Rainfall:** Excessive rain can [wash away soil](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/concrete-lifting/soil-washout/) and destabilize the ground above sinkhole-prone areas.
  * **Droughts:** Long dry periods can cause soil to dry out and crumble, making it more likely to collapse when water returns..
  * **Construction & Development:** Human activities, such as road construction and excessive groundwater pumping, can trigger sinkhole formation.
  * **Natural Erosion:** Over time, water naturally erodes limestone layers, making certain areas more susceptible to sinkholes.


## Where Do Sinkholes Occur in Florida?
Sinkholes can happen anywhere in Florida, but they are most common in certain regions. Data from the Florida Center for Instructional Technology (FCIT) at the University of South Florida provides a detailed visual representation of sinkhole occurrences across the state.
According to the map, sinkholes are highly concentrated in the central region, particularly in and around:
  * **Hernando, Hillsborough, and Pasco Counties:** These counties have some of the highest numbers of recorded sinkholes in the state, making the Tampa Bay area one of Florida’s most at-risk regions.
  * **Marion and Alachua Counties:** Including areas such as Ocala and Gainesville, this region sees frequent sinkhole activity due to its geological makeup.
  * **Polk and Orange Counties:** Cities like Orlando and Lakeland are in areas where sinkholes have formed regularly.
  * **Northern Florida (Leon, Suwannee, and Columbia Counties):** While less frequent than in Central Florida, this area still sees notable sinkhole occurrences.


For a better understanding of where sinkholes have occurred, homeowners can refer to the[ FCIT’s Florida sinkhole map](https://fcit.usf.edu/florida/maps/pages/11100/f11165/f11165.htm), which highlights past incidents and high-risk areas.
## Signs of Sinkhole Activity Near Your Home
Recognizing the early warning signs of a developing sinkhole can help prevent significant property damage. Be on the lookout for:
![](https://images.groundworks.com/NCN5ICUA/at/25b93bv524vqbk3xq32b4jmw/Cracked_slab_2.jpg?tr=w-768,h-432,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
  * **Cracks in Walls and Floors:** [Cracks in drywall](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/problem-signs/drywall-cracks/), tile, or concrete slabs may indicate shifting ground beneath your home.
  * **Doors and Windows That Stick:** If doors or windows suddenly become [hard to open or close](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/problem-signs/sticking-doors-windows/), it could mean your house is shifting.
  * **Depressions in the Yard:** If you notice low spots, holes, or sinking areas in your yard, a sinkhole may be forming.
  * **Leaning Structures:** Fences, trees, or utility poles that tilt unexpectedly could be signs of unstable ground.
  * **Water Problems:** Changes in water levels in a well, puddles forming in unusual places, or [poor drainage](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/foundation-repair/have-water-drainage-issues-around-the-foundation-these-5-solutions-can-help/) could mean water is escaping into an underground void.


If you notice any of these warning signs, it’s important to seek professional inspection and repair services immediately. While a sinkhole can’t be stopped, you can prevent damage to your home caused by nearby sinkhole activity.
## How to Protect Your Home from Sinkhole Activity
While sinkholes in Florida are a natural occurrence, homeowners can take steps to reduce their risk and protect their property:
![Alpha crew member installing pier at porch.](https://images.groundworks.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2022/01/CFI-Installing-Pier-at-Porch.jpg?tr=w-410,h-231,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
  * **Helical Piers** : These piers feature[ screw-like threads](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/helical-piers/) that allow them to be twisted into the ground. They work well in loose or unstable soil and are suitable for lighter structures.
  * **Push Piers** : These are hydraulically driven [straight into the ground](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/push-piers/) and are ideal for heavier structures or situations where soil conditions are particularly challenging.
  * **Slab Piers** : Designed specifically for homes with slab foundations, these piers are installed [beneath the concrete slab](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/slab-piers/) to provide targeted support. They are ideal for repairing cracks and leveling uneven floors caused by sinkhole activity.

## Sinkhole FAQs
Are sinkholes more common in certain areas of Florida? 
According to the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection](https://floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes?utm_source=chatgpt.com), sinkholes are most common in central Florida, particularly in Pasco, Hernando, and Marion counties, due to the easily dissolvable limestone bedrock in the region.
Can sinkholes form under new homes? 
Yes, sinkholes can form under new homes if the underlying soil or limestone has not been properly assessed or compacted during construction.
What’s the difference between a sinkhole and a settling foundation? 
A sinkhole involves the collapse of underground voids, while foundation settling is caused by soil compression or poor compaction; a professional inspection can determine the issue.
