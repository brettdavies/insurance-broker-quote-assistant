### Key Takeaways 
  * According to California law, **insurance carriers must reward good drivers with a 20% discount**. 
  * To qualify, you must have **held a driver’s license for three years** and **maintain a clean driving record**. 
  * Drivers who get **more than one demerit point on their records within 36 months** are not eligible for the discount. 
  * You can **hide one point from insurance companies** by completing traffic school. 
  * Some insurers also offer discounts for staying accident-free, installing anti-theft systems, and more. **Drivers can qualify for multiple discounts at once**. 


## What Is the California Good Driver Discount – and How Do You Qualify?
Under **California Insurance Code §1861.02(b)** (Proposition 103), insurers are required to offer a **20% Good Driver Discount** to applicants who meet all of the following conditions:
  * Licensed for at least three consecutive years in the U.S. or Canada.
  * No more than one DMV point on their driving record within the past three years.
  * No convictions for serious driving offenses such as DUI, reckless driving, or other major misdemeanors/felonies in the past ten years.
  * Not principally at fault in any accident that caused bodily injury or death within the past three years.


If you qualify, insurers must provide you with a Good Driver policy when you submit a completed application. The discount is built into your premium — you don’t need to apply separately. Depending on your insurer and coverage, this can save you **hundreds or even thousands of dollars annually**.
The Good Driver Discount was established through **[Proposition 103 in 1988](https://consumerwatchdog.org/insurance/text-proposition-103/)** as part of a broader reform aimed at lowering auto insurance costs and expanding coverage. At the time, rising premiums had left nearly **[one in four California drivers uninsured](https://sins.senate.ca.gov/sites/sins.senate.ca.gov/files/3_24_10_prop17_background.pdf)**.

## What Is Considered a Good Driving Record in California?
![Image shows a car with a certificate and a green check, implying a clean driving record](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
The [California Department of Insurance](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/01-auto/lca/upload/Good-Driver-Definition-Flyer.pdf) states that you’re eligible for a good driver discount if you have **no more than one point on your license within the last three years**. Therefore, drivers charged with a minor infraction over the past 36 months can still qualify. 
**Example** : A [speeding ticket](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/speeding-ticket-california/) for driving 1 to 25 miles over the limit will add one point to your record. If that’s your only violation in a three-year period, you can still receive the Good Driver Discount. In many cases, you may also be able to **complete traffic school** to keep the point from appearing on your public driving record. 
However, certain violations automatically disqualify you from the Good Driver Discount:
  * **DUI (misdemeanor or felony):** Disqualifies you for 10 years; points remain on your record for the same period.
  * **[Reckless driving](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/reckless-driving/), speeding over 100 mph, or at-fault accidents causing injury or death:** These are considered major violations and remove your eligibility.


These offenses indicate **higher risk behavior** , which signals to insurers that you are more likely to file a claim. As a result, you lose access to the discount and will pay higher rates for as long as the violation remains on your record.
### How to Check Your Driving Record
Mistakes can happen, and that’s why you should [check your California driving record](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-driving-record/) at least once a year, as well as:
  * After receiving a [traffic ticket](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/traffic-tickets-california/)
  * If you’ve had a car accident
  * Before applying for a job where your driving record matters


Simply go to the [California DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/customer-service/request-vehicle-or-driver-records/) to get a copy of your driving record. Alternatively, [request it by mail](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/request-for-your-own-driver-license-identification-card-dl-id-or-vehicle-vessel-registration-vr-information-record-inf-1125-pdf/) or from a [local DMV office](http://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/dmv/offices). This service costs $2 to $8, depending on the delivery method and type of record. 
By checking your driving record regularly, you can identify and address any errors that could impact your insurance rates. Plus, you’ll know exactly how many points you have accumulated, and whether you qualify for the good driver discount

## Can You Lose Your Good Driver Discount?
There are situations where your Good Driver Discount can be taken away, which means higher insurance premiums. This happens if you:
  * Already have one point on your record and get a second one within three years.
  * A convicted of a DUI.
  * Are found at fault for an accident that causes injury or death.
  * Are convicted of other serious driving offenses (misdemeanors or felonies).


For minor violations, there’s some relief:
  * Traffic school allows you to mask one eligible point from your public driving record.
  * This option is typically available for infractions like speeding under 100 mph or running a red light, including camera tickets.
  * While the ticket still exists on your DMV record, completing traffic school prevents insurers from seeing the point — which means you may keep your Good Driver Discount.


The good news? Traffic school is easy to complete online. With Best Online Traffic School, you can finish the course at your own pace — and you don’t pay until after you pass.
## Other Good Driver Insurance Discounts
In addition to the California Good Driver Discount, U.S. drivers can qualify for multiple other auto insurance discounts. However, most insurance providers will place a cap on the total discount percentage you can get. 
Seniors may also be eligible for [government-mandated car insurance discounts](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/government-mandated-auto-insurance-discounts/). These usually vary between 5% and 20% and may require taking a [mature driver safety course](https://www.trafficsafetyinstitute.com/mature-driver/). 
Here are some of the most common safe driver discounts offered by major carriers. Just make sure you ask your insurance provider about them, as they may not be automatically applied to your policy. 
### 1.) Accident-Free Discount 
![Image shows a car with a crumpled fender with red prohibition circle over it to suggest no accidents](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Many insurers will lower your premiums if you stay accident-free for one to five years. In California, this perk is available to drivers insured by major carriers like:
  * Geico
  * State Farm
  * Progressive
  * Nationwide 
  * Allstate 
  * Amica


### 2.) Violation-Free Discount
![Image shows an envelope with a speeding ticket in it and a red prohibition circle over it suggesting no speeding tickets](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Most carriers also offer discounts if your driving record stays clean. To qualify, you must go a certain amount of time – typically at least 1-3 years – without [getting a traffic ticket](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/car-insurance-traffic-school/) for speeding, tailgating, [failure to follow a signal](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/cvc-21461-failure-to-obey-traffic-signals/), and other minor traffic violations.
Note that **some insurers offer this discount on top of the mandatory good driver discount**. Others use the term “violation-free discount” for the good driver discount, meaning you must meet the state’s requirements to lower your premiums. 
Below are a few examples of insurance companies offering violation-free discounts:
  * State Farm
  * Progressive
  * Nationwide
  * Allstate
  * Travelers
  * Liberty Mutual


### 3.) Device-Free Driving Discount
![Image shows a hand holding a phone and texting with a red prohibition circle over it suggesting no texting \(while driving\)](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Another way you can get a discount on auto insurance? [Driving without being distracted](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/distracted-driving/) by your devices. 
Qualifying for this discount often means you need to download an insurance carrier app that will detect whether you pick up or use your mobile device while driving. 
A good example is [Drivewise](https://www.allstate.com/drivewise), an app developed by Allstate. 
Once installed, it monitors your driving behavior, including how often you use your phone behind the wheel. If you prove to be a safe driver, you’ll get discounts and rewards every six months. Check with your insurance provider to see if they have similar technology.
### 4.) Usage-Based Insurance Discounts
![Image showing the speedometer and mileage on a car dashboard, showing some of the things usage-based insurance tracks ](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Statistically, people who drive less frequently or for shorter distances are less likely to get into accidents. Less time behind the wheel means lower odds of encountering a dangerous driving situation. Plus, it’s safer to drive in areas where you’re very familiar with the roads. 
That’s why some insurance carriers offer usage-based discounts for people who don’t drive very much. These can be based on your vehicle’s mileage, or you can qualify by downloading an app that tracks the time you spend behind the wheel and where you drive.
Here are some companies offering usage-based insurance discounts, including low-mileage discounts:
  * State Farm 
  * Nationwide
  * USAA
  * Allstate


### 5.) Equipment-Based Insurance Discounts
![Image showing symbols for security, alarms, airbags, seatbelts, and ABS breaks, suggesting some of the automobile equipment an insurer might consider for a discount](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Having certain equipment on or in your vehicle makes it safer. That’s why some insurance companies provide drivers with equipment-based discounts for:
  * Airbags
  * Anti-lock brakes
  * Anti-theft or alarm systems
  * Passive restraints (seat belts that automatically fasten once the car is turned on)
  * Daytime running lights


Since newer vehicles tend to have the latest safety features, some insurance carriers will also offer discounts for driving a newer car.
If you live in California, you may request such discounts from:
  * Geico
  * State Farm
  * Nationwide
  * Allstate
  * Amica
  * Travelers


### 6.) Defensive Driver Course Discounts
![Image showing a defensive driver certificate with a completed sticker on it](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
If you’re proactive about staying as safe as possible behind the wheel, your insurance provider may give you a discount on your premiums. 
For instance, many carriers offer discounts for customers who take [defensive driving courses](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/defensive-driving/). These courses can be completed online in just a few hours, which makes them a great investment for anyone looking to save on auto insurance.
Below are some insurance companies that will reward you for completing defensive driver training:
  * Geico
  * State Farm
  * Nationwide
  * Amica
  * Travelers


If you’re 55+ and have a California driver’s license, check out our [DMV-approved Mature Driver Course](https://trafficsafetyinstitute.com/). It’s accepted by all major insurance carriers and could **lower your premiums by up to 15%**. 
### 7.) Young Driver Discount 
![7.\) Young Driver Discount ](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Drivers under the age of 21 to 25 (depending on the insurer) may qualify for additional discounts. Such discounts are available to those who meet one or more of the following requirements: 
  * Maintain a good driving record
  * Take defensive driving classes
  * Stay on their parents’ policy
  * Move away to school and only drive while at home


For example, Progressive and State Farm have discounts for young drivers who study in a different city or state and drive only when they return home for a visit. 
Amica, on the other hand, offers discounts for drivers under 21. The only requirement is to complete a state-approved driver training program. The company also has discounts for full-time students who are away at school, stay on their parents’ policy, and only drive while at home. 
### 8.) Good Student Discount 
![8.\) Good Student Discount ](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/california-good-driver-discount/)
Young drivers who earn good grades in school (a “B” average or better) may get a discount on their insurance premiums. The savings can be as high as 15%. 
One explanation is that good students are more likely to drive safely. Insurance companies want to encourage and reward this behavior. 
In California, you could get a good student discount if you’re insured by:
  * Geico
  * State Farm
  * Progressive
  * Nationwide
  * Allstate 
  * Travelers
  * USAA
  * Liberty Mutual 


The exact amount you can save depends on your age, insurance provider, and other factors. For example, seniors are more likely to qualify for certain [auto insurance discounts](https://www.bestonlinetrafficschool.co/auto-insurance-discounts-seniors/), such as retired military discounts, than younger drivers. 
Our advice is to request multiple quotes from different insurers. Also, ask about the available discounts and what it takes to qualify.
