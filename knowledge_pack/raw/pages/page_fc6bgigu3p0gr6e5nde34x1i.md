# Everything You Need to Know About California’s 2025 Auto Insurance Minimum Increase
Posted Dec 18, 2024
By the Mercury Team
Starting January 1, 2025, California is raising its minimum [auto insurance](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/insurance/auto/) requirements. With medical bills and repair costs rising, this change is designed to better protect drivers from unexpected financial stress after an accident. Whether you’re a long-time policyholder or just exploring your options for auto insurance in California, here’s what you need to know about these updates, why they matter, and how to prepare.
## Understanding California’s New Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements
So, what’s changing with California’s minimum auto insurance requirements? Let’s break it down so you know exactly what to expect.
Current Minimum Coverage (Before 2025)
Right now, California law requires drivers to have liability insurance with these minimum limits:
  * **$15,000** for injuries or death to one person.
  * **$30,000** for injuries or death to multiple people in one accident.
  * **$5,000** for property damage.


New Minimum Coverage (Effective January 1, 2025)
Starting January 1, 2025, the new minimum [auto coverage in California](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/local/california/auto-insurance/) will be:
  * **$30,000** for injuries or death to one person.
  * **$60,000** for injuries or death to multiple people in one accident.
  * **$15,000** for property damage.


As you can see, the new limits double the protection for bodily injuries and triple the coverage for property damage.
## Why Is California Raising Minimum Auto Coverage?
Since 1967, California’s minimum requirements for auto insurance have remained unchanged. Now, with [Senate Bill 1107](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1107), the state is updating its limits for the first time in over five decades. But why? Ultimately, the increased limits are a response to the rising costs of medical care, emergency services, and vehicle repairs.
In fact, according to a [press release from the California State Senate](https://www.eastcountytoday.net/sen-dodd-introduces-auto-liability-insurance-reform-bill/), the state’s current minimums are among the lowest in the nation, with only four states matching or having lower limits. These outdated requirements can leave crash victims without the financial support they need and place a heavy burden on at-fault drivers.
Sen. Bill Dodd explains, “California drivers have been underinsured for too long — and it has been costing them dearly. With the signing of this bill, we can ensure crash victims get the financial support they need while covering those who might be liable for soaring medical and property damage costs. This modernizes our insurance laws, bringing our state in line with what the rest of the country deems the right amount of coverage.”
Craig Peters, president of Consumer Attorneys of California, adds, “Over the last half-century, the cost of medical care and vehicular repairs has skyrocketed, leaving too many motorists underinsured and unprepared to cover the cost of being a victim of a negligent driver.”
## How California’s Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements Affect Drivers
With the higher coverage limits, you may see a slight [rise in your insurance premiums](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/resources/auto/why-did-my-car-insurance-go-up.html). While increased costs aren’t ideal, they come with a huge upside — much stronger financial protection when it matters most.
The new limits are designed to reflect the real-world costs of accidents today. Medical bills and repair expenses can quickly add up, and the old limits often left drivers paying out of pocket. With these higher minimums, your policy is far more likely to cover the full costs of an accident and protect you from potentially devastating financial consequences.
Think of it as an investment in your peace of mind. While the initial cost might go up a bit, the long-term financial safety and the ability to recover from an accident without too much stress are priceless.
## Ensuring You Meet California’s Minimum Auto Coverage Requirements
With the upcoming changes, now’s the perfect time to review your auto insurance policy to make sure you’re prepared. Don’t worry—staying compliant is simple, and we’re here to guide you through the process.
### Review Your Current Policy
Look at your current auto insurance policy. Check the liability limits and compare your coverage amounts for bodily injury per person, bodily injury per accident, and property damage. If your limits are below the new minimums — $30,000/$60,000/$15,000 — you’ll need to adjust your policy or your provider may do so automatically.
It’s important to note that these minimum requirements only cover damages and injuries you cause to other people or their property. They don’t cover damages to your own vehicle or medical expenses for you and your passengers.
If you want [full coverage car insurance](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/resources/basics-101/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance.html), consider adding these options to your policy:
  * **Comprehensive coverage:** Protects your vehicle from non-collision-related damage, such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters, or falling objects.
  * **Collision coverage:** Covers repair or replacement costs for your vehicle if it’s damaged in an accident, regardless of who’s at fault.
  * **Personal injury protection (PIP):** Helps cover medical expenses, lost wages, and other costs for you and your passengers after an accident, no matter who’s at fault.
  * **Medical payments coverage:** Specifically covers medical and funeral expenses for you and your passengers, regardless of fault.
  * **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage:** Protects you if you’re hit by a driver who doesn’t have insurance or enough coverage to pay for the damages.


### Talk with an Insurance Agent
If you need help managing these changes, your [California insurance agent](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/agents/california-insurance-agents.html) is your best resource to help make the process easy and stress-free. Here’s how they can help:
  * Evaluate your current policy to ensure it meets or exceeds the new requirements.
  * Recommend additional coverages based on your needs and budget, so you have the right balance of affordability and protection.
  * Find [auto insurance discounts](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/insurance/auto/discounts-and-savings.html) or bundling opportunities to help offset any premium increases.


## California Minimum Auto Insurance FAQs
Take a look at some common questions that you and other California drivers might ask:
### Will my current policy automatically update to meet the new requirements?
If you’re a Mercury Insurance customer, then yes! For renewal policies effective on or after January 1, 2025, any policies with coverage limits below the new state-mandated minimums will automatically be adjusted to meet the updated requirements. This means you don’t have to take any action—your policy will be updated to ensure compliance with state regulations. Along with these adjustments, any applicable premium updates will also be applied.
If you’re not a Mercury customer, check with your insurance provider to see if they will handle these changes for you.
### How much could my premiums increase?
Your premium increase will depend on your current coverage, your insurer, and your driving history. If you currently have minimum coverage, you may see a bump in your premium to reflect the added protection. While this might raise your monthly costs a bit, it also means your policy will offer better financial security if you’re in an accident. To help ease the impact, many insurers provide discounts for things like safe driving, bundling policies, or having safety features on your car.
### What happens if I don’t update my coverage by January 1, 2025?
If your policy doesn’t meet the new minimum limits and isn’t automatically updated, you could face serious consequences:
  * **Legal penalties:** Driving without the required minimum liability coverage is illegal in California. You may face fines, suspension of your driver’s license, and even impoundment of your vehicle until you provide proof of sufficient insurance.
  * **Financial vulnerability:** Without the updated coverage, you could end up paying out of pocket for costs that go beyond your policy limits if you’re in an accident. This could include things like medical bills, property damage, or even legal fees — expenses that can add up fast and put a serious strain on your finances.


## Conclusion
The 2025 increase to California’s minimum auto insurance requirements is an important change designed to better protect drivers from the rising costs of accidents.
Don’t wait — take time to review your current insurance policy today. Consult with your insurance agent to ensure your coverage meets or exceeds the new requirements, and explore additional options like comprehensive and collision coverage for full protection.
