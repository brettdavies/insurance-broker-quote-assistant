![What Does Hurricane Insurance Cover in Florida?](https://assets.site-static.com/userFiles/2464/image/hurricane-insurance-coverage.jpg)
Hurricane insurance refers to coverage you can add to your home insurance policy to cover damage caused by storms. Typically, hurricane insurance covers wind damage, damage to personal property, and additional living expenses if you can’t stay in your home. If you live in Florida, learning about hurricane insurance can help you [prepare for storms](https://www.palmparadiserealty.com/blog/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-hurricane-season/) while enjoying peace of mind all year long. 
For informational purposes only. Always consult with a licensed insurance professional before proceeding with any real estate transaction.
## 3 Things to Know About Hurricane Insurance
  * Hurricane insurance is generally part of homeowners insurance and typically covers wind damage, but additional policies may be necessary for comprehensive protection.
  * While hurricane insurance is not mandated by Florida law, mortgage lenders often require it in high-risk areas, making it crucial for homeowners to understand their policy requirements.
  * Flood damage is usually excluded from standard homeowners insurance, so separate flood insurance is necessary to avoid significant financial risks during hurricanes.


## What Is Hurricane Insurance?
**Hurricane insurance isn’t a separate insurance plan. Instead, it refers to various coverages in homeowners insurance policies that protect against damage caused by hurricanes and other high-wind events.** This insurance is generally recommended for people [living by the beach](https://www.palmparadiserealty.com/blog/living-near-the-beach-pros-cons/) or in high flood-risk communities.
Typically, standard hurricane insurance covers wind damage. However, standard homeowners insurance policies may not fully cover hurricane damage, necessitating specific hurricane policies. Pairing homeowners insurance with flood insurance often provides comprehensive protection. Regularly review your insurance coverage to ensure it meets current risks, especially in hurricane-prone areas.
## Is Hurricane Insurance Required in Florida?
**Florida law does not mandate hurricane insurance, but lenders might require it if you have a mortgage.** This is particularly true for homes in high-risk areas with a significant likelihood of hurricane damage. Mortgage lenders may require both windstorm and flood insurance to protect their investments.
Standard homeowners insurance policies typically include windstorm damage caused by hurricanes, but you can confirm with your insurance provider. You may need to purchase a separate windstorm insurance policy or add a windstorm endorsement to your existing standard homeowners insurance policy. Hurricane-related damage often includes flooding, which standard homeowners insurance does not cover. Flood insurance is required if your property is in a high-risk flood zone and you have a federally-backed mortgage.
## What Does Hurricane Insurance Cover?
### Wind Damage Coverage
A common consequence of hurricanes is wind damage, typically covered by standard homeowners insurance. Homeowner policies generally cover wind and hail damage as wind-related damage. **However, additional riders or separate policies may be required to ensure comprehensive windstorm damage coverage in hurricane-prone areas.**
### Flood Damage Coverage
Flood damage is typically excluded from standard homeowners insurance. Therefore, homeowners must purchase a separate flood insurance policy to cover flood damage. This omission can lead to significant financial risks during hurricanes, highlighting the need for adequate flood insurance. [Ask about flood history](https://www.palmparadiserealty.com/blog/questions-to-ask-when-buying-waterfront-homes/) when buying a waterfront home to make a more informed purchase.
**The[National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) and some private insurers offer flood insurance to fill in gaps left by your base home policy.** Mortgage lenders may require homeowners in high-risk flood areas to carry flood insurance. 
### Personal Property Protection
Homeowners in hurricane-prone areas should confirm that their policies provide adequate personal property coverage.**This coverage protects belongings from hurricane damage.** Opting for replacement cost value coverage instead of actual cash value ensures maximum coverage for personal property.
### Additional Living Expenses
Additional Living Expenses (ALE) cover costs exceeding normal living expenses when a home becomes uninhabitable after a disaster.**Homeowners insurance typically covers these, including temporary lodging, increased meal costs, and other expenses while displaced.** Homeowners remain responsible for normal expenses, like mortgage payments, during this time.
Policies may limit the amount and duration of ALE coverage limits. Understand these limits to ensure they align with your needs during a hurricane.
## How Do Hurricane Deductibles Work?
![What is a Hurricane Deductible?](https://assets.site-static.com/userFiles/2464/image/hurricane-deductibles.jpg)
Hurricane deductibles work differently from standard deductibles in homeowners insurance. Here's a breakdown of how they operate:
  * **Specific to Hurricane Damage:** Hurricane deductibles apply only to damages caused by named hurricanes. The standard deductible applies if damage occurs from a non-hurricane windstorm or other perils.
  * **Percentage-Based Deductible:** Unlike fixed dollar amounts for standard deductibles, hurricane deductibles are typically calculated as a percentage of the insured home's value. Common percentages range from 1% to 10%, though higher percentages may be available in high-risk areas.
    * For example, if your home is insured for $300,000 and you have a 2% hurricane deductible, you must pay the first $6,000 of hurricane damage before your insurance kicks in.
  * **Triggered by State Definition:** A hurricane deductible is triggered only when the storm meets your state’s specific criteria, such as being officially declared a hurricane by the National Weather Service. The deductible applies to damage occurring within a set time after the hurricane's landfall (e.g., 72 hours).


## How Much Does Hurricane Insurance Cost in Florida?
The cost of hurricane insurance in Florida varies depending on factors such as the home's location, age, construction type, and level of coverage. **On average, windstorm coverage, which protects against hurricane-related wind damage, can cost $2,000 and upward annually for a typical home.** If flood insurance is also needed, policies may cost an average of $819 per year. 
As a result, Florida homeowners insurance rates are significantly higher than the national average due to the state's high exposure to hurricanes and tropical storms. While the national average for homeowners insurance is around $1,915 annually for $300,000 worth of dwelling coverage, Florida homeowners often pay more than that, mainly driven by the added cost of windstorm and flood coverage.
For informational purposes only. Always consult with a licensed insurance professional before proceeding with any real estate transaction.
## Is Adding Hurricane Coverage Right For You?
Understanding hurricane insurance and ensuring you have the right coverage is crucial for protecting your home and personal property. Comprehensive coverage can provide peace of mind during hurricane season, covering everything from wind and flood damage to personal property protection and additional living expenses.
Reviewing your insurance policies regularly and consulting with professionals can help you tailor your coverage to meet your needs. Stay prepared and proactive to safeguard your home so you can enjoy the many [benefits of coastal living](https://www.palmparadiserealty.com/blog/health-benefits-coastal-living/).
## Frequently Asked Questions
### Is hurricane insurance mandatory in Florida?
Hurricane insurance is not mandatory in Florida; however, mortgage lenders may require it for properties in high-risk areas. Hence, it is advisable to review your coverage needs based on location and lender requirements.
### Does standard homeowners insurance cover flood damage?
Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage; separate flood insurance must be obtained for that protection. 
### What is a hurricane deductible?
A hurricane deductible is a specific amount applied to claims resulting from hurricanes. It is typically based on a percentage of the property's insured value. It can be paired with [FEMA programs for storm damage](https://www.palmparadiserealty.com/blog/fema-50-percent-rule/) to provide the most comprehensive coverage.
### How can I lower my hurricane insurance premiums?
Increasing your deductible and investing in home improvements like storm shutters can lower your hurricane insurance premiums. 
### What should I do if my hurricane insurance claim is denied?
If your hurricane insurance claim is denied, carefully review the reasons, verify all documentation is complete, and consider seeking professional assistance to resolve any issues.
