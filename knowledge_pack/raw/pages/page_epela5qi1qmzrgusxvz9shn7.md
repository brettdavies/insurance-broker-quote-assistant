## Texas FAIR Plan for Homeowners Who Are Denied Coverage
If at least two providers deny you coverage, you can apply for the [Texas FAIR Plan](https://www.texasfairplan.org/), a last-resort home insurance plan run by the state government. It tends to be more expensive and offer less coverage than the private market. Another option is taking steps like installing impact-resistant windows or fire-resistant roofing to increase your chances of getting private coverage.

## Coverage Options for Natural Disasters in Texas
Texas homeowners may be vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, windstorms, and wildfires, especially as climate change worsens these events. Review your home insurance policy to make sure you have the needed coverage.
#### Flooding
Flooding is the most common disaster in Texas, but standard home insurance does not cover it. You can get a separate flood insurance policy through the federally backed [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.floodsmart.gov/) or a private insurer.
#### Hurricanes
Most home insurance policies do cover some wind-related damages from hurricanes, but do not cover flooding. However, windstorm coverage may be excluded for homes in high-risk coastal areas, so review your policy and buy additional coverage if needed.
#### Wildfires
Wildfire damage is typically covered by a standard home insurance policy, as are additional living expenses if your house is temporarily unlivable after a fire. Assess and reduce your wildfire risk using the [Texas Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal](https://texaswildfirerisk.com/).
## Texas Department of Insurance
Insurance companies in Texas are regulated by the Texas Department of Insurance. You can call the department's Help Line at 800-252-3439 to ask questions or report a complaint against an insurance company or agent. Customers can also visit the[ department's website](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/index.html) to learn more about the state insurance market, report suspected fraud or complaints, compare insurance rates, and more.

## FAQ
Is homeowners insurance required in Texas?
State law doesn't require homeowners insurance. However, your mortgage lender may require you to have coverage. Also, some homeowners associations (HOAs) may require it in certain communities, particularly for condos and townhouses. Although it's not legally required, protecting your property and assets is a good idea.
What does homeowners insurance cover in Texas?
Standard homeowners insurance covers your house, other structures on your property like a garage or fence, and your personal possessions. It also includes coverage for personal liability and medical payments for injured guests. If you are displaced from your home because of a covered peril, your policy will reimburse you for the additional living expenses.
Why are home insurance companies dropping customers in Texas?
The increasing threat of natural disasters has led to some companies limiting new policies in Texas and nonrenewing policies of current customers, effectively dropping them. In 2024, several major insurers scaled back their coverage in Texas, largely because of its extreme weather events. The state consistently ranks as one of the most disaster-prone in the country, experiencing a large number of expensive catastrophes each year.
Why are homeowners insurance rates going up in Texas?
One of the primary reasons for rate increases is climate change, which is causing more frequent and severe natural disasters that lead to costly losses for homeowners and providers alike. Inflation is another problem, as it has increased construction and labor costs, driving up the price of repairing a home.
How can you save on homeowners insurance in Texas?
Ask your home insurance provider what discounts you’re eligible for, as they vary by company. Insurers often provide discounted premiums for homeowners who install certain safety features, bundle multiple insurance policies together, buy a new home, or upgrade their roof.

## U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Local Homeowners Insurance
To build our ratings, we researched 16 homeowners insurance companies and insurance agencies and analyzed data from a consumer survey with 1,125 responses, product features collected from company websites, and data on insurance costs provided by Quadrant Information Services. U.S. News worked with Quadrant to analyze a report of publicly available insurance rates using 34,595 ZIP codes across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the companies in our rating of the best homeowners insurance companies that operate in that state. The insurance rates in our study are based on averages of sample rates for a 38-year-old and 56-year-old married applicant household with a 720 FICO credit score. The rates were obtained for an HO3 policy covering a wood-frame house with 10% Other Structures Coverage, 20% Loss of Use Coverage, 50% Personal Property Coverage, and a guest medical limit of $5,000.
