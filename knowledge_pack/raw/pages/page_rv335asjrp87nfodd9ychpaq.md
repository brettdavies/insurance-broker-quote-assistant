## New California insurance laws
The state of California raised its minimum liability insurance requirements starting Jan. 1, 2025.
**The new law increased the amount of bodily injury liability coverage needed to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident.** This pays for injuries to other drivers and their passengers if you cause an accident.
**The property damage liability requirement also increased to $15,000 per accident.** This coverage pays for damage to the other driver's car or a building or structure if you hit something. This makes California's requirements among the [top 10 highest in the country](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state#state "Minimum car insurance limits in each state").
Previously, drivers only needed $15,000 of bodily injury liability coverage per person and $30,000 per accident, along with $5,000 of property damage liability. Up until 2025, California had some of the lowest liability requirements in the country.
## Liability coverage in California
All drivers in California must have liability coverage, which pays for injuries or damage you cause in an accident.

**[Bodily injury liability insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?")** pays for the other party's medical expenses if you cause an accident.
If you choose the minimum California car insurance requirements, your insurance company will pay up to $30,000 in medical expenses per person and $60,000 per accident.

If you have the minimum California insurance requirements, your insurance will pay up to $15,000 for damage you cause.

How ValuePenguin found the cheapest companies
To find the cheapest minimum liability insurance in California, our editors gathered quotes from nine top companies across 1,824 California ZIP codes. [Full methodology #methodology ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/requirements#methodology "#methodology"). 
### Does California's minimum liability insurance come with enough coverage?
**The minimum limits may not be enough to cover the full medical expenses or damage if you cause a serious accident.** Most drivers should [choose higher liability limits](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-liability-how-much-coverage-do-i-need "How Much Car Insurance Do I Need?"), if they can afford it.
For example, if you cause a major accident with a brand new Tesla, $15,000 of property damage liability won't be enough to cover the full cost of replacing it. You'll have to pay the difference yourself.
**In addition, California car insurance laws don't require[collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance").** These coverages help pay to fix or replace your car after a crash, regardless of whose fault it is.
Most lenders require you to have these coverages if you have a car loan or lease. You should also consider adding them if your car is less than 8 years old or worth more than $5,000.
### Recommended auto insurance coverage for California drivers
Liability coverage is required by law in California. But other [optional auto insurance coverages](https://www.valuepenguin.com/types-of-auto-insurance "Types of Auto Insurance") can be useful for many drivers.
  * **[Comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?"):** Collision coverage pays to repair damage to your car after an accident, regardless of whose fault it is. Comprehensive coverage pays for other types of damage, such as vandalism, theft or damage from a natural disaster.
If you have a car loan or lease, your lender typically requires you to have collision and comprehensive coverage. You should also consider adding these coverages if you drive a new or expensive car. 
  * **[Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance"):** This coverage pays your medical bills and car repair expenses if you're hit by a driver who either doesn't have insurance or doesn't have enough coverage. 
  * **[Medical payments (MedPay)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/medical-payments-car-insurance-coverage "What Is Medical Payments Coverage? How Does It Work?"):** This coverage pays the medical bills of you or your passengers after an accident, regardless of who is at fault. Coverage typically comes in $1,000 increments and usually starts at $1,000 per person. 


## Alternatives to the California motor vehicle insurance requirements
If you don't want to buy an auto insurance policy, there are three other ways to drive legally in California. However, not every option is available to all drivers.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/prepaid)
**You can make a cash deposit to cover the other driver's medical bills or car repairs if you cause a car accident.**
First, you must deposit $35,000 in a savings account with any bank. Then, you'll contact the DMV Financial Responsibility Unit to fill out and submit an application form. Once it's approved, you must make sure that there's always $35,000 in the account. The DMV will use those funds if you're at fault in a car accident.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/bank)
**You can get a $35,000 surety bond.** A surety company issues bonds to drivers that guarantee they'll cover medical bills, car repairs and other property damage if you cause a car accident. If you can't pay these expenses, the surety company will step in — but you'll have to pay them back later.
Contact the California Department of Insurance at 800-927-4357 for a list of licensed surety companies in California that offer this type of bond.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/document-certified)
**You can get a self-insurance certificate from the California DMV if you own more than 25 vehicles in your name.** The certificate states that you can cover medical bills, car repairs and property damage expenses as a minimum liability policy would, and this certificate can prevent [your vehicle registration from getting suspended](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/vehicle-registration-suspension "Vehicle Registration Suspension in California"). Before issuing the certificate, the department may require evidence that you can meet these financial demands.
* * *
### CLCA program policy
**If you can't afford minimum liability insurance in California and you qualify for a policy through[California's Low Cost Auto Insurance Program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/low-cost-auto-insurance-program "California Low Cost Auto Insurance Program"), or CLCA, you can legally buy auto insurance with lower limits.**
The CLCA program aims to provide affordable car insurance for safe drivers whose household income falls below federal poverty levels. The minimum coverage limits for drivers with a CLCA policy are:
  * **Bodily injury liability insurance:** $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident 
  * **Property damage liability insurance:** Up to $3,000 per accident 
  * **Uninsured motorist BI*:** Up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident 
  * **Medical payments*:** Up to $1,000 per person 


_*These coverages are optional._

## Penalty for driving without insurance in California
If you're caught driving without insurance, you will have to [pay fines](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/california/penalties-driving-without-insurance "Penalties for Driving Without Insurance in California"). Repeat offenders may also have other penalties.
  * **First offense:** A fine between $100 and $200, along with penalty assessment fees of $26 per $10 of the base fine. For example, if you're fined $100, your penalty assessment fee will be $260. 
  * **Two or more offenses:** A fine of $200 to $500, plus penalty assessment fees. 
  * **Other potential penalties:** Your license and registration may be suspended, which means you won't be able to drive for a period of time. In addition, you'll have to pay fees to get your license and registration reinstated, and you could be required to file an [SR-22 certificate](https://www.valuepenguin.com/sr-22-auto-insurance "SR-22 Insurance: Compare Quotes and Find Cheap Coverage").
