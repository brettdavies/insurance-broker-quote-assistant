These basic types of insurance make up minimum and full coverage plans. Minimum insurance is the best option for drivers looking for affordable coverage. However, minimum insurance doesn’t work for everyone — you’ll need [full coverage auto insurance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/full-coverage-auto-insurance/) if you have a car loan or lease.
A full coverage policy is ideal for drivers with vehicles they can't afford to replace outright.

While Geico auto insurance rates are usually some of the lowest on the market, that might not be the case for you. For example, high-risk drivers can pay two to three times more for insurance from Geico than from other companies. Make sure to [save money by comparing online car insurance quotes](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/save-money-by-comparing-online-car-insurance-quotes/) before making a final decision.

With solid ratings and low average rates, one of the only downsides is that there aren’t many Geico auto insurance options for add-ons. Insurance companies offer add-ons so drivers can customize their policies.
Read More: [What types of car insurance coverage does Geico offer?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/what-types-of-car-insurance-coverage-does-geico-offer/)
Most companies provide at least a few, and Geico is one of them. However, Geico offers fewer options than many of its similarly-sized competitors. One crucial difference between Geico and many of its competitors is that Geico doesn’t offer gap insurance (Learn More: [Does Geico offer gap insurance?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/does-geico-offer-gap-insurance/)). If gap insurance is important to you, Geico isn’t the right company.
Gap insurance pays the difference between what you owe on a loan and what your car is worth. 
Tracey L. Wells **Licensed Insurance Agent & Agency Owner**
If you’re unsure of how much insurance you need, a Geico representative can help. Some of the available coverages are dependent on what state you live in. For example, whether you can buy PIP or MedPay coverage depends on your state (Read More: [Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Medical Coverage that Your Car Insurance Policy will Pay For](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/personal-injury-protection-pip-and-medical-coverage-that-your-car-insurance-policy-will-pay-for/)).
And while it doesn’t offer the most add-on options, Geico offers a few valuable ways to add extra protection to your policy, such as Geico’s roadside assistance comes to the rescue for situations like a flat tire, dead battery, empty gas tank, or when you need a tow (Learn More: [Best Auto Insurance for Towing and Roadside Assistance](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/best-car-insurance-for-towing-and-roadside-assistance/)).
Geico also offers mechanical breakdown insurance, which pays for mechanical problems with your car that result in a trip to the repair shop. Mechanical breakdown insurance can save you thousands in repairs but does not cover maintenance issues like worn brakes.
Adding more coverage is never a bad idea, but you should only purchase what you need. Every add-on increases your monthly rates, quickly making your policy expensive. 
Kristen Gryglik **Licensed Insurance Agent**
And while companies like Uber and Lyft offer insurance for their drivers, but there are often gaps in the coverage. Geico’s [rideshare insurance coverage](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/rideshare-insurance/) fills in the gaps to better protect you while you work.
Wondering how to get cheaper Geico insurance? Geico auto insurance quotes are usually some of the cheapest on the market, partially because they offer so many ways to save. When you shop with Geico, you’ll [get low-cost car insurance with driver discounts](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/get-low-cost-car-insurance-with-driver-discounts/):

GEICO is unpredictable and arbitrary. You\'d need insurance for this insurance, since GEICO is unable or unwilling to provide the most important function of insurance: certainty. They cancelled my new auto insurance for no reason other than their own incompetence. Long story short: I paid the policy in full. While on a vacation with my family, I opened GEICO app and was surprised to find that my policy is scheduled to be cancelled. When I came back home I found a letter saying that I have eight days from the 5th of October to send them documents (only accepted by postal mail, even though every document was a copy) or my insurance would be cancelled. In fact the letter was delivered *about 8 days after the 5th of October* (again, delivered while I was not home). At no earlier point had I been informed that these documents were required, and GEICO made no attempt to contact me by phone call, text message or Email. In fact, had I not checked the app and stayed on vacation for longer, I might have ended up driving without insurance unwittingly. I called GEICO multiple times. They consistently assured me that if I sent the correct documents before the fast-approaching cancellation date, my policy would continue. So I sent all the documents they requested by priority mail. In spite of the supposed urgency they were attempting to convey, it took them six days after receiving the documents to start reviewing them (with no way to contact the underwriting department or confirm that they had recieved them). It took five more days for the final review because of their own confusion about what was clearly included in the documents I\'d sent them. Two days before the deadline, I find out by calling them (without any notification on their part) that, in fact, my policy will be cancelled. The reason is that I had no prior insurance, which they claimed was contrary to my statements. This is 100% false and can be refuted by recorded calls to customer service in which I stated that GEICO was my first insurance, and by the fact that they don\'t have the name of my previous insurance company and the coverage limits (required information when you register online if you state that you\'ve been insured). GEICO had zero interest in checking the evidence or compensating me, and there was no way to appeal. Price I have to pay for GEICO\'s incompetence: Having to find new insurance in two days (which was hard in the first place since I have no driving record in the US), possibly higher rates because of the cancellation on my record. If it happened to me, it must have happened to thousands of other customers in the country, as confirmed by a large fraction of GEICO\'S customer reviews online. So the chance that it will happen to you is non-negligible.

### Can't get rid of them
From my personal experience, GEICO is the best place if you want to be fooled. Once you open the door, you can't get rid of them. About a year ago I canceled my policy ceasing any dealings with Geico. I paid the premiums in full and closed my account. Throughout the year, I've been a happy StateFarm customer.

About a year ago I canceled my policy ceasing any dealings with Geico. I paid the premiums in full and closed my account. Throughout the year, I've been a happy StateFarm customer. Several weeks ago, Geico unilaterally opened my policy forcing me to pay premiums for the following 6 months. Understanding that it could be a mistake, I contacted them 3 times. I talked to 6 different people. All of them promised to help me. I wrote 2 emails attaching copies of my StateFarm Id's for the entire period (after Geico policy cancellation). It didn't cure the problem. Moreover, Geico retroactively and unilaterally (without my desire, knowledge, and consent) reopened the policy. Now, they force me to pay for the previous months (last year). Geico supervisor [REDACTED NAME] claims that he obtains sufficient evidence that I hadn't been insured after I officially broke with Geico in April-May 2020 = the company is right demanding me to pay for nothing. From my non-legal understanding, it's a fraud, He knowingly (I sent them StateFarm Id's for the entire period) mispresents the facts unlawfully demanding payment.

### BAIT AND SWITCH
They waited 60 days and then doubled my rate. they never notified me. When I looked it up they said it was due to the agent putting it in as a sports bus, and since I am using it for sales my rate is double. yes on their letter they sent me it shows right on it that the old use is class "C" and the new use is class "C". The reviews on geicos website are fake. real reviews are much more negative. They lie in their commercials about saving money s...
They waited 60 days and then doubled my rate. they never notified me. When I looked it up they said it was due to the agent putting it in as a sports bus, and since I am using it for sales my rate is double. yes on their letter they sent me it shows right on it that the old use is class "C" and the new use is class "C". The reviews on geicos website are fake. real reviews are much more negative. They lie in their commercials about saving money so why would I not expect them to lie about the rate they are giving me. I am no risk adjuster but any halfway intelligent person knows their is a lot more risk for a bus full of athletes that ways 20,000 pounds than a minivan with one person in it. Yet according to geico insuring a moving tank is cheaper than insuring a minivan. Would you believe that? I am not that gullible. Bait and switch all the way.

### Not recommend 
They were alright not the best. If they put in more effort into the customers they could’ve kept me.

### Helpful
Geico has been great during the pandemic. They have worked with me changing billing dates based on what I need. They have helped me save 212 dollars a month on insurance.

### Geico is amazing
My experience receiving auto insurance from Geico has been extremely positive. The insurance process was perfectly smooth and I have all my insurance information neatly organized at the tip of my fingers on my mobile phone. The coverage and premiums are much better than I received from my previous provider.
