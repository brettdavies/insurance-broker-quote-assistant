*USAA is only available to current and former military members and their families.
In Vermont, 18-year-old drivers pay nearly three times as much for car insurance as 30-year-old drivers. That's because young drivers typically have only a few years of driving experience, which means they're more likely to make a mistake and cause a crash.
![piggy bank icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/piggy-bank)
**The best way for younger drivers to save money on their insurance is by[sharing a policy with a parent](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-car-insurance-teen-drivers "Best Car Insurance for Teen Drivers \(and Their Parents\)") or older relative.** A shared policy typically costs much less than two separate policies, and you can qualify for a multicar discount.
In addition, many insurance companies have discounts geared toward young drivers. For example, [State Farm's Steer Clear program](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/state-farm-steer-clear-review "State Farm Steer Clear Review") offers a discount to young drivers who complete online safety courses and practice driving with an older mentor.

![accident icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//static/icons/accident2)
**You don't have to worry about switching car insurance companies right after your crash.** Your rates won't go up until your current policy expires. But any quotes you get will include your accident, so they'll probably be more expensive than your current rates.
**Instead, wait until you get your renewal offer from your current company.** You'll typically get this a few weeks to a month before your policy expires. Then, [shop around for quotes from multiple companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance-quotes "Get Free Car Insurance Quotes Online") to find the best rate for you.

## Vermont car insurance requirements
Vermont requires drivers to have a [minimum amount of car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/vermont/requirements "Auto Insurance Requirements in Vermont"). These minimum insurance limits, often listed as  25/50/10, pay for injuries to another driver and damage to their vehicle. They also cover your own bills if you're in an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance or whose policy doesn't have enough coverage.
  * **[Bodily injury liability](https://www.valuepenguin.com/bodily-injury-car-insurance-coverage "Bodily Injury Car Insurance Coverage: How Does It Work?"):** $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident

![award icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/award)
### What's the best car insurance coverage for VT drivers?
Most drivers in Vermont should get full coverage car insurance.
That's because full coverage can have higher liability limits than the state requirement, as well as comprehensive and collision coverage.
**Minimum coverage plans may not be enough to cover the cost of damage in an expensive accident.** For example, if you crash into and total a brand new car, $10,000 of property damage liability coverage won't be enough to fully replace it. With a full coverage policy, you can have higher property damage liability limits, so you'll pay less out of pocket after a crash.
In addition, full coverage insurance includes [comprehensive and collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?").
  * **Collision coverage** pays for damage to your car after a crash, regardless of whose fault it is. 
  * **Comprehensive coverage** pays for other types of damage, like damage from theft, vandalism or extreme weather. 


**Most lenders require you to have comprehensive and collision coverage if you have a car loan or lease.** You should also consider these coverages if your car is less than 8 years old, or worth more than $5,000.
