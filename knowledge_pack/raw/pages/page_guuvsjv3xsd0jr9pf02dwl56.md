## How Car Insurance Companies Use Your Driving Record
Do insurance companies check your driving record? Does your driving record affect your insurance rates? How long does an accident stay on your driving record? Read through the next several sections for everything you need to know about your driving record and your auto insurance rates.
### How far back do insurance companies look at driving records?
How far back does a driving record go? It primarily depends on where you live and the type of offense.
If a driver in your household has a [moving violation](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/will-a-moving-violation-ticket-affect-car-insurance-rates/), it’s essential that you know timeframes and when the insurer can see these.
**You don’t want to fail to disclose a violation purposely.**
Doing this is called material misrepresentation, and it can lead to claims denials, policy cancellations, or at least a misquote.
> How long certain violations remain visible on your record depends on the type of violation you’re cited for.
The state you live in may have special laws surrounding how long serious violations stay on your record.
What do car insurance companies check? Here’s a breakdown of how far back car insurance companies look:
  * **Minor Violations** – Speeding, failure to stop, improper turn, improper pass, following too closely, and failure to yield are all examples of minor traffic infractions. _These infractions will only stay on your record for three years in most states._ At the renewal following the third anniversary of your conviction, the surcharge that raises your rates will fall off.
  * **Major Violations** – Leaving the scene of an accident, driving under the influence, reckless driving, and refusing to stop for an officer are examples of major infractions. Time frames for major violations are a bit different because they tend to be criminal, which is why the period they affect your rates can vary by state. _In most states, the violations can affect rates and eligibility for between three and seven years, depending on the nature of the offense._


How far back do insurance companies check for DUI? Some companies go back as far as seven years, but most DUI convictions stay on your driving record for at least ten years.
### How long are you considered a high-risk driver?
[Drivers are considered high risk](https://www.carinsurancecomparison.com/best-car-insurance-for-bad-driving-record/) for as long as traffic violations and other moving violations are on their record. As we’ve already discussed, the timeframe for violations remaining on record depends both on the severity of the offense and local state laws.
Also, teen drivers are usually considered high risk because of age and lack of experience. And driving without car insurance for more than six months will put in a high-risk driving status with car insurance companies.
### Why do car insurance companies care about moving violations?
It’s natural to assume that an insurer will only raise your rates when you cost the company money, but in the world of auto insurance, that’s not the case.
If you get a ticket, it will impact your car insurance. It might not cost the insurer money, but it does affect your risk class as a policyholder.
> Getting a traffic ticket shows the insurer that you don’t obey traffic laws that are set to reduce the chances of preventable and devastating crashes occurring.
According to [New Jersey state law](https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/license/suspension.htm), the real-world probability of getting into an accident rises when you have one or more violations in recent years; driving infractions will impact your rates.
### How do car insurance companies check for violations?
When you shop for insurance, you agree that any company you apply to can run specific reports.
One of these reports is a Motor Vehicle Report (MVR) in the state where you’re licensed.
According to LexisNexis, companies run the MVR only during the application process because reviewing your driving abstract doesn’t come cheap. For example, the 36-month driving record in AZ can provide a detailed history, and the CLUE/MVR report includes essential information. This is particularly important when checking for issues like LexisNexis provides MVR for speeding.
When you first submit your application, the company can spend up to $27 to pull your report and see if you have any minor or severe violations.
What’s included in your MVR? When insurance companies get a copy of your MVR, they’ll be able to see any accidents or moving violations you’ve been involved in, as well as any criminal convictions that may have resulted from these incidents.
If you’ve ever had your driver’s license suspended, that will show up on the MVR as well, along with any restrictions (like prescription lenses) that may be on your license.
#### How to Check Your Driving Record
If you want to check your driving record to see what information insurance companies like Allstate see, you can request a copy of your Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) through your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Typically, there’s a nominal fee involved to obtain your MVR, which provides details about your insurance companies’ three-year history of your car insurance driving history, including what may be checked during an Allstate insurance background check.
### How much will a violation affect your car insurance rates?
While an infraction is chargeable, it can drive up your rates and even disqualify you from receiving a good driver or safe driver discount.
How much a violation impacts your rates depend on the type and the company. Companies have conducted studies to see how much weight is placed on violations.
Here’s how much the study found surcharges to be:
  * **Reckless driving** – 22 percent
  * **Failure to stop** – 15 percent
  * **Improper turn** – 14 percent
  * **Failure to yield** – 9 percent
  * **Improper pass** – 14 percent
  * **DUI conviction surcharge** – 19 percent

Look at how many accidents and DUIs affect car insurance rates compared to a clean driving record. You could pay thousands more for car insurance from violations like DUIs and reckless driving.

### What happens if you don’t disclose a violation?
If you’ve failed to disclose a violation of your application, the underwriter will re-evaluate rates and eligibility before issuing your policy. If you have a major infraction that leads to disqualification, you’ll receive a notification.

According to [Washington State Insurance Commissioners](https://www.insurance.wa.gov/clue-comprehensive-loss-underwriting-exchange), the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) will provide the company with seven years of personal auto claims history to make underwriting decisions.
How long insurance companies consider your claims when calculating rates will depend, but in most cases, at-fault claims are only surcharged for three years.

In all but a few states, credit can affect your personal auto insurance rating. It’s why companies run your FICO report or another related report to get a credit insurance score when you apply.
Watch this video to learn more about how your credit score is calculated into the overall insurance score companies to evaluate your perceived risk and adjust your rates accordingly.
A credit report looks back into your credit history to show how you pay your bills, how much debt you have, and how recently you’ve applied for credit.

## Case Studies: How Far Back Do Car Insurance Companies Look?
**Case Study 1: Recent Violation**
John recently received a speeding ticket for exceeding the speed limit by 10 miles per hour. He contacts various insurance companies to obtain quotes for car insurance coverage. Insurance Company A looks back three years into John’s driving history and considers his recent violation when calculating his premium.
As a result, Insurance Company A offers him a higher premium compared to other companies that only look back two years.
**Case Study 2: Clean Driving Record**
Sarah has maintained a clean driving record for the past five years. When she applies for car insurance, Insurance Company B conducts a thorough review of her driving history. They only consider incidents that occurred within the past three years when determining her premium.
Due to Sarah’s clean record during that timeframe, Insurance Company B offers her a competitive and lower premium compared to other companies that have a longer lookback period.
**Case Study 3: Multiple Accidents and Violations**
Mike has a history of multiple accidents and traffic violations. He applies for car insurance with Insurance Company C, which has a lookback period of five years. When evaluating Mike’s driving history, the company takes into account his accidents and violations within that timeframe.
As a result of his extensive record, Insurance Company C offers Mike a higher premium to account for the increased risk associated with his driving history.
**Case Study 4: Severity of Incidents**
Two years ago, Samantha was in a major accident causing injuries and property damage. She applies for car insurance with Insurance Company D, which evaluates the severity of incidents and considers a lookback period. Insurance companies that only check two years might have different criteria for her application.
Geico considers the seriousness and impact of Samantha’s previous accident when determining her premium. They look back three years into her driving history, similar to Insurance Company D. As a result, they offer her a higher premium due to the nature of the incident. This illustrates how long an accident stays on your record with Geico.
