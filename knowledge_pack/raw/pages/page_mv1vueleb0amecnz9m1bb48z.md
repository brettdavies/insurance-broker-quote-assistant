# Sinkhole Warning Signs in Florida
Written By [Ted Dryce](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/foundation-repair/sinkhole-warning-signs-in-florida/#author-bio-139)Published on 11/26/2024Updated on 06/23/2025
![](https://images.groundworks.com/NCN5ICUA/at/345rjgt4j65442h88ff8vcx/FRS_St_Louis_Push_Piers_20230620_07143.jpg?tr=w-1696,h-1133,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
Sinkholes are a common problem in Florida because of the state’s unique geology. A common variety of bedrock in Florida is limestone, a type of rock that dissolves over time when exposed to water. This can create underground voids that lead to sudden collapses in the ground, called sinkholes. 
These collapses can damage homes and roads and even put people’s safety at risk. Knowing the warning signs and how sinkholes form can help you protect your property and family.
[Schedule free inspection](https://www.alphafoundations.com/contact-us/)
## What Is a Sinkhole?
A sinkhole occurs when the ground collapses into an underground cavity. This process typically begins with the erosion of limestone bedrock, a natural feature of Florida’s geography. Rainwater, often slightly acidic, seeps into the ground and dissolves the limestone, gradually creating voids beneath the surface. 
When the ground above can no longer support itself, it collapses, forming a sinkhole. The development of Florida sinkholes are accelerated by the state’s heavy rainfall, high water tables, and human activities such as construction and groundwater pumping.
### How Do Sinkholes Form?
Sinkholes form slowly, often starting deep underground. Rainwater seeps through the soil and dissolves the limestone, creating cavities. Over time, these cavities grow larger. Events like heavy rains or droughts can trigger a collapse.
Heavy rains can saturate the ground and add weight, while droughts can lower the water table, leaving the ground unsupported. Human actions, such as overusing groundwater or changing the natural flow of water during construction, can also weaken the ground and cause sinkholes to form more quickly.
## Warning Signs of a Sinkhole
It’s important to watch for early warning signs of sinkholes around your home or property. Some of these signs include:
![](https://images.groundworks.com/NCN5ICUA/at/v756c4p9cbgnfmqsp999n3t/Inside_Garage_Crack_Near_Door-Enhanced-SR.jpg?tr=w-1908,h-1431,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
  * **Cracks in Walls and Floors:** [Cracks in drywall](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/problem-signs/drywall-cracks/), tile, or concrete slabs may indicate shifting ground beneath your home.
  * **Doors and Windows That Stick:** If doors or windows suddenly become [hard to open or close](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/problem-signs/sticking-doors-windows/), it could mean your house is shifting.
  * **Depressions in the Yard:** If you notice low spots, holes, or sinking areas in your yard, a sinkhole may be forming.
  * **Leaning Structures:** Fences, trees, or utility poles that tilt unexpectedly could be signs of unstable ground.
  * **Water Problems:** Changes in water levels in a well, puddles forming in unusual places, or [poor drainage](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/foundation-repair/have-water-drainage-issues-around-the-foundation-these-5-solutions-can-help/) could mean water is escaping into an underground void.


Even small changes, like wilting plants in a circular area, can hint at problems below the surface. If you notice one or more of these signs, don’t ignore them.
### What Should You Do If You Suspect a Sinkhole?
![](https://images.groundworks.com/NCN5ICUA/at/pp9mnhtj4n5jxrx583vkp5jb/DSC01834.jpg?tr=w-2400,h-1600,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
If you think a sinkhole is forming, it’s important to act quickly. First, ensure everyone’s safety. If the problem seems serious, leave the area and contact professionals to inspect your property. A geologist or structural engineer can help determine if there is a sinkhole and how to address it.
Take pictures of cracks, sinking areas, or other warning signs. This documentation can be helpful for insurance claims or repair planning. Avoid making repairs on your own, as this could hide the problem or make it worse.
### Can Sinkholes Be Prevented?
You can’t stop sinkholes from forming, but you can take steps to lower the risk:
  * **Manage Water Properly:** Make sure water drains away from your home to reduce erosion.
  * **Inspect Your Property Regularly:** Look for early warning signs like [foundation settlement](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/problem-signs/foundation-settlement/) or [soil erosion](https://www.alphafoundations.com/resources/concrete-lifting/soil-washout/).
  * **Limit Groundwater Use:** Avoid overusing well water, as this can weaken the ground.
  * **Consult Experts:** Before building or making major changes to your property, have the soil checked by professionals.


These steps can’t stop sinkholes, but they can help reduce the chances of one affecting your property.
## What to Do if Sinkholes Damage Your Home
If a sinkhole damages your home (particularly its foundation), there are ways to address the problem quickly and effectively. [Foundation piers](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/foundation-piers/) are one of the most reliable solutions for stabilizing and repairing foundations affected by sinkholes. These piers provide strong, long-lasting support to help restore your home’s stability and protect it from further damage. 
Foundation piers are heavy-duty steel supports that are driven deep into the ground to reach stable, load-bearing soil or bedrock. Once installed, these piers transfer the weight of your home from the unstable ground to the solid layers below.
There are three common types of foundation piers used in sinkhole repair:
![](https://images.groundworks.com/NCN5ICUA/at/ppp92pg8cvqcgq439s8mtv7/DSC01330.jpg?tr=w-2400,h-1350,c-maintain_ratio,fo-center,q-75)
  * **Helical Piers** : These piers feature[ screw-like threads](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/helical-piers/) that allow them to be twisted into the ground. They work well in loose or unstable soil and are suitable for lighter structures.
  * **Push Piers** : These are hydraulically driven [straight into the ground](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/push-piers/) and are ideal for heavier structures or situations where soil conditions are particularly challenging.
  * **Slab Piers** : Designed specifically for homes with slab foundations, these piers are installed [beneath the concrete slab](https://www.alphafoundations.com/services/foundation-repair/solutions/slab-piers/) to provide targeted support. They are ideal for repairing cracks and leveling uneven floors caused by sinkhole activity.


All three options are designed to stabilize your home and, in some cases, lift it back to its original position.

## Sinkhole FAQS
Can sinkholes form under new homes? 
Yes, sinkholes can form under new homes if the underlying soil or limestone has not been properly assessed or compacted during construction.
What’s the difference between a sinkhole and a settling foundation? 
A sinkhole involves the collapse of underground voids, while foundation settling is caused by soil compression or poor compaction; a professional inspection can determine the issue.
Are sinkholes more common in certain areas of Florida? 
According to the [Florida Department of Environmental Protection](https://floridadep.gov/fgs/sinkholes?utm_source=chatgpt.com), sinkholes are most common in central Florida, particularly in Pasco, Hernando, and Marion counties, due to the easily dissolvable limestone bedrock in the region.
