Joisted masonry is a construction method that uses fire-resistant walls made of materials like [brick ](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/masonry/brickwork/philadelphia/)or stone, combined with wooden floors and roofs. This style is often chosen for both homes and commercial buildings. It’s cost-effective because it mixes sturdy, fire-safe masonry with less expensive wood.
These buildings usually have up to four stories and are built with beams spaced regularly for stability. This method is particularly popular in places like Philadelphia, where it's important to maintain the historical look while meeting modern safety standards. Joisted masonry is a smart choice for building strong, safe, and cost-efficient structures.
Key Takeaways
  * Joisted Masonry Construction is a fire-resistant building with brick veneer on a wood frame and combustible floors/roofs.
  * It offers structural integrity, longevity, aesthetic appeal & improved fire resistance at lower maintenance costs.
  * Cost, material availability, and project scale should be considered when selecting the right construction class.


## Decoding Joisted Masonry Construction
Joisted masonry is a distinctive construction category recognized by the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO). Constructing buildings with fire-resistant materials for walls that are rated for at least one hour is the core of this concept. Combustible floors and roofs are also featured in this construction method. This construction method is most commonly seen in structures such as office buildings and housing, where the predominant form of joisted [masonry construction](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/masonry/philadelphia/) is brick veneer on a wood frame.
Joisted masonry buildings exhibit unique structural attributes. Typically, these buildings:
  * Stand no more than four stories high.

### **The Basics of Joisted Masonry**
Joisted masonry construction, particularly for residential buildings, often includes brick veneer on a wood frame. This construction method is also commonly used in commercial property buildings. The exterior bearing walls of joisted masonry buildings can take on various forms of masonry, such as brick, stone, and concrete blocks, making it one of the six categories of building construction.
The selection of joisted masonry construction for residential buildings is not merely a matter of aesthetics. Instead, it is preferred due to its cost-effectiveness compared to other masonry types and its convenient repairability in the event of damage.
### Classification and Importance
In commercial applications, joisted masonry construction deviates slightly, with masonry units being supported by a steel joist framework. This shift from wooden joists in residential constructions to steel joists in commercial constructions is a key differentiator. Despite the materials used, joisted masonry construction is notably prevalent in the construction industry, particularly as the predominant class for commercial buildings in Washington state.
The classification of Joisted Masonry in the Commercial Lines Manual plays a crucial role in the insurance categorization. Joisted Masonry (Class 2) is a type of building defined by its structure. It consists of exterior walls made of fire-resistive masonry, which can resist fire for at least one hour, and combustible floors & roofs. This classification impacts the insurance coverage of buildings and the assessment of premiums.
## The Anatomy of Joisted Masonry Buildings
The anatomy of a joisted masonry building goes beyond aesthetics, focusing on the structural integrity it imparts. The exterior walls in a joisted masonry building are constructed using masonry materials such as adobe, brick, or concrete. These walls provide essential support and stability, aiding the even distribution of the building's weight.
These buildings not only feature solid exterior walls but also incorporate combustible elements. The primary elements of a joisted masonry building include load-bearing walls constructed of materials such as adobe, brick, concrete, gypsum block, hollow concrete block, stone, or tile. However, the roof is commonly constructed of wood, a combustible material.

### **Exterior Walls: More Than Just Aesthetic**
The masonry exterior walls in joisted buildings render more than just an aesthetic appeal. They are critical in the structure's overall support and fire resistance. Built using masonry materials such as brick, concrete block, or stone, these walls are non-combustible and possess high fire-resistance ratings, aid in distributing the building's weight, withstand external forces, and enhance the aesthetic appeal.
While the exterior walls of joisted masonry buildings often consist of materials like adobe, brick, concrete, gypsum block, hollow concrete block, stone, tile, or similar materials, these materials are selected for their robustness, longevity, and fire resistance to complement the building's design. However, it is important to note that while these materials play a crucial role in enhancing the strength and durability of a joisted masonry building, they may also encounter problems like cracking, spalling, bowing, leaning, interstitial condensation, brick freeze-thaw damage, and inadequate reinforcement, which can affect the building's structural integrity and long-term performance.
### **Combustible Components: Floors and Roofs**
Contrasting the non-combustible exterior walls, joisted masonry buildings house combustible elements like floors and roofs made from untreated wood. These wood floors and roofs are classified as combustible due to the flammability of wood as a material, increasing the potential fire hazard within a building.
To mitigate this risk and decrease the flammability of floors and roofs in joisted masonry buildings, non-combustible or limited-combustible materials may be utilized, including:
  * Brick
  * Concrete
  * Steel frame
  * Treated wood


These materials are especially recommended for firewalls and exterior and interior bearing walls.
## Fire Resistance and Safety Features
Fire resistance isn't merely a bonus in joisted masonry construction—it's indispensable. The primary factors that contribute to the fire resistance of joisted masonry construction include:
  * Load-bearing exterior walls constructed from non-combustible materials such as masonry
  * The incorporation of fire-resistive materials in structures such as exterior walls, floors, and roofs with a minimum fire resistance rating of 1 hour
  * The structural stability and durability offered by the construction materials.


Fire resistance implementation in joisted masonry buildings hinges on the construction classification, underscoring the utilization of masonry or fire-resistive construction for exterior walls with a minimum one-hour fire resistance rating.
### **Achieving Fire Resistive Construction**
Fire resistance in joisted masonry construction extends further than just the use of fire-resistant materials. It also involves:
  * The use of specialized techniques that encompass the use of fire-resistant materials
  * The implementation of construction methods that reduce fire spread
  * Integrating elements such as fire-rated walls, fire doors, and fire suppression systems.


While the construction of fire-resistive joisted masonry structures presents difficulties such as ensuring the fire resistance of exterior walls and load-bearing elements, addressing structural concerns for fire resistance, and meeting construction class standards, these challenges can be mitigated through the use of non-combustible materials for exterior walls, the implementation of fire-resistant construction methods, and adherence to construction regulations.

### **The Role of Fire Resistance Rating**
Joisted masonry buildings' fire resistance rating is gauged through the standard fire resistance test, which determines the time a building can withstand fire before succumbing to structural failure, typically in hours. Factors such as the materials utilized, the thickness of the masonry walls, and the construction methods all play a role in determining the fire resistance rating of joisted masonry.
It is essential to have a specific fire resistance rating as it directly impacts the structure's ability to withstand fire and contain its propagation. Joisted masonry buildings are mandated to have a fire-resistance rating of one to two hours to ensure occupant safety, and a higher rating can result in reduced fire insurance premiums.
A higher fire resistance rating signifies the ability of a building to:
  * Endure fire for an extended duration
  * Allow for increased time for evacuation and emergency response
  * Elevate the overall safety of the building
  * Diminish the likelihood of structural collapse during a fire.


## Joisted Masonry in Commercial Lines Manual
According to the Commercial Lines Manual, joisted masonry is categorized as a construction type where the exterior walls are constructed with masonry materials (CC 2). This categorization holds significance in assessing the building's fire resistance and risk level, which is pivotal in the insurance industry.
The manual categorizes the fire resistance of building construction on a scale from 1 to 6, with higher ratings signifying greater fire resistance. These ratings significantly influence the insurance premiums for the structure.
### **Insurance Implications**
Insurance holds substantial importance in the construction industry, including joisted masonry construction. The nature of joisted masonry construction can significantly influence insurance costs as it is often perceived as a higher-risk category, primarily due to the increased potential for fire damage.
Insurance companies typically perceive joisted masonry buildings as presenting a higher level of risk and commonly classify them as Class 2 according to the ISO classification system. This can have implications for insurance-related considerations. Insurance premium costs can be influenced by factors such as:
  * The materials utilized
  * The age and condition of the building
  * Fire protection systems in place
  * Location
  * The building's claims or losses history


Buildings constructed with joisted masonry that provide a certain level of fire resistance, such as walls rated for one or two hours, may be eligible for reduced insurance rates due to the decreased fire risk.

### **Choosing the Right Construction Class**
Selection of the suitable construction class is contingent upon factors like strength, durability, local material availability, cost, handling, and storage. Joisted Masonry construction offers many advantages, such as higher fire resistance than combustible classes, improved structural stability and durability, and is often more cost-effective. However, it does come with its own disadvantages, including restricted design flexibility, potential increase in maintenance and repairs over time, and potentially higher initial costs compared to specific other classes.
The cost of Joisted Masonry construction may differ, but it typically exceeds the cost of Tilt-Up construction and is lower than that of masonry Non-Combustible construction. This comparison is subject to location, project scale, and intricacy. Structures suitable for Joisted Masonry construction include:
  * Wooden walls with brick veneer
  * Adobe
  * Brick
  * [Concrete](https://www.apsmasonrycontracting.com/services/contractor/concrete/philadelphia/)
  * Gypsum block
  * Hollow concrete block
  * Stone
  * Tile


## Summary
In summary, understanding joisted masonry is pivotal in the construction industry as it impacts buildings' structural integrity, safety, and insurance. Its benefits include fire resistance, structural stability, and cost-effectiveness, but it also presents challenges such as higher combustibility and maintenance.
In conclusion, the choice of construction class should be guided by factors such as strength, durability, availability of materials, cost, and desired aesthetics. Joisted masonry offers a unique blend of advantages, making it a viable option for several types of buildings, provided its inherent challenges are mitigated.
## Frequently Asked Questions
### **What is joisted masonry construction?**
Joisted masonry construction consists of walls with a combustible roof and flooring materials, such as wood, asphalt, concrete, or cement, on a wood deck supported by combustible load-bearing construction. Floors resting directly on the ground are not considered.
### **What is the difference between masonry and frame construction?**
Masonry construction involves blocks of concrete, tile, or stone between the exterior material of the wall and the drywall. In contrast, frame construction involves wooden studs running vertically through the walls with space for insulation in between them.
### **What are the five building types?**
These five building types include fire-resistant, non-combustible, ordinary, heavy timber, and wood-framed, each providing different features and benefits to the construction process.
### **What type of construction is masonry?**
Masonry is the craft of building structures with brick, stone, concrete blocks, or other non-combustible materials bound together with mortar. It is one of the most popular construction techniques worldwide due to its numerous advantages.
### **What are the structural attributes of joisted masonry buildings?**
Joisted masonry buildings generally have a maximum of four stories with joists spaced 16 inches in the center and feature a combustible roof and floor, categorized as CC 2 construction.
