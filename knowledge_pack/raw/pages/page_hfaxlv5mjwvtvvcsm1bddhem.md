I was a State Farm policyholder for over 30 years, and when I needed them, I got no support or help. Prior agents were significantly better than this one, who doesn't seem to care about her clients.

Why we picked this company
GEICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO sells homeowners, renters, flood, travel, life, and business insurance, among other products. 
The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than expected for a company of its size.
Pros

  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs

## How to ensure you have enough coverage on your Mercedes-Benz
Finding the right insurance coverage usually depends on what state you live in, whether you’re financing your car, and how much protection you want for your vehicle.
Most Mercedes-Benz drivers will need to purchase some of the following coverage options, at a minimum:[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/vehicle/mercedes-benz/#cite-3)
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/169fdfde11/liability-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/169fdfde11/liability-coverage.svg)
#### Collision coverage
If you get into an accident, [**collision coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/collision-insurance/) will pay to repair your vehicle from an at-fault accident with another vehicle or stationary object, like a tree or light pole. It also covers rollover accidents and pothole damage. Lenders also require it as part of a full-coverage policy if you have an auto loan or lease.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/665da91bf7/comprehensive-coverage.svg)
#### Comprehensive coverage
[**Comprehensive coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/comprehensive-insurance/) pays for damage from non-collision incidents, such as theft, vandalism, fire, severe weather events, wildfire collisions, and cracked windshields.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/150x150/c09380c3c0/car-dashboard-96x96-orange_045-airbag.svg)
#### Bodily injury liability coverage
Even safe drivers can injure someone, and [**bodily injury liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) ensures you can pay the medical bills for injuries you cause. Most states set a minimum level of liability insurance you’ll need to purchase to drive legally.
  * ![illustration card https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/db598219e3/damage-from-aircraft.svg](https://a.storyblok.com/f/162273/x/db598219e3/damage-from-aircraft.svg)
#### Property damage liability coverage
Similar to bodily injury liability, [**property damage liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/liability-insurance/) pays to repair or replace any property that you happen to damage while you’re driving. It’s legally required in all states (except New Hampshire) and Washington, D.C.

#### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
[**Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) will pay for your medical bills and associated expenses if you get injured in an accident that an uninsured or underinsured driver causes.

  * ### Which company has the cheapest Mercedes-Benz insurance?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
USAA and GEICO offer the cheapest Mercedes-Benz insurance rates for a full-coverage policy for most models, according to Insurify data. Your actual rates may be more or less than average based on numerous individual rating factors, including your driving record, age, gender, location, claims history, and credit-based insurance score.
  * ### Are Mercedes-Benz models expensive to insure?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Yes. The average Mercedes-Benz insurance cost is higher than the national average for a liability-only policy and a full-coverage policy due to the high-end nature of these cars.
  * ### How much does it cost to insure a Mercedes C-Class?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
The average monthly car insurance cost for Mercedes C-Class cars is $129 per month for liability-only coverage and $242 for full coverage.
  * ### How much does insurance typically cost for a Mercedes-Benz each year?
![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
The average annual premium for Mercedes-Benz cars is $1,500 for a liability-only policy and $2,820 for a full-coverage policy.


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible


Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.
