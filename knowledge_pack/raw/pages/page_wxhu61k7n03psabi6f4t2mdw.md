#  A month after closing State Farm tells me they won’t cover me because my roof is 20 years old. 
Isn’t this something that is supposed to be vetted before an approval from my lenders and/or State Farm? They told me everything was okay but called me today to say it didn’t go through the underwriter. They said I can replace my roof or try to find someone else to get home insurance through, but if I can find it it will be expensive. What? Isn’t a loan contingent on ability to get it insured? It all feels very scummy and timing is poor, because if I needed a new roof, that would have been addressed in our offer and it would change the amount we paid for the house, I’m sure. If anyone has been through a similar scenario and can give me some guidance that would be great. Not sure how to proceed with my lender and everything else. Thank you in advance.

Generally the agent will put age of the roof in the quote. If they do not, the insurance company will have to send in inspector. Inspector then determine if the roof is good, needs fixed, etc. Sounds like inspector wants it fixed. See if you can find other coverage to get it handled. If you can not, you may have to use an actual cash value rated policy(not ideal). This does happen more than it probably should. If I can help further, let me know. Ty Matt

Sadly, yes. Bought a house with a shake shingle roof. Kinda' obvious, huh? Got the coverage, closed on the house, then State Farm said "Hey! You have an old shake shingle roof! It's a fire hazard! We're going to cancel your policy if you don't immediately replace it!" 
We threatened to call the state insurance commissioner noting they had no excuse for not knowing this in advance, but in the end only got a 6 month reprieve. $20K later (HCOLA) we had a new roof and a new insurance company. 
Sorry for your hassles :( good luck!

If your roof is not causing issues (no leaks) and it is 20 years old, it's actually a good time to replace it. Once the damage and leaks set in, the cost to repair goes way up. I replaced my roof at 12 years old (it had 15-20 year shingles before, not certain). The cost was only about $5,000 to replace the shingles. I'm sure that will be higher in Alaska. 
Try to think of it this way. Invest the money now and then you won't have to deal with the roof for another 15+ years.

I'm surprised this didn't come up during the inspection. That's when I learned I'd have to replace the roof soon. It wasn't even bad enough to not be insured - I'm surprised your roof wasn't flagged by your inspector.

We decided against putting an offer on a house bc the roof was 20 years old and looked rough. Got a quote for 14k. Our main worry was insurance. I was so sad to let it go.

This happened to us. Thankfully we kinda already knew we were gonna have to replace the roof this year anyway. Also thankfully it’s not too big of a burden on us.

They can deny you for virtually any reason. If you fix your roof they might not like a tree. I would cast a wide net to find coverage.

I have a concrete tile roof that was supposed to last 45 years. But at 20 my insurer dropped me, and I got a policy that prorated the roof.

We knew the roof was 20 years old. The home inspection showed the roof was in great shape. No leaks or any issues what so ever. The only negative is its age. Home inspection report came back with no problems. Everything was good. Then State Farm sent a lady out who took photos with her iPhone for like 3 minutes and apparently that was enough to qualify the roof needed to be replaced.

Very common. When we moved in our insurance company told us we had month to repaint and repair the shes or the policy would be canceled. We did those things are keep our insurance. I have an old roof and am not able to get insurance from many carriers. I am a little surprised that your agent and inspector did not catch this

Knowing the age of the roof when you purchased it, you should have been planning to replace it already. No insurance company is going to want that risk.

Why this came up on my reddit feed I don't know BUT I work at a State Farm office and we've seen this exact situation happen: 
-we ask for when the roof was installed and most people are pretty good at getting that information. I can't submit an app without the roof age. Once we submit it then it goes to underwriting ("quality control") and that takes weeks. It's not quick. They get access to photos that may be old as fuck but they will use what they have. 
-in the one case I am obliquely referencing, the client's roof was 17 years old but his roof had shingles on it that were discontinued due to a class action lawsuit. And apparently State Farm isn't willing to replace it with another shingle of like kind and quality, they will only replace it with the EXACT same kind and if the exact same kind isn't made anymore then they won't insure the home. It's a fucking nightmare. 
-as far as the bank goes, yes, you will need adequate insurance on the home throughout the life of the mortgage. The mortgage probably needs to have replacement cost coverage on the roof instead of ACV because no bank will write a mortgage when the roof gets ACV after 7 years. The bank will know if there's a lapse in coverage and they will contact you fast. 
-roofing claims are a sore spot in the industry right now. This is partially their way to mitigate further risks on their books. They know people will lie and deceive the company for roof money so the insurance companies will not bother hearing anybody out. You can thank all the people calling in with questionable claims over the years for this. 
-on the other side, some of these underwriting guidelines aren't done in good faith. I trust the current system but the way State Farm is doing this pisses a lot of people off

Everyone is confusing a home inspector you pay for with an insurance inspector. What your home inspector that you pay for finds has nothing to do with insurance. 
The insurance company will almost always begin a policy and then investigate later for risk. When they investigate for risk and find something, they issue a notice that you have to fix what they want or your policy gets dropped, usually in 30 days. 
Any inspections or reviews for risk don’t usually happen until AFTER you have a policy with them. The mortgage underwriter and the insurance underwriter are looking for two very different things. 
The mortgage company wants to see proof of a policy and that’s pretty much it. The loan will close before the insurance starts inspecting and sending notices that they have issues with your property

Pretty much if the roof is older than 12-15 years old it will have to be replaced. I’m waiting for my letter now as our homeowners insurance left my state and we had to get a new company. 
we have 4,000 under roof so probably going to be at least 60k (lcol area)

My insurance company told me I have to replace the roof on the garage and trim some branches or they'll drop me. So I went ahead and do what they asked. Sent them the invoice and pictures, to which they replied that they are still not reinstating my policy without further proof. So I sent about 15 more pictures. Still not reinstating my policy. Thanks for making me pay $4k immediately after moving in for nothing Homesite by progressive. 
So now they're losing me as a home insurance customer AND a vehicle customer. Not that they care.

  * **Know the Comps** : Use detailed comps to justify your offer. ["My offer is 30k less than the house that sold 2 doors down because that one had a pool."](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1o37nmz/comment/nit6fpk/)


### Negotiation Tactics
  * **Start Lower, Aim Higher** : Begin with an offer slightly lower than your budget to give room for negotiation. ["Start a little lower than your budget – but not so low that it feels insulting."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1ndaakq/10_smart_tips_to_negotiate_property_prices_like_a/)
  * **Use Silence as a Tool** : After making an offer, wait for the seller to respond. Silence can create pressure and encourage them to lower the price. ["Silence creates pressure – and often, the other person starts justifying or lowering the price themselves."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1ndaakq/10_smart_tips_to_negotiate_property_prices_like_a/)
  * **Highlight Property Weaknesses** : Point out any flaws or necessary repairs to justify a lower offer. ["Pointing these out politely can help you justify your lower offer."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1ndaakq/10_smart_tips_to_negotiate_property_prices_like_a/)


### Emotional Control
  * **Never Show Too Much Excitement** : Keep your emotions in check, even if you love the house. Showing too much interest can weaken your negotiation position. ["The moment a seller sees your excitement, they know you’re emotionally hooked."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1ndaakq/10_smart_tips_to_negotiate_property_prices_like_a/)
  * **Be Ready to Walk Away** : Show seriousness, but be ready to walk away if the seller is not willing to negotiate. ["Be emotionally detached. Show seriousness, but be ready to walk away if they are not reducing."](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianrealestate/comments/1mx573e/comment/na2y94g/)


### Agent and Market Considerations
  * **Choose a Competent Agent** : A good real estate agent can provide valuable advice and help you navigate the negotiation process. ["Good agents get more business from reviews and word of mouth."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1ol6awv/comment/nmfy0p2/)
  * **Understand Market Conditions** : Adjust your strategy based on whether it’s a buyer’s or seller’s market. ["If it's a hot market, that might be over asking. If the listing is old, that might be under asking."](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1o37nmz/comment/nit81gi/)


### Additional Tips
  * **Consider Seller Financing** : If possible, use seller financing to appeal to the seller. ["Cash + easy terms for them could be more appealing than waiting for an all cash buyer."](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ohxlfx/comment/nlrv6jd/)
  * **Negotiate Inspection Issues** : After the inspection, negotiate on repairs or credits for any issues found. ["Get all of the prices. Start with something like 80% of the total cost."](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1o37nmz/comment/nit6fpk/)
