_“I haven't had to file any claims, but my husband and I switched to State Farm because we both purchased new vehicles, and our other insurance company greatly increased our rates. After comparison shopping, we received equal coverage at a much lower rate with State Farm. We then signed up for the UBI program, and after they tracked our driving habits for a few months, we both scored discounts because we're safe drivers.”_
