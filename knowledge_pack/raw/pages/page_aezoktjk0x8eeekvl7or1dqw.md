#  Quick question on 3-year safe driving discount 
Hello, new customer here. 
I was using the online tool to create a quote, and almost had a rate I was happy with. Unfortunately, once I was prompted to enter my VIN, my premium increased by about $200, and I realized the 3-year safe driving discount was removed due to a speeding ticket I received 2 years and 10 months ago. As the coverage period is for 6 months, it is pretty unfortunate timing. My question: 
If I go with the coverage I've selected, will I be able to call in after 2 months and have the discount applied, lowering my premium? 
Bonus question: If I'd like to, can I opt for lower coverage for these first 2 months to reduce my cost, and then upgrade to full coverage with the discount applied after that 3-year mark has been passed? 
Any advice is appreciated.

Yes, you can call services once it has been 35 months, and they will set it to non-chargeable. A few states require it to be 36 months. If you are in California, New York, or Washington, you will have to wait until your next renewal. And yes you can update your coverages but adding Comp, collision, roadside, and rental requires a 5 day wait from the call date.

When something falls off your record, there is a little known procedure to call services to have the point you’re charged for it removed. They will need to review their guidelines on how to do so. I did it and got a nice refund back since I had paid in full.

You can call and have the violation removed depending on the state you’re in. I can’t remember which ones don’t do it off the top of my head but there’s only four or five who we can’t remove it early (NY is a definite no). As far as the discount it is only applied by the system and we have no way to override it. It only applies when a policy is reviewed at the start or at renewal. So if you start a policy today it won’t apply until renewal in December.

The coverage you choose is entirely up to you, it can be changed at any time just know if the vehicle is a lease or loan the financing company may require certain levels of coverage and in those cases you can’t change it. 
The discount will not apply after 2 months if it is added it won’t be until your renewal is up after your first 6 months. Also keep in mind some states we look at driving history for the last 3, 5 or 7 years so make sure your state applies you might still have that ticket counted few years down the road.
