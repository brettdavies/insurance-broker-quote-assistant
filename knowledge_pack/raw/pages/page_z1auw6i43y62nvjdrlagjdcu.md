#  Umbrella policy shock! Advice please? 
I just got the renewal for our 1 million liability umbrella policy with State Farm. It went from $725 to $1289! We have not filed a single claim and, in fact, have just sold one vehicle to help lower our insurance cost, so there are even less automobile exposures. Is this a joke? We can't afford this hike in price and now have to cancel this policy. I live in Maryland. 
Recommendations on other places to look for a reasonable policy?

At one point umbrellas had been a great value for their price and liability provided, but right now SF is paying huge losses on them compared to the amount they are collecting in premium for them. They have actually stopped writing them in some states.

It's not just State Farm. A lot of insurers waited way too long to evaluate their umbrella policies and are playing catch up because severity in losses is getting so out of control.

I saw a presentation recently by an insurer and their data shows nationally umbrellas are operating at roughly 145% [loss ratio](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=umbrella+policy+loss+ratio&cId=ab0e4e03-c52e-4884-88c9-ccbba5341091&iId=d91c956c-6196-4a6c-bd4e-c35ea067c044).

My state farm agent just told me state farm _stopped writing them_ and the day I transferred mine when moving out of state (which requires a "new" policy) was apparently the last day.

Several years ago I had a civil lawsuit filed against me by one of those big injury lawyers for something I didn’t even do. I’m grew up with nothing and worked my ass off to retire and volunteer. I was a volunteer for a National non profit and they saw I had assets and came after me for 5 million dollars. A really long story but the non profits insurance dumped me although they were supposed to cover me. My insurance eventually covered me mostly (out of pocket legal fees over 20K) but my insurance rates doubled, umbrella 5x. My personal lawyer RECOMMENDED I never volunteer again for any organization under any circumstances! So I don’t volunteer If You have assets you are a potential target, especially if you were previously sued.

Yep. And don’t get me wrong, there are 100% cases where class actions lawsuits are more than justified and I believe that good change can come of them. BUT there needs to be a better solution for groups of people to sue wrongful acts by parties other than a bunch of private equity firms treating cases like the next stock market and ‘investing’ in lawsuits.

Ours has been going up in cost far faster than we were hoping. Probably an overall rate increase based on the experience of a large number of policies.

Usually. You need to carry underlying limits of 250/. 500000 or 500k csl ( combined single limits) for auto liability and 500k for personal liability to satisfy the underlying insurance requirement. 
Umbrella lines is a loser for many carriers so that’s why u see stricter standards and less availability.

More and more claims are piercing umbrella layers than ever before, particularly thanks to [plaintiff attorneys](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=plaintiff+attorneys+insurance+claims&cId=942916af-9a79-41cc-a663-bc70354e48ad&iId=1f7cd84d-d3b5-4517-9938-9a93875caf53). Think about it - how many personal injury ads do you see and hear on a weekly basis? What about all of the nuclear verdicts, and attorneys bragging about their hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements?

Umbrellas are loss leaders in the insurance industry. Last year, my carrier had a combined ratio of 155 for umbrella policies— for every one dollar in premium, they paid 1.55 in claims. Not sustainable.

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.

Bogleheads are passive investors who follow Jack Bogle's simple but powerful message to diversify with low-cost index funds and let compounding grow wealth. Jack founded Vanguard and pioneered indexed mutual funds. His work has since inspired others to get the most out of their long-term investments. Active managers want your money - our advice: keep it! How? Investing in broad-market low-cost indexes, diversified between equities and fixed income. Buy, hold, pay low fees, and stay the course!

FI/RE (Financial Independence / Retiring Early) is a money strategy that's sweeping the nation. It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.

A place for theoretical discussions about GameStop stock ($GME). Opinions and memes welcome. Suspected crypto coin scams such as the "Superstonk" coin and "DumbMoney" crypto coin (with the symbol "$GME") have nothing to do with GameStop stock. None of this is financial advice.

This is a community to post suspicious LMIA pending or LMIA approved jobs from the Job Bank. It is also a place to name and shame business that are abusing the terrible program. Lastly, it is place to post news about the TFW program. Post jobs from anywhere in Canada and crosspost them to the community subreddit where the job is located. Many of these jobs offer strangely high wages, so at the very least this page will help make Canadians who are looking for work aware of well-paying jobs.
