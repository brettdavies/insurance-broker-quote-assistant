At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

## State Farm vs. Farmers: The verdict
State Farm has more competitive rates and a strong financial strength rating, which indicates a solid outlook for paying out future claims. 
Farmers, on the other hand, has more extensive coverage options, including customized equipment coverage and [**accident forgiveness**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/what-is-accident-forgiveness/). But the extra coverage options come at a cost since Farmers’ average rates are nearly double what you can find with State Farm. 
Farmers’ [**car insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/discounts/) might offset some of the higher prices, but if you want [**cheaper car insurance rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/), State Farm is probably a better fit.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

## State Farm Drive Safe & Save vs. Farmers Signal
State Farm and Farmers offer optional [**telematics programs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) that track driving habits through a mobile app, allowing drivers to earn discounts for driving safely. State Farm’s [**Drive Safe & Save**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/drive-safe-and-save/) provides a discount of up to 30%, and drivers must download the Drive Safe & Save app or enroll eligible vehicles in Connected Car.

State Farm calculates rate deductions every six months.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/farmers-vs-state-farm/#cite-1)
Farmers offer Signal, a similar discount program that rewards safe drivers. Drivers must download the Signal by Farmers app and allow it to track their driving.
