## GEICO Insurance: A good choice for most shoppers
GEICO earns a **good** rating from The Zebra thanks to its affordable pricing, wide range of discounts, and solid coverage options — especially when compared to carriers of similar size.
Our survey responses echo that sentiment. While customer service reviews are mixed, GEICO’s low rates and broad availability help tip the scale for many drivers.
What customers like:
  * **Financial Strength Ratings:** Strong ratings indicate the carrier can pay claims during major events.
  * **Self-Service Options:** Complete tasks independently without waiting for an agent.


What customers don't like:
  * **Average Processing Time:** Slow processing delays reimbursement when you need funds.
  * **Transparency in Process and Timeline:** Lack of transparency leaves you uncertain about claim status.


### How The Zebra evaluates insurance companies
Rating | Explanation | Star rating equivalent  
---|---|---  
Subpar  |  Lowest ranking, suggesting instability or high risk  |  0-1.9   
Fair  |  Somewhat stable but not consistently reliable  |  2-2.9   
Good  |  Generally dependable with moderate stability  |  3-3.9   
Solid  |  Strong, reliable and dependable with minor risks  |  4-4.4   
Exceptional  |  Highest rating, indicating outstanding stability and reliability  |  4.5-5   
#### Methodology — how The Zebra reviews insurance companies
The team of insurance experts at The Zebra evaluates companies by focusing on **customer experience first** , with an emphasis on service quality, reliability, and ease of interaction. Unlike previous models, **pricing is not scored** but is instead presented separately as context for comparison. 
Each category has been scored using a combination of our internal customer satisfaction survey results and published scores from reputable organizations such as AM Best and J.D. Power. 
  * **Service Accessibility & Support Quality (25%): **This category measures how easy it is to get help when needed, evaluating factors such as support channel availability (phone, chat, in-person, app), response times, agent knowledge, service hours, and language accessibility.
  * **Claims Experience (25%):** This category assesses how smoothly the claims process works, considering ease of filing (online, app, or phone), transparency and communication, processing times, and fairness in dispute resolution.
  * **Digital Experience & Policy Management (25%): **This category evaluates the convenience of managing your policy: this includes mobile app usability, website experience, account management, digital document access, self-service options, and platform integrations
  * **Trust & Reliability (25%): **This category looks at a company’s overall reliability, measuring financial strength, market stability, regulatory history, communication transparency, and consistency in policy terms.


**Price context:**_Pricing varies significantly based on individual circumstances and risk factors. Customers can evaluate cost-effectiveness based on their specific situation and the service quality scores provided._

#### The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.

## GEICO's customer service & claims experience: Hit or miss
GEICO’s customer service quality really depends on what you need. When it comes to general policy support, the experience is usually smooth and dependable. But once you enter the claims process, things can shift — expect slower response times and less visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes.

####  [ Will GEICO increase my rates if I file a windshield claim? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/will-geico-increase-rates-file-windshield-claim/ "Will GEICO increase my rates if I file a windshield claim?")
Filing a windshield claim with GEICO usually won’t cause your car insurance rates to go up. These repairs fall under comprehensive coverage and are often treated as “no-fault,” meaning they don’t count against you like an at-fault accident might. Small chip repairs are sometimes even free with no d…

####  [ Will I get dropped by my insurance company for two totaled cars? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/dropped-by-insurance-company/ "Will I get dropped by my insurance company for two totaled cars?")
I'm sorry to hear about your recent accidents. GEICO does reserve the right to non-renew your policy based on the number of claims you had. This is normal for insurance companies. The answer isn't always simple, and in my experience, I've seen the outcome go both ways.Making claims can be complicat…

####  [ What is the statute of limitations for filing a GEICO claim? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/statute-limitations-file-claim-geico-vermont/ "What is the statute of limitations for filing a GEICO claim?")
Because of this, I recommend getting an estimate for the repairs prior to filing a claim. If the value of the repairs is less than the rate increase you would receive plus your deductible (so, $2,080 + $500 to $1,000), I recommend repairing the vehicle yourself. check our handy claims calculator to…

####  [ Does GEICO roadside assistance help with keys locked in a car? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/roadside-assistance-help-keys-locked-car/ "Does GEICO roadside assistance help with keys locked in a car?")
Yes — if you’ve added Emergency Roadside Service (ERS) to your GEICO auto policy, lockout assistance is included. That means if you accidentally lock your keys inside your vehicle, GEICO can dispatch someone to help you get back in. However, it’s important to understand how the benefit works so you…

Claims process: Long and sometimes with a less then stellar outcome
