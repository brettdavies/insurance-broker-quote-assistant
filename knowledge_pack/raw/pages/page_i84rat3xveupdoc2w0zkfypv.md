## **GEICO Loyalty Discounts**
Many insurers reward [customer loyalty](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/loyalty-discount) with savings opportunities, and GEICO is no exception. It offers two discounts to acknowledge and encourage long-term relationships:
  * **Multi-vehicle:** Insuring more than one vehicle — including a motorcycle, ATV, or trailer — can earn you a discount of up to 25% on most coverages.
  * **Multi-policy:** You can qualify for additional savings by bundling your auto insurance with other policies. Consider renter, condo, mobile home, or homeowner insurance.


Remember that discount opportunities and values vary by state. If you have any questions, check with your insurance agent.
## **GEICO Affiliation Discounts**
![People signing a contract after a car accident](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/ad4ed09e5e/people-signing-contract-2.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Many insurers have partnerships with various organizations to offer affiliation discounts, including GEICO (except sometimes in New York). The insurance giant provides auto insurance discounts to members of numerous partner organizations, including:
  * **Alumni associations:** Members of some college and university alum groups may qualify for discounts.
  * **Professional organizations:** People affiliated with specific professional groups can sometimes access premium reductions.
  * **Fraternities, sororities, and honor societies:** Members of recognized Greek and honor societies may be eligible for savings.


To determine if your organization is among GEICO’s partners, search its name on the membership discounts page.
## **GEICO Occupational Discounts**
Your [occupation](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/occupation) can influence your auto insurance rates since insurers associate some professions with lower risk. GEICO offers discounts for various occupational groups, including:
  * **Federal employees:** Active or retired federal government employees — particularly people with GS-7 classification and above — may qualify for the company’s “Eagle” discount.
  * **Military personnel:** GEICO offers special discounts and premium reductions to [military members](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-companies-military) in recognition of their service.
  * **Educators:**[Teachers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/teacher-discounts) who are members of some educational organizations may be eligible for membership discounts.


If you don’t see your profession listed, contact an agent or GEICO customer service to see if you can take advantage of your occupation to save on GEICO car insurance.
## **GEICO Telematics Discounts**
[Telematics insurance programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount), like GEICO’s DriveEasy, monitor driving behavior through smartphone apps. These programs typically reward safe driving — often with sizable discounts. The app calculates your discount by tracking speed, braking, and phone usage.
Enrolling in DriveEasy provides an immediate 10% discount and up to 15% on future premiums. And on top of that, telematics programs promote safer driving habits that can improve fuel efficiency by 10%–40%, according to research from Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
But risky driving behaviors can lower your discount and even lead to higher premiums. Consistent, safe driving is key to unlocking full savings.
## **How to Add Discounts to Your GEICO Policy**
![A man with glasses working on a computer](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/c71c2f1d99/man-on-computer-with-pen.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
GEICO applies most eligible discounts to your policy automatically. But some discounts, like for being a good student and taking a defensive driving course, may require submitting a report card or certificate of course completion. See eligibility requirements for exact details.
To review and add discounts to your policy, follow these steps:
  1. Log into your GEICO account.
  2. Click “View Policy.”

## **Other Ways to Save With GEICO**
Beyond discounts, you can use several strategies to see your bill change and save on auto insurance. Here are some of our favorites:
  * **Choose a higher deductible.** Opting for a higher [deductible](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles) can result in substantial savings, but make sure you can afford the extra cost if you have to file a claim.
  * **Review your coverage annually.** Regularly evaluate your policy to ensure you’re not overinsured. Older vehicles, for example, might not need comprehensive or [collision coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance). And if your vehicle is no longer worth more than you owe, [canceling gap insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/cancel-gap-insurance) probably makes sense.
  * **Maintain good credit.** Many insurers consider credit history when determining premiums and offer lower rates for having good credit. Paying your bills on time now could lead to savings down the road.
  * **Compare rates from multiple insurers.** Shopping around is one of the most effective ways to save on car insurance. [Car insurance comparison sites](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-comparison-sites) can help you compare multiple quotes and find the best rates quickly.
