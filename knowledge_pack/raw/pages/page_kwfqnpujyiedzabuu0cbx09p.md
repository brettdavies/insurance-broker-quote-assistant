This company’s basic coverage includes dwelling, other structures, personal property, personal liability, guest medical expenses, and loss of use. Progressive does not offer as many optional endorsements as some other providers, but you can add coverage for water backup or personal injury to your policy; you may also want to purchase separate flood insurance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Progressive partners with several companies that offer certain standalone plan options, such as home warranty, jewelry insurance, and identity fraud.
Progressive coordinates with a [network of third-party insurers](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/homeowners-companies/) that underwrite home insurance policies, so you may have various options available to you when you purchase through Progressive. Coverage and discounts will vary by provider and state. While Progressive sells home insurance nationwide, it may limit options in certain states due to weather or other issues.

## What Does Progressive Homeowners Insurance Cover? 
Progressive’s standard coverage is fairly basic, offering everything you would expect from this type of homeowners insurance policy.  

#### Dwelling Coverage
This covers damage to the physical structure of your house and anything permanently attached to it, such as your porch or chimney.
#### Other Structures
For structures that are not attached to your house, such as a detached garage, gazebo, driveway, or fence, this coverage can help pay for damages.
#### Personal Property
Personal possessions coverage insures your belongings in the event of a covered loss; it applies to clothes, electronics, furniture, and other personal items.
#### Personal Liability
This type of insurance can cover lawsuits and other financial losses if you are responsible for injuring someone or damaging their property.
#### Guest Medical Payments
Guest medical payments coverage can protect you from medical expenses if someone gets injured on your property.
#### Additional Living Expenses
This coverage, also known as loss of use insurance, helps you pay for increased living costs when a covered loss forces you to temporarily move out of your house.
## Additional Options Offered by Progressive Homeowners Insurance
You can upgrade your standard Progressive home insurance policy with a couple optional add-ons. Progressive also advertises certain standalone plans from third-party companies; these options can complement your Progressive homeowners insurance but are not directly provided by Progressive.
Personal Injury
This addition to your home insurance policy covers legal fees and damages from uncommon but expensive situations, such as a slander lawsuit, malicious prosecution, wrongful eviction, or false imprisonment.
Water Backup
This add-on coverage helps pay for [water damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) that occurs when water backs up, overflows, or discharges from drains, sewers, sump pumps, or other equipment.
Flood Insurance
Your standard home insurance policy will not cover flood damage. However, even if you do not live in a high-risk flood zone, you can still be hit with unexpected flooding from heavy rain, snowmelt, rivers, or dams. Purchase a separate flood insurance policy through FEMA’s [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) to protect your home.
Identity Theft
For insurance against losses from identity fraud, Progressive ID Protection plans are offered by IDnotify, which is part of the credit bureau Experian. This monthly plan – separate from your home insurance policy – can help you monitor your credit and watch for identify fraud.
Jewelry Insurance
If the personal property protections of your homeowners policy are insufficient to insure your valuable jewelry, you can purchase a Lavalier standalone jewelry insurance policy through Progressive.
Home Warranty
A standalone Progressive home warranty plan by Cinch can help compensate you for wear and tear damage that is not covered in your home insurance policy; select from different plan tiers to get coverage for appliances, the plumbing system, the electrical system, or other parts of your home.
Home Security
Homeowners may want to buy SimpliSafe’s standalone home security plan through Progressive. This security system can safeguard your home against burglaries, warn you about fire or water damage, and potentially help you qualify for a discount on your Progressive home insurance.
## What Does Progressive Homeowners Insurance Not Cover?
A basic homeowners insurance plan from Progressive does not cover damage from flooding, but you can get flood insurance through FEMA’s program. Earthquakes, landslides, mudslides, and sinkholes are not covered. The standard policy also does not include coverage for water backup damage or certain personal injury lawsuits, which is why you may want to add those optional endorsements. Expensive jewelry and identity theft will likely not be covered, so consider buying the standalone plans to get coverage for those.
Damage caused by neglect, intentional actions, or illegal activity is not eligible for coverage. Exclusions may vary by policy, but you will typically not be covered for losses resulting from normal wear and tear (unless you have a separate home warranty plan) or pests such as insects and rodents.
## How Much Does Progressive Homeowners Insurance Cost?
With an average monthly premium of $157.58, Progressive ranks No. 7 out of the nine companies in our cheapest home insurance rating, making it one of the more expensive providers. This rate is for a policy with a dwelling coverage limit of $300,000 and a liability coverage limit of $100,000. However, at several other price points in our analysis, Progressive moves up to No. 6 and overtakes Chubb with slightly cheaper premiums.

Per Month
Our analysis is based on average rate data from Quadrant Information Services for a married homeowner in a three-person household with a wood-frame house. This study looked at average rates for a 38-year-old and a 56-year-old homeowner with a credit score of 720 and a deductible of either $1,000 or $2,500.
The cost of home insurance depends on many different variables, including the policy’s coverage limits and deductible, your age and credit score, the age and location of your home, your claims history, and more. You should [compare quotes](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/quotes) from various providers and see what discounts are available before deciding.

If you are buying a new home or switching from renters to home insurance, you may be eligible for some savings. For this discount option, the home does not have to be newly built.
New Home Construction Discount
This discount is for newly built houses. The more recently your home was built, the more money you may be able to save on your policy.
Multi-Policy Discount
Customers who buy both home and auto insurance from Progressive save 7% on average. You can also get a discount by bundling your home insurance with other policies, such as RV or motorcycle insurance.
Protective Device Discount
Homeowners who install certain alarm systems and safety features may qualify for a discount. Progressive advertises the SimpliSafe home security system as one option that may help lower your premium.
Quote in Advance Discount
Progressive may offer a lower rate to customers who shop ahead by getting a quote at least 10 days before the policy start date.
Receive Documents by Email Discount
If you opt to receive policy documents electronically, you may get a slight discount.
Pay in Full Discount
Paying for a yearlong policy up front rather than monthly may lower your rate.
Florida Wind Mitigation Discount
For Florida residents only, this discount applies to homeowners who have made certain roof and wind mitigation updates certified by the Florida Building Code.
## How To Buy Homeowners Insurance From Progressive
To help you figure out how much home insurance coverage you need, Progressive has some online tools you can use, including a [home insurance calculator](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/insurance-coverages/calculator/) and a [personal property inventory calculator](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-create-a-home-inventory/). If you’re uncertain how to estimate the cost of rebuilding your home or the worth of your personal belongings, contact an insurance expert for help.
To get a quote, you will need to provide more information than just your desired coverage limits. Progressive will ask questions about who lives with you, whether you’re running a business from your home, when your house was built, how old your roof is, if you currently have a home insurance policy, and more.
Progressive can pull information on your house from public records and photos, but you should still be prepared to give details about specific house features, recent upgrades, safety devices, and other factors, such as whether you live in a high-risk area like a flood zone.
Progressive’s online [HomeQuote Explorer](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/homequote-explorer/) tool lets you apply for an online quote and potentially compare multiple home insurance providers side by side, depending on which insurers are available to you. You can also call Progressive at 855-347-3939 or [find a local agent](https://www.progressiveagent.com/). After you get a quote, you will finalize it and purchase your policy.
If you have a mortgage, notify your lender about your new policy. If you currently have home insurance with another provider, avoid a lapse in coverage by canceling that existing policy only after your new one takes effect.
## How Do I File a Claim With Progressive Homeowners Insurance?
Progressive works with a network of third-party insurers, so your claim will be handled by the underwriter of your particular policy. You’ll need to directly contact the insurer mentioned in your policy documents; Progressive provides a list of insurance company phone numbers [on its website](https://www.progressive.com/claims/property-process/).
If you’re not sure which company to contact, call Progressive at 800-776-4737 and give your policy number to get connected to the right insurer. From there, your provider will direct you to fill out claim forms on the website or app, or send them to you by mail.
When you experience a covered loss, you should begin the claims process as soon as possible. Before you do, however, make sure you’re out of any potential danger, and if necessary, arrange for emergency repairs to protect your home from imminent further damage.
Prepare as much documentation as you can by taking photos and videos of the damage and making a complete list of lost, stolen, or damaged items. Include any receipts that demonstrate the value of your belongings, and don’t throw out any damaged property while your claim is still open, as it may be needed for evidence.
You may also be asked to provide an estimate of how much the larger repairs will cost. If applicable, you can also submit receipts for any initial emergency repairs, a copy of a police report, and receipts for any expenses incurred by having to temporarily relocate from your house.
After your insurer has all the necessary documentation, a representative will review your out-of-pocket costs and claim estimate with you before sending payment, which you can use to hire someone to carry out the repair work. After your claim has been settled, if you find more damage during repairs, you may be able to get additional compensation from your provider.
## FAQ
Does Progressive homeowners insurance cover mold?
Like most homeowners policies, Progressive only covers [mold damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold) in certain circumstances. Generally, you’ll need to show that the mold is caused by a sudden incident covered in your policy, such as a burst pipe or storm damage to a roof. Your agent can provide information regarding a specific incident.
Does Progressive homeowners insurance cover water damage or roof leaks?
Progressive homeowners policies cover [water damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) from perils included under your policy, such as a faulty appliance, water from fighting a fire, etc. You can get additional protection for an extra fee, including endorsements for water backup from sewers or drains, or by adding flood coverage through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program.
Typically, homeowners policies cover [roof leaks](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-damage) caused by sudden, accidental events such as storm damage or a tree falling onto the roof. However, leaks caused by lack of maintenance or typical wear and tear aren’t covered.
Does Progressive homeowners insurance cover theft?
Your Progressive homeowners policy includes coverage for theft of your personal property. There are limits to the amount of coverage you’ll receive in a standard policy, so if you have more expensive items such as jewelry, you may want to purchase a separate jewelry insurance policy.
Does Progressive homeowners insurance cover tree damage?
If a tree falls due to a covered event like a storm and damages your property, your insurance usually covers it. Also, if the tree lands on a covered structure such as your house or a detached garage, tree removal is also covered. Most policies do not pay for damage to the tree itself.
Does Progressive homeowners insurance cover fire?
Homeowners policies generally cover [damage from a fire](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-fire-damage) and smoke damage, though each policy and claim will be handled differently. Depending on the extent of the damage, both dwelling protection and personal property coverage may apply.
The key exceptions are preventable fires, such as arson or failure to maintain a chimney. In these cases, your policy is unlikely to cover the damages.
