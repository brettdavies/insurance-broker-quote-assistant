# Does homeowners insurance cover roof leaks?
Dwelling coverage under your homeowners policy may pay to repair or replace your roof, up to your coverage limit and minus your deductible, if the leak was caused by a covered peril. If the roof leak is due to lack of maintenance or wear and tear, homeowners insurance typically won't cover it. Damage to your personal belongings resulting from a leaky roof may also be covered by your policy.

  * Seal roof vents
  * Check for attic ventilation to stop moisture buildup
