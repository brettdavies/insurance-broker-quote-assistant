Amica vs Progressive comparison Is Amica cheaper than Progressive? Amica vs Progressive: discounts Amica vs Progressive: customer experience comparison Frequently asked questions Methodology
Progressive generally offers lower average rates than Amica across a range of driver profiles, but Amica's unusual policy dividend program could help make up some of that premium difference. While Progressive's Name Your Price Tool may appeal to younger drivers on a budget, both carriers offer telematics programs to help you potentially save on coverage. Amica stands out most distinctly for its excellent service record, with high customer satisfaction scores from third-party organizations.

Founded in 1907, [Amica Insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/amica/) is the oldest mutual auto insurer in the United States. It underwrites its own auto insurance products under Amica Mutual Insurance Company. Amica offers all the standard car insurance coverage types and a selection of optional coverage types. This combination of company longevity and solid product offerings is supported by Amica’s top-notch customer service, as proven by its high scores across several rating systems.
[Progressive Insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/progressive/), founded in 1937, is the second-largest auto insurance company. The national carrier has several underwriting companies for auto insurance, depending on where you live and what rating class you fall into. On top of generally affordable rates, one feature that Progressive stands out for is its Name Your Price Tool, which allows potential customers to set a budget to determine the type of coverage options available within their price range.
Lightbulb Icon
Our verdict
Amica generally offers higher average rates than Progressive but is recognized for its superior customer and claims satisfaction ratings from J.D. Power, setting a high standard in service quality. Progressive, on the other hand, might be a good pick for those who prioritize advanced digital tools for policy management. Amica tied for the [2025 Bankrate Award](https://www.bankrate.com/awards/2025/best-auto-insurance-companies/) for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall and won Best for Customer Experience. Progressive did not earn a Bankrate Award this year.

## Frequently asked questions

The best car insurance company for you will need to meet your coverage needs and customer service expectations, all while staying within your budget. Broadly speaking, Amica and Progressive cater to different types of policyholders. Our insurance reviews suggest that an Amica policy will typically be more expensive, but in return, you should expect a high level of customer service, especially if you need to file a claim.

Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Auto Insurance Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study).

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

Amica vs Progressive comparison Is Amica cheaper than Progressive? Amica vs Progressive: discounts Amica vs Progressive: customer experience comparison Frequently asked questions Methodology
Progressive generally offers lower average rates than Amica across a range of driver profiles, but Amica's unusual policy dividend program could help make up some of that premium difference. While Progressive's Name Your Price Tool may appeal to younger drivers on a budget, both carriers offer telematics programs to help you potentially save on coverage. Amica stands out most distinctly for its excellent service record, with high customer satisfaction scores from third-party organizations.
