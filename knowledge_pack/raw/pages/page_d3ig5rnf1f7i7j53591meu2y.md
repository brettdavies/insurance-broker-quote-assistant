Taking advantage of discounts can save you money on your car insurance, and you can save even more by combining them.
[Allstate](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/allstate-insurance) offers 12 discounts, including multi-policy, new car, and responsible payer discounts. Although some discounts apply to your policy automatically, others require personal information or proof that you qualify.
Keep reading for the complete list of Allstate discounts, how to get them, and other ways to save on your Allstate car insurance policy.

## **Allstate Driving Record Discounts**
Many insurers offer [discounts](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts) for maintaining a good driving record. Your claims history, driving habits, and mileage determine your eligibility for these driving record discounts.
Allstate offers these two driving-related savings programs:
  * **Safe driving bonus:** Earn savings for each six-month policy period without an accident.
  * **Deductible Rewards:** When you sign up, you’ll receive a $100 credit toward your collision [deductible](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles), plus an additional $100 for each year you go without an accident, up to $500.


Although Allstate doesn’t offer a [low-mileage discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/low-mileage-insurance-discount), it factors your [annual mileage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/annual-mileage) into your rate. You can save an average of 23% if you drive less than 7,500 miles annually.
Additionally, with Allstate’s optional [accident forgiveness](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-accident-forgiveness-insurance) coverage, your rates won’t increase after an accident. You may need to pay extra for the coverage, so contact your local agent to find out more.
## **Allstate Vehicle Discounts**
![A man getting out of his car outside of a building](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/1d6aa9772f/man-getting-out-of-car.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The features and type of car you drive could also land you a discount. Allstate offers the following vehicle discounts:
  * **New car discount:** Receive a [new car discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/new-car-discount) if you’re the original owner of a vehicle that’s less than three model years old.
  * **Anti-lock brakes discount:** Get a [discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/passive-restraint-discount) if your car has an anti-lock braking system (ABS).
  * **Anti-theft technology discount:** Installing an anti-theft device could earn you a [discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/anti-theft-discount).


## **Allstate Age-Related Discounts**
Many insurers offer discounts for younger drivers, which can be especially helpful since this group pays much more for car insurance than most drivers. Allstate offers a student discount for drivers who are single, under 25, and meet at least one of these requirements:
  * Have a grade point average (GPA) of 2.7 or higher
  * Finish the teenSMART driver training program
  * Attend college at least 100 miles from where you garage your car


If a driver in your household qualifies for the [good student discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/good-student-discount), provide your insurance agency with a copy of their most recent grade report or contact Allstate customer service to apply the discount.
## **Allstate Payment Discounts**
![Two men writing on a clipboard after a car accident](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/3d1048e0df/insurance-after-crash.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Insurance companies usually offer multiple ways to pay your bill. Being flexible could help you qualify for one or more of Allstate’s payment discounts, including:
  * **EZ pay plan discount:** Set up [automatic withdrawals](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/automatic-payments-discount) to receive this discount.
  * **FullPay discount:** Pay your entire policy premium to get the [paid-in-full discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/paid-in-full-discount).
  * **Responsible payer discount:** Continually pay your bill on time or within the grace period to get this discount.
  * **Allstate eSmart discount:** Receive a [paperless discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/paperless-discount) when you sign up to view your policy documents online.
  * **Early signing discount:** Sign your policy at least seven days before it takes effect to earn this discount.


## **Allstate Loyalty Discounts**
Some companies offer loyalty discounts to customers who renew their policies or purchase multiple policies from the same insurer. Although Allstate doesn’t have a continuous coverage discount, it offers the following savings:
  * **Multi-car discount:** Get the [multi-car discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-car-insurance-discount) by insuring at least two cars on the same policy.
  * **Multi-policy discount:** Bundle your auto policy with homeowners or renters insurance to save up to 25% with the [multiple policy discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/multi-policy-discount).


## **Allstate Telematics Discounts**
[Usage-based programs](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) are becoming more common in the auto insurance industry. Allowing your insurer to track your driving habits could help you save on your car insurance.
Allstate’s [Drivewise](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/allstate/drivewise) telematics program offers an initial enrollment discount of up to 40% off, depending on your driving habits. Customer reviews suggest realistic savings of 20% to 25%.
Allstate calculates this discount by considering things like braking events, driving speed, phone activity, and time of day. But risky habits — like driving late at night, using your phone, or driving too fast — could increase your premiums.
## **How to Add Discounts to Your Allstate Policy**
![A young woman with glasses using her laptop](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/800x450/7d2257f16f/young-woman-on-computer-3.jpg/m/800x450/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
The type of discount determines how it’s added to your Allstate policy. Some apply automatically, like multi-car, anti-theft, ABS, and new car discounts. But others require you to do something to get the savings, like:
  * Choosing a payment plan or paying in full to get specific payment discounts.
  * Signing your policy at least seven days before its effective date to get the early signing discount.
  * Enrolling in Allstate’s Drivewise [telematics program](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/telematics-discount) to get the enrollment discount, then downloading the mobile app to record your trips and calculate your potential participation discount.
  * Providing proof of GPA, such as an honor roll certificate or report card, with the school’s contact information for a good student discount.


If you’re unsure about how to qualify or apply for a specific discount, contact your insurance agent or an Allstate customer service representative.
## **Other Ways to Save With Allstate**
Although discounts are an easy way to save on Allstate auto insurance, you can do other things to [lower your cost of car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). Here are some tips that may help:
  * **Shop around annually.** Although companies use similar [factors](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors) to determine premiums, prices can vary significantly. It’s worth [shopping](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/how-to-shop-for-car-insurance) around every year to check if Allstate is still your cheapest option.
  * **Compare insurance before buying a vehicle.** Insurance rates vary by the make and model of your car. If you’re shopping for a new or used car, [compare insurance premiums](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance) to find the best vehicle and insurance company for your budget.
  * **Increase your deductible.** Opting for higher comprehensive and collision [deductibles](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-deductibles) can reduce the cost of your monthly premiums. Just make sure you can afford the added cost if you have to file a claim.
