What kind of car insurance do you need? That depends on your situation. For example, a rideshare driver will need different insurance coverage than someone who commutes to the office three days per week. Some companies offer discounts for people in certain professions. In contrast, others offer unique add-ons and endorsements that may provide additional benefits, so it is important to figure out exactly what your needs are before you choose an insurance policy.

## Finding the Best Car Insurance Company
#### Cost
Premiums depend on location, vehicle, coverage selections, and other factors. Compare quotes to find coverage that fits your budget.
#### Add-On Coverage
Insurers offer add-ons, also known as endorsements, that extend your protection. Consider the additional coverage you want on your policy and whether it's available.
#### Discounts
Most car insurance companies offer discounts, but the options and percentage off vary.
#### Reputation
It's a good idea to research companies' reputations, examining details such as customer service and the claims process.
## How Much Does Car Insurance Cost? 
The average cost of a year-long car insurance policy is $2,012, according to our rate study. Among companies in our rating, American National has the lowest average rate, followed by USAA, Geico, Travelers, and Auto-Owners.
Our report on the [cheapest car insurance companies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/cheapest-car-insurance-companies) provides an analysis of which insurers have the lowest average rates in different driver categories, including teens, young adults, senior drivers, and drivers with a speeding ticket, at-fault accident, or DUI on their record. These include insurers in our rating and other providers.
### What factors impact the cost of a car insurance policy?
Insurers [consider many factors](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/average-cost-of-car-insurance) as they assess risk and determine what you’ll pay for coverage. These include your location, age, vehicle, driving history, credit-based insurance score, and more. 
## Car Insurance Coverage
Car insurance companies offer standard coverage that includes:
Liability (bodily injury and property damage)
Liability insurance covers injuries you cause to others. It also [covers damage you cause](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/liability-car-insurance) to someone else’s property, including their vehicle. In addition, it can cover legal fees if you’re sued. Liability is required by most states.
Uninsured/underinsured motorist
This coverage provides financial protection if you’re in an accident with an at-fault driver who has [no insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/uninsured-motorist-car-insurance), or who has too little insurance to cover damages. It’s required in some states.  

Collision
If you collide with another vehicle or a stationary object, [collision](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/collision-car-insurance) covers damage to your vehicle, regardless of fault. It’s not required by any state, but it’s typically required by a lender or lessor if you finance or lease a car.
Comprehensive
Comprehensive covers [non-collision damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/comprehensive-car-insurance). This includes damage caused by falling objects or severe weather, as well as vandalism, theft, and cracked windshields. This is not a state-required coverage, but like collision coverage, it is often required by a lender or lessor.
Medical payments (MedPay)
Medical payments, also known as [MedPay](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/medical-payments-coverage), can cover medical costs and funeral expenses for you and your passengers, no matter who’s at fault in an accident.
Personal injury protection (PIP)
Like MedPay, [PIP](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance) covers medical costs for you and your passengers. But it also pays some other expenses, such as lost wages and rehabilitation. The additional expenses covered can vary by state.
### Other car insurance coverage
In addition, car insurance companies offer optional add-ons to personalize a policy. These differ by insurers, but often include rental car reimbursement, roadside assistance, rideshare coverage, accident forgiveness, gap insurance, and new car replacement. 
### More coverage from the best car insurance companies

## Car Insurance by State
Most states require at least a minimum amount of car insurance to legally operate a vehicle. Requirements differ by state. Almost all states require liability coverage, and in many states, that’s the only type of coverage mandated. But other states require additional coverage, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist. States with [no-fault insurance laws](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/glossary/what-is-no-fault-car-insurance) require PIP coverage.
You have to carry enough coverage to meet your state’s requirements, but you shouldn’t stop there when constructing a policy. Higher limits and other kinds of coverage are available. Carefully consider [how much car insurance you need](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need) for adequate financial protection.

## How We Rated Car Insurance Companies
To compile our ratings, we researched 75 car insurance companies, surveyed 1,144 car insurance policyholders, collected 394 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data points including the number of consumer complaints filed against such companies in 2024, and analyzed a total of 3,538 company features. The following describes our approach to researching car insurance companies to guide prospective consumers.
### **U.S. News Methodology for Evaluating Car Insurance Companies**
### **1. We identified the companies people care most about.**
U.S. News analyzed and compared a variety of publicly available data about car insurance companies. We found 75 car insurance companies that offer car insurance in the U.S. We then narrowed our list down to 29 car insurance companies that are accepting new business in states that cover at least 60% of the U.S. population. We further narrowed our list during our consumer survey, only including companies that reached the threshold of at least 30 respondents per company.
### **2. We collected data needed to make company comparisons.**
With the companies determined, we conducted a comprehensive data collection on the company and its car insurance policy features to create a general summary of what consumers should know to assist with their purchasing decisions. We collected data via a consumer survey, NAIC, Quadrant Information Services, and company feature analysis.
(a) We surveyed 1,144 car insurance customers (641 women and 503 men, with an average age of 49.8 years) to assess their satisfaction with their services. The survey was conducted in February 2025, and the target respondents were individuals in the U.S. who currently have a car insurance policy from one of the 29 companies we identified. Survey respondents were located in the Northeast (32.3%), Midwest (26.0%), South (22.9%), and West (18.8%). We asked how satisfied they are with the following: 
  * Value from the Policy
  * Claims Handling
  * Customer Service
  * Customer Loyalty


(b) We collected 394 NAIC data points, including consumer complaints and annual premiums for all companies at the subsidiary level. The complaint data points were weighed by the size of the annual premium written, and we aggregated the weighted data points to calculate the NAIC score at the parent company level.
(c) To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual driver profiles.Our study rates are based on profiles for male and female drivers aged 17, 25, 40, and 60. Vehicles used include the 2020 and 2025 Toyota Camry, 2020 and 2025 Toyota RAV4, and 2020 and 2025 Ford F-150, with annual mileages of 7,000 and 14,000 for each vehicle. Three car insurance coverage levels were used, as were credit tiers of good fair and poor. Clean driving records, as well as records with one accident, one speeding violation, or one DUI were also used in the calculations of certain driver archetypes. The three coverage levels we used are referred to as "low," "medium," and "high." Low coverage refers to the minimum coverage required in each state. The medium coverage tier is $50,000/$100,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible, $50,000 property damage coverage, $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, and any other mandatory coverages a state may require. The high coverage tier is $100,000/$300,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $500 deductible, $100,000 property damage coverage, $100,000/$300,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, as well as any other mandatory coverages a state may require. To get the average annual rate used in our analysis, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers aged 25, 40, and 60 who drive 14,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record. The rates are for comparative purposes only and should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. Because car insurance rates are based on individual factors, your car insurance rates will differ.
(d) We collected data on 3,538 company features from the insurance providers’ websites. These features were selected based on what consumers care most about according to our survey results, including:
  * State Availability
  * Discounts
  * Purchasing Options
  * Required and Optional Coverage Options


### **3. We converted the raw data into standardized scores.**
To account for different data types from the survey results (e.g., 5 = very satisfied) and the company features (e.g., $99.99), we standardized each data point by converting raw data into scores with a common unit of measurement. The standardization allowed us to combine different data types into our model while retaining the relative variability of the original data points for fair and accurate assessment.
### **Conversion to Standardized Scores**
![Graph visualizing top standardized scores](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000196-ef18-d572-a796-ff5ad1c00000/unnamed-3.png?update-time=1752520502478&size=responsiveFlow640)
_We converted the raw data (left) into standardized scores (right). The numeric values changed after the conversion, but the relative variability remained proportional to that of the original values._
### **4. We assigned weights to the standardized scores.**
To integrate standardized scores into our model, we used the survey results and industry knowledge to identify which scores should influence the purchasing decision more strongly. We also considered the variability of the scores. If a score was highly variable across companies, we assigned more weight to that score. However, if a score was uniform for all companies, we reduced the weight of that score. For example, if all companies have a mobile app to manage the policy, we removed mobile app features from the model. This allowed us to enhance the model’s ability to detect meaningful differences by emphasizing the scores with stronger discriminant power. As a result, we arrived at the following weights:
(a) Cost (35% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 28% National Average Rate 
  * 7% Number of Discounts Available 


(b) Customer Sentiment (25% of the U.S. News Rating) 
  * 15% Customer Service Section of the Survey 
  * 10% NAIC Complaint Index Score


(c) Survey (25% of the U.S. News Rating)  

  * 6% Value
  * 6% Customer Service
  * 6% Customer Loyalty
  * 6% Claims Handling


(d) Coverage/ Features Score (15% of the U.S. News Rating)
  * 9% Number of Add-On Coverages 
  * 6% State Availability Score


### **U.S. News Rating Breakdown**
