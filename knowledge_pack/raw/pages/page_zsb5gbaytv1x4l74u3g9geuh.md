# 5 reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage
Written by [State Farm® Editorial Team ](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/editorial-team-and-process)
Explore several reasons to consider adding roadside assistance to your existing auto policy. 
**_Overview:_**_Roadside assistance coverage can provide valuable help when unexpected car issues occur, such as flat tires, dead batteries or locked keys in your car. By adding this coverage to your auto policy, you may be able to better manage surprise expenses, avoid risky DIY repairs and quickly connect with knowledgeable help in stressful situations. With services like towing, jump-starts, fuel delivery and lockout assistance typically included, roadside assistance can offer convenience and practical support, which can be a smart addition for handling life’s unpredictable moments on the road._
Car trouble can strike at the worst times — whether you’re hurrying to work, on a family road trip or simply running errands. That’s why it’s important to consider the reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage. If you’ve ever wondered what roadside assistance is or what it covers, this guide can help you decide if it’s right for you.
## What is roadside assistance?
Many insurance companies offer roadside assistance as an add-on to your auto policy. It helps enable you to connect with help [when your vehicle breaks down](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/what-to-do-if-your-car-breaks-down) or you’re stuck by the side of the road. Instead of feeling stranded, you’re able to access knowledgeable individuals who can get you moving again — day or night.

## What does roadside assistance generally cover?
Coverage details can vary by provider, but plans typically include:
  * **Towing** — if your car won’t start or is unsafe to drive.
  * **Jump-starts** — for a dead battery.
  * **Tire changes** — if you get a flat.
  * **Lockout service** — if you accidentally lock your keys inside.
  * **Fuel delivery** — if you run out of gas.
  * **Minor mechanical help** — for small repairs that can be done on the spot.


## Reasons to consider getting roadside assistance coverage
Here are five reasons you might want roadside assistance coverage and why you may want to consider [adding coverage to your auto policy](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/get-roadside-assistance).
**1. Covers common car issues**
  * **Flat tires can happen to anyone  
**Even careful drivers can run over a nail or hit a pothole. [Changing a tire](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/tire-maintenance-safety-and-care) on a busy road can be dangerous and stressful, especially if you haven’t done it before. Roadside assistance sends help directly to you, so you don’t have to worry about doing it yourself.
  * **Batteries can die without warning  
**A [dead battery](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/car-battery-replacement-tips) can happen anytime, especially in extreme weather or with an older car. If your car won’t start, roadside assistance can provide a [jump-start](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-to-jump-start-a-car).
  * **Getting locked out is easy  
**It only takes a moment of distraction to lock your keys in the car. Roadside assistance coverage may help you avoid long waits or paying a hefty fee to a locksmith.


**2. Helps manage surprise expenses**
Unexpected costs can add up. A tow, a jump-start or a locksmith can cost more than an entire year’s roadside assistance coverage, which [typically ranges from $10 to $60 annually](https://www.marketwatch.com/insurance-services/auto-insurance/how-much-is-roadside-assistance/). By having it as part of your auto insurance, you may potentially [save money in the long run](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-roadside-assistance-coverage-may-save-you-money) and help protect [your budget](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/financial/budget-breakdown) from those unforeseen bills.
**3. Can be a safer** [alternative to DIY car repairs](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/benefits-of-roadside-assistance)
Trying to fix your car on a busy highway or in strange surroundings can be risky. Roadside assistance sends knowledgeable individuals to help handle the situation more safely so you don’t have to deal with it on your own.
**4. Helps ease concerns during stressful situations**
Knowing that support is available 24/7 can help make you feel more at ease, especially when traveling, [driving at night](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/night-driving) or in unfamiliar areas.
**5. Provides access to assistance**
One call typically arranges the needed help, which can save you time and the added hassle of finding it yourself.
## How do you get roadside assistance coverage?
Many insurance companies offer roadside assistance as an add-on to your auto policy. While [regular car maintenance](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/simple-tips-for-owning-and-maintaining-a-car) can help prevent breakdowns, roadside assistance is there to help when the unexpected happens.
Consider [adding roadside assistance coverage](https://www.statefarm.com/claims/get-roadside-assistance) to your policy. For more details or to get a quote, [contact a State Farm agent](https://www.statefarm.com/agent/) today.
