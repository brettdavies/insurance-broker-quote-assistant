Here are the average annual full-coverage rates for teens on their own policies in Maryland.

## How To Get Cheap Car Insurance For Teens In Maryland
Getting affordable car insurance for a teen driver in Maryland can be challenging, but these steps can help you find a policy that balances coverage and cost:
  1. **Assess Driving Habits** : Determine how often and how far your teen drives. Low-mileage drivers can benefit from usage-based insurance programs like Allstate’s Milewise® or GEICO’s DriveEasy.
  2. **Shop Around for** **Quotes:** Compare quotes from multiple insurers, including State Farm and USAA, which often offer competitive rates for teens in Maryland.
  3. **Ask About Discounts:** Inquire about discounts for teen drivers, such as good student discounts, safe driving programs, and multi-policy discounts.
  4. **Consider Usage-Based Insurance:** If your teen drives infrequently, look into pay-per-mile or usage-based insurance programs for potential savings.
  5. **Choose a Higher Deductible:** Opt for a higher deductible to lower your premium, but ensure you can cover the deductible if needed.
  6. **Bundle Policies:** Bundle your teen’s car insurance with other policies, like homeowners or renters insurance, to qualify for discounts.
  7. **Add to an Existing Policy:** Adding your teen to your existing policy is usually cheaper than purchasing a standalone policy.
  8. **Enroll in a Safe Driving Course:** Encourage your teen to take a defensive driving course to improve skills and potentially reduce insurance costs.
  9. **Review and Update Regularly:** Periodically review your teen’s policy as they gain driving experience, which may qualify them for additional discounts.


## Why Is Car Insurance So Expensive For Teens?
Car insurance is expensive for teens primarily because of their lack of driving experience and higher risk of accidents. Statistically, teen drivers are more likely to be involved in accidents compared to older, more experienced drivers. This increased likelihood of claims leads insurance companies to charge higher premiums to offset the risk.
### Key Reasons for High Costs:
  1. **Lack of Experience:** Teens have less experience behind the wheel, making them more prone to making mistakes, which can result in accidents.
  2. **Higher Accident Rates:** Data show that teens, especially males, have higher accident rates than any other age group. This is often due to risky behaviors like speeding, distracted driving, and not wearing seat belts.
  3. **Greater Severity of Accidents:** When teens are involved in accidents, the damage can be more severe due to inexperience in handling dangerous driving situations.
  4. **Immaturity:** Teens are still developing their decision-making skills, which can lead to poor choices on the road. This immaturity is factored into the cost of their insurance.
  5. **Expensive Claims:** The cost of repairing newer vehicles or covering medical expenses in the event of an accident is high. Insurers pass these potential costs onto policyholders through higher premiums.
  6. **Limited Credit History:** Insurers often consider credit history when determining rates. Teens typically have little or no credit history, which can lead to higher premiums.


## What Affects Car Insurance Costs For Teens?
Several factors affect car insurance costs for teens, leading to higher premiums compared to older drivers. These factors include:
**Age and Driving Experience:**
  * Younger, inexperienced drivers are more likely to have accidents, leading to higher premiums.


**Driving Record:**
  * Accidents or violations increase costs, while a clean record can reduce premiums.


**Type of Vehicle:**
  * Sports cars or high-performance vehicles are more expensive to insure.
  * Vehicles with advanced safety features may qualify for discounts.


**Location:**
  * Urban areas with higher traffic and crime rates typically result in higher insurance costs.


**Coverage Levels:**
  * Full coverage policies are more expensive than minimum liability.
  * A higher deductible can lower premiums but increases out-of-pocket expenses.


**Credit History:**
  * Although less relevant for teens, a limited or poor credit history can lead to higher rates.


**Gender:**
  * Young male drivers often face higher premiums due to higher accident rates.


**Discounts and Programs:**
  * Good student discounts and safe driving programs can lower costs.


**Policy Bundling:**
  * Adding a teen to an existing family policy is usually more cost-effective than a separate policy.


## How Can I Add A Teen To My Car Insurance Policy?
[Adding a teen to your car insurance policy](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-to-add-a-driver-to-your-car-insurance) is a straightforward process, but it requires careful planning to ensure you get the best coverage at an affordable rate. Here’s how to do it:
### 1. Notify Your Insurance Company
  * **Contact Your Insurer:** Once your teen gets their driver’s license or learner’s permit, inform your insurance company. [Some insurers require you to add them](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/what-happens-if-i-dont-add-my-teenager-to-my-car-insurance) immediately, while others may allow you to wait until they have a full license.
  * **Provide Necessary Information:** Be prepared to provide your teen’s personal information, such as their driver’s license number, date of birth, and driving history if they already have any.


### 2. Discuss Coverage Options
  * **Review Your Current Policy:** Go over your existing policy to understand what’s covered and decide if you need to adjust the coverage levels. Adding a teen driver may increase your premiums, so it’s essential to evaluate whether your current coverage is sufficient.
  * **Choose Appropriate Coverage:** Consider adding higher liability limits or comprehensive and collision coverage if your teen will be driving a newer or more valuable vehicle. Some insurers offer specific coverage for young drivers, so inquire about those options.


### 3. Ask About Discounts
  * **Explore Discounts:** Many insurance companies offer discounts for teens, such as good student discounts, safe driving discounts, and discounts for completing driver’s education courses. Make sure to ask your insurer about all available discounts to reduce the overall cost.
  * **Consider Bundling Policies:** If you haven’t already, bundling your auto insurance with other policies, like [homeowners ](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/homeowners-insurance)or renters insurance, could result in additional savings.


### 4. Evaluate the Impact on Your Premiums
  * **Get a Quote:** Ask your insurer for a quote to see how much your premiums will increase by adding your teen. Compare this with other insurance companies if you’re considering switching providers.
  * **Consider Deductible Changes:** Raising your deductible can lower your premium, but make sure it’s an amount you’re comfortable paying out of pocket in case of an accident.


### 5. Add Your Teen to the Policy
  * **Formalize the Addition:** Once you’ve selected the appropriate coverage and discussed discounts, finalize the process by officially adding your teen to your policy. Your insurance company will update your policy documents to reflect the change.


### 6. Educate Your Teen on Safe Driving
  * **Emphasize Safe Driving:** Encourage your teen to adopt safe driving habits, as a clean driving record will help keep insurance costs down over time. Consider enrolling them in a safe driving course to further reduce premiums.


### 7. Review the Policy Regularly
  * **Annual Review:** As your teen gains more driving experience, review the policy annually to see if additional discounts or changes in coverage are necessary.


## Car Insurance Discounts For Teens
Here are some common car insurance discounts that teenage drivers can take advantage of to lower their insurance costs:
  * **Good Student Discount** – Teens who maintain a certain grade point average (usually a B or 3.0 GPA) can qualify for this discount. Insurance companies believe that responsible students are likely to be responsible drivers.
  * **Driver’s Education Discount** – Completing a driver’s education course can lead to a discount on insurance premiums. These courses teach safe driving practices, which reduce the risk of accidents.
  * **Safe Driving Discount** – Some insurers offer discounts for teens who maintain a clean driving record with no accidents or traffic violations.
  * **Safe Driver Programs** – Programs like State Farm’s Steer Clear® or GEICO’s DriveEasy reward teens for practicing safe driving habits. These programs typically require participation in a monitored driving course or app.
  * **Low Mileage Discount** – Teens who don’t drive often may qualify for a low mileage discount. This is particularly beneficial for teens who only drive occasionally, such as to school or work.
  * **Student Away at School Discount** – If your teen is attending college more than 100 miles away from home and doesn’t have regular access to a car, some insurers offer discounts since the car is less likely to be driven.
  * **Bundling Discount** – Adding your teen to an existing family policy or bundling auto insurance with other types of insurance (like homeowners) can result in a multi-policy discount.
  * **Accident-Free Discount** – If your teen maintains an accident-free record over a certain period, they may qualify for an accident-free discount.
  * **Early Signing Discount** – Some insurance companies offer discounts if you sign up for a policy or renew it before your current policy expires.
  * **Usage-Based Insurance Programs** – Programs like Progressive’s Snapshot® or Allstate’s Drivewise® track driving behavior and offer discounts based on safe driving habits. These programs are particularly beneficial for teens who drive safely.
  * **Good Driver Discount** – This discount rewards young drivers who have had their license for a few years and have maintained a clean driving record.
