[Usage-based insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/usage-based-insurance) programs monitor your driving habits to potentially lower your premiums based on safe driving behaviors. They’re ideal for drivers who avoid hard braking and late-night driving and maintain steady speeds.
Progressive’s [Snapshot](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive/snapshot) uses a mobile app to monitor factors like time of day, mileage, and braking. After each trip, you’ll receive personalized feedback, including a star rating, data summary, and driving tips to help improve your score. Safe drivers may earn significant discounts, but risky driving can lead to higher rates.
Allstate’s [Drivewise](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/allstate/drivewise) also tracks your driving through its mobile app and rewards you for staying under 80 mph, avoiding sudden stops, and limiting late-night trips. New customers get a participation discount after taking at least one trip per policy period and may receive additional rewards after 50 trips.
Like Snapshot, Drivewise can increase your rates if it detects risky driving behaviors. It also includes crash detection and automatic assistance if you get into a serious accident.
