**If you have a car loan or lease, your lender probably requires you to have a full coverage policy.** That's because full coverage comes with [collision and comprehensive insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance: What Is the Difference?"). These coverages pay to fix or replace your car after an accident, theft, flooding and other types of damage.
What do collision and comprehensive insurance cover?

**[Collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance#coll "What is collision insurance?")** pays for damage to your car after a crash with another vehicle or structure, regardless of whose fault it is.
  * Hitting another car 
  * Crashing into a pole or fence 


  * Driving over a big pothole

**If your car is worth more than $5,000 or is newer than eight years old, it's usually worth it to have full coverage, even if you own the car outright.** Collision and comprehensive coverage typically cost less than your repairs after a serious accident.

There are a lot of factors that go into the cost of collision and comprehensive insurance, including the age and type of car you drive, accident and theft rates in your area and your personal driving history.
One of the most important factors is your  deductible. Policies with higher deductibles usually cost less because insurance companies won't pay as much after a crash.
### Monthly collision and comprehensive rates by deductible
Deductible | Collision | Comprehensive | Total monthly cost  
---|---|---|---  
$250 | $79 | $38 | $117  
$500 | $67 | $31 | $98  
$1,000 | $53 | $24 | $78  
$1,500 | $47 | $21 | $68  
Deductible | Collision | Comprehensive  
---|---|---  
$250 | $79 | $38  
$500 | $67 | $31  
$1,000 | $53 | $24  
$1,500 | $47 | $21  
**Consider dropping your[comprehensive and collision insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") when you can reasonably afford to replace your car.** Your car insurance costs will drop. But you'll need to pay for a new car out of pocket if you cause an accident that totals your car.
![filter icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_60//icons/filter)
**In addition to protecting your car, full coverage typically includes higher liability limits than minimum coverage.** Many states require very low liability limits that don't provide enough protection to cover the cost of a major accident.
A full coverage policy with higher limits means you'll pay less out of pocket if you cause a major accident.
### How much liability coverage do I need?
You should get as much liability coverage as you can afford, so you're protected if you cause a major accident.
Coverage:  25/50/20
  * **Monthly rate:** $179/month
  * **Is it enough coverage?** It might cover a very minor fender bender, but this isn't enough protection for a serious accident.


Example
  * **Example crash:** You have a fender bender with a small SUV at 25 mph. Two passengers suffer whiplash and one has a minor concussion. 
  * **Claim total:** $30k in medical bills and $25k in vehicle damage 
  * **Would 25/50/20 be enough?** No, you'll end up paying around $10k out of pocket, $5k for medical bills and $5k for the other driver's vehicle repairs. 


Coverage:  100/300/50
  * **Monthly rate:** $198/month
  * **Is it enough coverage?** In most cases, this is enough coverage. But it might fall short if you cause a very serious accident.


Example
  * **Example crash:** You rear-end a Tesla Cybertruck at 40 mph. One passenger has a fractured pelvis, another has severe whiplash, needing an MRI and specialist care. 
  * **Claim total:** $60k in medical bills and $40k in vehicle damage 
  * **Would 100/300/50 be enough?** Yes, your insurance will pay up to $300k to cover medical bills for all three passengers, well above the cost of their injuries.
You also have up to $50k for damage to the Tesla, so you won't have to pay anything out of pocket. 


Coverage:  50/100/25
  * **Monthly rate:** $189/month
  * **Is it enough coverage?** It's enough to cover most common crashes. But it's not enough for a major accident.


Example
  * **Example crash:** You crash into a family minivan at 30 mph. Two family members suffer back injuries. 
  * **Claim total:** $30k in medical bills and $25k in vehicle damage 
  * **Would 50/100/25 be enough?** Yes, you have up to $100k to cover the medical bills of the two passengers. Your insurance will also pay up to $25k for damage to the minivan, which is right on target.
That means you're fully covered after this minor crash. But that may not be the case if more passengers in the other car were hurt, there were severe injuries or you crashed into an expensive new car. 


Coverage:  250/500/100
  * **Monthly rate:** $217/month
  * **Is it enough coverage?** Yes, this should cover most accidents, including a very serious or multi-car crash.


Example

A BMW X5 is totaled and the other cars need major repairs. Four people are injured in the crash — one with a broken leg, one with a traumatic brain injury and two others with back and neck injuries. 
  * **Claim total:** $120k in medical bills and $90k in vehicle damage 
  * **Would 250/500/100 be enough?** Yes, you have up to $500k to cover medical bills for all four passengers, which easily covers $120k in injuries.
You also have up to $100k for damage to the other driver's cars — $67k to pay for a replacement BMW and up to $33k for repairs to the other vehicles. That exceeds the total amount of property damage.

## How much is full coverage insurance?
The average cost of full coverage car insurance is $175 per month for a typical safe driver.
Rates can vary widely based on factors such as where you live and the company you choose.

## 7 ways to get the best full coverage car insurance quotes
1. Shop around
[Comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "Compare Car Insurance Quotes Online") is the easiest way to get savings all year long without changing your coverage. Different insurance companies will likely quote you different prices for the same amount of coverage. That's because they each set their rates in different ways. 
2. Use car insurance discounts 
You could save with [car insurance discounts](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance-discounts "Car Insurance Discounts") by doing things like signing up for automatic payments, being a safe driver, having anti-theft systems and more. 
3. Get rid of coverage you don't need
Getting rid of extra coverage gives you less protection, but the trade-off may be worth it for you. For example, you may not need [rental car reimbursement](https://www.valuepenguin.com/car-insurance/rental-reimbursement-insurance-coverage "Rental Reimbursement Coverage: What Is It and Do I Need It?") coverage if you have a second car or easy access to public transportation. And you might not need roadside assistance if you have AAA. 
4. Increase your deductible
[Rasing your deductible](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-do-deductibles-affect-car-insurance-premiums "How Do Deductibles Affect Car Insurance Premiums?") will lower your monthly costs, but you'll have to pay more for repairs after a claim. Compare rates for different deductibles to see if the monthly savings is worth it compared to your potential costs after an accident. 
5. Increase your coverage limits
It could only cost a few extra dollars per month to increase your liability coverage limit from $100,000 to $300,000. This could give you much more protection after a bad accident, and it's a good value because it won't increase your bill very much. 
6. Bundle your policies
[Bundling car and home insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "Best Companies for Home and Auto Insurance Bundles") can save you about 25%. Bundling is popular because it's an easy way to save money, and it can also be more convenient because you only have to deal with one insurance company. 
7. Pay by credit card to earn cash back
By using a credit card to pay your insurance bill, your card could give you cash back or help you earn points. For example, a $175 per month car insurance bill could earn you  $42 cash back at the end of the year. Make sure that your insurance doesn't add a fee for using a credit card and that you pay off the credit card bill to avoid interest.

## What's included with full coverage car insurance quotes?
Full coverage auto insurance includes [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance"), which offer more protection than a minimum liability policy.
Comprehensive and collision coverage pay for damage to your car. Full coverage typically also has higher liability limits than the minimums required by your state. This protects you if you cause an expensive accident.
### What else does a full coverage policy cover?
A full coverage policy also includes any [other coverage your state requires](https://www.valuepenguin.com/minimum-car-insurance-required-your-state "What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Your State?"). This could include uninsured motorist coverage or personal injury protection.
  * **[Uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** pays for your injuries and damage to your car if an uninsured driver hits you. Some states require this coverage. 
  * **[Underinsured motorist coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-car-insurance "Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Car Insurance")** pays for your expenses if you're hit by a driver who doesn't have enough car insurance to cover your costs. 
  * **[Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-injury-protection-car-insurance "What Is Personal Injury Protection \(PIP\) and Do You Need It?")** pays your medical bills if you’re injured in a crash, regardless of who caused it. PIP can also reimburse you for lost wages if you miss work while recovering. "No-fault" states may require PIP.

## Frequently asked questions
### How much is full coverage insurance?
Full coverage car insurance costs $175 per month, on average. Some drivers can find cheaper rates from companies like [State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance#state-farm "#state-farm"), Erie, Country Financial or USAA.
### Which company is the cheapest option for full coverage?
[State Farm](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance#state-farm "#state-farm") is the cheapest widely available option for full coverage auto insurance, at $134 per month. Drivers should also get quotes from Auto-Owners (which has extra coverage options) and from USAA if they’re eligible because of a military connection.
### What does full coverage car insurance cover?
Full coverage pays for damages to your car as well as any damages or injuries you cause to others. The main benefit of full coverage is that it includes [collision and comprehensive coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance#what "#what"), which protects your car. Full coverage also usually includes more liability coverage than your state's minimum requirements, so you'll be protected if you cause an expensive accident.
If your state requires uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage and PIP, these coverages may be included in your full coverage policy. But the definition of full coverage varies by company.
### Do I need full coverage on a financed car?
Yes, lenders require a full coverage policy with collision and comprehensive if you have a [new car loan or lease](https://www.valuepenguin.com/new-car-insurance "New Car Insurance: When You Need It and How to Get It"). Once you pay off your loan, you're free to decide if you still need a full coverage policy.
### Does full coverage car insurance replace your car?
Yes, a full coverage policy's [collision coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance "Collision vs. Comprehensive Car Insurance") will pay for a new car or fix your vehicle, minus your deductible, if you cause an accident. If another driver causes the accident, their liability coverage will pay to repair or replace your car.
Keep in mind that most car insurance only pays out the value of your car after considering its age and mileage. This is usually lower than the price to buy a similar car, so you'll have to pay some of the cost yourself. And if your car isn't worth a lot, it's likely that insurance will consider it totaled after an accident because the cost of repairs could be more than the car is worth.
