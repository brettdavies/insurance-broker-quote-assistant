##  California Casualty car insurance review 
California Casualty car insurance is available to teachers, firefighters, nurses, law enforcement officers and other qualifying public service workers across seven states. In addition to the car insurance basics, drivers can also insure their antique or classic cars, trailers, campers, snowmobiles, motorcycles, RVs, golf carts and road-registered dune buggies. Policies are also somewhat customizable with extra benefits like pet injury coverage, gap insurance, up to $500 in personal property coverage and custom parts coverage. However, not every coverage option is available in every state where California Casualty writes auto policies.
Like the [best car insurance companies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/), California Casualty Insurance offers standard coverage options such as liability, comprehensive, collision, medical payments and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. If you’re interested in additional coverage types, California Casualty offers several options, including some [specific to essential workers](https://www.calcas.com/types-of-coverage1). Law enforcement officers may appreciate turnout gear and firearms coverage, which pays out to cover stolen, damaged or destroyed firefighter and law enforcement gear and/or firearms stored in the vehicle, as well as custom/non-factory equipment coverage to insure any parts and devices that aren’t from the vehicle’s original manufacturer that get damaged or need replacement after a covered loss.
### Pros and cons of California Casualty car insurance

#### California Casualty car insurance quotes by age
In most states, a driver's age influences what they pay for auto insurance with young drivers paying some of the highest average rates. Younger drivers, [especially teens](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/), are more likely to drive recklessly and have less experience behind the wheel. To account for the added risk of insuring a younger driver, many insurance companies charge these drivers higher rates.

### California Casualty customer satisfaction
Reviewing an insurance company’s customer satisfaction ratings can help paint a picture of what your customer experience may be like. This can be done by speaking with existing policyholders or by reviewing third-party ratings from entities like J.D. Power. J.D. Power scores and ranks companies on a scale of 1 to 1,000 based on a variety of attributes, including how easy it is to manage your policy digitally. Unfortunately, California Casualty was not included in the J.D. Power studies we analyzed, likely because it is a smaller carrier than other national companies.
#### California Casualty auto insurance customer complaints
Customer complaints are another way to assess how well a company works with its policyholders. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) tracks customer complaints and uses carriers' market share and number of complaints to calculate complaint indexes by product type. The index has a baseline of 1.00, meaning that companies over 1.00 receive more complaints than expected based on their market share and vice versa. California Casualty’s NAIC complaint index from 2021 to 2023 was [higher than average](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=27464&:refresh), indicating that the company could stand to improve its auto insurance service.

### California Casualty customer satisfaction
California Casualty’s home insurance product was not rated by J.D. Power for property claims satisfaction or customer service. This is likely because those studies focus on companies with larger shares of the market, and California Casualty only caters to public service workers.
#### California Casualty home insurance customer complaints
On the homeowner side, California Casualty has a low market share that may lead to confusing complaint index data. Although its [index was above average](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=27464&:refresh) in 2022 and 2023, the carrier only received a total of two complaints during that time period. Speaking with existing policyholders may give you more insights into California Casualty's service level.

##  Is California Casualty a good insurance company? 
Bankrate’s insurance experts put together this California Casualty Insurance review to help you decide whether this company is right for you. The company’s mission is to protect people who serve the community, which is why California Casualty Insurance tailors its insurance coverage to educators, higher education employees, firefighters, law enforcement officers and nurses. If you are in these professions and want access to its specialized coverage and benefits, California Casualty may be a good fit. However, its customer service is not available 24/7 like some competitors, and its average home insurance rates are significantly higher than the national average. Plus, it does not have a mobile app, which could be an issue for some.
## What are real-life customers saying about California Casualty?
In order to get a pulse on what actual customers think about the company, our team looked at California Casualty reviews from across the web. Like with many other insurance companies, the general consensus around the company was a mix of positive and negative. Many customers appreciated the company’s customer service and low prices. But, some claimed that customer service was slower than they would prefer. Multiple other Trustpilot users were unhappy with steep car insurance rate increases when their policy was renewed.

Solid customer service
I currently have them and the only real complaint I could make is that it can take A LONG time to get to someone on the phone. Other than that, they were cheap, (roughly $60 a month cheaper than all competition in my area) and when I did talk to someone, they were polite, to the point, and they always seem more than willing to help me out when something happens.

Slow claims response
I was with Geico for 15 years. Changed to CC because I am a teacher and my daughter a nurse and recommended by our unions. Two weeks later someone breaks in my daughter’s car. We are currently in the middle of the claim - a month later. I am wildly disappointed. Emails are not returned, questions are not addressed, phone calls not returned. Car is ready but CC is not responding to me or the dealer so we cannot get the car. Dealer says CC is very hard to work with. At this point, I could not recommend this company to anyone.

Our unique Bankrate Scores look at a myriad of factors like average rates, discount availability, corporate sustainability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and other metrics. One of these is third-party scores, which were not available for California Casualty, thus disqualifying the company from earning a Bankrate Score.

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.

Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:

Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
