![Matt Timmons](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_30/employee_photos/Matt_Timmons_VP_V2)
Written by [ Matt Timmons ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/author/matt-timmons "Matt Timmons")
Updated Jul 8, 2025
Car insurance prices are expected to increase an average of 7.5% in 2025.
That's a significant slowdown from the past two years, when car insurance rates rose an average of 16.5% in 2024 and 12.0% in 2023.
The average cost of car insurance nationwide in 2025 is $175 per month for full coverage. Nevada, Florida and Michigan are the most expensive states in the U.S. for car insurance, all with prices exceeding $250 per month.

## How much does car insurance cost in my state?
The average cost of full coverage car insurance for 2025 is $2,101 per year, or about $175 per month.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-space)
  

The most expensive states for [full coverage car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-full-coverage-auto-insurance "The Cheapest and Best Full Coverage Car Insurance") are Nevada ($286 per month), Florida ($272) and Michigan ($263). These three states are all 50% more expensive than the national average rate of $175 per month.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

Car insurance prices vary dramatically by state, with coverage in the most expensive states being at least 2.5 times as much as the cheapest states.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

The three states with the [cheapest car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-car-insurance "The Cheapest Car Insurance Companies") barely crack $100 per month for the same policy. Maine drivers pay an average of just $103 per month, while neighboring New Hampshire and Vermont are tied at $107 per month — all for the same level of coverage.
Those prices are about 40% below the national average.

## Average car insurance rate changes in 2025
Car insurance costs are expected to increase by 7.5% across the US in 2025.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-space)
  

While drivers across the country can expect to pay an average of 7.5% more in 2025, price jumps vary a lot by state.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

New Jersey, Washington and California drivers can expect to see the biggest jumps the next time they renew. New Jersey and Washington have estimated increases of 17.2%, while California residents will see a 16.2% increase, on average.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

Only one state — North Carolina — has an expected rate drop in 2025 (0.1%). That means NC drivers are the most likely to see no change, or even a slight drop, in their insurance rates next year.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that people paid an average of 19% more for [car insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance "/auto-insurance") in 2024 than in 2023, though that also includes increased coverage amounts and higher vehicle replacement costs.

### 2025 rate increases by company
The rate increases drivers will face in 2025 can also differ by company. American Family is set to hike its rates the most among major insurers, with a massive 16.0% increase.
Meanwhile, USAA drivers can expect an average of 2.6% increase over the next year. Geico and Progressive are also raising rates only a small amount in 2025.

## How much does a traffic violation increase car insurance costs?
Drivers with a [traffic violation](https://www.valuepenguin.com/high-risk-auto-insurance "Best Cheap Car Insurance for High-Risk Drivers") or accident could see an average car insurance rate increase of 53% in 2025.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)
  

Drivers in North Carolina are likely to see the highest cost increase after a road incident, with a typical increase of 146%.
![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)

![spacer](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_150/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/gold-spacer)

### Car insurance costs after a ticket, accident or DUI
State | Rate hike | Ticket | Crash | DUI  
---|---|---|---|---  
North Carolina | 146% | $192 | $244 | $591  
California | 108% | $241 | $332 | $477  
Hawaii | 95% | $146 | $172 | $408  
New Jersey | 76% | $250 | $382 | $416  
Connecticut | 72% | $235 | $316 | $451  
Michigan | 68% | $332 | $359 | $631  
Show All Rows
Rate hike is based on the average price among one speeding ticket, at-fault crash or DUI, compared to the price of insurance for a driver with a clean record.
## Cost of car insurance for the most popular new cars
The Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V are the [cheapest new cars to insure](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-and-cheapest-cars-insure "The Cheapest Cars to Insure") in 2025.
The two cars each cost about $244 per month to insure, which is 16% less expensive than average among the most popular 2024 models.
The most expensive car to insure is the Tesla Model Y, at an average of $396 per month.
New cars generally cost more to insure than older models because they're worth more and it's harder to find replacement parts. However, new safety features like blindspot detection can offset that by reducing the chance that drivers get in a crash.
### Cost of car insurance for top-selling cars
Car model | Monthly rate  
---|---  
Toyota RAV4 | $244  
Honda CR-V | $245  
Nissan Rogue | $270  
Honda Civic | $278  
Toyota Camry | $281

### Electric car growth slows, while insurance rates compared to gas cars hold steady
While electric cars continue to grow in popularity, their insurance prices compared to gas cars have stayed steady. The top 10 EVs cost an average of $344 per month to insure — 23% more than the top gas-powered cars, or [the same difference as last year](https://www.valuepenguin.com/state-of-auto-insurance-2024#cars "State of Auto Insurance in 2024").
Electric cars are expected to make up about a quarter of new car sales in 2025, per Cox Automotive.
The biggest new EV of 2024, the Tesla Cybertruck, is also among the most expensive. The average price to insure a new Cybertruck is $422 per month. That's the second-most expensive EV, behind only the Rivian R1S ($432 per month).
[Teslas are typically very expensive to insure](https://www.valuepenguin.com/tesla-car-insurance "The cost to insure a Tesla EV").
In general, electric cars made by legacy manufacturers like Ford and Volkswagen tend to be about 25% less expensive than those made by EV-only companies. This may be because replacement parts from these brands are easier to find, in addition to lower vehicle prices.
### Cost of car insurance for popular EVs
EV model | Monthly rate  
---|---  
Volkswagen ID.4 | $240  
Ford F-150 Lightning | $283  
Hyundai Ioniq 5 | $316  
Ford Mustang Mach-E | $316  
Cadillac LYRIQ | $348

## 2025 car insurance trends
![state of auto insurance 2024](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_250,dpr_1.0,q_auto/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/woman-binoculars-2)
Inflation is down...
Inflation has fallen to just over 3% for the last half of 2024. A major driver of car insurance price hikes over the last three years was the cost of repairs, so falling inflation means insurance price increases may continue to slow.
Financing options are also improving, bringing down the overall cost of insuring a new car in 2025.
But tariffs may increase rates.
However, if President-elect Donald Trump goes forward with his plan to impose tariffs on imported goods, insurance rates may increase again.
About 60% of replacement car parts are imported from other countries. Higher parts costs mean higher repair prices, which would likely result in higher premiums.
Trump has posted on social media that he intends to cut car insurance rates, but there's not much he can do to directly influence prices. Insurance companies set rates in tandem with individual states, without input from the federal government.
## How can I save money on auto insurance in 2025?
While the impact of inflation and regulation changes on car insurance in 2025 may be uncertain, how to save is not.
### SHOP AROUND
![car](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_155/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/magnifying-glass)
The most important thing any driver can do to save money on their car insurance is to compare prices from multiple companies — at least five insurers, or more if you have a recent incident. That could [save drivers more than $100 each month](https://www.valuepenguin.com/shopping-auto-insurance-study "How Much Does Shopping Around Save You on Insurance?").
### IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE
![auto-refi](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_145/auto-insurance/2024-data-update/adjust-credit-art)
Insurers in almost  every state use your credit score to set car insurance rates. A driver with good credit can bring their rates down from $341 to $175 per month compared to one with bad credit.
So paying your credit card on time and consolidating your debts will help you save each month on car insurance.
### LOOK FOR DISCOUNTS
![car](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_155/auto-insurance/2024-graphic/money-plant)
Insurance companies give you discounts for taking actions that make you less risky to insure.
Drivers in some states can also take a safe driving course to drop your rates, no matter which insurance company you have or whether you've recently gotten a ticket. For example, all drivers in New York can take an online course to save 10% on their insurance for three years.
Another effective discount is to [bundle your home and auto insurance](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-home-car-insurance-bundle "/best-home-car-insurance-bundle"). That can save you between 11 and 24% among top insurers.
