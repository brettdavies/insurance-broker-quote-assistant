Who can connect me with a CICA contract?  
  
My FMO doesn't have one.  
  
Also who is the most telesales friendly? I.E. text message signatures.  
  
I already have Trans, AmAm, CVS, GTL, Americo that I know are easier to work with.  
  
MOO, AIG, Royal Neighbors as far as I can remember not so easy to do over the phone.

Last I heard CICA wasn't taking new agents.   
  
That might have changed?  
  
They are anything but telesales friendly.   
  
Their rules and requirements for making the sale by phone is very cumbersome.

Jd, things have changed. We created the Senior Choice product 20 months ago and have growing pains like everyone else. We finished 2024 with just over 21 million in annual premium. True SS billing will be here at the end of March. Allegiant Wealth Group does not contract agents directly, but we can refer agents to a good upline that will release, let you keep comp, and be fair based on production. We limit who we do business with to try and keep the product priced well.  
  
You can now upload recording at the end of the app process right in the portal. We are also adding text and email signatures.
