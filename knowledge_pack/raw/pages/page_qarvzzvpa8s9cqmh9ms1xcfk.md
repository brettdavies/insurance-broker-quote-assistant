Between 2014 and 2023, damage from flooding in the U.S. has cost an average of $46 billion a year to repair, according to the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-09/59971-flood-damage.pdf). With the growing impact of climate change, that amount is projected to increase by at least a quarter in the next 25 years.
A standard [home insurance policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/) won’t cover floods — to protect your home and belongings, you’ll need[ a ](https://www.cnbc.com/select/flood-insurance-cost/)standalone[ flood insurance policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/flood-insurance-cost/). Yet close to a quarter of homeowners (22%) who live in a flood zone [don’t have coverage](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-flood-insurance).
  * **Read:**[**What does** **(and doesn’t) homeowners insurance cover?**](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/)


Flood policies are available from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as well as from private insurance companies. While NFIP policies are available to anyone in a participating community, they have lower coverage limits, little customization and no coverage for additional living expenses. Private insurers typically offer more competitive rates, higher coverage limits and fewer exclusions.  
  
Below, [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/) has selected the best flood insurance companies, based on rates, coverage, customer service and more. **To learn how we made our selections, see**[**our methodology**](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/#hd7R3qY7xU)**.**

**Standout benefits:** Chubb automatically covers basement items and offers high limits for valuables. Policyholders can get up to $5,000 to flood-proof their homes or move belongings if a flood warning is issued.
##  Does homeowners insurance cover flooding? 
Damage from water that originates inside your home, like from a [burst pipe](https://www.cnbc.com/select/does-insurance-cover-burst-pipes/), is typically covered by homeowners insurance.
When the source is from outside the house, it’s more complicated: Water coming into your home from the top down — like a steady drip caused by rain — may be covered. But if that same rain causes a storm surge that fills your basement with two feet of water, you’d need [flood insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-flood-insurance/) or have flooding added as a named peril in a rider to be covered.
NFIP vs. private flood insurance
Flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is underwritten by FEMA to allow homeowners who might otherwise be rejected to get a policy. While NFIP plans are sold by a variety of private insurers, like [Amica](https://secure.money.com/pr/j76810949750), [Farmers](https://secure.money.com/pr/w111bf99698d) and [Nationwide](https://secure.money.com/pr/t1970a747e53), the rates are set nationally.
NFIP policies cap dwelling coverage at $250,000 and personal property coverage at $100,000. They don’t cover personal belongings in a basement or outside structures — like decks, fences, swimming pools or septic systems — and they don’t reimburse for living expenses if you need to relocate while your home is repaired.
Because it’s not tied to FEMA, private flood insurance has higher coverage limits, typically at least $500,000 for dwelling coverage. [Chubb](https://secure.money.com/pr/xe87fb35d81b)’s flood policies go as high as $15 million for combined dwelling and contents.
Private plans also offer more comprehensive protections, including coverage for personal property, basements, pools and external structures. They typically cover hotel rooms, food and other expenses if you need to relocate, and are more likely to cover the cost of removing debris caused by flooding.   
  
Because they’re not government-backed, however, private companies can decline to cover a high-risk property.
##  How much does flood insurance cost?
The average NFIP flood insurance costs about $786 a year, [according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/work-with-nfip/risk-rating/single-family-home). The cost of private flood insurance varies greatly, however, and can be more or less than an NFIP policy.  
  
In either case, your premiums depend on the location and flooding risk of your home, the building materials and the number of floors, as well as the type of policy and the deductible amount you select.
##  Do I need flood insurance?
Mortgage lenders often require homebuyers to take out flood insurance if they live near a FEMA-designated floodplain. Usually, the policy only needs to cover the building, though you can add coverage for your personal belongings.
Even if it’s not required, flood insurance can be a wise investment: Some 90% of natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding, according to NFIP data, and over 40% of claims come from areas that aren’t designated high-risk flood zones.
## Flood insurance FAQs
### Does homeowners insurance cover floods?
While a homeowners policy typically covers water damage [from burst pipes](https://www.cnbc.com/select/does-insurance-cover-burst-pipes/), it won’t cover flood damage. You’ll need to purchase a separate flood insurance policy, through either the NFIP or a private flood insurance carrier. 
### How much does flood insurance cost?
NFIP flood insurance policies average about $786 per year, although rates vary greatly by state and property.
### Can renters get flood insurance?
Renters can buy an NFIP policy to cover contents up to $100,000. If you rent in a low-to-moderate risk area, you may be eligible for a Preferred Risk Policy, which has the lowest rates offered by the program. According to FEMA, a quarter of NFIP flood claims occur in low-to-moderate risk areas.
### Who underwrites flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program?
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) underwrites NFIP policies.
### What if I can’t get covered for flood insurance?
Not everyone is eligible for private flood insurance. NFIP flood insurance, however, is available to any homeowner, renter or business owner who lives in a community that follows FEMA guidelines for reducing flood risk.
