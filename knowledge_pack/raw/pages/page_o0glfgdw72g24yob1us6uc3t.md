## Key Takeaways
  * Texas law only requires drivers to have liability insurance, but many insurance companies offer additional coverage options that are worth considering.
  * In Texas, men usually face higher auto insurance rates than women due to higher rates of fatalities and DUIs.
  * Married couples generally pay less for insurance than single individuals, even if they’re widowed.


## **Is Car Insurance Required In Texas?**
Yes, car insurance is required in Texas. State law mandates that all drivers carry a minimum amount of liability insurance to cover damages or injuries they may cause in an accident. Drivers must also provide proof of insurance when requested by law enforcement or when registering their vehicle. Failing to maintain insurance can result in fines, license suspension, or other penalties.
## **What Are The Minimum Car Insurance Requirements In Texas?**
In Texas, the minimum car insurance requirement is 30/60/25. This means drivers must have: $30,000 in coverage for injury or death to one person. $60,000 in coverage for injury or death to multiple people in an accident, and $25,000 in coverage for property damage.
These are the minimum liability limits, and drivers are encouraged to consider higher coverage for better protection.
## Is Minimum Coverage Enough?
While Texas’ minimum car insurance coverage meets legal requirements, it may not offer enough protection in a serious accident. The $30,000 for one person’s injuries, $60,000 for multiple injuries, and $25,000 for property damage could be used up quickly in a severe crash.
If your costs go over these amounts, you may have to pay the difference yourself. To better protect yourself, it’s a good idea to consider higher coverage or add extra options like collision or uninsured motorist coverage.
## **Average Cost Of Car Insurance In Texas**
[Car insurance costs in Texas](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/cost-of-car-insurance-texas) can differ based on factors like age and gender. Generally, young drivers pay significantly more than older drivers for both minimum and full coverage.
Male drivers in their 50s tend to get the lowest rates, while female drivers usually see the best rates in their 40s.
Age | Male | Female

## **Texas Car Insurance Laws**
Texas has specific car insurance requirements that differ from some other states, especially those like Florida or New Jersey. Unlike states such as New Hampshire and Virginia, which do not require auto insurance at all, Texas mandates that all drivers carry a minimum level of liability insurance. This insurance helps cover damages or injuries you cause to others in an accident.
Minimum coverage ensures that if you’re at fault in an accident, there’s coverage for the other person’s injuries and the damage to their vehicle or property. However, Texas law does not require you to carry coverage for your own injuries or vehicle damage (unless you opt for additional coverage, like [collision or comprehensive insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-car-insurance-vs-collision-insurance)).
Additionally, Texas uses a fault-based system. This means that the driver at fault is financially responsible for the damages. Texas drivers can be sued if their negligence caused an accident. [Car insurance companies in Texas](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/best-cheap-car-insurance-texas) conduct their own investigations to determine fault in accidents.
**Important** : If you are caught without insurance in Texas, your first offense will be a fine of $175, second will be $400.

### Proof Of Insurance
In Texas, you must have proof of car insurance with you whenever you’re driving, either in digital form on your phone or as a physical card. If you’re pulled over by law enforcement or involved in an accident and can’t show proof of insurance, you could face penalties, including fines, having your vehicle towed, or even having your driver’s license suspended.
It’s important to keep your proof of insurance up to date and accessible at all times to avoid legal trouble and ensure you’re following the law. Many insurance companies now offer digital proof through apps, which makes it easier for drivers to stay compliant on the go.
### Registration Information
In Texas, you must have car insurance to register your vehicle, whether you’re registering it for the first time or renewing the registration.
To register your vehicle in Texas:
  1. Get your vehicle inspected: Take your car and proof of insurance to a certified inspection station to have it inspected.
  2. Go to your county tax office: Visit your local county tax assessor’s office with your insurance card, inspection certificate, and proof of ownership.
  3. Pay the registration fee: The registration fee is usually at least $50, but it may vary depending on your county.


### Uninsured Drivers In Texas
In Texas, the [uninsured motorist rate](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/uninsured-motorists-statistics) is higher than the national average, with estimates around 14% of drivers on the road lacking insurance. One of the main reasons for this is the rising [cost of car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance), which can be especially expensive for high-risk drivers or those in accident-prone areas.
Texas follows a fault-based system, meaning the driver responsible for an accident is financially liable for damages. This system can lead to higher insurance premiums as companies account for the risk of being sued for damages. Additionally, drivers who can’t afford insurance may choose to drive without it, increasing the uninsured rate.
## Is Car Insurance Required In Texas If You Don’t Own A Vehicle?
In Texas, even if you don’t own a car, you still need car insurance if you drive. While you don’t need insurance for a vehicle you don’t own, you can get [non-owner car insurance](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/non-owner-car-insurance). This type of coverage protects you if you’re driving someone else’s car and are at fault in an accident. It covers the damage or injuries you cause to others but doesn’t cover any damage to the car you’re driving.
[Non-owner insurance in Texas](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/non-owner-car-insurance-texas) is a good choice if you often drive rental cars or borrow other people’s vehicles. It also helps you avoid gaps in your coverage, which can be important if you plan to buy your own car later. Without insurance, you could face fines or a suspended license, even if you don’t own a car.

## Legal Penalties For Driving Without Insurance
Texas treats driving without insurance very seriously. If you’re caught driving without coverage, your driver’s license will be suspended, and you’ll have to pay a fee to reinstate it.
| First offense | Second offense | Third offense  
---|---|---|---  
Reinstatement Fee | $175 | $380 | $450  
Both your license and vehicle registration can be suspended for up to three years. However, this penalty applies if you commit three offenses within a three-year period.
## Other Types Of Optional Coverage
In Texas, while basic car insurance is required, there are several optional coverages you can add to your policy for extra protection. These coverages aren’t mandatory, but they can help you avoid costly expenses in the event of an accident or other incidents.
  1. **Collision Coverage:** This helps pay for repairs to your car if you’re in an accident, no matter who is at fault. It’s useful if your car gets damaged and you want to avoid paying for repairs yourself.
  2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** This covers damage to your car caused by things other than a collision, like theft, vandalism, storms, or fire.
  3. **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** If you’re hit by a driver who doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough to cover your costs, this coverage helps pay for medical bills, car repairs, and other expenses.
  4. **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** PIP covers medical costs, lost wages, and other expenses if you’re injured in an accident, regardless of who caused it. It’s not required in Texas, but it’s helpful if you don’t have health insurance.
