## FAQ: Homeowners Insurance in Florida
### Why is homeowners insurance so expensive in Florida?
[Homeowners insurance is expensive in Florida](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/cheap-homeowners-insurance-florida/) due to increasing natural disasters, rising construction costs, legal system abuse and high reinsurance expenses. Frequent hurricanes and severe storms increase the risk of major property damage, driving up insurance costs. Higher prices for construction materials and labor, along with legal challenges and fraud, increase insurers' operating expenses. The cost of reinsurance for Florida insurers has more than doubled, and insurers pass these costs on to homeowners in higher premiums.
### Is hurricane coverage included in Florida homeowners insurance?
Hurricanes, a common natural disaster in Florida, are covered by homeowners insurance. Consider purchasing policies for [other natural disasters](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-natural-disasters/#when-natural-disasters-are-covered) for financial protection. Hurricanes (as designated by the National Hurricane Center) trigger a separate deductible in your policy from your standard home deductible in Florida. All Florida home insurers must offer hurricane deductible options of $500, 2%, 5% or 10% of the policy dwelling or structure limits.
### Is flood insurance included in Florida homeowners insurance?
All areas of Florida are prone to flooding year-round, not just during hurricane season. Coastal homes are at the highest risk for flood and may be required to purchase flood insurance. Flood insurance is not typically included in a standard home policy, but it can be purchased through the National Flood Insurance Program, a private flood insurer or through a standard home insurer if they offer it as an endorsement.
### Is there currently an insurance crisis in Florida?
There is an ongoing [property insurance crisis in Florida](https://www.iii.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/triple-i_trends_and_insights_florida_pc_02152023.pdf) due to legal system abuse and claim fraud. Seven residential insurers went insolvent between February 2022 and 2023. Legislative actions have since improved the market, and seven new insurers are entering the market in 2024. The state has successfully depopulated Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-backed insurer of last resort, with tens of thousands of policies taken over by private insurers.
### Is homeowners insurance required in Florida?
No, [homeowners insurance is not required in Florida](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/homeowners/best-homeowners-insurance-florida/). However, if you’re working with a mortgage lender, your lender may require insurance to protect their financial investment.
