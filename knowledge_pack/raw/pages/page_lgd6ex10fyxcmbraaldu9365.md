#  How are insurance brokers paid? 
How are insurance brokers paid? When my homeowners insurance renewal comes in with a 40% increase do they make more money as well? Given my car and home rates have increased 20-55% each of the past two years I'm curious.

Yes, they get a % of your premium and renewals. It’s based on the agreement they have with the carrier. The broker doesn’t have anything to do with your rates, though. Using an agent or broker to get insurance doesn’t cost more, either.

Having a broker or agent does in fact effect premium.

If you get a quote from a broker and a quote direct from the same company, as long as you’re inputting the same information, the quote should be the same. It doesn’t cost you more to use an agent or broker vs. going direct. 
A quote from an agent or broker may be different because they’re inputting the information correctly, but it’s not because of their commission.

Brokers make a commission on your premiums from the carrier that will depend on the coverage and if the business is new or renewal. Their pay follows your rates, so it goes up when carriers push rate and you grow your exposures, it shrinks when you reduce your exposures or policy premium. 
Carriers also pay brokers “[contingent commissions](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=insurance+contingent+commissions&cId=1057d1c2-18d7-4970-bb8a-491cb9ff11b6&iId=75934a45-355b-4776-abbc-ddd90d38f9bb)” if their portfolio of policies perform favorably in terms of growth or losses, basically giving them an extra bonus.

We get a percent of your premium cost as when we sell it, and a percentage each time it renews. 
So if your premium is 2000, we might make 200 when we sell it and 200 when it renews. Or 300 when we sell it and 100 when it renews. The splits vary by company on new/renewal, and they can even vary by agent depending on how much they sell for a given carrier or how they do at dialing in on carrier appetite. 
The first time sale premium is probably low for the acquisition cost of the policy, if I'm being honest on the cost and return on time for revenue. The renewal is more likely to be on target if you don't call every week asking what we can do about your rate. 
The renewal payments ensure that someone is there to answer the phone when you call with questions because questions after that first sale don't generate any additional revenue. We just have to do the service if that's part of the expectation. Local agents are important to local relationships. 
We don't have anything to do with setting your rates, and unless you're going with someone who has separately filed rates for agents vs. the 1-800 number, like Progressive, you won't see any difference for buying through the carrier vs. an agent. And what's more, some of them won't even let you buy direct. They require you to use an agent. People who don't know what they are doing buying insurance and don't have an agent holding their hand are REALLY expensive insurance clients to service, as it turns out. 
So yes, our revenue goes up if your rates go up, but not by as much as you think. That same 2000 policy, when it goes up by 20%, is going up to 2400 for you, and our revenue only goes up by $40. Across 1000 policies, that can turn into real dollars, but that's also 1000 policies worth of phone calls and rate reviews that we have to figure out how to service, so it balances out for the demands those kinds of increases put on the agency.

If you are an independent broker or agent can you answer me a question? I know from what I've been told if I go through state farm I should get the same quote and price. If I go through and independent and I have identical coverage for something sold though independents can I get different quotes? I know my brother sells whole life and he can vary quotes quite a bit. Didn't know if property was the same.

If you go independent we'll quote you with the carriers that we can write with. State Farm is only State Farm they can only quote SF and we can not quote SF(Same with USAA and until recently Geico). 
Every carrier is going to have different rating factors and different contract language. Some carriers will not write some things that others will, for instance in my state Travelers won't write some model year Kia/Hyundai's.

Also please know that agencies have been working a lot harder to re-quote and answer questions from clients trying to ensure their policies are up to date. 
So while yes, they may make more commission on rate increases, it is not easy money because many agents are losing clients when more people are re-quoting more often.

And this is _especially_ important now for property owners. 
The cost to rebuild your house in 2019 is _not_ the same as it would be today - by perhaps double. 
If you haven't checked your insured value, you may be in for a world of hurt if you have a fire or natural disaster and find you only have enough insurance for 50% of the cost to rebuild.

While yes the increase has seen agents gain more renewal commissions there has been a general decline in commission percentages over time. My Moms been an agent since the late 80s and if I were to strike out on my own I’d never find as good of a contract. More and more companies are also going without agents or brokers so they get to pocket what would’ve went to them as profit.

As others have said, we don't control the rates and we can't give you a discount for renewing. The carrier can, but most don't. There are discounts for things like multi car, multi driver, good grades, military veteran, things like that. But if the carrier doesn't offer it, we can't give it to you. We can't just type over the rate the carrier is showing us and put in a lower number.

I meant it more like the cell phone discount in the way that coverage is the same and the price is different and cheaper at another place why should I stay? Cell phones I go to renew and its nothing at t mobile and Verizon has a free iPhone for the same price I'm leaving. Internet is the same way. I'm probably going to switch to fiber in 2 years when my contract is up and 2 years after that I expect to be back to cable. 
I know you guys can't do discounts. Trust me I don't want to switch every year either.

Yes, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it costs you more and the same applies to their inability to directly influence how much your premiums rise

We do, we get a percent of the premium as residual.

Insurance brokers are typically paid through commissions by the insurance companies whose policies they sell. Here’s how it works: 1. Commission-Based Payment: Brokers earn a percentage of the premium as their commission. This percentage can vary by insurer and type of policy but often ranges between 10% and 20% of the annual premium for personal lines like homeowners or auto insurance. 2. Renewals: Brokers usually earn commissions not only on the initial policy sale but also on renewals. If your premiums increase, their commission may increase proportionally, as it is calculated based on the total premium amount. 3. Fee-Based Models: In some cases, brokers may charge a flat fee or a service fee instead of, or in addition to, earning a commission. This is less common for personal insurance policies and more typical in commercial insurance or specialized situations. 
If your homeowners or auto insurance premium increases, the broker’s commission will increase as well, assuming the percentage remains the same. For example, if your homeowners premium increases from $2,000 to $2,800 and the broker’s commission is 15%, their earnings would rise from $300 to $420 annually. 
The sharp increases in rates you’ve experienced over the past two years are likely driven by broader market conditions rather than the broker’s influence. These can include: • Rising costs of claims (e.g., from inflation, labor, materials, or climate-related damages). • Adjustments for risk due to regional factors. • Insurers tightening underwriting due to higher loss ratios. 
While brokers benefit from higher premiums via increased commissions, their primary role is to find you the best coverage and rates available. If you’re unhappy with your rates, you could ask your broker to shop around with other insurers or review your coverage for cost-saving opportunities. You may also want to ask if switching insurers or bundling policies could help mitigate rising costs.

If you work directly with the insurance company they will not advise you what and why to buy . If you work with an agent or broker that does not educate you find a different source. Please remember that the insurance product is like buying a fire extinguisher. Hope you never need it but if you do have a catastrophic event and reach for the extinguisher- you will very much hope that it saves you from financial ruin. Please don’t just buy cheapest you can find .

That doesn't even make any sense of course it jacks up the price! They have an office of people working there and pay them including pensions or 401 K's. It's expensive where my broker is for office space!
