At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

### Cost of homeowners insurance by dwelling coverage amount
Your home insurance [**dwelling coverage**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/dwelling-insurance/) is what pays to repair or rebuild your home if a covered peril damages or destroys it.
Many homeowners mistake the purchase price they paid for the house as an appropriate dwelling coverage amount, but the cost of rebuilding your home may be more or less than the purchase price, depending on the cost of building supplies and labor, as well as timing.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/new-york/#cite-2)
It’s important to make sure you have the right level of coverage. The more dwelling coverage you select, the higher your home insurance premiums will be. Rates shown below are for a policy with a $1,000 deductible.

### Cost of homeowners insurance by deductible
Your [**home insurance deductible**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/home-insurance-deductible/) is the money you need to pay before your insurance coverage kicks in to pay for your claim. A lower deductible allows you to pay less out of pocket when you make a claim before the insurance coverage starts, but you’ll pay a higher premium to get the lower deductible.
Many homeowners choose to increase their deductible to lower their premium costs, even though it means you’ll have to pay more money out of pocket when you make a claim.

## How much homeowners insurance do you need in New York?
Unlike auto insurance, the state of New York doesn’t require homeowners to purchase home insurance. But your mortgage lender will require you to purchase a homeowners insurance policy as a condition of the loan.
New York homeowners should aim to get enough replacement cost coverage to rebuild their homes in case of a disaster. Make sure you understand exactly [**what your homeowners insurance policy covers**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) when you buy it, so you know you have coverage for everything you need.
For example, flooding is common in New York, but standard homeowners insurance policies don’t cover it. You’ll need to purchase a separate policy to protect yourself from flood damage.
### What are some of the biggest risks when owning a home in New York? 
Homes everywhere in the world can face potential damage from storms, floods, or other perils, but it’s a good idea for New York homeowners to understand the most common risks in their state so they can insure against them.
The Empire State is most likely to experience these types of natural disasters:

#### Storm surge/hurricane winds
The Insurance Information Institute reports that New York City is the country’s metropolitan area most at risk for storm surge and hurricane wind damage.[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/new-york/#cite-3) Even though direct landfall by hurricanes and tropical storms is relatively uncommon in New York state, these storms can cause substantial damage. The impact from 10 major hurricanes over the past 50 years has cost the affected New York communities nearly $11 billion, according to the [**New York State Climate Hazards Profile**](https://archplan.buffalo.edu/content/dam/ap/PDFs/NYSERDA/New-York-State-Climate-Hazards-Profile.pdf).

#### Flooding
Flooding occurs regularly across the state, and all 62 counties in New York see flooding events at least once every seven years. The [**National Flood Insurance Program**](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) (NFIP) provides flood insurance to property owners and renters in any of the 23,000 participating NFIP communities, and more than 1,300 of these communities are in New York. You can also purchase flood insurance from dozens of private flood insurance companies that offer coverage in New York.

#### Winter storms
Though some counties are more prone to winter storms than others, New York homeowners across the state may experience things like collapsed roofs from excessive snow loads, power outages, and damage to overburdened heating systems when Old Man Winter comes to call. The good news is that standard homeowners insurance does cover damage due to winter weather.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000


Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.
