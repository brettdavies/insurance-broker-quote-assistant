# What parents need to know about car insurance for teens
## Adding a teen driver to your car insurance can double your premiums. Here’s how to save.
Updated Wed, Jul 30 2025

Your child turning 16 is a big milestone. But while you’ve spent time researching the safest cars and how to help them pass their driver’s test, you’ll also need to update your [car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-companies/).
Because they’re newer drivers and statistically more likely to be in accidents, [teenage drivers](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-young-adults/) are the single most expensive demographic to insure.
Adding a teen to a family policy with two adults can cause premiums to shoot up 150%, according to the Insurance Information Institute. A teen with their own policy can expect to pay double or even triple what their share would be on a family policy.
Thankfully, there are still some ways to [save on auto insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ways-to-lower-your-car-insurance/) with a young driver in the family.
## 7 ways to save on car insurance for teens
  1. [Keep them on your policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#zTjP0xvUhL)
  2. [Shop around for car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#AVc6RPeFdn)
  3. [Bundle your car and property insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#Ch7ATKdrJv)
  4. [Keep an eye on their grades](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#r0BmyKHTLh)
  5. [Monitor their driving](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#JluYSjMp27)
  6. [Give them an old car](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#5pV2mkCeFl)
  7. [Buy an umbrella policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/car-insurance-teens-what-to-know/#_MK6fTnqoc)


##  1. Add them to your policy
Having a teen driver on their own insurance policy is significantly more expensive than adding them to yours.
[According to Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/18-year-old/), the average premium for an 18-year-old (the youngest age you can get a policy) is nearly $7,000 a year for a young woman and slightly more than $7,600 for a young man[.](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/18-year-old/)
In comparison, a policy with two adult drivers and an 18-year-old girl averages just over $5,500. With an 18-year-old boy on your policy, the average is just under $6,000.
##  2. Shop around for better rates
Once you add a teen, the policy you’ve had for years might not be the cheapest anymore. Insurers consider risk differently, so one may charge more for a young driver than another.
With affordable rates and generous student discounts, [Travelers](https://secure.money.com/pr/b68b79b41b79) and [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163) are two of our [top picks for teen car insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-car-insurance-young-adults/).

##  4. Keep an eye on their grades
Your child’s good grades can pay off with lower car insurance premiums: Providers like [Geico](https://secure.money.com/pr/zc1d02986163), [Auto-Owners](https://secure.money.com/pr/t486eb6aebcb) and [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625) have generous good-student discounts for high school or college students with a B average or better. At up to 25%, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d)’s is the biggest we’ve seen.
### [State Farm Auto Insurance](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d)

There are other ways to save, too: Many insurance companies offer discounts for young drivers who complete an approved defensive driving course or leave their car behind when they go off to college.
If your child has joined a fraternity, sorority, or honor society, they may qualify for an affiliation discount, and students in the armed forces are eligible for military discounts. A number of colleges and alumni associations negotiate their own discounts, as well.
##  5. Monitor their driving
[Telematics programs](https://www.cnbc.com/select/safe-driving-discounts-how-do-they-work/) give feedback on driver performance and habits and can even pinpoint your car’s location.

**Read our**[**State Farm Auto Insurance review**](https://www.cnbc.com/select/state-farm-auto-insurance-review/)
[State Farm’s Steer Clear program](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) is designed for drivers under 25 with no at-fault accidents or moving violations in the past three years. In addition to completing lessons, watching videos and taking quizzes, participants clock five hours on the road to receive an in-app certificate of completion and a discount of up to 15%.   
  
The company’s Drive Safe and Save program, another telematics-based offering, collects driving data on acceleration, braking and cornering to help drivers earn a discount of up to 30%.
##  6. Give them an older car
Because they’re worth more and their parts and technology are more expensive to repair or replace, new cars cost more to insure. Used cars have a lower resale value and parts that are cheaper to replace, so they’re usually cheaper to insure.   
  
If you own the car outright and it’s not worth [ten times your annual premiums,](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) you might even consider dropping collision and comprehensive insurance and just keeping[ a liability policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/cheapest-liability-only-car-insurance/), which can be a third of the cost of [full coverage](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance/).  
  
Don’t give them a clunker, though: Many top insurers have discounts for anti-lock brakes, anti-theft devices and passive restraints.
##  7. Buy an umbrella policy
Nobody wants to think about it, but without years of experience behind the wheel, a teen is more likely to cause a serious accident. If the damages or injuries are beyond your liability limits, you could be on the hook for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[Umbrella insurance](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-umbrella-insurance/) provides additional coverage and is relatively affordable: $1 million of umbrella insurance runs just $150 to $300 per year. [American Family](https://www.amfam.com/insurance/umbrella/personal) offers a bundling discount of up to 26% when combining home, auto and umbrella insurance.

## Car insurance FAQs
### What is the cheapest car insurance for a teen driver?
We found that [Travelers](https://secure.money.com/pr/b68b79b41b79) is the cheapest car insurance company for teen drivers. Prices vary by gender, age, location, make, model and other factors, so get several quotes and compare them to find the best price.
### Do I have to put my teenager on my car insurance?
All licensed drivers in a household should be listed on the primary policy to ensure sufficient coverage. If your child is of driving age and lives with you but doesn’t have a driver’s license, your insurance company may require you to list them as an excluded driver and they won’t be covered by your policy.
### At what age do car insurance rates go down?
Car insurance rates fall as drivers get more experience behind the wheel. Premiums are the highest for 16 to 18-year-olds and tend to decline at 21 and 25. The rates you pay will also be affected by other factors, like their driving record, grades and whether they still live at home.
