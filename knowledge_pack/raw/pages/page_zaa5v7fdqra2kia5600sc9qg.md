# The 15-Year Roof Rule in Florida: Can You Lose Insurance Over It?
  * [ August 19, 2025 ](https://solariasolarandroofing.com/2025/08/19/)
  * 4:29 pm


Is your Florida home insurance policy at risk? If your roof is over 15 years old, it very well could be – even if it’s perfectly sound and not leaking. This growing concern stems from Florida Statute 627.7011(5), which allows insurers to require an inspection for roofs aged 15 years or older. If that inspection reveals less than five years of useful life remaining, your policy could be dropped or denied – all based on the roof’s age, not just visible damage. This process is now widely known as the 15-year roof rule in Florida.
Why the sudden shift? Insurers are tightening requirements due to escalating hurricane risks and the high cost of roof claims across the state. Understanding this critical change is vital for every Florida homeowner.
In this blog, we’ll expose what this age-based insurance practice truly means for you, how it’s impacting homeowners statewide, and, most importantly, the proactive approach you can take to protect your coverage. Discover how a professional roof inspection, certification (proving at least 5 years of useful life), or a timely upgrade can secure your home insurance policy before it’s too late.

![15-Year Roof Rule In Florida](https://solariasolarandroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/33dd8c59-a4fd-4f2e-8b5b-258ebdfef193.jpeg)
Florida’s 15-year roof rule isn’t technically a building code—it’s an insurance guideline that gives carriers more power to evaluate your roof’s condition once it reaches a certain age. [Florida Statute 627.7011(5)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.7011.html) clearly states that insurers cannot deny or non-renew a policy solely due to the age of the roof if the roof is under 15 years old. 
Once the roof reaches 15 years, however, insurers may require an inspection by a licensed professional, at the homeowner’s expense. If the inspector determines your roof has less than five years of useful life left, your homeowners insurance policy may be denied or non-renewed, regardless of visible damage.
Florida’s insurance industry has been under extreme pressure. Hurricanes, roof-related lawsuits, and inflated claims have caused many insurers to raise rates or exit the market entirely. In response, legislation now allows insurers to make decisions based on roof age and inspection results—not just current condition or code compliance.
For asphalt shingle roofs, 15 years is the key threshold. After that point, insurers may:
  1. Require an inspection from an authorized inspector
  2. Cancel or refuse renewal if the roof fails inspection
  3. Shift your policy from Replacement Cost Value (RCV) to Actual Cash Value (ACV)
  4. Raise premiums or apply separate roof deductibles


This creates major pressure for homeowners to either prove their older roof is sound—or replace it preemptively.
While asphalt shingles are the most scrutinized, roofing materials like tile or metal often have longer lifespans. Some insurers may adjust their requirements based on material type, but others apply blanket age-based rules regardless of durability.
Even if your roofing project complies with Florida building codes, insurers may still consider it a financial risk. Here’s how they differ:
Category | Building Code (FBC) | Insurance Risk Models  
---|---|---  
Purpose | Public safety & structural standards | Financial risk management for insurers  
Focus | How roofs are built & maintained | Likelihood of future claims (age, material, location)  
Enforced by | Local building departments | Private insurance companies  
Example | Requires permits, inspections for roof replacement | May deny coverage for a structurally sound 15-year-old roof  
Understanding both helps you avoid confusion—and protect your insurance coverage.
Additionally, [**Florida’s 25% Roof Replacement Rule**](https://solariasolarandroofing.com/what-is-the-25-roof-replacement-rule-in-florida/)—separate from insurance—was updated in 2022. It now allows partial repairs on compliant roofs over 15 years old, instead of requiring full replacement. This highlights the key difference between building code compliance and insurance underwriting.
Florida’s 15-year roof rule has become a key factor in whether insurers will continue to offer or renew homeowners insurance. It’s not just about safety—it’s about financial risk. Insurance companies view older roofs—especially those 15 years or older—as more likely to fail under pressure from Florida’s harsh storm season.
As roofing materials age, they lose resistance to wind, water, and hail. A roof that’s been exposed to heat, humidity, and severe weather over time is more brittle and more likely to fail. Insurers track this risk using data showing that roof damage claims rise sharply after the 15-year mark. That’s why your roof’s surface, even if it looks fine, could still lead to higher premiums or dropped coverage.
Under Florida law (Statute 627.7011(5)), insurers can’t deny coverage solely based on age—if the roof is under 15 years old. After that, though, insurers can:
  * Require a roof inspection by an authorized professional
  * Switch your coverage to Actual Cash Value (ACV)
  * Impose higher deductibles or premiums
  * Refuse to renew if the roof is found to have less than five years of useful life


Even metal roofs, though long-lasting, aren’t always exempt. Internal underwriting criteria often override the material’s durability if it’s beyond 15 years old. Understanding how your roof qualifies under the 15-year roof rule in Florida can help you plan ahead and avoid sudden cancellations.
Yes—you absolutely can. Many Florida homeowners have already faced non-renewal notices due to the 15-year roof rule in Florida. Even if your roof isn’t leaking, insurers may still drop your policy based on its age or inspection results.
Insurers have legal backing to deny renewal if a certified inspection finds your roof deck has less than five years left. Some carriers apply stricter rules, offering only limited coverage unless you replace the roof to stay compliant with the 15-year roof rule in Florida. Others downgrade your policy to ACV, which covers less than replacement cost and may not pay for full roof replacement after storm damage.
Many homeowners report losing coverage after buying a home with an older roof, only to learn it didn’t meet the insurer’s guidelines. Others have had to replace a roof that still seemed structurally sound—just to keep their policy. These cases are common in hurricane-prone areas like Central Florida and along the coast.
Always check your renewal documents. Watch for language like:
  * “Subject to inspection”
  * “Switch to ACV coverage”
  * “Non-renewal due to roof age”
  * “Roof must be replaced by [date]”


Understanding these warnings early helps you plan. A proactive inspection or [roof replacement](https://solariasolarandroofing.com/roof-patch-right-fix-for-your-home/)
## How to Avoid Losing Coverage on an Older Roof
If your roof is almost or past the 15-year mark, there are ways to protect your insurance coverage under the 15-year roof rule in Florida before it’s too late.. Florida law gives you the right to prove that your older roof is still insurable—but it’s up to you to take action.
Start by scheduling a licensed roof inspection with a certified professional. If your roof passes and is determined to have at least five years of useful life left, you can submit a roof condition certification to your insurer. This document often satisfies their eligibility requirements and prevents non-renewal.
In some cases, if your roof fails the inspection or your insurer’s underwriting guidelines are strict, a full roof replacement may be your only option to maintain coverage—especially during hurricane season.

## Don’t Let an Aging Roof Cancel Your Policy
Under the 15-year roof rule in Florida, waiting for your renewal notice could cost you coverage. Insurers often act before you get the chance to respond, especially if your roof is over 15 years old. A proactive inspection gives you time to fix issues or submit a roof certification before your policy is at risk.
Acting early helps you avoid rushed decisions, premium hikes, or unexpected cancellations during storm season. Whether you need a roof assessment or full replacement, [Solaria Solar and Roofing](https://solariasolarandroofing.com/) is ready to help.
Contact Solaria today for a roof evaluation built to meet Florida’s insurance requirements—and protect your policy before it’s too late.
1. What is the 15-year roof rule in Florida?
The 15-year roof rule in Florida refers to an insurance guideline allowing companies to require a roof inspection once your roof reaches 15 years old. If it has less than five years of useful life, your policy may be denied or non-renewed.
2. Can an insurance company drop me because of an old roof?
Yes. If your roof is 15 years or older and fails a condition inspection, your insurer can deny or non-renew your homeowners insurance policy based on Florida Statute 627.7011(5).
3. What type of roof inspection is needed for insurance in Florida?
You need a licensed roof inspection from a certified home inspector, roofing contractor, engineer, or architect to certify your roof has at least five years of useful life remaining.
4. Do tile or metal roofs also fall under the 15-year rule?
Yes. Although tile and metal roofs often last longer than asphalt shingles, many insurers still apply the 15-year rule unless you provide documentation proving the roof's condition.
5. How can I keep my insurance if my roof is over 15 years old?
You can submit a roof condition certification showing it has five or more years of useful life. If not, a full roof replacement may be required to maintain coverage.
6. What does Florida Statute 627.7011(5) mean for homeowners?
It protects homeowners with roofs under 15 years from being dropped due to age alone but allows insurers to require inspections and make renewal decisions for older roofs.
