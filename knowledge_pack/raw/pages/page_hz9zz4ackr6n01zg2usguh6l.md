## USAA vs. State Farm: rates for high-risk drivers
If your driving record an [at-fault accident](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/accidents/), [speeding violation](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), reckless driving violation or [DUI](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/dui-vs-dwi/) on your driving record, USAA is likely a better choice than State Farm. Every car insurance company will handle driving offenses differently, so don't be afraid to shop around and [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) to find out which insurance company suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: USAA VS. STATE FARM
**Citation** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $1,304 | $2,849  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $947 | $1,524  
DUI/DWI | $1,952 | $3,854  
Reckless driving | $1,472 | $2,895  
Speeding ticket | $1,124 | $1,983  
## USAA vs. State Farm: rates by age
Insurance companies use age to help estimate the level of risk that a driver poses. Policies are then priced accordingly. Auto insurance policies are typically most expensive for teen drivers — because of their inexperience — and are often much more affordable for drivers aged 25 or older. Because every insurance company rates ages differently, it's best to shop around and find the right policy for your needs.
In general, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose USAA over State Farm: USAA offers average yearly savings of nearly $3,000 when compared to State Farm.
##### RATES BY AGE: STATE FARM VS. USAA
**Age bracket** | **USAA avg. annual premium** | **State Farm avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $2,864 | $5,820  
**20s** | $1,261 | $2,379  
**30s** | $963 | $1,585  
**40s** | $957 | $1,587  
**50s** | $889 | $1,558  
**60s** | $845 | $1,485  
Affordability aside, USAA and State Farm each carry pros and cons, including their discount programs, add-ons, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to get quotes and compare rates before purchasing a policy.

State Farm provides robust policy types and plenty of [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a solid option for both standard homeowners and those with unique coverage needs.

#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.
