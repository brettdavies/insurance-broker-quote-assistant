With attractive discounts for new homeowners, robust financial strength, and high customer satisfaction, Progressive stands out. Its website is designed for easy navigation and gives instant quotes.
The presence of a mobile app boosts the digital experience, making it easier for policyholders.
One unique feature that Progressive offers, which other insurers do not, is its “single deductible” benefit. When you bundle auto and mobile home policies, any claim you file will be subject to just one deductible.
For example, if a hailstorm causes damage to your mobile home’s roof and your car, and your deductibles are $500 each, you would only need to pay one deductible to have both fixed.
You can also benefit from a bundle discount when you combine both your mobile home and auto insurance with Progressive.
An added benefit from Progressive is the “trip collision” endorsement, providing protection for your dwelling and belongings while in transit.

## How To Find The Best Mobile Home Insurance Company For You

  * When obtaining a quote, be sure to include any major renovations, upgrades, or alterations that may influence your mobile home’s value.
