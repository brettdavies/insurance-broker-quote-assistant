Discounts are one of the easiest ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks). If you’re an active-duty service member or veteran of the armed forces, you could save up to 25% with a military discount.
[State Farm](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/state-farm) offers a military discount only in [Louisiana](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/louisiana) because it’s the only state that requires car insurance companies to provide it.[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-military-discount#cite-1) We’ll explain how to get State Farm’s military discount and tell you about other discounts the company offers.
## **What Is the State Farm Military Discount?**
United States active-duty military personnel, reservists, and Louisiana Air and Army National Guard Members can receive 25% off their State Farm car insurance. You must [own the registered](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/insure-car-you-dont-own) vehicle and be named on the car insurance policy to get the discount.
State Farm may also offer a discount to veterans with at least a 50% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
But the discount might apply only to your [liability insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/liability-insurance) coverage, not your entire car insurance [premium](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/what-is-a-car-insurance-premium). Check with your State Farm agent to find out how much a military discount can save you.
## **How Much Can You Save With the State Farm Military Discount?**
[Military members](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheap-car-insurance-companies-military) in Louisiana can save up to 25% on their State Farm car insurance. But the amount you save depends on your [coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage) and any other discounts applied to your policy.
State Farm doesn’t advertise its exact savings, but it’s a good discount for drivers who qualify. And even if you live outside Louisiana, you might still get a cheap rate with State Farm.
Reddit users who received the military discount say State Farm gave them the lowest rates after [comparing car insurance quotes](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance).[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-military-discount#cite-2) [[3]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-military-discount#cite-3) [[4]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/state-farm-military-discount#cite-4) If you need coverage quickly, an [insurance-comparison site](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/compare-insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-comparison-sites) can help you find the best deal.
