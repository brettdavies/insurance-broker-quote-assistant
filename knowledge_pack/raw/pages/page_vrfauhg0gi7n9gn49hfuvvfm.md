#  Umbrella Policy vs. High Liability Coverage: Which Makes More Sense? 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
I am planning to buy a $1 million umbrella policy and realized that some insurance companies offer $1 million liability coverage on auto and renters policies directly (for example, Amica and Geico). When I do the math on what each policy costs, just getting $1 million liability on auto and home comes out ahead. 
# For example, with Amica:
**Option 1: Minimum Coverage + Umbrella**
  * Minimum required for auto: 250k/500k/100k which costs $945 (6 months) 
  * Renters policy: 300k which costs $87 (12 months) 
  * Umbrella $1 million: $301 (12 months) 


**Total = $950 (6 months) + $90 (12 months) + $301 (12 months) = $1,341**
**Option 2: High Liability Coverage Only**
  * $1 million on auto and renters: $1,059 (6 months) + $100 (12 months) = $1,159 


Would it make sense to just get $1 million coverage on auto and renters, or am I missing something?

$1M umbrella limit is in addition to your direct policy limits. More coverage than a straight $1M limit liability direct policy.

Umbrella often does make more sense. I was recently pricing out some liability coverage increases and I found that increasing auto liability from 300/500/100 to $1M/$1M/500K was $108 a year — for auto liability only. (Homeowners is already at $1M liability.) Increasing the umbrella from $2M to $3M was only $80 a year and covers a more broad scope of liability, so it was an easy choice for us. It’s worth running numbers like this for yourself, though, because insurance pricing can be all over the map depending on the insurer, the individuals, and the location.

Umbrella policies aren’t just the respective limited scope of an auto or a home policy. 
There’s potentially coverage for boats and other property that wouldn’t have liability under an auto or home. It’s also more broad in that it can cover a defense for things like slander. And it’s possible it affords coverage for international incident. 
Umbrella makes far more sense.

As already stated, an umbrella policy typically provides a wider net of coverage vs. liability on an auto or HO policy; check the exclusions page for each policy to see what types of claims are not covered to get a better comparison of what you are paying for. Personally, I’d go with umbrella.

Umbrella. The umbrella may cover liability scenarios not covered by auto or renters such as defamation claims

What kind of assets are you trying to protect? Check your state law as some assets are judgement proof, meaning it can't be taken on a lawsuit

Sure will do, thanks! Technically I can get away with 700k but almost all insurers only offers at minimum 1 million $ for umbrella.

What I was trying to get at is depending on your assets it might not be necessary for you to get a 1 million dollar coverage.

I was in the same boat, trying to figure out if it’s better to just raise the liability limits on my home and auto insurance, or if getting an umbrella policy actually made more sense. I m not a financ expert or anything, but after chatting with a Insurance agent of my known, things clickd. So how I see it now: high liability coverage is solid, but it only takes you so far. If something major happens.......like a bad car accident or someone seriously hurt on your property....you can burn through that coverage pretty fast. That is where the umbrella kicks in. It is basically a backup plan that covers you once your main policy caps out. Kind of like an extra safety net. What surprised me most was how affordable the umbrella policy actually was. I thought it would be crazy expensive, but it was definetly not. The folks at Schwartz Reliance did not push anything just laid it out in normal terms....... which I really appreciated. End of the day, I went with both........good base coverage and the umbrella, bcoz I would rather be overprepared than caught off guard. If you have got stuff you care about protecting (your house, savings, future income), it’s worth looking into.

Your policy can make a big difference in whether you should get the umbrella or not. My umbrella also covers my uninsured/under insured policy. I wanted the piece of mind knowing that I and my family are covered regardless of the other parties' limits. Getting into an accident that cripples me for life only to find out they have no insurance or minimal insurance would suck.

Which Insurance companies do y’all recommend for Umbrella policies? I hear that many companies don’t offer this option anymore in WA State, but I could be wrong. TIA.

This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.

  * [ When do you need umbrella liability insurance?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/11n0tx4/when_do_you_need_umbrella_liability_insurance/)
[ r/financialindependence ](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) • 3y ago
[r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/)
This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent (FI), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible.
