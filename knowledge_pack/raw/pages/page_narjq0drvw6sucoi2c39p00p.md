Residents of California, the most populous state in the U.S., cannot afford to ignore the importance of renters insurance.
The risk of theft or damage to belongings is high in major cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento.
Moreover, the state's susceptibility to wildfires makes it even more crucial for renters to protect themselves and their possessions with insurance coverage. While renting in California does not mandate insurance, it is wise to invest in it to safeguard one's assets and peace of mind.

## Navigating Insurance Amid Los Angeles Wildfires
Understanding insurance coverage has become increasingly crucial for renters in disaster-prone regions like Los Angeles as natural disasters, including wildfires, grow more frequent and severe. Renters insurance is a key tool for protecting personal belongings and ensuring financial stability in the event of damage or loss. Policies typically cover fire and smoke damage and temporary living expenses if a home becomes uninhabitable. However, renters should be mindful of policy limitations and ensure their coverage aligns with their specific needs, particularly in high-risk areas.
The evolving insurance landscape in California means renters may face higher premiums and fewer options as insurers adjust their models to account for climate-related risks. Reviewing and comparing policies, confirming coverage for disasters like wildfires, and keeping an inventory of personal belongings can help renters prepare for unexpected events. By staying proactive and informed, renters can navigate the complexities of insurance while ensuring peace of mind in uncertain times.

Although Allstate is a national insurance company, it has that small mom-and-pop feel because it’s easy to talk to local agents who know your area or neighborhood.
You can always call your local agent to get a quote or to ask questions about your policy.
Besides its affordable rates (although the upper limit is high), Allstate is known for its many ways to file a claim.
Like Lemonade, Allstate allows you to get an instant quote and purchase a policy on its website in under 10 minutes without talking to a customer service rep.
Allstate coverage is also customizable, allowing you to choose whether you want replacement cost value (RCV) or actual cash value (ACV), personal property protection, and extra protection for other items in your home.
And suppose you have to vacate your rental due to a fire that burns down your unit. In that case, you can stay in comparable lodging with no limit on the loss of use, a unique California renters insurance policy feature Allstate provides.
Additionally, the insurer’s many customer discounts offer steep savings, which can bring your premium down significantly.
The major drawback is that Allstate does not offer an earthquake endorsement.

Allstate gives renters opportunities to save with these discounts.
  * **Bundling discount:** Save money when you add your renters policy to another one like auto.
  * **55 and retired discount:** You can get off a whopping 25% off your premium if you are no longer working and not seeking work and age 55 or over.
  * **Auto-Pay discount:** Schedule automatic monthly payments and get another discount.


### Allstate Renters Insurance Pros & Cons
Pros

  * Choose between RCV or ACV for personal property coverage.

Liberty Mutual is best known for its comprehensive coverage, ability to cover high-end valuables like jewelry using an add-on, straightforward claims processing, cheap rates, and comprehensive earthquake coverage.
Liberty’s earthquake coverage is one of the best around.
For California residents who live in areas susceptible to earthquakes, this optional coverage protects you in the event of an earthquake.
Coverage includes damage caused by aftershocks up to 360 hours after the earthquake.
Note that this coverage requires a separate deductible.
The bad news is that while Liberty Mutual covers the entire state of California, its earthquake coverage does not. It would be best if you lived in an eligible area.
But the number of Liberty’s discounts and accessibility is hard to beat. For example, you can qualify for a discount by purchasing your policy online and signing up for automatic payments, to name two easy ways.

### Liberty Mutual Renters Insurance Discounts

  * **Claims-free discount:** If you haven't filed a claim with your previous insurer for five years or more, you qualify for a discount.
  * **Early quote discount:** If you get a quote from Liberty Mutual before your previous policy expires, you'll save when you sign up.
  * **Bundling discount:** You can save when you bundle multiple policies.
  * **Auto-pay discount:** Save money when you enroll in auto-pay with your bank account.
  * **Online purchase discount:** Automatically save when you purchase your policy online.


### Liberty Mutual Renters Insurance Pros & Cons
Pros
  * Easy online claims filing.
  * With its online claims process and mobile app, you can “chat” with the insurer almost exclusively without needing to call a representative.
  * Great for those who want to connect with a local agent.
  * Customer service available on weekends.

GEICO has a user-friendly app and website.
You can even estimate the value of your items and learn if there are any discounts you can take advantage of to lower your premium.
GEICO’s app and online experience are similar to its competitors, although GEICO does them one better by allowing customers to contact a local agent directly.
But for California residents, GEICO’s earthquake endorsement stands out.
Earthquake insurance for renters is the safest way to protect your belongings and cover the cost of living somewhere else, like a hotel, if your rental is damaged and needs repairs after an earthquake.
GEICO has one of the cheapest earthquake policies in the US, at only **$2 per month**.
### GEICO Renters Insurance Discounts

Assurant Renters Insurance
Renters insurance made easy for you.  

[Assurant](https://assurantrenters.com/) is best overall because of its affordable rates, cheap earthquake policies, compelling optional coverages, and noteworthy flood insurance endorsements.
Assurant offers renters a selection of lower deductibles of $100, $250, and $500.
Renters also win with Assurant’s basic renters insurance policy, which has a low monthly premium of only **$13**.
On top of that, **Assurant offers earthquake protection for only $2 per month**..
So, for both the basic renters policy and the earthquake add-on, you will only pay $15 per month.

Another important bonus for renters is that replacement coverage is automatically included at no extra cost.
Assurant is also one of the nation’s leading providers of flood insurance.

Progressive teams up with third-party insurers to provide renters insurance.
It is well-known for the discounts it offers to policyholders.
One of its most notable discounts is a single deductible discount that can lower your premium.
If you bundle Progressive's renters insurance with its auto insurance, you only need to pay a single deductible if you file a claim on both policies simultaneously for a covered event.
For example, if someone steals your car, which also incidentally contained your laptop or phone, this would apply to your auto and renters policy; only one deductible would apply to this claim instead of two.

### Progressive Renters Insurance Pros & Cons
Pros

## Is Renters Insurance Mandatory to Rent an Apartment in California?
In California, renters insurance is not mandatory when renting a property.
However, tenants are highly recommended to purchase renters insurance to cover the cost of repairing or replacing damage caused by a covered event, such as a fire, flood, or earthquake.
By protecting property from theft or damage and providing liability protection, renters insurance can offer renters significant peace of mind.
While renters are not obligated to purchase renters insurance in California, they should strongly consider investing in a policy to ensure sufficient coverage when the unexpected occurs.
It should be noted that, unlike in some states, [landlords in California can require tenants to purchase](https://www.propertynest.com/blog/insurance/why-do-landlords-require-renters-insurance/) renters insurance while leasing their property.
### How Does The Landlord Enforce Renters Insurance?
Some lease agreements include a clause in which the renter agrees to purchase a renters insurance policy.
This is partly done to protect the landlord from a lawsuit if damage to the property causes it to become uninhabitable.
It also protects the landlord from liability if an injury occurs.
In this clause, there is wording stating that the landlord’s insurance does not in any way cover a renter’s personal property if the property is damaged by a covered peril or stolen.
Also, when your lease contains this clause, you must always have renters insurance.
The clause can also help protect the landlord from missed rent payments if the renter their belongings due to a fire or other natural disaster occurring on the property.
To ensure you comply with the clause, your landlord may ask for proof of renters insurance each time you renew your lease.
They may also check if you have enough liability and personal property coverage.
If a renter can’t provide proof of coverage, the landlord may remind the renter that this is required and may pursue terminating the lease agreement.
## What is the Average Cost of Renters Insurance in California?
Rates will vary depending on your preferred coverage limits and the value of your belongings and add-ons you select.
The average basic renters insurance policy in California costs **$226.32 per year** or **$14.45 per month**.
That's about the same as the national average cost per month.
This figure is based on having **$15,000** in personal property coverage, **$100,000** in liability coverage, and a **$500** deductible.
## What Factors Determine Your Policy Rates?
As you search for the best policy, keep these factors in mind that will increase or decrease your rate.
### Earthquakes
California is prone to earthquakes because of the many fault lines running through the state.
As such, California renters should purchase earthquake insurance, which will increase their rate.
### A Home Not Up to Code
If your rental is old, dilapidated, not up to code, or far from a fire station or fire hydrant, your policy will cost more.
### Long Rental History
If you’ve rented for a long time in various cities and have the experience of knowing what additional coverages you should get, your premium may be lowered.
### Claims History
If you have never filed a claim with a past insurer and then signed up for a new renters policy, your new insurer will usually grant you a discount provided you don’t claim for a certain period specified by the insurer.
### Pets
Your [pet is usually covered under the liability portion](https://www.propertynest.com/blog/insurance/best-pet-insurance/) of your renters insurance policy.
However, if your dog, for example, poses a high risk and has a history of biting people, it will, in all likelihood, not be covered.
If your insurer doesn’t cover pets, you may need to buy a separate pet insurance policy to protect against damage caused by your pet.
### Bundling
Most insurance companies give you a multi-policy discount for bundling your renters insurance with other policies, like auto and life insurance.
The multi-policy discount is one you should look for. It can substantially lower your rate. If you bundle, you can shave  
as much as 15% with certain insurers.
## What Does Renters Insurance Cover?
California's standard renters insurance policy covers liability, personal property theft or damage, medical treatment, and loss of use.
### Liability Coverage
Liability coverage protects you against lawsuits from someone who sustains bodily injuries or property damage you or your family caused.
Liability coverage also pays for your legal defense.
### Personal Property Coverage
This pays to repair or replace property stolen, vandalized, or damaged due to fire, windstorms, smoke damage, and other perils your policy may cover.
Types of items covered items and their coverage limits include the below.
Most Common Items Stolen in Home Burglaries Type | Items | Coverage  
---|---|---  
Cash or Other Forms of Currency | Bank notes, bullions, gold or silver (non-jewelry), coins, medals, smart cards, stored value cards. | Most renters insurance policies will only cover up to $200 in stolen cash.  
Electronic Equipment | Phones (iPhones, Androids, etc.), computers, laptops, iPads, earbuds, smart watches, TV sets, gaming systems, Alexa or Google home devices, etc. | Standard renters insurance policies cover the loss or damage of electronic devices.  
Clothing | Designer purse/handbags, shoes, jewelry, designer watches | Standard renters policies cover your personal clothing or designer handbags etc.  
Power Tools | Drills & drivers, saws. | Covered under the personal property coverage.  
Kitchen appliances | Refrigerators, microwaves, blenders, electric mixers, ice makers, coffee machines, and other appliances. | Renters insurance covers personal appliances if they are damaged, stolen, or destroyed by a covered peril.  
Prescription drugs |  | Will not cover stolen prescription drugs.  
Personal information | Bank accounts, identity information stolen from documents, or stolen personal equipment. | Most companies do not include identity theft as a covered peril in a standard renters insurance policy.  
Firearms | Pistols, rifles | Legal firearms are covered under personal property coverage.

### Loss of Use
This policy covers basic living expenses and temporary housing costs if you can’t live in your rental unit due to damage or destruction from fire, smoke, or heavy winds.
### Medical Payments For Others
The standard policy pays for medical care if there is bodily injury to a person that occurs in your rental unit, regardless of fault.
## How Much Liability Coverage Should You Get in California?
If your landlord requires renters insurance, check with the landlord to see how much liability coverage the landlord requires you to buy.
Most landlords require a liability coverage limit of at least **$100,000**.
But note that adding more coverage is relatively inexpensive.
You can get **$300,000** or **$500,000** of liability coverage on your California renters insurance for just a few dollars more a year.
## What Does a Landlord’s Insurance Policy Cover?
Renters insurance does not cover the rental structure, such as the exterior and interior of your apartment building.
That’s your landlord’s responsibility.
The landlord’s insurance covers common areas in a building that may need repairs or become damaged due to a covered peril, such as the lobby, the elevator, the hallways, and other common spaces.
But in some situations, a landlord will cover certain parts of your rental unit.
For example, the landlord will repair or replace your front door or any broken windows if there's a burglary.
If your electrical system goes down, your landlord will also repair it.
Some renters insurance providers cover spoiled food as part of their standard policy, but that’s rare.
You may be able to get additional coverage to cover your losses, but you should first assess whether some items are non-essential or things you can easily replace.
## What Natural Disasters are Covered by Standard Renters Policy?
The following natural disasters, often called covered perils, are covered by a standard renters insurance policy.
  * Fire
  * Wildfires.
  * Lightning.
  * Windstorm and hail damage.
  * Smoke damage.
  * Volcanic eruption.
  * Explosion
  * Weight of ice, sleet, or snow.
  * Hurricanes.
  * [Water damage](https://www.propertynest.com/blog/insurance/renters-insurance-water-damage/) unrelated to natural floods.


## What Renters Insurance Typically Does Not Cover in California
Besides earthquakes and flood damage, the basic renters insurance does not cover the following:
### Structural Damage
Landlords or owners need to buy extra coverage for the frame and structure of their property.
### Roommate Property
If you have a roommate and you experience a covered peril, only your personal belongings are covered,
Your roommate will need to purchase their policy.
### Expensive Belongings
You need to get add-on coverage for costly items and valuables as they are excluded from standard renters insurance policies or are only covered up to the policy’s limit.
### Natural Disasters
The following natural disasters are not covered in a standard renters insurance policy.
  * Earthquakes
  * [Floods](https://www.propertynest.com/blog/insurance/best-flood-insurance/)


## What Natural Disasters Occur in California?
California is one of the ten riskiest states to live in due to many natural disasters, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s new “National Risk Index.”
These natural disasters occur in California:
  * Wildfires
  * Floods
  * Mudslides
  * Landslides
  * Earthquakes


Some rarer natural disasters for Californians are:
### Tornadoes
In Los Angeles County, tornadoes are a risk and more likely to happen between November and January.
The cities with the most recorded tornadoes include Long Beach, South Los Angeles, and South Whittier.
### Hurricanes
It’s very unlikely, however, that should your city in California be subjected to a rare hurricane that causes major destruction, your renters insurance will protect you.
### Why is California Prone to Natural Disasters?
A combination of coastal conditions, fluctuating weather, extreme heat, and geology makes California prone to natural disasters.
## Why You Should Get Earthquake Coverage and Flood Insurance
California is at risk of earthquakes because it sits on many fault lines.
Therefore, it’s advisable to buy additional earthquake coverage.
It’s also recommended that California renters get flood insurance.
But there are differences between natural floods and floods that cause interior damage.
Damage resulting from the water backup or water originating in the rental is covered in the standard policy.
Flooding due to hurricanes or severe storms that damage your belongings is not covered.
Since flooding due to natural disasters is common, getting flood insurance is recommended.
Both earthquake and flood insurance will raise your premium, but if you don't have them and one or both occur, you’ll pay out of pocket for any damages and losses.
### What Does Earthquake Insurance Cover?
While earthquake coverage differs depending on the insurer you choose, it usually covers personal belongings damaged due to an earthquake.
In addition, earthquake coverage includes necessary living expenses if your rental becomes uninhabitable, such as staying at hotels or eating out at restaurants.
However, earthquake coverage does not cover fire, flooding, or vehicle damage.
You get fire damage protection from your basic renters insurance policy, flooding for an additional cost to your basic policy, and vehicle damage from your auto insurer.
### What If My Policy Doesn’t Include Earthquake Coverage?
If a renters insurance policy doesn’t include an earthquake endorsement, you must shop in California.
Your renters insurance company can help point you in the right direction.
In addition, the Department of Insurance website can also be a resource for finding licensed earthquake insurers.
Californians also have another option. You can buy earthquake coverage through the California Earthquake Authority (CEA)
You can get an instant quote on CEA’s website.
If you already have a renters policy, you can contact the company to see if it's a CEA-approved insurer.
However, insurers typically won’t sell new policies for one or two months if an earthquake has occurred in your area.
So, you should get earthquake coverage immediately when you sign up for a renters insurance policy.
## How to Protect High-Cost Personal Belongings?
Your standard renters policy in California will be able to replace or repair your belongings in full, minus the deductible, up to the policy limits.
However, you must pay the difference if your diamond ring costs $20,000 and your coverage limit is $15,000.
A standard renters policy doesn’t cover expensive possessions like jewelry, musical instruments, electronics, or furniture.
You need to get an endorsement or rider to cover your collectibles or valuables.
But first, you’ll have to get your expensive items appraised.
That’s because the appraised value of an item is used to determine the cost of the policy rider.
For example, you will pay about $2 per $100 in value for a rider to cover expensive jewelry. So, if you have a diamond ring worth $5,000, you’ll pay $100 for a rider on top of your insurance premium.
## Should You Perform a Home Inventory?
With a home inventory, you inventory your possessions and assign them a value.
It is also recommended that you take photos of all your items.
If you can’t remember the cost of each item you own, or if you can’t find any receipts, you can research them online.
Or you can find a similar item if the manufacturer no longer makes it.
This will help when you file a claim if a fire damages your items. The insurer will know precisely what to pay.
A home inventory lets you determine how much coverage you need and what a standard renter’s policy offers.
## Can You Be Denied Renters Insurance in California?
Yes. You may be denied renters insurance in California.
For example, an insurer may deny coverage for being too far from a fire station or hydrant.
A fire hydrant should be within 1,000 feet of where you rent.
## What’s The Last Resort If You're Declined for Renters Insurance?
If you’ve been declined several times by renters insurance companies, you are not out of luck.
Your last resort is the California FAIR Plan, which offers renters insurance to those who pose a risk and who’ve been turned down elsewhere.
However, the FAIR Plan has limited coverage compared to a standard renters insurance policy.
The FAIR Plan pays only for damage due to fire, lightning, smoke, and internal explosions.
Those disasters are considered standard in a renters insurance policy.
You have to pay extra for a few coverages from the FAIR Plan, which come as standard in a renters policy.
For example, theft isn’t covered. But you can add that to your FAIR Plan coverage.

## Our Methodology
PropertyNest thoroughly researched the state's top renters’ insurance companies and narrowed the list down to those that operated in California. We then rated them on criteria that included ease of use, financial strength, customer satisfaction, and affordability. Read our full in-depth [renters insurance methodology](https://www.propertynest.com/renters-insurance-methodology/).
### How We Ranked and Picked the Best Renters Insurance Companies in California
We gathered information from multiple trusted sources and California's renters insurance companies. We narrowed our search down to the unique needs of California residents by prioritizing the following:
#### Discounts
We added that insurer to our list if a company had many discounts that could significantly lower your premium.
It was important for the insurers we chose that they had a multi-policy or bundle discount because it provides the highest policy discount. Some companies reduce their premiums by as much as 15% when bundling.
#### Coverage
A quality insurer should have a range of policy coverage options to suit the different needs of different policyholders.
We examined how many coverages an insurer had to customize a basic renters policy.
Having multiple coverage options is important because there is limited coverage available in a standard renters policy.
That’s because there is limited coverage available to customers in a standard renters policy.
In considering the needs of California residents, we looked at many insurers to find those with earthquake coverage and flood insurance.
To our surprise, many renters insurers didn’t offer earthquake coverage as an add-on to the basic plan. However, that’s primarily because California residents are considered high risk for insurers because of the large number of claims caused by earthquakes.
#### Financial Strength
If your renters insurance company doesn’t have an excellent financial rating, they might be unable to fulfill their obligations when so many people are simultaneously making claims.
#### Technology
We included only those companies with websites and apps that were not difficult to use and were easy to navigate. Those insurers who allowed you to get a quote online or buy a policy were placed on our list.
#### Customer Satisfaction
We spent considerable time reviewing published consumer ratings and verified reviews of renters insurance providers in California.
Insurers with many quality consumer ratings and reviews were included in our list.
#### Price
We looked at each insurer's affordability because it is so important to Californians.
We included insurers with rates lower than or near the state and national average. We found many premiums for under $15 per month in our search for affordable renters insurance in California.
#### Location
We surveyed insurance coverage prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Fresno.

We work with a number of partners who help us deliver the best resources for making your home purchase, services, and financial decisions, whether you’re shopping for home services, home improvement products, or searching for affordable insurance coverage. When you click on a link or widget or make a purchase from one of our partners we may collect a commission from them.
While our partnerships may affect where products may be placed within our content and our site, our goal is still to provide you with the best information and tools you require to make the best decision.
PropertyNest works hard to present you with the best products and companies so whenever possible, we try to provide these to you from a mix of sources–a variety of different partners as well as those we are not partnered with.
Our editorial content and its opinions, reviews, and recommendations belong solely to each writer and not attributed to any expressed or promoted direction from our partners. Occasionally, our content may be reviewed by our partners singularly for the purpose of fact-checking, compliance, or avoidance of misleading information.
