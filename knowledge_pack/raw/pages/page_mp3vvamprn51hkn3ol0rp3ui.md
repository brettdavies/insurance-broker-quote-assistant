# What Are the Illinois Minimum Car Insurance Requirements?
UPDATED: June 25, 2025 
Share:
[ ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fillinois-minimum-car-insurance-requirements%2F) [ ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+Are+the+Illinois+Minimum+Car+Insurance+Requirements%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insureonthespot.com%2Fillinois-minimum-car-insurance-requirements%2F)
**TL;DR** : Illinois law requires every driver to carry minimum auto insurance to drive legally. Specifically, you must have at least **$25,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person** , **$50,000 per accident** , and **$20,000 property damage liability coverage**. 
Illinois also mandates uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage with the same **25/50** minimum limits. Driving without this insurance can result in a **$500 fine** , license plate suspension, and reinstatement fees. 
For help meeting Illinois insurance requirements or getting a fast quote, call **Insure on the Spot at**[773-202-5060](tel:773-202-5060).
## **What Are the Mandatory Minimum Insurance Coverages in Illinois?**
In Illinois, the law mandates several types of coverage for every auto insurance policy. These are the minimum requirements you must carry to comply with state law:
  * **Bodily Injury Liability (BI)** : You must have at least **$25,000** per person and **$50,000** per accident to cover injury claims for other people involved in the accident. If you cause an accident and someone else is injured, your insurance will cover their medical bills up to the policy limit.  

  * **Property Damage Liability (PD)** : Illinois requires **$20,000** in coverage to repair or replace another person’s property (like their vehicle) if you are at fault in an accident.  

  * **Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI)** : This coverage must also be at least **$25,000** per person and **$50,000** per accident. It protects you if an uninsured driver causes a crash that injures you.  



**Underinsured Motorist (UIM)** coverage is closely related to UM. If you purchase higher-than-minimum UM limits, your policy will automatically include UIM coverage to protect you if the at-fault driver’s insurance is insufficient.
Remember, these numbers represent the **legal minimum**. You can always choose to increase your limits for more protection. Many drivers opt for coverage like **50/100/50** for double the minimum limits.
## **What Are the Penalties for Driving Without Insurance in Illinois?**
Driving without the required insurance in Illinois is illegal, and there are strict penalties for non-compliance:
  * **First Offense** : If caught driving uninsured, you face a **minimum $500 fine** , and your **vehicle registration (license plates)** will be suspended. You cannot legally drive the vehicle until you provide proof of insurance and pay a **$100 reinstatement fee**.  

  * **Repeat Offenses** : If you’re caught uninsured a second time, you will face a **4-month suspension** of your vehicle registration, and still have to pay the **$100 reinstatement fee**. If you are caught driving during the suspension period, you will incur a **$1,000 fine**.  

  * **Third or Subsequent Offenses** : For a third violation, Illinois will require you to file an **SR-22** insurance certificate for three years to prove future financial responsibility. Failure to maintain the SR-22 filing will result in a **driver’s license suspension**.  



In summary, Illinois enforces tough penalties to discourage uninsured driving. If you are caught uninsured multiple times, you could lose your driving privileges.
## **How Do I Show Proof of Insurance in Illinois?**
Illinois law requires you to carry proof of insurance in your vehicle at all times. This proof is typically an insurance ID card provided by your insurer, which must be shown to law enforcement during traffic stops or accidents.
  * **Electronic Insurance Cards** : Illinois allows digital proof of insurance (on your phone), as long as it clearly shows your vehicle is covered with at least the required liability insurance.  

  * **Electronic Verification System** : Illinois uses an **Electronic Insurance Verification System** to monitor insurance compliance. The system checks registered vehicles twice a year to verify insurance status. If your vehicle is found to be uninsured, you will receive a notice and be required to provide proof of coverage.  



If you forget your insurance card and are pulled over, you can still avoid fines if you provide valid proof of insurance later. If you’re uninsured, however, you’ll face penalties.
## **What if I Forget My Insurance Card and Get Pulled Over?**
In Illinois, failing to show proof of insurance doesn’t automatically mean you’ll be fined as an uninsured driver. If you have insurance but forgot your card, you can present valid proof later, and the citation may be dismissed. However, if you truly do not have insurance, you will be subject to the penalties discussed earlier.
To avoid this, always keep your insurance ID card in your vehicle or have a digital version accessible on your phone.
## **Is Minimum Insurance Enough, or Should You Get More Coverage?**
While Illinois’s **minimum insurance requirements** meet legal standards, they may not provide enough protection in the event of a serious accident. The state-required **25/50/20** liability limits can be quickly exhausted in a major crash.
  * **Protecting Your Assets** : If you have significant assets (like a home or savings), the minimum liability limits may not fully cover damages in a severe accident. You may want to increase your liability limits to **50/100/50** or **100/300/100** for better protection.  

  * **Vehicle Value** : Minimum insurance doesn’t cover your own car’s damages. If your vehicle is valuable, you should consider adding **collision** and **comprehensive** coverage, especially if your car is financed or leased.  

  * **Medical and Uninsured Motorist Protection** : You might also want to increase your **UMBI** coverage or add **Medical Payments** coverage to protect yourself and passengers in the event of an accident, especially if the at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured.  



While the state minimum meets the legal requirement, many drivers choose more comprehensive coverage for better protection. The cost of upgrading your insurance is relatively small compared to the potential financial devastation of an accident.
## **Bottom Line**
Illinois minimum car insurance requirements ensure every driver has some protection. However, the **25/50/20** limits may not cover all costs in a serious accident. Consider increasing your coverage limits to better protect yourself and your assets. **Insure on the Spot** can help you meet the state’s minimum requirements or provide a quote for additional coverage based on your needs.
