## Illinois renters insurance coverages
Check out the four standard coverages on nearly all Illinois renters insurance policies:
  * **Personal property** protects your personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics whether they're inside your apartment or elsewhere
  * **Loss of use** helps cover costs associated with an increase in living expenses, up to your policy's limit, if you're unable to stay in your home while it's being repaired or rebuilt due to a covered loss
  * **Personal liability** protects you financially if you're legally responsible for another person's injuries or damage to their property
  * **Medical payments to others** pays for medical expenses due to a covered occurrence


### Additional coverages
The best renters insurance in Illinois is a policy with customized coverage. Here are some extra options for when you need more protection:
  * **Add a rider** : Certain valuable items, [like jewelry](https://www.progressive.com/answers/jewelry-and-engagement-ring-insurance/), may have specific limits on your renters policy. If your item exceeds the limit, you may be able to purchase an endorsement called **[a rider](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-rider/)** for your policy to cover the item for its value.
  * **Personal injury coverage** : May pay for legal fees and damages if you're liable for slander or defamation.
  * **Water back-up coverage** : Water that backs up through sewers or drains or discharges from a sump pump may not be covered by a standard renters policy. Water back-up coverage may pay for the damage to your belongings and water removal costs.

## Is renters insurance required in Illinois? 
Renters insurance in Illinois isn't required by law, but your landlord or rental company may require you to have coverage before you can move in. Even if it's not mandated, renters insurance is an affordable way to have personal liability coverage and protect your belongings. It may also help you pay for lodging and groceries, up to your coverage limit, if your residence needs to be repaired or rebuilt after a covered loss. 
Pro tip:
Wondering how to cover your personal items while they're in transit from your old place to your new space? Renters insurance [may protect your belongings while moving or in storage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/moving-and-storage-unit-insurance/).
### Is renters insurance worth it in Illinois?
Renters insurance is an affordable option for tenants renting apartments, homes, or condos throughout the Prairie State. Here are scenarios when a renters insurance policy may protect you:
  * Your apartment complex is burglarized, and equipment is stolen from your exterior storage unit. Personal property coverage may pay to replace your items, up to your coverage limit.
  * You collide with a pedestrian while riding your bicycle to work. If you're liable for their injuries, personal liability coverage may cover their medical bills, up to your coverage limit.
  * Water damage forces you to move out while repairs are being made. Loss of use coverage may pay for your hotel costs and food expenses, above what you normally spend, caused by the temporary relocation.
