Doing so doesn’t require divulging personal information like your name, address or other confidential details. Getting an anonymous quote can give you a general idea of how much you can expect to pay for coverage before signing up with any particular carrier.

## What is an anonymous car insurance quote?
Want to shop for an anonymous auto insurance quote with no strings attached, less pressure to commit to a policy and fewer worries about receiving unsolicited marketing messages from that insurer afterward? 
Consider requesting an anonymous car insurance quote, which involves asking for an [estimate of the cost of auto insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/calculators/car-insurance-calculator/) without surrendering any personal information like your name, address or other personal identifying information.
“Normally, insurance quotes require you to give out details like your name, address and sometimes your Social Security Number. However, an anonymous quote allows you to obtain a rough estimate of what your insurance premium might be, based on generic information such as the make and model of the vehicle and perhaps your ZIP code to get a sense of where the vehicle will be primarily located,” says Dennis Shirshikov, an economics professor at the City University of New York.
## Why do some people prefer anonymous quotes?
Many people often prefer anonymous quotes to protect their privacy and bypass potential marketing emails, letters or follow-up calls from auto insurance companies or agents.
“You might be in the early stage of insurance shopping and not ready to commit to any particular provider just yet. Perhaps you have concerns about how your personal information is being handled or used,” Shirshikov says. “There’s a sense of freedom and ease in exploring options anonymously without any pressure.”
## Pros and cons of getting anonymous car insurance quotes
Lauren McKenzie, an insurance broker with A Plus Insurance, agrees that one of the major advantages of anonymous quotes is that you can obtain accurate car insurance quote estimates without compromising your private information.
“This can be important if you value your privacy or confidentiality or are concerned about sharing sensitive information like your address,” she says.
Another plus? It will likely take less time to [get an auto insurance quote](https://www.carinsurance.com/how-to-get-a-car-insurance-quote/) if you only provide basic info for a car insurance calculator minus your personal details.
However, even anonymous auto insurance quotes might not be as accurate. That’s because they don’t account for your complete driving history, credit score and other [personal factors that could affect the insurance premium](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/10-factors-that-affect-your-car-insurance-rates.aspx).
“Your actual premium may vary significantly once the insurer has more of these needed details,” McKenzie says.

## What personal information do insurance companies require to get a quote?
While you can always provide a nickname or alias when pursuing anonymous car insurance quotes, you’ll still need to give the insurance agent, broker or salesperson at least a few key details.
“This includes basic information about your vehicle, such as its make and model, year of manufacture and perhaps brief information about your age, gender and driving history – such as if you’ve had any accidents or violations. This information helps the carrier provide you with a closer estimate of what your insurance premium might look like,” McKenzie says.
The more precise information you provide, your quote will likely be more accurate. But if you’re in a hurry or want to avoid ending up on marketing lists before binding a policy, you can try to reveal as little as the insurer will allow for an anonymous quote.
Eventually, when you’re ready to choose a carrier and decide on specific coverages within a policy, you’ll need to divulge more necessary details. These can include:
  * The full name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, Social Security Number (if requested) and phone number for all drivers on the policy.
  * The vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model, year and mileage for every vehicle you want to be insured.
  * Facts about your driving history and any tickets, infractions or accidents incurred by insured drivers.
  * Details on how, when and where you most often plan to drive your vehicle.
  * Personal info on if you own or rent a home, income, profession and more.


### Why car insurance companies request personal information
Insurers require your private information to be able to deliver a more precise and reliable quote. They’ll need to obtain a soft credit report on you and verify that your driving status is intact, with no major violations or convictions on your record.
“Car insurance premiums are calculated based on many different rating factors, such as your age, gender, credit score and physical location. Providing small required details like gender and age make a significant impact on the premium,” McKenzie says.
## How to get an anonymous car insurance quote
Ready to try getting an anonymous car insurance quote? The experts say you should be prepared to provide at least information on your car’s make, model, year and mileage and the area/city or ZIP code where you live.
If the insurer asks for details you aren’t prepared to furnish, be upfront and explain that you’re simply looking for a quick anonymous rate quote without revealing your personal details.
### Get an anonymous quote with car insurance calculators
You may be able to find and use online tools, websites or other [car insurance online calculators](https://www.carinsurance.com/calculators/) to generate anonymous rate quotes.
## What do you do after you get an anonymous car insurance quote?
Getting anonymous rate quotes is a good starting point for car insurance shopping. [Compare quotes across different car insurance companies](https://www.carinsurance.com/car-insurance-comparison.aspx), to see who offers the best deal.
“If you find a quote that’s competitive and the insurance company has good reviews, consider contacting that insurer for a more customized quote,” Shishikov says.
When you’re ready to get serious about getting a quote, you must provide personal details for an accurate personalized rate quote.
## Which companies require the least personal information for a quote?
Several insurers have built a reputation for requiring less personal information for preliminary quotes, with [car insurance companies](https://www.carinsurance.com/list-of-car-insurance-companies/) including Allstate, Travelers, State Farm, GEICO, The General and Progressive.
“Companies like Progressive and GEICO offer platforms where you can get initial quotes on insurance rates with minimal information,” Shirshikov says.
## Final thoughts on anonymous quotes
Remember that while anonymous quotes provide a good starting point, a more personalized quote will give you a better understanding of how much you’ll pay for auto insurance. The customized quote process comprises the private details necessary for the carrier to calculate your premium accurately.

## FAQs
### Can I get accurate quotes without revealing personal information?
Yes. Many insurers will allow you to provide only basic, generic information – such as your ZIP code and your vehicle’s make, model and year – to generate anonymous quotes.
### Can I get a quote without sharing my name and contact number?
Yes. Several carriers won’t require that you divulge your full name or phone number to receive an anonymous rate quote. However, this anonymous quote won’t be as accurate because the insurer needs more details.
### Can I obtain a quote without providing my Vehicle Identification Number?
Yes, it’s possible to obtain a car insurance quote without providing any vehicle information or your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), but the quote you receive may not be as precise as one that includes your VIN – which contains crucial information about your particular vehicle that will affect the insurance premium.
### Is it safe to get a quote without my Social Security Number?
An auto insurance company may or may not ask for your Social Security Number when you request to get a car insurance rate quote. You should be safe whether or not you provide your Social Security Number; any personal information you provide should be kept confidential by the carrier.
