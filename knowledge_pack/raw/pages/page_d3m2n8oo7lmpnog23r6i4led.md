[ ![Post this release on X](https://content.presspage.com/assets/8f5a482826e7b872907d81ba224126ea7d62b233/images/x-post-flat.png) ](https://x.com/intent/post?text=Additional%20options%20for%20customers%20in%20need%20of%20a%20rental%20or%20replacement%20vehicle&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.statefarm.com%2Ffor-customers-in-need-of-a-rental-vehicle%2F)
State Farm is fortunate to have relationships with vendors who help our customers recover after devastating events such as the recent wildfire activity.* To support our customers:
  * A special Enterprise Rent-A-Car rental rate is available at certain Southern California neighborhood locations on select cars and SUVs through the following [link](https://partners.rentalcar.com/state-farm).
  * In need of a truck or van? Enterprise Truck Rental is offering a special rental rate that is available at certain Southern California neighborhood locations on select vehicle types through the following [link](https://www.enterprisetrucks.com/truckrental/en_US/promotions/state-farm-policyholders.html?mcid=response:45079454&CID=SFCAFRL.).
  * For these rentals, Enterprise is waiving its young renter fee, additional driver fee and one-way drop fee. Renter must meet standard Enterprise rental requirements for each vehicle type.
  * Enterprise Car Sales is offering $500 off the purchase of a vehicle at certain Southern California dealerships. To take advantage of this benefit, [click here](https://www.enterprise.com/content/dam/ent-brand/LOB/na-replacement-and-leisure/insurance-replacement/la-wildfire-relief-jan2025/ECS-California-Wildfire-Voucher.pdf). Participants will be asked to provide insurance policy number at point of purchase.
  * California customers with questions about this opportunity should contact their State Farm agent.


*Enterprise benefits are available independent of the State Farm Car Policy benefits and the availability of the Enterprise benefits do not impact insurance coverage under the State Farm Car Policy.
