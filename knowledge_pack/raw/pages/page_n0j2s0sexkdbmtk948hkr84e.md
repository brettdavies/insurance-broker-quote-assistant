## How to get SR-22 insurance
Most car insurance companies offer SR-22 insurance, but some don’t. It’s good to let the companies you contact for quotes know about your SR-22 requirement up front. This can spare you the time of having to fill out insurance questionnaires for companies that don’t have it.
  * Most companies add a small SR-22 filing fee of about $25 to your rate.
  * Your insurance company usually files your SR-22 certificate with your state’s DMV when you buy your policy. Make sure to confirm this with the company you choose.
  * You can often get non-owners SR-22 insurance if you don’t own a car. A non-owners SR-22 policy lets you legally drive cars that you  borrow  If you regularly borrow the same car, its owner may need to add you to their policy. You can check with their insurance company to find out.  or rent.


### SR-22 car insurance coverage requirements
You usually only need to meet your state’s minimum auto insurance requirements to get an SR-22. Most states require liability insurance. A few also make you get  uninsured motorist  Uninsured motorist covers you and your passengers for injuries caused by a driver with no insurance. It’s required in about 20 states and optional everywhere else.  (UM) and  personal injury protection  PIP covers injuries to you and your passengers, whether you or another driver causes the accident. It also covers lost wages and certain other expenses.  (PIP).
You usually need to add  collision  Collision covers damage to your car from a collision with another vehicle or object.  and  comprehensive  Comprehensive covers your car for theft and damage from non-collision causes, like fire, flood and vandalism.  (comp) to your policy for a loan or lease. Both coverages come with a deductible, which is your share of repair costs.
## How to save money on SR-22 car insurance
You can often save money on SR-22 insurance by shopping around, adjusting your coverage and using [car insurance discounts](https://www.lendingtree.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-discounts/).
### SR-22 car insurance shopping tips
The average cost of car insurance goes up by 85% after a major violation like a DUI to $324 a month. However, some companies raise their rates by smaller amounts. Getting quotes from multiple companies helps you find the best rate for your situation.
  * Some companies, including State Farm and Allstate, work with exclusive agents. You have to contact these companies separately for quotes.
  * Other companies, including Auto-Owners and Progressive, work with independent agents. An independent agent can get you quotes from multiple companies at once.


It’s good to ask the insurance agents who give you quotes which companies they represent. This helps you make sure you get quotes from all the companies you want to contact. It also helps you avoid having multiple agents give you quotes from the same companies.
### Money-saving SR-22 coverage tips
You can also save money on SR-22 insurance by choosing high deductibles or dropping full coverage.
Since your deductibles come out of your pocket, you don’t want them to be too high. However, just raising them from $500 to $1,000 usually provides noticeable savings.
You may be better off without full coverage if your vehicle’s value is less than a few thousand dollars. Insurance only covers your car at its depreciated value, minus your deductible.
If you have a $1,000 deductible for a $3,000 car, insurance only pays $2,000 if it’s totaled or stolen. For comparison, dropping collision and comp can knock about $1,000 off your annual insurance rate.
### Best discounts for SR-22 insurance
Bundling your car insurance with a home or renters policy usually gets you a big discount. You can add to your savings by using your insurance company’s safe driving app, if it has one. Ask about these other discounts when you get your quotes.
