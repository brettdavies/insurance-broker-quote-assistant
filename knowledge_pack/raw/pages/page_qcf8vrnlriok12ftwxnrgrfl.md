## What are the minimum requirements for motorcycle insurance in Illinois?
Illinois motorcycle law requires all riders to carry [motorcycle liability coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/motorcycle-liability-coverage/) for bodily injury and property damage. Liability coverage may pay for injuries and damages you cause to others while riding, up to your policy's limits. Property damage liability coverage, however, doesn't cover your own motorcycle. You can increase the amount of liability coverage, if necessary, to protect your assets more fully.
Required coverage | What it covers | Minimum amount  
---|---|---  
[Bodily injury liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/bodily-injury-liability/) |  What it coversInjuries you cause to others in an accident |  Minimum amount$25,000 per person  
$50,000 per accident  
[Property damage liability](https://www.progressive.com/answers/property-damage-liability/) |  What it coversProperty damage you cause to others in an accident |  Minimum amount$20,000 per accident

Collision can cover your motorcycle if it collides with another object or vehicle, regardless of who's [at fault](https://www.progressive.com/answers/at-fault-vs-no-fault-accidents/).
