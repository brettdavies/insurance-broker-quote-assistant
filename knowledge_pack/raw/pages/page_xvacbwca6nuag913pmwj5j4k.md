## Should Seniors Bundle Home and Auto Insurance?
Combining home and auto insurance policies can be a smart move for seniors looking for ways to save money. Many insurance providers offer multi-policy discounts, which lower overall premiums.
Additionally, bundling policies can simplify insurance policy management. Since billing is consolidated and customer service is under one company, seniors may find it easier to track payments, policy updates and claims. Depending on the insurance provider, you may also find bonus features like loyalty rewards or enhanced coverage options.
### Is It Cheaper to Bundle Home and Auto Insurance?
Getting a home and auto insurance bundle is typically cheaper than buying separate policies. An unbundled auto insurance policy costs an average of $925 per year, while a home insurance plan costs an average of $1,718 per year. That's a total of $2,643 per year.
The average total cost of a bundled home and auto insurance policy is $2,071 per year. This helps seniors save an average of $572 annually.
Insurance Type | Average Estimate (Not Bundled) | Average Estimate (Bundled) | Average Savings  
---|---|---|---  
Auto | $925 | $784 | $141  
Home | $1,718 | $1,287 | $431  
Combined | $2,643 | $2,071 | $572  
### Is It Better to Bundle Home and Auto Insurance?
Whether bundling home and auto insurance is better depends on your specific needs and circumstances. However, there are generally several advantages for seniors.
![bank icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/bank_xefjcz.svg)
**Single Point of Contact**
Managing policies through one insurer reduces the need to coordinate with multiple companies, simplifying communication for claims and customer service.
![securePayment icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/securePayment_of1xqh.svg)
**One Payment**
Bundled insurance typically results in one combined bill, making budgeting and payment scheduling easier to handle.
![checkList icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/moneygeek/image/upload/v1585171420/assets/components/icon/checkList_iwqocr.svg)
**Streamlined Claims Process**
If an incident affects both the home and vehicle, bundled policies can lead to faster and more efficient claims resolution without navigating two separate processes.

## How Seniors Can Save Money When Bundling Home and Auto Insurance
Bundling home and auto insurance already provides savings, but there are ways seniors can maximize the value even more.
  1. 1
Compare Quotes From Multiple Companies
Rates and discount amounts vary by insurer. Comparing bundle quotes from at least three providers helps seniors find the best combination of coverage and price.
  2. 2
Ask About Policy Customization
Tailoring coverage to actual needs, rather than accepting a default package, can help seniors avoid paying for unnecessary extras while maintaining strong protection.
  3. 3
Maintain a Strong Credit Score
Some insurers use credit information when determining rates. Seniors with good credit often qualify for better discounts on bundled policies.
  4. 4
Increase Deductibles Carefully
Choosing higher deductibles can lower premiums. Seniors with enough savings to cover a higher deductible in an emergency can benefit from lower overall insurance costs.
  5. 5
Check for Additional Discounts
Many insurers offer multiple discount opportunities beyond bundling. Ask about available promotions, loyalty incentives or safe homeowner discounts to maximize savings.
  6. 6
Consider Bundling Additional Policies
Seniors who need other types of insurance, such as umbrella or [life insurance](https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/life/), can often bundle additional policies for even bigger discounts.
  7. 7
Reassess Policy and Needs Annually
Needs and circumstances can change over time. Reviewing bundled policies every year ensures seniors maintain the right coverage and take advantage of new discounts or better pricing.
