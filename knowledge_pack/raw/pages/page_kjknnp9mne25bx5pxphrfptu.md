## Can you save on home insurance with a security system?
The savings you can expect from a [home security system](https://www.progressive.com/home-security/) discount will vary by insurer and the specific types of anti-theft or safety devices your insurer may offer a discount for. However, the true value of a security system lies in the losses it might help prevent.
Offering an insurance discount for an alarm system to homeowners who install home security cameras and other devices provides even more opportunity for them to do what they can to make their home less of a target for would-be thieves.
##  How much do you save on home insurance with an alarm? 
The amount of your discount, if any, varies by insurer.
While the home security insurance discount you might receive for installing a security system won’t cover the cost of the system itself, the peace of mind and sense of protection for you and your family may be worth it in addition to any future savings you may also incur.
## What types of security devices can help lower your home insurance rate?
You may receive a protective devices discount for a variety of safety and anti-theft devices, including:
  * **Security systems** : Many security systems are on the market today, with both DIY and professional monitoring options. Many providers will offer insurance discounts for video surveillance cameras and home security systems equipped with an alarm, door and window sensors, and motion sensors. These devices are designed to deter potential criminals and alert you (and your neighbors) of an intrusion.
  * **Smoke detectors and fire alarms** : While many insurance companies require smoke detectors to qualify for a policy, having monitored smoke detectors may make you eligible for a fire alarm credit on homeowners insurance.
  * **Sprinkler systems** : Besides having monitored smoke detectors, having a sprinkler system may provide extra savings.


### Security cameras and homeowners insurance
Some insurance companies may extend a discount for security cameras and other security systems and connected, smart home devices, whether linked to a dedicated monitoring station or self-monitored by the homeowner. Check with your [homeowners insurance](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/) company to see what discounts they may offer.
## Besides theft, what other benefits does a home security system offer?
In a study funded by the [Alarm Industry Research and Educational Foundation (AIREF)](https://alarm.org/burglars-confess-why-your-home-is-a-target/) , researchers found that about 83% of survey respondents (who were convicted burglars) said they would seek an alternative target if they could determine that an alarm system was present before attempting a burglary. When you consider that the average loss from a single burglary typically exceeds $2,000, adding a home security camera to your house to reduce insurance might make sense.
Outside of protecting your home from potential thieves, your home security system may also offer:
  * Sprinkler systems can help to mitigate a fire by dowsing flames and preventing or slowing their spread. A monitored smoke alarm can protect your home by alerting you when the smoke detector goes off when you're away.
  * Water sensors to help detect leaks before they worsen or warn you of a malfunctioning HVAC system
  * Protection against liability claims. If something unfortunate occurs on your property and you shoulder the blame, security camera footage might resolve the dilemma or provide evidence of what really occurred.


If lowering your rate is your goal, there are other steps you can take help keep your [rate cheap](https://www.progressive.com/homeowners/discounts/cheap-home-insurance/) while achieving the right amount of protection.
