Car insurance prices increased over 22 percent from 2023 to 2024, outpacing the rate of inflation.[1](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/cheap/#citation-1) That’s why we researched hundreds of providers to find [auto insurance companies](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/) that offer affordable rates without skimping on coverage. We use the latest industry data, independent ratings, and real-life customer experience to assess companies’ rates, claims process, and customer satisfaction.
For this review, we prioritized carriers with low rates that remain relatively stable at each renewal. We also analyzed rates by driver profile, so you can find the lowest premiums regardless of your age, driving record, or location.
Your auto insurance needs are unique to your circumstances. If you have a DUI, multiple accidents, or other violations, check out our guide to [auto insurance with a bad record](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/bad-record/). If you’re looking for [auto insurance for seniors](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/seniors/) or [auto insurance for teens](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/teens/), we’ve reviewed those, too.
## Who has the cheapest car insurance? 
If you are eligible, USAA tends to have the cheapest car insurance, with an average monthly rate of $117 for full coverage and just $35 monthly for minimum coverage.
For non-military drivers, GEICO, Erie, Nationwide, State Farm, Progressive, and Root tend to have the cheapest rates. Note that Erie is a regional provider available in 12 states; and Root is a usage-based provider, meaning safe drivers with low annual mileage will save the most.
Below we’ve summarized the cheapest car insurance companies based on the type of insurance or the type of driver seeking insurance.
Cheapest by Category | Carrier | Average Monthly Rate | Average Annual Rate  
---|---|---|---  
Full coverage | Root | $93 | $1,120  
Minimum coverage | GEICO* | $43 | $517  
Large provider  
(available in all 50 states) | GEICO | $144 | $1,731  
[Low credit score](https://www.autoinsurance.com/loans/best/bad-credit/) |  [Erie](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/erie/reviews/)** | $128 | $1,532  
Teens | GEICO* | $408 | $4,891  
Seniors | [Nationwide](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/nationwide/reviews/) | $126 | $1,511  
[After a DUI](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/dui/) | Progressive | $231 | $2,770  
After a speeding ticket | Erie** | $147 | $1,765  
[Military members and veterans](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/veterans/) | USAA | $117 | $1,407  
*USAA technically offers the cheapest average rates for these categories, but it is only available to the military community.
**Erie is only available to drivers in certain states. GEICO is the next-cheapest after Erie, and is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
Auto insurance companies determine your premium based on a variety of factors, including your age, gender, driving history, marital status, and location. As you can see in the table above, providers can specialize in different types of insurance — like [car insurance for seniors](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/seniors-drive-less-than-5000-miles/) or for [high-risk drivers](https://www.autoinsurance.com/best/high-risk/) — so your quotes will vary.
####  ![Car and cell phone](https://images.autoinsurance.com/app/uploads/2023/02/15183132/step-3.svg)Our Top Options for the Cheapest Auto Insurance
  1. **Root – Cheapest for Safe Drivers**  
Root’s unique usage-based insurance determines your rates based on how safely you drive. Because Root insures only safe drivers who exhibit good driving habits, it’s able to keep its prices low.
  2. **USAA – Cheapest for Military and Veterans**  
USAA offers the cheapest average rates among the major national insurers, along with discounts, bundling options, and specialized resources. Its coverage is limited to military members, veterans, and their families, who must become USAA members to access its benefits.
  3. **GEICO – Cheapest for Minimum Coverage**  
If you’re looking for only the state minimum coverage, GEICO may be your best option. In general, minimum coverage is already cheaper than full coverage, but with GEICO, you can save even more with its low average rates.

[Read Full Review](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/root/reviews/)
Root is our top provider for drivers with safe driving habits and a good driving record. Although Root is the cheapest insurance on our list ($1,120 annually for full coverage), signing up comes with a few caveats. Root is able to offer great rates because it denies coverage to high-risk drivers, especially high-risk drivers with a bad record.

### Cheap Insurance for Safe Drivers
Here’s how much Root’s full coverage may cost safe drivers compared to competitors:
Company | Full Coverage (Annual) | Full Coverage (Monthly)  
---|---|---  
Root | $1,120 | $93  
USAA | $1,407 | $117  
Erie | $1,647 | $137  
GEICO | $1,731 | $144  
Nationwide | $1,808 | $151  
Metromile | $1,855 | $155  
[American Family](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/american-family/reviews/) | $1,936 | $161  
Progressive | $1,960 | $163  
State Farm | $2,167 | $181  
[Clearcover](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/clearcover/reviews/) | $1,994 | $166  
[Allstate](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/allstate/reviews/) | $2,605 | $217  
[Gainsco](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/gainsco/reviews/) | $2,909 | $242  
### Test-Drive Process
Part of why Root can offer such low rates is its strict vetting process. You must sign up for a test drive and allow Root to track your driving behavior for up to 30 days to get a quote.
Root connects to your smartphone and uses already available features — GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope — to measure your driving habits across those 30 days. Its tracking system will identify what time of day you’re driving, how many miles you’ve driven, your turn speed, and more. If your driving habits meet its standards, it will approve you and offer you some of the cheapest rates available.
### Safe Driver Discount Model
Root has a unique [auto insurance discount](https://www.autoinsurance.com/cost/discounts/) model that makes benefiting from savings much easier for customers. While it offers traditional bundling discounts for car and renters insurance, most of the company’s safe-driver discounts will be integrated into your final quote automatically. So rather than having to ask an agent for your eligible discounts or applying for a discount, Root will apply a number of safety discounts to your quote. Drivers with the best driving records and test drive scores will be eligible for the lowest prices.
### 2. Cheapest for Military Drivers - USAA
![USAA Logo 2023](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2F28182057%2FUSAA-Logo-2023.png&w=640&q=75)

[Read Full Review](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/reviews/)
USAA has offered financial products to the military community since 1922. It has the cheapest average rates out of the top 10 largest insurance providers and also offers various discounts, bundling options, and resources for military members.
The caveat with USAA is that it’s only available only to military members, veterans, and their families (spouses and children). Those eligible must become a USAA member in order to take advantage of its offerings, which include affordable rates, specialized coverage and discounts, financial advice, and more.

  * ![con](https://www.autoinsurance.com/assets/icons/icn-close-circle-line.svg)
Non-USAA members


### Specialized Military Discounts
One of the key discounts offered by USAA is a vehicle storage discount, which is particularly useful to active military members who are deployed abroad or stationed away from home and don’t have access to their vehicle(s).
With USAA, you can earn a discount of up to 60 percent on your car insurance policy if you’re out of state on military duty and keep your car securely stored. You may also be eligible for a 15 percent discount on comprehensive coverage if you garage your vehicle on a military installation.
### Save With Usage-Based Insurance
USAA offers pay-as-you-drive policies through Noblr, a USAA subsidiary, which tracks your driving and allows you to save on your premium if you drive less than average. It also takes your driving behavior into account, so driving safely will also help you save money. These usage-based policies are currently available in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.
If you don’t necessarily drive less than average but are confident in your safe driving and are looking to save more, USAA also has its [SafePilot](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/usaa/safepilot/) telematics program, which will track your driving habits and reward good driving with a discount.
### USAA Military Perks
USAA is a particularly good choice for military members not only because of its affordable rates but also thanks to its additional perks that members have access to. Here are some of the added benefits offered by USAA:
  * 24/7 membership support for insurance, deployment questions, and transition to life abroad or back to the U.S.
  * Expert advice for managing debt, [loans](https://www.autoinsurance.com/loans/), saving, investing, and other financial needs
  * Discounts for shopping, hotels, travel insurance, and more


### 3. Cheapest for Minimum Coverage - GEICO
![Geico Logo](https://www.autoinsurance.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.autoinsurance.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F06%2F15193840%2FGeico-Logo.png&w=640&q=75)

[GEICO has the cheapest average rates](https://www.autoinsurance.com/companies/geico/) for minimum coverage insurance for non-military drivers at $517 per year on average, making it a great choice for those looking to get the absolute best deal. Minimum coverage always costs less than more robust coverage since you’re opting for a lower level of financial protection, but GEICO stands out with particularly low rates. It also offers a variety of discounts to help drivers save even more.

  * **Clean driving record:** If you’ve been accident-free for at least one year you can get a discount of up to 22 percent.

Accident forgiveness is a useful add-on to your auto insurance policy if you are prone to accidents, have a teen driver on your policy, or simply want added peace of mind. If you have accident forgiveness, GEICO won’t raise your rates following the first at-fault accident of any driver on your policy. It will also allow you to keep your good driver discount.
GEICO policyholders are automatically eligible for accident forgiveness if they have been insured with GEICO for at least five years and have no other qualifying claims within the past five years. GEICO also offers the option to purchase it as a policy add-on in most states.

    * Comprehensive and collision: $500 deductible
  * **Claims Handling (25 percent):** Policyholders rely on insurers to efficiently handle claims, which includes clear communication, fair evaluation of damages, and timely payment or resolution. We assess claims practices through sources like the CRASH Network Insurer Report Card and J.D. Power’s Claims Satisfaction Report, and financial strength from sources like AM Best and S&P Ratings. Real-life customer experiences are included when available.
  * **Customer Experience (25 percent):** We evaluate how easy it is to get a quote and purchase a policy. We also consider the availability and quality of both online and agent interactions, as well as the functionality of the company’s website and mobile app. Our sources include J.D. Power studies, the NAIC complaint index, BBB ratings, and app store reviews.
