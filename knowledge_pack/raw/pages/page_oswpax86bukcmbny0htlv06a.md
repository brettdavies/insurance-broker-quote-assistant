### Nationwide’s good student discount
Nationwide has the highest savings for good students, with an average discount of 20%, based on CarInsurance.com data.
According to Nationwide, the insurer offers a student discount for young drivers ages 16 to 24: “Drivers must be full-time high school or college students and maintain a minimum of a B average to qualify for good student discounts.”

## How long does a good student discount last?
A good student discount stays in effect for different lengths of time, depending on the insurance company. Typically, insurers provide the discount through the early to mid-20s.
Loretta Worters, vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, says a good student discount lasts as long as the teen driver is in school. In addition, a student must maintain a B average or better, avoid accidents and cannot take their vehicle to college.
## How much can I save with a good student discount?
According to IRMI, formerly International Risk Management Institute, Inc., an insurance risk educator and publisher, good student discounts can range from 5% to 15%. State Farm says good student discounts go as high as 25% on their site, but 25% is high – the average is 12.5%.
“It all depends on the insurer,” Worters says.
## Why do young drivers face higher car insurance costs?
In general, young drivers pay the highest car insurance premiums. Newly licensed drivers lack experience behind the wheel and have an increased risk of accidents. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/teen-drivers/risk-factors/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html), young drivers between the ages of 16 and 19 have the highest crash risk out of any other age group. Because young drivers are much riskier to insure than adults, insurance companies charge higher rates.
### Are home-schooled students eligible for a good student discount?
Some homeschooled students may be eligible for a good student discount, but it depends on the car insurance company. For example, [Nationwide’s website](https://www.nationwide.com/personal/insurance/auto/discounts/types/good-student) says that homeschooled students can use their standardized testing scores to qualify for the discount. If the student scores in the top 20% of the test’s national performance, they can get the discount.
To find out whether your car insurance company offers a good student discount to homeschooled students, you should contact an agent.
