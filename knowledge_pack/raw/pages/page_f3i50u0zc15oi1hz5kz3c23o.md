  * SR-22 is a certificate of financial responsibility
  * Geico offers SR-22’s to new or existing customers
  * SR-22’s can be issued due to DUI/DWI’s, reckless driving, and accidents caused by uninsured drivers
  * An SR-22 can remain valid for as long as the Geico auto insurance policy is active


What is an SR-22? And where can you get one?
An SR-22 is formal documentation citing proof of the minimum [liability auto insurance coverage](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/top-liability-insurance-coverage-what-you-need-to-know/ "liability auto insurance coverage") required by your state. The form is typically submitted to the DMV under court order after a charge of reckless driving or a DUI/DWI.
Generally, SR-22’s are issued after the loss of auto insurance due to a driver’s license being suspended by court order.
Once your driving privileges have been reinstated, an SR-22 can be obtained through most auto insurance companies. A Geico SR-22 can be issued if you are a current policy member or if you’d like to start new coverage.
Explore affordable Geico SR-22 rates in your area by [typing your ZIP code](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/geico-sr-22-insurance-coverage-what-you-need-to-know/#mdatop) in the free tool above.
## How to get a Geico SR-22?
To procure an SR-22 with Geico as an existing policyholder you must contact the Geico customer service department. The customer service representative will review your current coverage and start the process of filing the SR-22 certificate.
If you’re not an existing Geico customer, you must follow the following steps:
  1. Start a custom quote
  2. Select and purchase a Geico policy


Once you’ve selected and purchased a policy, you’ll be asked if you need a certificate of financial responsibility. Select “Yes.” After all the steps are completed, Geico will begin the process of filing the SR-22.
If you have any questions or you’d like to speak with a representative, you can call the Geico SR-22 phone number at (800) 861-8380.
Even though Geico is a top auto insurance provider for high-risk drivers, SR-22 still has a higher premium. Rates can increase at least 25% after a DUI/DWI, reckless driving, or other violations.

## SR-22 Insurance
Although it can be referred to as SR-22 insurance, SR-22 is not a form of auto insurance. SR-22 is only a certificate that ensures you will maintain the minimum liability coverage required by your state of residence. (For more information, read our “[Understanding SR-22 Insurance: What is it and who is it for?](https://www.InsuranceProviders.com/understanding-sr-22-insurance-what-is-it-and-who-is-it-for/)“).
The court may require you to keep the SR-22 certificate for at least three years. Geico SR-22 requires a one-time fee for filing an SR-22 of between $15 to $25.
## Geico SR-22 Non-Owner Insurance
Another form of SR-22 insurance is Geico’s [SR-22 insurance for non-owners](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/top-sr-22-auto-insurance-coverage/). Non-owner SR-22 insurance is a form used by persons who don’t have a vehicle to insure, but must still meet the requirement of the court.
Non-owner SR-22 auto insurance is for persons who:
  * are age 21+
  * do not own a vehicle
  * are driving a vehicle that you’re borrowing or renting and the vehicle owner does not live in your household


Like SR-22 insurance, non-owner SR-22 insurance covers the minimum amount of liability insurance. If you don’t have a vehicle, non-owner SR-22 insurance does not cover you but it does provide some level of protection against tickets or suspensions. (For more information, read our “[Non-Owner SR-22 Auto Insurance: What It Is and How to Get It](https://www.insuranceproviders.com/non-owner-sr-22-auto-insurance-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-it/)“).
## Geico SR-22 Insurance Coverage
SR-22’s are not a form of auto insurance coverage. Rather, they are coverage options under several auto insurance companies including Geico.
An SR-22 protects high-risk drivers by certifying they possess at least the state-required amount of liability coverage. Geico offers SR-22’s to both new and existing customers. Once a policy is established, Geico will proceed with filing the SR-22 with the your state DMV.
Geico also offers non-owner SR-22 coverage. Non-owner coverage differs from SR-22 insurance because the recipient doesn’t own a vehicle.
As a staple for high-risk drivers, Geico works to provide fair rates even for those who find themselves in need of an SR-22.
