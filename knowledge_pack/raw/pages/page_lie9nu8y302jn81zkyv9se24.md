#  question about bundled auto-home discounts 
I have auto insurance with Geico and home insurance bundled but the latter is contracted out by them to a regional company. If I switch to a different auto company for a cheaper rate, is my home insurance rate with that other company likely to go up since they are nominally associated with Geico?

Yes it's possible. By how much we wouldn't really know.

Yes, but you never know, some times the bundled savings is less than having everything separate.

They give you a bundle discount for having both -- if your home insurance policy documents or website shows a breakdown of your discounts then you'll know how much it'll go up by if you no longer bundle (probably listed as "multi policy discount")

Yes, and just for the record, auto/home discount is the biggest discount on a homeowners policy so your premium increase could be significant. 30% would not be surprising.

Thanks for the comments, I just chatted with a rep and it looks like we are only saving about $60 over the course of a year, which is pitiful compared to what we would save by switching to cheaper auto insurance and keeping the home with the Geico affiliate.
