At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

## What is State Farm car insurance?
Although State Farm offers various insurance products, it actually started with car insurance as its only offering. In 1922, retired farmer G. J. Mecherle started the company to provide car insurance to rural drivers. Over time, the company grew, and now it offers numerous different products to customers.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/state-farm/#cite-3)

I was a State Farm policyholder for over 30 years, and when I needed them, I got no support or help. Prior agents were significantly better than this one, who doesn't seem to care about her clients.

## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible


Quotes for Allstate, Farmers, GEICO, State Farm, and USAA are estimates based on Quadrant Information Services’ database of auto insurance rates.
