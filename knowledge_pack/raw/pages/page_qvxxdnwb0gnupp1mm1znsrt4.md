![Pros and Cons of Uninsured Motorist Coverage in California](https://cdn-cohml.nitrocdn.com/llNcBddMnPHXNokhFHIZETloHncnFTuC/assets/images/optimized/rev-0401089/seriousaccidents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pros-and-Cons-of-Uninsured-Motorist-Coverage-in-California.jpg)
[California](https://www.ca.gov/) is an at-fault state for car accidents. This means that the party who [caused](https://seriousaccidents.com/personal-injury-resources/causation/) the accident can be held legally responsible for the damages caused by the accident. State law requires specific types of[ car insurance](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/), including liability insurance. Liability insurance coverage compensates victims for damages when an insured driver causes an accident covered by the insurance policy.
However, there are other types of car insurance coverage you may want to consider purchasing to protect your interests. [Uninsured motorist coverage](https://seriousaccidents.com/blog/understanding-uninsured-underinsured-motorist-coverage-in-california/) can be beneficial if you are in an accident with a driver who does not have liability insurance.
## What Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage in California?
[Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/01-auto/auto101.cfm) is not required in California, but insurance companies must offer it. If you decline the coverage, you must sign a waiver stating you are turning it down. UM coverage includes Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI) and Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD). It covers compensatory damages if you are injured in a car accident caused by an uninsured driver or a [hit-and-run driver](https://seriousaccidents.com/san-diego-car-accident-attorney/hit-and-run-accident/). Your UM coverage limits must match your liability limits unless you choose lower limits. 
If you have the state’s minimum liability coverage ($15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident for bodily injury and $5,000 for property damage), your UMBI coverage would be $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident. UMPD is typically limited to $3,500 unless you have collision coverage, which would cover the damages instead. If you purchase higher liability limits, your uninsured motorist coverage increases accordingly.
## What Are the Benefits and Disadvantages of Purchasing Uninsured Motorist Insurance in California?
The primary benefit of purchasing uninsured motorist insurance in California is the protection from losses caused by an uninsured motorist accident or a hit-and-run accident. You can sue the driver who caused your accident, but they may not have sufficient resources to pay your damages. Even if you receive a judgment in your favor, you might not receive any money or a small percentage of your damages.
The only con of purchasing uninsured motorist insurance in California is the cost. However, UM insurance is generally much less costly than liability insurance. When considering the cost of uninsured motorist coverage, it is essential to remember what could happen if you do not have UMC and an uninsured motorist causes your accident.
You are responsible for your medical bills and expenses. Your health insurance may cover some of the bills, but not all. If you are out of work because of your injuries, you may incur substantial lost wages that your liability insurance does not cover. You would not recover compensation for your pain and suffering and other [non-economic damages](https://seriousaccidents.com/personal-injury-resources/non-economic-damages/). 
Having uninsured motorist coverage can provide the compensation you need after a car accident so you do not pay for the[ negligence](https://seriousaccidents.com/personal-injury-resources/negligence/) of an uninsured driver.
## Do I Need to Hire a Car Accident Lawyer to File an Uninsured Motorist Claim in California?
You are not required to hire a [car accident attorney in San Diego, CA](https://seriousaccidents.com/san-diego-car-accident-attorney/), to file an insurance claim after a car accident. However, that does not mean you should not consider hiring an attorney. As with claims against the at-fault driver, a claim under your uninsured motorist insurance policy may not go smoothly. Even though you are dealing with your insurance provider, the adjuster assigned to your claim is acting in the best interest of the insurance company. Therefore, the adjuster will search for reasons to deny your claim or undervalue your damages.
Also, you must prove the uninsured or hit-and-run driver caused the accident to receive damages from your uninsured motorist insurance policy. If your insurance company alleges you are partially to blame for causing the accident, it will decrease the settlement offer for your claim.
Hiring an experienced San Diego car accident attorney may be necessary to prove your claim. A lawyer has the resources to investigate the accident and gather [evidence](https://seriousaccidents.com/personal-injury-resources/evidence/) proving fault. Your attorney also understands the damages and how much your claim is worth. You may not receive the full value of your uninsured motorist claim without an attorney.
## What Should I Do After a Car Accident With an Uninsured Driver?
Treat the car accident just like any other traffic accident by following these steps:
  * Call 911 to report the crash. If the driver fled the accident scene, try to remember as much as possible about the vehicle they were driving.
  * Document the accident scene by making a video and taking photographs.
  * Ask eyewitnesses to give you their names and contact details.
  * Tell the officer the facts without assuming fault. You want to avoid saying something that could be misunderstood as admitting fault.
  * Seek prompt medical treatment to document your injuries.
  * [Report the accident](https://seriousaccidents.com/blog/how-to-obtain-a-car-accident-report-in-california/) to your insurance company as soon as possible.


Never confront a driver for not having the required insurance. It could create a dangerous situation. Instead, allow the police officer to address the matter.
