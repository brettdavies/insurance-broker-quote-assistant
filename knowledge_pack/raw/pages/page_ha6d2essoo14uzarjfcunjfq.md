# What is SR-22 insurance in Illinois?
![reviewer icon](https://www.carinsurance.com/images/blueberry/highlight.svg) Updated on: Mar 17, 2025
In Illinois, if you're deemed a high-risk driver, you may be required to get an SR-22 form. If your insurer requires an SR-22, it could raise your insurance rates.Skip to article
[SR-22 insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/sr22.aspx) in Illinois is not an insurance policy. Rather, it’s a certificate proving financial responsibility that some drivers must submit to the state. It’s necessary for individuals who are found guilty of specific driving offenses, including DUI, driving without insurance and reckless driving.
The SR-22 form is filed by your insurance company with the Illinois Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to prove that you have the state-required minimum liability coverage. This form verifies that you have the necessary insurance coverage in place. If your driving privileges were suspended or revoked and you must carry an SR-22, you must maintain continuous coverage for the period specified by the court or DMV.
This guide outlines what SR-22 insurance covers in Illinois and explains how it impacts your annual premium rates should you require SR-22.

## Who needs an SR-22 in Illinois?
In Illinois, an SR-22 is typically required for individuals whose license was suspended or revoked due to certain violations.
**Some examples of violations that may lead to an SR-22 requirement include:**
  * [DUI or DWI](https://www.carinsurance.com/dui-vs-dwi/) (driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated) conviction
  * [Reckless driving](https://www.carinsurance.com/risky-and-dangerous-driving-behaviors/)
  * [Driving without insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/driving-without-insurance-penalties-state.aspx)
  * Multiple traffic offenses within a short period
  * If you’re involved in an accident and don’t have car insurance, the DMV may suspend your license and require you to file an SR-22
  * Nonpayment of fines or penalties if you’re sued after an accident


In Illinois, an SR-22 is generally needed for 3 years, but this duration can differ based on the specific violation. Throughout this period, it’s crucial to maintain at least the [minimum car insurance required by Illinois](https://www.carinsurance.com/state/state-minimum-car-insurance-in-illinois/) law.

## How do I get an SR-22 in Illinois?
Getting insurance in Illinois involves purchasing a car insurance policy and having the insurance company file an SR-22 form with the [Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.carinsurance.com/MotorVehicle.aspx) (DMV)on your behalf.
Getting the right car insurance:
  * **Reach out to your current insurance company:** Most insurers file SR-22s, but your auto insurance rate increase will depend on the carrier.
  * **Compare quotes from other insurers:**[ Shop around and compare quotes from different car insurance carriers](https://www.carinsurance.com/car-insurance-comparison.aspx) who offer SR-22 coverage. Be transparent about your need for SR-22 to get accurate quotes.
  * **Meet**[**state minimum liability requirements**](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/minimum-liability-car-insurance-requirements-by-state.aspx)**:** Illinois mandates a minimum of 25/50/20.


Filing the SR-22:
  * **Inform your insurer about your SR-22 requirement.** They’ll handle the paperwork and submit the form to the DMV.
  * **Pay any associated fees.** Expect an SR-22 filing fee from your insurance company on top of the increased premium for your high-risk status.
  * **Maintain continuous insurance.** A [lapse in coverage](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/lapse-in-coverage-penalties-by-state.aspx) may result in the DMV suspending your license again.


Having an SR-22 may increase your car insurance costs because it signifies a riskier driver. To minimize the impact, compare quotes from different insurers and focus on safe driving habits to get lower rates in the future.

## How long do I need SR-22 insurance in Illinois?
In Illinois, you are required to have SR-22 coverage for a period of 3 years. This confirms to the Illinois DMV that you have the state-mandated minimum insurance coverage.
SR-22 insurance varies by state and the reason you need it. Usually, it’s required for three years but in some cases, it might be longer. For example, if someone has repeat violations, the requirement could extend out to five years, says Dr. James Brau, Joel C. Peterson professor of finance at Brigham Young University.
## How do I check my SR-22 status online in Illinois?
There are two ways to check the status of your SR-22. Visit the official website of your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Most states allow you to check your SR-22 status through their online services. You can also contact your state’s DMV directly via phone.
## What happens if I cancel my insurance?
If you discontinue your SR-22 insurance in Illinois before the mandated period ends, you could face severe consequences.
  * **Driver’s license suspension:** If your SR-22 policy is canceled, your insurance provider will notify the state. This typically leads to a suspension of your driver’s license since insurance coverage must be maintained for the mandated period.
  * **Fines and penalties:** In some states, you might face additional fines or penalties for not complying with the SR-22 requirement.
  * **Extended probationary period:** If your SR-22 is part of a probation period for a driving offense, canceling it might restart your probationary period.
  * **Increased insurance costs:** A lapse in coverage and violations on your driving record resulting from SR-22 policy cancellation can lead to significantly higher insurance premiums in the future.


Failing to maintain continuous SR-22 coverage for the mandated period can result in legal consequences and the suspension of your driving privileges.
## How to get an SR-22 removed in Illinois
The most common [way to get your SR-22 removed](https://www.carinsurance.com/kb/how-to-cancel-SR-22-after-3-years) is to wait until the required filing period is over. In Illinois, the standard SR-22 filing period is 3 years from its filing date.
Brau explains that you should maintain continuous insurance coverage without any lapses. If you cancel your policy or let it expire, the SR-22 will no longer be valid. Wait out the required period. During this time, drive responsibly and maintain your insurance coverage.
“Check with your state’s DMV and confirm the exact duration and any additional requirements for removal. Some states may require you to submit a formal request or provide proof of good driving behavior,” he says.
“Once the required period has passed, ask your insurer to file an SR-26 form with the DMV. This form notifies them that you no longer need an SR-22. After your insurer submits the SR-26, check with the DMV to ensure the SR-22 is officially removed from your record.”
## How does an SR-22 affect car insurance rates in Illinois?
The requirement of an SR-22 certificate can increase your car insurance premiums significantly. Most insurance companies consider drivers with SR-22 high risk, resulting in premium hikes.
Your [specific increase in rates will vary based on various factors](https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/10-factors-that-affect-your-car-insurance-rates.aspx), including your [driving record](https://www.carinsurance.com/how-to-check-your-driving-record) and the reason for the SR-22.
Don’t settle for the first offer. Compare quotes from multiple insurers to get the best deal on car insurance with an SR-22. If you stay violation-free and comply with the SR-22 requirements, your rates could go down over time.
