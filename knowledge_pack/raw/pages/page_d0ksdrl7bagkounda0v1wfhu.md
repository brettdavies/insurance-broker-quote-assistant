# What is Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage?
[ Read More Of What Our Clients Have to Say Here ](https://www.richmondvona.com/reviews/)
New York law requires all drivers to carry liability insurance under its no-fault laws, but sometimes the minimum coverage won’t pay for all your medical expenses after an accident. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM) is a crucial lifeline for Empire State drivers, allowing them to recover damages after a collision with another driver who doesn’t have enough insurance to cover medical costs that exceed no-fault limits.
The [experienced New York car accident lawyers at Richmond Vona](https://www.richmondvona.com/about-us/) understand the state’s no-fault laws and how uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage can impact your case. If you’ve been injured in a car accident and don’t know what to do next, [contact us online](https://www.richmondvona.com/contact-us/) or call [716-500-5678](tel:7165005678) today for a free consultation.

## Understanding Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is insurance that kicks in when you would be entitled to recover compensation from another driver who doesn’t hold an insurance policy, which is often required under state law. Similarly, underinsured motorist (UIM/SUM) coverage fills the gap when a liable driver’s insurance isn’t enough to cover your damages.
[Since New York has a no-fault insurance system](https://www.richmondvona.com/blog/understanding-new-yorks-no-fault-law/), most minor car accidents won’t require you to use your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. However, if you suffer serious injuries or have damages exceeding your policy limits, these coverages allow you to receive more compensation even when the other driver doesn’t have [insurance to pursue](https://www.richmondvona.com/faqs/who-can-i-sue-after-a-car-accident-in-new-york/).
Our team secured [a $375,000 settlement](https://www.richmondvona.com/story/maine-vacation-drunk-driving-375k/) for a husband and wife injured by a drunk, uninsured driver when vacationing in Maine. If you’re hurt by an uninsured or underinsured driver, our experienced team can help you pursue all available compensation.
## Why is Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Important in New York?
New York requires drivers to hold a minimum of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident in UM coverage, the same mandatory amounts as standard liability insurance. UIM/SUM is generally optional (often offered to match your BI limits unless you select lower limits or decline it), but carrying it is strongly recommended. Going without these coverages is [incredibly risky](https://www.richmondvona.com/videos/what-to-do-if-youre-hit-by-an-underinsured-driver-without-uim/): You may be forced to cover medical bills and lost wages out of pocket, which can be very pricey in New York.
Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is key for peace of mind, ensuring you’ll be protected when other drivers don’t hold up their end of the no-fault system. UM/UIM will also cover damages resulting from a hit-and-run accident, as there won’t be a known at-fault driver to pursue.
> "We’ve had countless cases where uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage—UM/UIM—made all the difference in the outcome. Even when the at-fault driver didn’t have enough insurance to cover our client’s losses, we were able to tap into our client’s own UM/UIM policy to secure a much higher settlement. It’s one of the most important coverages you can carry, and we know exactly how to use it to make sure our clients are fully compensated.”

## Are There Any Time Limits for Filing a UM or UIM Claim in New York?
New York’s [statute of limitations](https://www.richmondvona.com/faqs/what-is-the-personal-injury-statute-of-limitations-in-new-york/) for personal injury claims is typically three years after an accident. However, UM/UIM claims are made against your own insurance policy, and your insurer may require you to notify them of an accident and make a formal claim much sooner.
Our knowledgeable [New York car accident attorneys](https://www.richmondvona.com/new-york/car-accident-lawyer/) can review your insurance policy to determine what time limits might be in place. Then, we can help you notify your insurer, build a case, and file a timely claim as quickly as possible.
## Trust Richmond Vona to help you Get The Compensation You Deserve After a Car Accident
Even if you have sufficient UM/UIM coverage, your insurance company may still attempt to underpay your claim. The [experienced New York car accident lawyers](https://www.richmondvona.com/new-york/car-accident-lawyer/) with Richmond Vona can help protect your rights and fight to get all the compensation you’re entitled to under your policy.
