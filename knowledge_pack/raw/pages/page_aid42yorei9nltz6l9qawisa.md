### Chicago rates by deductible amount
The cost of home insurance in Chicago, IL can vary significantly based on the [deductible](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-deductible/) amount you choose.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ######  Do I need flood insurance in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
Flooding can happen anywhere, even if you don't live near a large body of water. An overflowing culvert, for example, may be enough to cause a wet basement. Many Chicagoans live near Lake Michigan, while others have homes near smaller bodies of water, such as the Des Plaines River — all of which can flood in the right conditions. To find out your risk of flooding, check out FEMA's [Flood Map Service Center](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home), which allows you to input your address to find out if there is a high risk of flooding in your neighborhood. If you need [flood insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance/), your home insurance company may be able to help you, or you can look into purchasing a policy from the National Flood Insurance Program.
  * ######  What does homeowners insurance cover in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
Homeowners insurance in Chicago [typically covers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-does-homeowners-insurance-cover/) several key areas to protect your home and belongings. Standard policies usually include dwelling coverage, which helps repair or rebuild your home if it’s damaged by covered perils like fire, wind or hail. Personal property coverage is also common, protecting your belongings such as furniture, electronics and clothing. Liability coverage is included to help pay for legal expenses if someone is injured on your property, and additional living expenses coverage can assist with temporary living costs if your home is uninhabitable due to a covered event.
  * ######  How much home insurance do I need in Chicago?
Caret Down Icon
As a general rule, most insurance professionals recommend you [have enough dwelling insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/how-much-homeowners-insurance/) to cover your home’s rebuild value and enough personal property insurance to cover the value of your personal items like clothing, furniture and appliances. Your liability coverage limit may be based on your personal assets, such as your income, savings and retirement accounts. When in doubt, you may find it helpful to consult with a licensed agent to determine if you have sufficient coverage.
  * ######  How can I get home insurance online?
Caret Down Icon
More home insurance companies than ever allow people to request quotes and purchase home insurance online.

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well auto and home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC).
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways a home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.
