## What Does Liability Car Insurance Cover in Illinois?
Your liability [car insurance coverage](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-are-the-different-types-of-car-insurance.html) pays for injuries, property damage, and other losses you cause in a car accident, up to coverage limits. Here are a few examples of what liability insurance covers:
  * You [rear-end](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-fault-automatic-rear-end-car-accident-case.html) another car at a stop sign and cause damage.
  * You crash into your neighbor's fence.
  * You hit a [bicyclist in an intersection](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/bike-accidents-collisions-with-cars-29549-2.html) and cause injuries and property damage.


Liability insurance doesn't pay for your vehicle damage or injuries after a car accident. If you want coverage for your car repair bills, you need to purchase [collision and comprehensive](https://www.alllaw.com/auto-accidents/what-s-the-difference-between-collision-and-comprehensive-car-insurance-coverage.html#:~:text=Comprehensive%20automobile%20insurance%20covers%20damage,hitting%20an%20animal%20while%20driving.) car insurance.

Are you seeking compensation for an injury? Yes Not Sure
Medical payments (MedPay) coverage will pay medical bills for you and your passengers no matter who caused the accident, up to policy limits. Learn more about [MedPay claims](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pip-or-medpay-car-insurance-claim-tips.html).
### Who Is Covered Under a Liability Car Insurance Policy?
Your liability coverage typically covers drivers who are named on your policy, most household members, and "[permissive users](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/permissive-use-car-insurance-coverage.html#:~:text=Permissive%20use%20in%20an%20automobile,permission%20to%20use%20your%20car.)."
Household members can be related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Permissive users are people who have permission to drive your car. For example, if you allow a friend to borrow your car, your friend would be a permissive user.
Your liability insurance covers you when you drive your car and will likely cover you if [you get into an accident in a rental car](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/i-got-into-a-car-accident-while-driving-a-rental-car.html).
Learn more about [who is covered under your car insurance policy](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/car-insurance-what-drivers-and-vehicles-are-covered.html).
> Illinois car insurance policies usually include uninsured motorist coverage at the same minimums that exist for liability coverage.
### Is the Minimum Amount of Liability Coverage Enough in Illinois?
You can—and in some cases should—carry more coverage than the minimum amount required by state law. If you cause a serious car accident that leaves multiple people with significant injuries, their crash-related medical bills can quickly exceed the $50,000 liability minimum in Illinois. If that happens, you'll be personally on the hook for any amount above your coverage limits.
## Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage Required in Illinois?
Liability insurance policies in Illinois usually include [uninsured motorist coverage](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-make-underinsured-uninsured-driver-insurance-claim.html) at the same minimums set by the state for liability coverage ($25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident).
Uninsured motorist insurance covers your accident-related losses if you're in a crash with an at-fault driver who is uninsured. Depending on how much uninsured motorist coverage you decide to carry, Illinois law may also require that your policy include _under_ insured motorist coverage too.
## What Are My Insurance Claim Options After an Illinois Car Accident?
Under the Illinois fault-based car insurance system, a driver who causes a car accident is financially responsible for anyone else's crash-related losses ("[damages](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/damages-how-much-personal-injury-32264.html)" in the language of the law), including medical bills, car repairs, [lost wages](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/car-accident-claims-and-lost-wages.html), and [pain and suffering](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-pain-suffering-determined-car-accident-case.html). So, after an accident, if the other driver is at fault and they have insurance, you can [file a third-party car insurance claim](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/filing-a-third-party-claim-for-car-accident-vehicle-damage.html) with that driver's insurer, and get compensation for your accident-related damages.
But you can also file a claim under your own car insurance coverage in some situations—under your own [personal injury protection](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/auto-accident/pip-personal-injury-protection-claims.html) or [collision coverage](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/using-collision-coverage-for-vehicle-damage.html), for example. Or, if the other driver is at fault but they're uninsured, you might need to make a claim under your own uninsured motorist coverage.
Learn more about [starting the car insurance claim process](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-do-i-start-a-car-accident-claim.html#:~:text=You%20might%20file%20a%20third,insurance%20company%20raising%20your%20rates.).
## Proof of Insurance Requirements in Illinois
Illinois requires vehicle owners and operators to carry proof of insurance in their cars. If you're stopped for a traffic violation or involved in an accident, a law enforcement officer may write you a traffic citation if you can't provide proof of insurance.
Under the [State of Illinois Insurance Verification System](https://ilivs.com/Index_ILIVS.aspx), the Illinois Secretary of State conducts automated checks for liability insurance twice a year. If a check doesn't verify that a vehicle is covered in line with the state's minimum requirements, the vehicle will be rechecked in 30 days. If the second verification attempt fails, the registered owner will have 30 days to submit proof of coverage, or their vehicle's registration will be suspended. To get a registration suspension lifted, a vehicle owner will need to:
  * buy liability insurance that complies with the state's requirements, and
  * pay a $100 reinstatement fee.


## What Happens If I Drive Without Car Insurance in Illinois?
If you're stopped for a traffic violation or you're involved in an accident and you're unable to provide proof of car insurance:
  * your license plates will be suspended and you may face the following fines:
  *     * Minimum fine of $500 for driving uninsured
    * Minimum fine of $1000 for driving a vehicle while the license plates are suspended for a previous insurance violation.


As stiff as these penalties are, they pale in comparison to the financial hit you could take [if you're in a car accident and you don't have car insurance](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/if-youre-car-accident-you-dont-have-insurance.html).
