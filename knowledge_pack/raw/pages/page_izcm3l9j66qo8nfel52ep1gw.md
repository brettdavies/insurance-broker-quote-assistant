#  The General Auto Insurance is a SCAM 
[ Misc Advice  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Misc%20Advice%22)
The General Auto Insurance is a SCAM 
TLDR: The General Auto Insurance lies and doesn’t disclose anything. Said I owe $455 for half a month of insurance after billing me $710/month without notice. 
For anyone in the US looking for low cost insurance, avoid The General Auto Insurance. They raised my bill from $193 to $293 to $710 WITHOUT informing me. When I called for a quote while buying my new car they told me they couldn’t give me a price. 
When I went to check my email after they sent me my second monthly statement, the bill was for $717. I audibly laughed and called them up, thinking it must be my 6 month premium. They informed me that because I had 7 points on my license, my monthly payment was raising to $710. 
I said I wasn’t aware of points on my license. She listed offenses that I had from years ago. I said “ok, but I’d like to cancel my insurance as I was never informed of the change. No one in their right mind would pay $710/month for insurance.” She said “OK, you’re canceled.” 
Then I get a letter that my bill of $455 for the half a month I received insurance from them was being sent to collections. 
I called the PA DMV and they said they’ll send me a letter regarding points on my license. Today I get the letter and they tell me I have ZERO points on my license. 
I called back to dispute them, sent emails to the original supervisor and I have yet to hear back. They’ve since sent it to their internal collections.

The General, and several of those other "cheap" insurance companies, exist only to prevent you from getting a ticket for driving without insurance. That's it. They also take high risk customers who may not otherwise qualify for insurance. 
You're almost always better off with a major like [State Farm](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=State+Farm+insurance&cId=06c5cdb3-d53f-4e94-b23d-0ababd8df264&iId=84c74e6d-8649-4b9e-8e23-fff412bb79e6), Erie, [GEICO](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=GEICO+insurance&cId=862a0163-ee43-46c9-8650-5b87a5796530&iId=3ea904f6-6e8e-4797-8826-4616a12c3d48), even Progressive if you can swing it. One major difference is that if you have one of those big companies and you have a claim against you, they're more likely to actually represent your interests than some "cheap" carrier. 
EDIT: Fascinating how so many bots are crawling out of the woodwork to spam a 4 month old comment.

In MI, a lot of people use 'the general' so they can get their registration current for the year and then cancel a month later

I pay $73/month through StateFarm. But I do have a clean record with no accidents and liability only on a 15 year old hatchback.

When I first got a quote for my new car Geico, State Farm and Progressive gave me quotes well over $400/month. I've only ever had two tickets. The General had originally quoted me $190 then sent me an arbitrary bill for $710.

I was paying $210/mo with The General. Switched to Progressive and was initially paying $165/mo. 
I’ve been with them for one year and they just lowered it to $120/mo.

Car insurance is such a scam, I pay $2,000 a year with 15 years of accident free driving. Every time I try to get another quote from a new company it’s even more then what I’m paying. Such a joke.

That’s about average though. 
It also depends on where you live. In DFW, for example, our rates have skyrocketed because of the sheer number of uninsured and reckless drivers.

I figured ones like The General would screw you over. I've had great experience with NJM Insurance so far. Only for people living in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania though. Kept full coverage when I switched from Travelers and almost cut my auto insurance in half! Consumer Reports rates them near the top. With Travelers I kept seeing my bill go up every 6 months with no accidents and was getting too expensive. So [u/Pitiful-Struggle-890](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pitiful-Struggle-890/) keep them in mind next time you're shopping since you're in PA

Total scam ! They went up in my policy to $359 a month for full coverage without notifying me just charged me . So I tried to call for 4 days at the end of January to cancel but my work days are too long so they weren’t open . Finally on the 3rd I called canceled my policy and got coverage with progressive …. 3 weeks later I get a $360 charge on my debit . I called my bank and reversed the transaction bc when I cancelled I asked the rep at the general if I owed anything and he told me NO . I had cancelled before the next payment cycle . Ok cool . Well 10 days ago I get a call from the general for a debt that’s going to collections for $360 I’m like what are you talking about ? They tell me it’s my last bill and fees for canceling and I have to pay it . I pay it reluctantly and then today I get a notice from my DMV that the General is reporting to DMV that I let my insurance lapse ?! Seriously? That never happened ! Now this B Brandy at the general is telling me that bc I reversed the charge ( even though I paid it 10 days ago when they called ) that it shows in their system I cancelled my car insurance on 1/20/25 😳😳😳I’m so pissed I could scream and brandy didn’t want to help bc no one wants to do their job anymore

very bad service trying to get the car repaired with full coverage the traffic controller has been on vacation for a month now and no one is dealing with my case, that is, if you understand the expression of the workers, wait until she comes back (but we are really trying to help you now) the service is disgusting, do not bring your money to this company

When I was getting insurance for a new car after i was in a NOT at fault accident and no priors they quoted me for $675 on a 2015 Nissan Armada SL and the lowest they could go was $550 and tried to tell me “I wouldn’t find a better deal anywhere else”. Now IM with progressive with $85 a month and with better coverage. The general seems like a scam.

The GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND WILL TAKE THEIR TIME THEY DO NOT HELP WITH GETTING YOUR VEHICLE BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOUR VEHICLE WAS STOLEN FROM YOU THEY KNOW YOU NEED IT BACK AND THEY ARE JUST TAKING THEIR SWEET TIME ON IT???? Police Found it!! Seems like they're only there to have insurance to make sure you don't get a ticket we've been waiting for way too long for the kind of claim we have?
