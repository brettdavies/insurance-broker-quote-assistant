The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/)’ 2025 report on the largest car insurance companies in the U.S. reveals the industry is continuing to consolidate: The top five insurers held a cumulative market share of 63.59% in 2024, up from 62.49% in 2023.
The top two providers, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) and [Progressive](https://secure.money.com/pr/v68db5884625), account for more than 35% of the market by themselves.

[Nationwide](https://secure.money.com/pr/l9470b585c8a), meanwhile, fell out of the top 10 entirely, slipping from No. 10 to No. 13.
The report also reinforces how car insurance rates [continue to outpace](https://www.cnbc.com/select/average-cost-of-full-car-insurance-went-up-in-2024/) the cost of living: While inflation increased 3% between 2023 and 2024, direct written premiums shot up more than 13%.

##  How to save on car insurance
**Shop around:** There can be huge differences among insurance companies for the same basic policy. Get rate quotes from at least three providers [every time you’re up for renewal](https://www.cnbc.com/select/when-to-switch-car-insurance/) to ensure you’re getting the best deal.
**Pay your whole premium upfront:** Most companies charge a fee for dividing your premium into monthly payments. You can often receive a discount for setting up autopay, as well.
**Bundle home and auto insurance:** Getting multiple lines of insurance [from the same carrier](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-home-auto-insurance-bundles/) doesn’t just simplify your life, it can result in discounts of up to 25%.  
  
**Take advantage of other discounts:** Rate reductions are often available to safe drivers, [good students](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-get-car-insurance-student-discounts/), homeowners, [members of the military](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-cheap-car-insurance-veterans-military/) and others. The nation’s largest car insurance company, [State Farm](https://secure.money.com/pr/i4ce986d7c7d) has a discount of up to 30% if you use its Drive Safe & Save mobile app to track your driving.  
  
**Consider pay-per-mile insurance:** If you don’t drive often, a [pay-per-mile policy](https://www.cnbc.com/select/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/) can save you more than 40% over traditional insurance. You’re charged a daily flat rate plus a few cents per mile.  
  
**Improve your credit score:** In most states, insurance companies can use your credit history [when calculating your rates](https://www.cnbc.com/select/credit-score-save-on-car-insurance/). Paying off debts, lowering your [credit utilization ratio](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-credit-utilization-rate/) and reporting errors or fraud are all ways to boost your FICO score.
**Select a higher deductible:** Raising your deductible from $200 to $500 can reduce the cost of collision and comprehensive coverage by as much as 30%, according to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/nine-ways-to-lower-your-auto-insurance-costs#:~:text=Ask%20for%20higher%20deductibles&amp;text=By%20requesting%20higher%20deductibles%2C%20you,you%2040%20percent%20or%20more.), while upping it to $1,000 can save you 40% or more. Just make sure you have adequate savings to cover the difference.
