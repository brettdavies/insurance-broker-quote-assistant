#  Stay away from GEICO! Buyer beware, would like to share story. 
[ Auto Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Auto%20Insurance%22)
So my auto insurance for two vehicles was going up by about 25 dollars a month to a bit over 300 a month for very good collision and comprehensive on a 2019 VW and 2024 Tesla (urban area), so I thought I'd shop around. I got a quote from GEICO for ~120 dollars a month less than what I pay with similar if not the same coverage. Seemed like a no brainer switch. 
While trying to finalize the quote, they stated that because in Nov 2020, I was rear ended (DMV records show not at fault, no insurance payout/ no damage) and in 2021 my car was hit in a parking lot (DMV records show not at-fault, other party's insurance paid) my original quote for 197 dollars would jump up to 650+ dollars a month. 
I don't know what logic they use in their system, but it's definitely broken. Don't get scammed! Also it takes forever to get a hold of someone, so it does feel like it is a deal of you get what you pay for. 
I have no at-fault crashes, no speeding tickets, no violations, no lapse in insurance. (I'm 28 with continuous insurance since 16, 2 degrees, married, homeowner, reputable engineering job, wife works and has a degree, etc ). I'll stick to my current policy even if it's more expensive, at least they have a local office that I've never had an issue talking to someone with.

This isn’t shocking. 
Not at fault accidents like the ones you describe are almost as big a predictor of future losses as are at fault accidents. 
So, in the states that allow it (most of them), people with not at fault accidents get to pay more.

The answer to this is that most all quotes you get from insurers (especially online insurers like GEICO) is *provisional*. They have not run the MVR ([Motor Vehicle Report](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Motor+Vehicle+Report+insurance&cId=49d2236a-72cb-4d6f-8e00-4b4a0e6109c4&iId=644e7f82-8033-42db-9f10-cf3147866b17)) yet because it costs them money to do so. 
So, if you're filling out a quote online, it's important to be *as accurate as possible* when declaring past claims. That way you will get a quote that will most closely match what your eventual rate will be. 
But even then it likely can and will change. It's just the nature of the business. 
As I said up top, it's best to go in with the mindset that whatever quote you are initially given is entirely provisional and *will* change.

Depending on your state (and your insurer), a not at fault accident may: 
  1. Still count as a derogatory mark (albeit a lesser one than an at fault accident), and your premiums may increase; 
  2. Not affect _premium_ but still affect _eligibility_ for insurance 


This is not a GEICO specific issue

They don’t want you that is the go away price. You are a high risk with 2 claims within 2 years. Even if you aren’t at fault. This isn’t a scam insurance is highly regulated and all their rates are filed with your states [department of insurance](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=state+department+of+insurance&cId=674b2a64-15a5-489f-b164-138f4dd13fe7&iId=a298cace-a123-45c2-a72a-8312dc730d23). 
Also if you aren’t accurate in your quotes when quoting online you will see this price change after reports are run with every carrier. The price will only be accurate if you are truthful.

What is "very good comp and collision?" Either you have it or you don't. And you pick your deductible for each. 
Nonetheless, this isn't a Geico issue. It's more if a _you_ issue. You didn't disclose the not at fault accidents and in states where it's allowed to be used for rating, many companies will do so because you are a riskier client than someone without that claims history, at fault or not.

Yes I told them they'll find not at fault claims with them, and did the whole quote both online and then I called the agent multiple times to confirm as well. Long story short I am not changing insurance right now. 
Reddit is full of people loving to hate but I'm just sharing a story of an experience I had in the hopes of answering someone else's question in the future. Google searches are basically useless unless you put "Reddit" on them these days lol. I use these types posts all the time from others when I need to search something up.

99% of people that come here to proclaim they've been scammed find out they just don't understand how insurance works. 
Every insurance carrier works this way. They give you a preliminary rate based on the information you include. When you're ready to purchase the policy, they will pull your CLUE report and look at the actual tickets and accidents listed. If/when there is a difference, you will be charged accordingly.

Just go to a local agent. They'll shop your rates for you and they'll make sure all the reports are ran before giving you the quote. And then if you have any issues you just talk to them and don't have to call in to a call center.

Yeah I've had a good luck with State Farm off the past ~12 years, I'll stick to them since getting quotes is such a waste of time. Car dependency in general is a cyclical scam but that's a whole other thing.

To follow up, you all can be as hostile as you want In the comments, I don't mind! I'm ensuring that people will be able to refer to this In the future when someone else runs into this issue as I've looked into other posts on this sub Reddit. I'm sharing my experience, not asking advice. 
It feels scummy and's I'd like to share what came of this. Then again most everything involving automobiles is scummy, from insurance, dealers, and car dependency. I will continue to advocate for people's freedom to move without a car, but as we are trapped into car dependency where I live, we have to deal with stuff like this--where someone else ranking third car into you makes everything more expensive for the victim. We should advocate for that to be illegal. And we need to hold companies and people accountable. 
Thanks for everyone who contributed! I appreciate the engagement!

Lots of things go into insurance quotes depending on where you live/what is allowed. 
  1. Most companies look at credit scores. 
  2. Accidents, whether at fault or not where claims were filed. How many claims in a short amount of time etc. 
  3. Age of the person & gender 
  4. Types of vehicles you drive ( make, model etc) 
  5. The state and city that you live in 
  6. Type of coverage you elect to carry over state mandated minimums 


All of these things affect your rates. ( Underwriters if I’m missing anything please feel free to correct me! I worked on the claims side of things😉)

I carried full-coverage insurance with Geico for five years, no at-fault accidents. In 2023, a deer jumped out in front of me on a state highway a couple of minutes from my house. I was not happy with the way my claim was handled. The insurance adjuster did not contact the collision shop with the estimate. As a result, my vehicle sat out in the street on a questionable side of town an extra week. Despite being a NO-FAULT deer accident, they cut my Safe Driver Discount IN HALF. After the deer accident, my premiums started creeping up about every six months. When I dropped Collision and Comprehensive, my premium for basic liability insurance was still $132.00/month. I asked my sister her opinion of the cost, and she said that sounded high; she suggested I contact State Farm Insurance. My premium for basic liability dropped from $132.00/month to $42.62/month, almost $100.00 less! I am a 65-year old senior on a fixed income , and cannot afford to pay an extra $90/month for the same coverage, so I said adios to Geico -- NEVER again!!
