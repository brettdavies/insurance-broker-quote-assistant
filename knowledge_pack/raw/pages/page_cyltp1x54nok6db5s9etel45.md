At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

GEICO is one of the largest auto insurance companies in the United States by market share, and its long-running advertisements suggest that a call to [**GEICO**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/geico/) can save drivers 15% or more on their insurance.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-1)
[**The Hartford**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/the-hartford/) doesn’t have as large a market share, but it’s offered auto insurance since 1913, a full 23 years before GEICO’s founding. The Hartford offers specialty insurance that caters to drivers older than 50.
To determine if The Hartford or GEICO is the [**best car insurance company**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/best-car-insurance/) for you, take the time to [**compare quotes**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), discounts, customer service, and coverage options from each company so you can make an informed decision.
Quick Facts

  * GEICO has a high complaint index score with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), meaning it receives more complaints than expected for its size.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-2)


## GEICO vs. The Hartford: The verdict
While both GEICO and The Hartford offer similar [**auto insurance coverages**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/), senior drivers may find exclusive services with The Hartford’s partnership with AARP.
Drivers of any age can get insurance through GEICO, while The Hartford specializes in auto insurance products for drivers 50 years and older. GEICO’s average monthly rates are also significantly cheaper than The Hartford’s for all drivers, whether they have clean records or spotty driving histories.
GEICO insurance may have the best rates, but it has a much worse record for customer satisfaction. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index is 1.35, meaning it has a higher rate of complaints compared to the average.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-2) In other words, GEICO receives nearly one and a half times the number of complaints as the national average. The Hartford’s NAIC index of 0.78 means it receives fewer complaints than expected.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/geico-vs-the-hartford/#cite-3)

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.

GEICO is the third-largest auto insurance company by market share, according to the NAIC, and it offers competitive rates and a long list of potential discounts. While it’s a nationally known insurer, it also has a lower-than-average J.D.

## GEICO DriveEasy vs. The Hartford TrueLane
GEICO and The Hartford both offer [**telematics programs**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/telematics/) that could potentially help safe drivers save money on their premiums.
The GEICO DriveEasy program is in the insurer’s main mobile app, and drivers can sign up for it by logging into their accounts on their phones. Once you sign up for DriveEasy, the mobile app uses your phone’s sensors to track various driving behaviors, including distracted driving, hard braking, cornering, and smoothness. It also tracks factors like distance driven, time of day, route regularity, and weather. The program assigns you a driving score based on this information.
Each time you renew your policy, GEICO partly determines your premiums based on your DriveEasy score. This means it’s possible to lower or raise your premiums with DriveEasy, and there’s no guaranteed discount. Additionally, every driver on your policy must enroll in DriveEasy if you sign up for the program.
The Hartford’s telematics program, TrueLane, offers an automatic discount of up to 12% when you enroll. The app automatically collects information about your driving behavior, including your speed, phone usage, cornering, braking, and acceleration.
When it’s time to renew your policy with The Hartford, your new policy premium will depend partly on your driving behavior. Good drivers can potentially save up to 25% at renewal. Not every driver on your policy has to enroll in TrueLane for you to take advantage of this program.
