### Orlando’s Insurance Rate Factors to Consider
Although Orlando is about a 45-minute drive from the Atlantic Coast and a 1.5-hour drive from the Gulf Coast, it can still bear the brunt of hurricane winds, which often spawn tornadoes that unexpectedly destroy homes and properties.
It’s also home to more than 50 inches of rainfall each year, some rainstorms coming down so hard you can barely see. And those rainstorms can turn into hail storms at times, too. All of these major weather events are covered by your Orlando homeowners insurance — but they [factor into the cost of your homeowners insurance](https://clovered.com/homeowners-insurance-rate-factors/).
A few other factors that can lead to rate increases or decreases in the Orlando area are:
  * [Deductible](https://clovered.com/home-insurance-deductible/)
  * Insurance Score
  * Home’s Age, Construction & Renovation
  * [Claims History](https://clovered.com/most-common-home-insurance-claims/)
  * Coverage Amounts
  * [Location & Crime](https://clovered.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-theft-and-robbery/)

### Orlando Sinkhole Insurance
Orlando and the rest of Central Florida are known as being the sinkhole capital of the United States. From 2006 to 2010, Florida saw 24,671 sinkhole-related home insurance claims, most of which occurred in Central Florida and many that occurred in Orlando. Just recently in 2024, [a ground depression in Lake County](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2024/07/21/sinkhole-reported-in-lake-county-neighborhood-evacuations-underway-officials-say/) has forced several evacuations and threatened property.
While [homeowners insurance in Orlando doesn’t cover sinkholes](https://clovered.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-sinkholes/), you’re not completely out of luck. The state’s insurers are mandated to provide a certain level of sinkhole coverage for all homeowners in the form of a separate policy or an add-on to their current policy, but it’ll cost a bit more.
