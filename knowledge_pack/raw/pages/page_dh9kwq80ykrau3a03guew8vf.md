# Masonry or frame construction – which is the more expensive home to insure?
tony • May 25, 2018
The short answer is a frame construction home will typically be more expensive to insure when compared to a masonry construction home. There are three main reasons why this is the case:
  1. Masonry construction homes are considered less combustible than frame construction home
  2. Masonry construction homes are less prone to degradation over time.
  3. Masonry construction homes have a lesser risk of Wood Destroying Organism, such as termites, weakening the structural integrity of the home.


It’s only natural for insurance companies to price for these additional layers of risk when determining the insurance premium. Another interesting fact is that frame construction homes have insurance premiums that increase at an increasing rate when compared to masonry construction homes.
**_Say what?_ **
While a new frame construction home may only have $100 difference in annual premium when compared to a masonry construction home, a 25 year old frame construction home may have a premium difference of $1000 or more.
**_So what happens when you have a home of mixed construction such as a masonry construction first floor and a frame construction second floor?_ **
Every insurance company looks at this situation differently. Some companies will consider the home masonry construction for rating purposes if the frame construction is less than 33% of the total construction. Other carriers will consider a home masonry construction if the home is less than 50% frame construction. While other carriers will give a masonry type of rating if the frame home is covered with masonry stucco.

It’s no secret that things are getting more and more expensive. From food prices to energy prices, it seems like all corners of the economy are being affected. We’re seeing supply chain issues, raw material shortages and labor supply issues all putting inflationary pressures on most consumables. And one area we’re seeing significant increases is in the cost to build a home.

Recently we had a customer call in to let us know that he had sold one of his cars and that he would like the vehicle removed from his policy. While talking to the customer he mentioned that he sold the vehicle for $4,000 more than what he paid for it. While that is great news for him it underscores a potential issue in the auto insurance marketplace that we expect will trickle down to you, the consumer, later this year.

If you have a mortgage with an escrow account, you have likely or will likely experience a time when your home insurance fails to get paid by your mortgage servicer before its expiration. This can be a terribly frustrating time for you. But if you live in Florida, just know that the state of Florida has your back.

Recently, FEMA rolled out Risk Rating 2.0 and the rollout has been quite shocking for many Florida residents. Risk Rating 2.0 is a methodology used to accurately charge for flood insurance based upon a property’s own unique flood risks. Prior to Risk Rating 2.0 flood insurance rates were largely determined by what flood zone a property was located in.

It’s no secret that COVID has changed the way many companies are doing business in the United States and the same is true for auto insurance carriers as well. With all the supply chain issues and manufacturing shortages, we’re not only seeing the price of new and used automobiles increase in value, which is increasing the cost to insure, but more importantly we’re seeing vehicles take longer and longer to get repaired after a covered claim. In fact, we’ve seen completely repaired vehicles sit for months waiting for a chip. We’ve seen parts that used to take days to come in, take months. We’ve seen some parts come in and have to sit for weeks while other parts make their way to the repair facility.

When buying a condo, part of your association dues goes towards a master condo insurance policy purchased by the condo association. This policy insures the condo building for covered losses. An HO6 policy picks up where the master policy ends and pays for the internal structures to your particular condo unit.
