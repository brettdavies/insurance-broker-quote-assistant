## The average cost of car insurance by region
Region  |  Average annual premium   
---|---  
Mid-Atlantic  |  $3,327   
Midwest  |  $3,028   
Southeast  |  $3,026   
Southwest  |  $2,982   
West  |  $2,836   
Northeast  |  $2,560   
Northwest  |  $2,248   
U.S. Non-Mainland  |  $1,844   
Data source: Quadrant (2023).
One reason why car insurance in the Mid-Atlantic tends to be more expensive is that many states in the region require higher minimum liability coverage and can also require additional coverage, such as personal injury protection and uninsured motorist coverage. That raises the cost of minimum coverage and therefore the overall average car insurance premium in those states.
## How to lower your car insurance premium
To get a better car insurance rate, it's necessary to understand how the price of auto insurance policies are set. Most companies look at these factors when setting your rate through their own insurance score system:
  * **Driving record:** New and younger drivers and those who have gotten into major accidents, received a [DUI](https://www.fool.com/money/insurance/auto/cheap-car-insurance-after-dui/?luri=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&furi=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&fuuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&luuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&ltyp=txt), or been booked for speeding tickets will have higher auto insurance rates than drivers with a clean record.
  * **Driving frequency:** Policyholders that drive more will pay more for auto insurance.
  * **Location:** Living in an area with higher rates of theft and accidents can increase the cost of auto insurance. Locations where severe weather that can damage cars, like hail, is more common can also have more expensive policies.
  * **Gender:** Women have historically been safer drivers than men and as a result may receive a better car insurance rate.
  * **Automobile model:** More expensive cars are more expensive to insure. Cars with certain safety features may qualify for discounts.


With those factors in mind, here are some ways to save on auto insurance:
  * **Shop around:** Whenever your policy comes up for renewal, make a habit of looking at rates other insurance companies offer.
  * **Bundle auto and homeowners insurance:** If you're a homeowner, bundling auto and [homeowners insurance](https://www.fool.com/money/insurance/homeowners/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/?luri=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&furi=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&fuuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&luuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&ltyp=txt) can net savings.
  * **Explore paying per mile:** If you aren't driving to work and otherwise minimally use your car, it may make sense to look at whether a [pay-per-mile policy](https://www.fool.com/money/insurance/auto/pay-per-mile-car-insurance/?luri=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&furi=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&fuuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&luuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&ltyp=txt) would lower your premium.
  * **Look for discounts:** Many auto insurance companies offer discounts for actions taken that lower risk. These include taking a [defensive driving](https://www.fool.com/money/insurance/auto/defensive-driving-discount/?luri=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&furi=%2Fresearch%2Faverage-cost-car-insurance-50-states%2F&fuuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&luuid=014261c6-6b83-4c17-9536-462319b651d7&ltyp=txt) course, parking in a secure garage if you live in an urban area, and driving a vehicle with safety features like anti-lock brakes.
  * **Maintain good credit:** Many auto insurance providers use credit history as a factor in calculating auto insurance scores. Data shows that good credit can net big savings.
  * **Keep a clean driving record:** Getting a DUI, being in a major accident, and accumulating speeding tickets can make auto insurance much more expensive. Taking an Uber or taxi after a night out, focusing on the road, and staying within the speed limit are well worth it when considering the financial consequences of being pulled over or getting in a wreck.
