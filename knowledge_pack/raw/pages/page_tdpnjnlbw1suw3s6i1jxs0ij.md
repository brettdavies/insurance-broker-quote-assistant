## What Is SR-22 Insurance?
[SR-22](https://www.insuranceopedia.com/auto-insurance/sr-22-insurance) is not a type of car insurance but rather a certificate of financial responsibility required for certain high-risk drivers. It serves as proof that the driver carries the minimum liability insurance required by state law.
Typically mandated after serious driving offenses like DUIs, reckless driving, or multiple traffic violations, the SR-22 is filed by the insurance company with the state’s motor vehicle department. While the SR-22 itself isn’t insurance, obtaining one often results in higher premiums because it signifies the driver is considered a greater risk by insurers. This requirement usually lasts for a specified period, such as three years.
## Average Cost Of Non-Owner Car Insurance In Illinois
The average cost of non-owner car insurance in Illinois is $40 per month. For non-owner SR-22 insurance, drivers in Illinois pay around $29 per month.
Understanding the average cost of non-owner car insurance in Illinois is essential for anyone who frequently rents or borrows cars. This type of insurance provides vital liability coverage without the full expenses of a standard policy, making it a practical choice for those without a personal vehicle.
## Average Cost Of Non-Owner Car Insurance In Illinois – By Age
Age plays a significant role in determining the average cost of non-owner car insurance in Illinois. Insurance companies assess risk based on various factors, and age is one of the most influential.

Non-owner car insurance is designed for individuals who frequently drive but do not own a vehicle.

## Should You Get Non-Owner Car Insurance In New York?
Non-owner car insurance is a valuable option for individuals who don’t own a vehicle but still find themselves in situations where liability coverage is necessary. Below are the different types of people who should consider this insurance, broken down by their specific needs.
### Renters
If you frequently rent cars, non-owner car insurance can save you money and provide better coverage than the insurance offered by rental companies. With a non-owner policy, you’ll have consistent liability coverage, which can be more comprehensive and cost-effective over time.
### Car Borrowers
People who borrow cars from friends or family members occasionally may benefit from non-owner car insurance. It ensures you’re covered for liability if you’re at fault in an accident while driving someone else’s vehicle, without relying solely on the car owner’s insurance policy.
### License Reinstatement
Non-owner car insurance is often required for drivers reinstating their license after a suspension or revocation due to serious violations, such as a DUI. Filing an SR-22 alongside a non-owner policy demonstrates financial responsibility and compliance with state requirements.
### Infrequent Drivers
If you rarely drive but still want to maintain continuous insurance coverage to avoid gaps, a non-owner policy is a practical solution. It helps you avoid higher premiums in the future, as gaps in coverage can signal a higher risk to insurers.
### Drivers Between Cars
If you’ve sold your car or are in between purchasing vehicles, non-owner car insurance can provide interim liability protection. This ensures you remain insured during the transition and maintain a good insurance history.
