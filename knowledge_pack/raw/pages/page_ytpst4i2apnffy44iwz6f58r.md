## Average cost of auto insurance in Illinois by coverage level
Car insurance costs in Illinois can differ based on the coverage limit. To legally drive, Illinois residents must adhere to the minimum liability limits of 25/50/20.
[Liability-only policies](https://www.carinsurance.com/coverage-definition/liability-car-insurance.aspx) are the cheapest, offering bare-bones protection that meets state’s financial responsibility laws – but they don’t offer much legal protection and coverage for your medical costs or property damage.
While liability insurance protects you from financial loss by covering legal defense and damages if you’re found responsible for causing injury or property damage to others, it doesn’t protect your vehicle or passengers.
On the other hand, [full coverage car insurance](https://www.carinsurance.com/what-is-full-coverage-car-insurance) costs more but provides a lot more protection. It covers damage to your car in accidents, theft, natural events and animal collisions. If you have full coverage, you can be reassured that you’re well-protected.
Full coverage comprises liability, comprehensive, collision and any other coverage required by your state.
**In the table below, see the car insurance premiums in Illinois for three different coverages.**
Coverage Level | Avg. Monthly Cost | Avg. Annual Cost  
---|---|---  
State Minimum – Liability Only BI/PD | $35  | $421   
Liability Only – 50/100/50 BI/PD | $39  | $471   
Full Coverage – 100/300/100 Liability BI/PD with $500 Comp/Coll Deductible | $128  | $1,532   
### State minimum car insurance in Illinois
[In Illinois, minimum car insurance requirements](https://www.carinsurance.com/state/state-minimum-car-insurance-in-illinois/) include $25,000 of bodily injury liability per person, $50,000 of bodily injury liability per accident and $20,000 of property damage liability.
The state minimum car insurance cost in Illinois is **$421** a year. However, this basic coverage only offers limited protection. Illinois drivers can choose to add more coverage, such as [comprehensive](https://www.carinsurance.com/coverage-definition/comprehensive-insurance.aspx) and [collision](https://www.carinsurance.com/what-is-collision-coverage-insurance) insurance, raise their liability limits and include personal injury protection or other insurance coverage, for better protection.
Drivers in Illinois must be aware of the minimum car insurance requirements to remain legally compliant.
### Liability-only car insurance in Illinois
According to CarInsurance.com data, liability-only car insurance costs **$471** in Illinois for limits **50/100/50**.
Liability-only insurance helps cover the costs if you damage someone else’s car or injure someone in an accident. It’s more affordable than full coverage insurance, but remember, it doesn’t pay for repairs to your vehicle or cover injuries to your passengers.
### Full coverage car insurance in Illinois
The average annual premium in Illinois is **$1,532** for a full coverage policy with limits of 100/300/100 – $100,000 in bodily injury coverage, $300,000 in bodily injury coverage per accident and $100,000 in property damage coverage.
Car insurance experts advise drivers to get full coverage insurance with the highest liability limits they can afford. Full coverage includes liability, comprehensive and collision coverage, with a deductible.
