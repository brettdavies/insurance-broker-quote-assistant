## **Average Home Insurance Rates in New York City**
The [level of coverage](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/resources/determining-coverage-needs) you need plays a big role in how much your insurance costs. That’s because the market value of your home affects your dwelling coverage needs. More valuable homes need more coverage than homes that aren’t worth as much.
It’s a good idea to get coverage for at least 80% of the value of your home. Otherwise, your insurer may not fully pay out your claims.
The table below shows the average homeowners insurance rates by dwelling coverage according to Compare.com data.

## **Factors That Affect Home Insurance Costs in NYC**
![Row of colorful, ornate brownstone buildings with decorative balconies and lush green trees lining the street.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/b559d9b3c1/nyc-houses.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
In addition to your home’s market value, a number of other factors go into your home insurance rates in New York City. Understanding how each of these factors affects your insurance premium can help you make the best decisions for your insurance needs.
Here are several of the factors that can affect your homeowners insurance premium:[[5]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-5)
  * **The home itself:** The size, repair history, and construction of your home can make a difference in your home insurance rates.
  * **Age:** The age of your home can affect the cost of repairing damage. If your home is older and doesn’t meet current building codes, that can also affect your premium.
  * **Construction type:** The type and style of your home can determine the ease or difficulty of locating construction materials for repair.
  * **Roofing materials:** How your roof is constructed may increase or decrease your risk of water damage. 
  * **Foundation type:** Your foundation may also mitigate or increase your water damage risk.


### **Where you’re located**
Location can make a major difference in your insurance premium. Insurers look at local crime rates, how likely your home is to flood, and how close you are to a fire station, among other things.
In pretty much all New York City boroughs, homeowners need to purchase flood insurance coverage to protect themselves from floods and other water damage. All boroughs across New York City face potential flood damage from severe weather year-round.[[6]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-6)
The good news for homeowners is that the city has 218 firehouses located within its 302 square miles. That means theoretically no home is more than 0.7 miles away from a fire station, which should help lower your premium.[[7]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-7)

### **How you structure your policy**
How you put together your homeowners insurance policy changes how much you pay. This includes:
  * **Your deductible:** This is how much you pay out of pocket before coverage kicks in. A higher deductible means a lower yearly premium, but you’ll have to pay more if you make a claim.
  * **Coverage options:** Your mortgage company may require some coverages and levels. But other coverage options, and the policy limits you choose for certain coverages, may be up to you. Adding flood insurance, replacement cost coverage, additional personal property insurance, or other coverage add-ons will increase your premium.
  * **Discounts:** You may lower your home insurance rates with discounts like bundling your home insurance with your auto policy.


### **Your background**
Your personal factors can also make a difference to your home insurance rates. Some of these factors include:[[8]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-8)
  * **Your credit history:** Insurers consider your credit history when giving you a quote because it may predict the likelihood you’ll file a claim. If your credit improves, you can request your insurer to review your policy and possibly get a lower rate.[[5]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-5)
  * **If you have prior coverage:** Insurers may offer loyalty or bundling discounts if you have a car insurance policy. But you could still get a lower rate by switching to a new company.
  * **Your claims history:** If you’ve submitted multiple claims in the past, your rates will likely be higher.


## **What Homeowners Insurance Covers in New York**
A homeowners insurance policy in New York City typically covers the following:[[9]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-9)
  * **Dwelling coverage:** This helps pay to repair or replace the structure of your home if it’s damaged or destroyed. Keep in mind that the dwelling coverage amount may be less than what you could sell your home. That’s because it’s based on the value of the actual structure, not the land it sits on.
  * **Personal property coverage:** If your personal property gets lost, damaged, or destroyed, this coverage will help repair or replace your belongings.
  * **Liability coverage:** If someone hurts themselves in your home, liability coverage will pay for their medical bills and potential legal costs.


### **What home insurance doesn’t cover**
While a basic home insurance policy offers a lot of protection, it doesn’t cover every disaster that could happen to your home. These are the most common issues that home insurance doesn’t cover in New York City:
  * **Flood damage:** Water damage from flooding is unfortunately common and can be very destructive. Home insurance doesn’t cover flood damage, so you need to purchase separate flood insurance to protect your home.
  * **Earthquake damage:** While NYC isn’t as earthquake-prone as somewhere like Los Angeles, it still might be a good idea to get earthquake coverage. Insurance companies don’t automatically cover earthquake damage, but many offer separate add-ons.
  * **Routine wear and tear:** A standard homeowners insurance policy doesn’t cover wear and tear. If you want to protect your appliances or HVAC system, it might be worth looking into a home warranty.

## **Flood Insurance in New York City**
![Tree-lined suburban street with charming houses, manicured bushes, and vibrant flowers under a clear blue sky.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/74630e4f0d/nyc-suburbs.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Flood insurance is mandatory for New York City homeowners who live in a Special Flood Hazard Area, have a federally backed mortgage, or have received federal disaster help.[[10]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-10)
But even the New Yorkers who don’t have to buy flood insurance probably should. As of right now, 1.3 million New Yorkers live in or near a floodplain, and it only takes one inch of water to cause roughly $25,000 worth of water damage.[[11]](https://www.compare.com/homeowners-insurance/by-state/new-york/new-york-city#cite-11)
