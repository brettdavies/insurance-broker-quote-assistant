#  Insurance company won't believe me when I say my home construction is masonry 
[ Home Insurance  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Home%20Insurance%22)
I'm shopping for home insurance - current insurer Nationwide has increased my annual premium from $2200 to $3100 in one year. 
Home is in Tempe AZ, built 1973. Brick (or block) masonry walls, truss and shingle roof. 
Through [policygenius.com](http://policygenius.com) I found Hubinternational insurance agent. 
They got me a quote from Hartford which is $1975. (deductibles are higher but Nationwide still can't match it). So I want to switch. 
Contract came through on Docusign; says home is "_stucco on frame construction_ ". I told the agent, no, it's masonry, I can't sign this. 
Agent came back and said underwriter believes the home is stucco on frame and we're not going to change it. WTF? For the record, I can tell the difference between stucco on frame and masonry. 
If home construction is listed wrong, can that cause claims problems down the road? I'm signing a statement I know to be incorrect - could there be repercussions? 
Or do I dig in and say change it to masonry, or I can't sign. 
cheers 
******* 
Update - agent couldn't help and advised me to speak to the underwriter at Hartford. But when I called I can't get through - the number I was given obviously flags Hartford that I'm an "agent" customer, and tells me I need to speak to the agent. So I'm done with that agent. 
I decided to get a quote directly from Hartford and whaddyaknow they list the property as block construction. premium is $200 more than the other Hartford quote, but still $900 less than Nationwide. 
It shouldn't be this hard, but thanks for the responses.

Keep shopping. 
I will add that the database the insurance company cost estimator is using may show stucco over frame. Since companies use similar estimators and probably drawing from the same database, you may get the same results elsewhere. 
Check your city/county Assessors office, that's where they usually get the construction info from.

Ask them where the underwriter is getting their info. Check with Maricopa County Assessor. Search your address and see what the records show. If it shows stucco on frame, that could be your issue.

Do not sign something that you know to be incorrect. Yes, it could cause problems for you down the road. You will need to submit some kind of proof that your home is masonry.

The can override that with Hartford by clicking a button in the drop down, but that construction type has a direct impact on rebuild costs. Agent likely didn't want to do it to keep the premium from going up and losing the sale

Underwriter that does a lot of property insurance here. You can have a home that appears to be masonry, but isn't because the frame itself is wood. In that case, the house would be classified as wood frame, even if the walls are made of masonry, metal, or something less combustible. The actual frame or structure of the house is the important part because it tells you how long the structure will stay standing in the event of a fire. If you want to learn more, just search for ISO construction types on Google and you can get all sorts of descriptions, rules and examples of what might count for each type. Most single family homes are going to be frame.

Definitely push back, tell them they can send out an inspector if they don't believe you. 
If you agree to their terms it will absolutely cause problems in the event of a claim because they will only approve rebuilding with stucco on frame.

Some carriers impose thresholds on material ratings. If a house is 85% masonry and 15% stucco, the underwriting rules might require masonry to constitute 90% of the construction material to justify the factorial savings.

The answer is that "it depends". Some carriers have whacky nuances to their Replacement Cost Estimators. I have seen some that list stucco-frame as masonry, others will list it as masonry-veneer. Same for brick-on-frame. Depending on the situation, it can be easier to make these underwriting changes, as opposed to filing new rating plans with the state. 
You should ask what their criteria are for being considered masonry construction. It's possible that, based on whatever their criteria is, your home does not meet it, but would be considered the next step down (stucco on frame) as opposed to all the way down to frame. 
They should be able to get an explanation from an underwriter as to why it is that way...and then if you are satisfied, sign it. 
At the end of the day, the RCE helps establish two things: what the risk is for the home, and what the rebuild cost would be. If the rebuild cost is accurate, then it's likely some weird artifact of their risk rating plan.

If the Hartford is going to give you a low rate, there’s going to be a lot more that might give you a better rate. Keep talking to brokers. 
You’re absolutely right to want the construction type accurate, because if you ever file a claim and the carrier discovers that your walls were mis‑classified, you could face a denied claim or even a policy cancellation. Carriers price and underwrite masonry very differently from stucco over frame, so it really matters on both ends. 
You did the sensible thing by going straight to Hartford and confirming “block” construction on their end, even if it cost a couple of hundred more. That quote reflects the true risk, and now you can sign with confidence that your policy declarations match reality. 
Going forward, make sure the declarations page actually says “masonry” or “block” construction before you sign—and keep a copy of any underwriting or inspection letters you receive. If you ever have to replace siding or modify walls, let the carrier know so your coverage stays aligned. 
It shouldn’t have been this much of a hassle, but now that you’ve got a policy that correctly reflects your home’s build, you’re in good shape—and saving almost a thousand a year compared to Nationwide. Enjoy the peace of mind (and the lower premium).

I have a 2016 stucco on block, not frame. I bought it as a brand new spec home in a newer subdivision. All homes here are stucco on masonry like mine, no frame, as this is building code here (FL). Just found out State Farm has been charging me the higher rate for frame for all of those years. Any recourse avail? Agent said she didn't know if I would get a refund for anything.

Best insurance policies for first-time buyers 
Buying insurance for the first time can be overwhelming, but understanding the key types of policies and what to look for can make the process much easier. Here’s a succinct guide to the best insurance policies for first-time buyers, based on insights from Redditors. 
### Home Insurance
  * **Coverage Types** : You can insure the building only, the building with content, or variations with extras. Most policies are based on rebuilding costs rather than market value. ["You can insure building only, building with content, or some other variations of this with extras, etc."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Rebuild Cost** : Ensure your policy covers the full cost to rebuild your home. ["Dwelling coverage should match rebuild cost (not market value)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyh9pb/)
  * **Personal Property** : Consider replacement cost coverage for your belongings rather than actual cash value. ["I also carry replacement cost on my contents. Otherwise they pay depreciated value."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njzs0i3/)
  * **Bundling** : Look for discounts by bundling home insurance with other policies like auto insurance. ["Bundle with your auto for discounts, but confirm whether it's cheaper."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1o8yuqg/comment/njyjsex/)
  * **Deductibles** : Higher deductibles can lower your premiums, but make sure you can afford the out-of-pocket costs if you need to make a claim. ["If you’ve got an emergency fund, nudging your deductible higher can shave down premiums."](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mxak8y/comment/na49j5s/)


### Life Insurance
  * **Mortgage Protection** : This is often a requirement for mortgage providers. ["Our mortgage provider needed both policies for drawdown."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/ni8tr2n/)
  * **Policy Types** : Shop around for different types of policies, such as standard, comprehensive, and those with additional benefits. ["Mortgage protection shop around. I went to 3 providers for quotes (basic) policy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingIreland/comments/1o0e05y/comment/nignqxs/)


### Health Insurance
  * **Premium Stability** : Your premium will not change for the next year once you sign up. ["Your premium will not change for the next year if that’s what you’re worrying about."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9xqyt/)
  * **Enrollment Periods** : You can only change or cancel your policy during open enrollment or if you leave your job. ["You can’t cancel whenever you want, only during open enrollment, or if you leave your job."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nm9z7mw/)
  * **Employer Plans** : If your employer offers health insurance, it’s often the best deal available. ["Your employer's health insurance plan is probably the best deal you have available, and it's probably best to sign up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1okdtzi/comment/nmawuce/)


### Car Insurance
  * **Coverage Considerations** : Focus on getting the right amount of coverage rather than just the cheapest policy. ["You should start at how much coverage would be a good fit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10aokm/)
  * **Car Choice** : Certain cars are cheaper to insure, such as older, slower models and those with lower theft rates. ["Smaller hatchbacks are pretty cheap to insure."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10z8at/)
  * **VIN Quotes** : Use the VIN of any vehicle you’re considering to get accurate insurance quotes. ["Call a local independent agent and give them the VINs of any vehicles you're considering."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1lq5sug/comment/n10h17k/)


### Additional Tips
  * **Use a Broker** : Working with an independent broker can help you find the best policies by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. ["Usually a good idea to work with a broker or independent agent."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Read the Fine Print** : Thoroughly read and understand the terms and conditions of your policy. ["Read your application before you sign it, and read your policy documents when you receive them."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/neoun74/)
  * **Check Claims Handling** : Consider the insurance company’s reputation for handling claims. ["My recommendation is to research how fast the insurance company handles claims."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1njav8x/comment/nep1z32/)
