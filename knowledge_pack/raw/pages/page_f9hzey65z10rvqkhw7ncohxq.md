Accident forgiveness is a car insurance policy benefit that prevents your premium from increasing after one at-fault accident. However, it doesn't remove the accident from your driving record. If accident forgiveness costs money to add to your premium, consider its benefits to decide if it's worth it for you.

  * Other companies offer accident forgiveness as an add-on coverage. Drivers should consider whether the added cost is [worth it](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/what-is-accident-forgiveness-coverage#is-it-worth-it).

## What Is Accident Forgiveness?
Accident forgiveness is a policy benefit that keeps your car insurance premium from increasing if you’re at fault for an accident. Some insurers offer it as an optional add-on that you can purchase, while others include it as a reward for good drivers or loyal customers. Availability depends on your insurer – it may not be offered in every state. Additionally, it may only be available to qualifying drivers with clean driving records.
## How Does Accident Forgiveness Work?
Your car insurance premium [will typically increase if you’re at fault](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/car-insurance-increase-accident) for an accident. The exact amount of your increase depends on your insurer and the details of your accident, such as its severity.
If you have accident forgiveness, your insurer won’t consider your accident when setting your premium when you renew your policy. However, other factors could still cause an increase, such as more car theft in your area.
Keep in mind that it usually only applies to your first accident. Any crashes after that will likely affect your premium. Additionally, check with your insurer to understand the limitations. Some companies forgive one per driver, while others forgive one per policy.
While accident forgiveness waives your accident for your car insurance, it doesn’t remove it from your driving record. If you [switch car insurance providers](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/switch-car-insurance-companies), the accident will likely affect your premium with your new company.
## Is Accident Forgiveness Worth It?
Accident forgiveness can be worth it for some drivers. Car crashes are unpredictable, and having this coverage may give you peace of mind that you won’t experience an expensive price hike.
When deciding if you should get accident forgiveness, consider the following factors:
#### The cost
Ask your insurer how much it costs to add this benefit to your policy, and decide if it’s worthwhile.
#### Your budget
Consider that it may increase your premium but could save you money later if you get into an accident.
#### Your driving habits
Accident forgiveness may be worth it if you drive a lot. You may also need a clean driving record to qualify for it.
## How To Get Accident Forgiveness
If you’re interested in accident forgiveness, contact your insurer to see if it’s available in your area and how to add it to your policy. You also need to know if you qualify. Some insurers only offer it to policyholders with a clean driving record. Others provide it if you’re a loyal customer.
