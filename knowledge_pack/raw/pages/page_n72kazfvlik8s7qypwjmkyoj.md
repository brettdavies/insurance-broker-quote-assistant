## How Much Car Insurance Do I Need in Texas?
Texas requires you to maintain 30/60/25[ state minimum auto insurance coverage](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html#:~:text=Texas%20law%20requires%20you%20to,about%20buying%20more%20liability%20coverage.). This translates to:
  * $30,000 bodily injury liability coverage per person 
  * $60,000 bodily injury liability coverage per accident
  * $25,000 property damage liability coverage per accident


This requirement is for [liability coverage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/liability-vs-full-coverage-car-insurance). That means it only covers the other party’s **bodily injuries**(including their medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages) and **property damage** (including their vehicle or other damaged property). Your injuries or damages to your vehicle are not covered.
Understanding your financial risks and how to manage them as they change over time can be challenging. Many consumers get advice from family, friends, and neighbors, while others research online, or work with an insurance agent. However you think about financial risk, stay vigilant.
### Additional car insurance coverage to consider in Texas
While state minimum car insurance requirements allow you to drive legally in Texas, it’s not the only coverage available to you. Your options will vary by insurer, but here are some common ones:  

#### Collision 
Collision coverage pays to repair or replace your vehicle after a collision with another vehicle or an object, like a fence or tree, regardless of fault. This coverage may be required by your lender or lessor.
#### Comprehensive
Comprehensive coverage pays to repair or replace your vehicle if it is damaged by something other than a collision, such as a fire, flood, or theft. Lenders and lessors also often require comprehensive coverage.
#### Medical payments coverage
Also known as MedPay, this covers you and your passengers’ medical bills. It also covers you if you’re hurt while a passenger in someone else’s vehicle or as a pedestrian.
#### Personal injury protection (PIP)
PIP covers you and your passengers’ medical bills, but it also pays for related expenses such as lost wages. If you don’t want PIP, you must ask your insurance company to remove it from your policy.
#### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage protects you if you’re in an accident with a driver who doesn’t have enough coverage to pay your expenses or is uninsured.
#### Rental reimbursement coverage
When you have rental reimbursement coverage, your insurance company will allot a certain amount that you can spend on a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired.
### Risks of getting minimum coverage
While 30/60/25 state minimum coverage is all you need to drive legally in Texas, only having this coverage leaves you exposed. Here are some examples of what you could be left financially responsible for if you only have state minimum coverage:
  * Repairing your vehicle in an at-fault accident (you need collision coverage)
  * Repairing your vehicle after it’s damaged during a storm (you need comprehensive coverage)
  * Repairing your vehicle if you’re in a hit-and-run accident (you need uninsured motorist coverage)
  * Your medical bills (you need medical expense or PIP coverage)
  * The cost of a rental car (you need rental car reimbursement coverage)


Keep in mind that these are just examples, not an exhaustive list. If you’re concerned about cost, it may be a better option to compare quotes to find the cheapest coverage options instead of sticking to the state’s minimum coverage.  

While it isn’t required by the state, uninsured motorist coverage can be a valuable addition to your insurance policy. If you’re hit by an uninsured driver you may be stuck paying your bodily injury and property damage costs out of pocket, with a lawsuit as the only way to recoup those costs. Approximately [14.5% of drivers](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-uninsured-motorists) in Texas are uninsured, and the best way to protect yourself if you are in an accident with one of those uninsured drivers is to purchase uninsured motorist coverage.

## How To Get the Cheapest Car Insurance Rates in Texas
Here are some steps you can take that may lower your car insurance premiums in Texas:  

**Select a higher deductible**
When you choose a higher deductible (the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance policy kicks in), your premium typically decreases.
**Shop around**
You can get quotes for the same coverage from several insurance companies and the premium for each will likely be different. Shopping around can help you find the cheapest rate. Just be sure you’re selecting similar coverage so your quote comparison is accurate.
**Improve your driving record**
Having a clean driving record without recent tickets or accidents will show insurance companies that you’re a less risky driver and lower your premiums.
**Inquire about discounts**
Some discounts are easy to qualify for like bundling your home and auto insurance or signing up for paperless billing. Other discounts take more effort, such as enrolling in a defensive driving course. Either way, see what discounts are available to you so you can lower your insurance premium.
## Texas Widows No Longer Penalized With Higher Premiums
As Texas law stands, insurance companies can reclassify widows from married to single, which typically increases their auto insurance rates. [Senate Bill 1238 ](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1238)is ending this practice, making it illegal to discriminate against widows in the state. It took effect on September 1, 2025. 
## Car Insurance Alternatives in Texas
In general, you must maintain active car insurance coverage to drive in the state. If you are unable to get coverage in the voluntary market, you may qualify for the [Texas Automobile Insurance Plan Association](https://taipa.org/for-insured/) (TAIPA). 
This program provides state minimum liability coverage of 30/60/25 along with personal injury protection and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. To qualify, you must have been denied coverage by two insurance companies in the last 60 days. An insurance agent who is certified through TAIPA must complete and submit your application. Your coverage through TAIPA will be more expensive than it would be with a traditional insurance company.
## Texas Department of Insurance
The Texas Department of Insurance regulates the state’s insurance industry, oversees the administration of the Texas workers’ compensation system, performs the duties of the State Fire Marshal’s Office, and provides administrative support to the Office of Injured Employee Counsel.
You can visit the [department's website](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/) to file a complaint, find an insurance agent or company, learn how auto insurance premiums are calculated, get an auto insurance claim paid, and more. You can also reach the department by phone at 800-578-4677.
## Texas Car Insurance FAQ
**How do I show proof of car insurance in Texas**
It’s good practice to always have proof of insurance on you. You may need to provide evidence that you’re insured when you:
  * Register your vehicle
  * Get a new driver's license or renew it
  * Have your vehicle inspected
  * Are in an accident or another situation when a police officer requests proof of insurance


While there are different ways to show proof of coverage, the most commonly accepted form is a digital or hard copy of your insurance card.
**Can car insurance companies in Texas charge whatever they want?**
No, insurance companies must abide by Texas laws and they’re regulated by the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). The TDI oversees the rates insurance companies charge. Also, Texas has laws that prevent insurers from charging excessive rates which could provide a long-term profit that’s unreasonably high compared to the coverage provided.
**What happens if I don’t have car insurance in Texas?**
If you’re caught driving without insurance in Texas, you’ll likely receive a ticket and you could receive a fine of up to $350. If it happens again, you could receive a fine of up to $1,000 and the court may suspend your license.

## Methodology - How We Collected Our Car Insurance Rates
To get annual insurance premiums for this study, U.S. News worked with [Quadrant Information Services](https://www.quadinfo.com/). To find the rates, Quadrant works both with individual insurance companies, as well as publicly available Department of Insurance filings in all 50 states. Using data from these sources, Quadrant calculates expected insurance rates for individual driver profiles. Our study rates are based on profiles for male and female drivers aged 17, 25, 40, and 60. Vehicles used include the 2020 and 2025 Toyota Camry, 2020 and 2025 Toyota RAV4, and 2020 and 2025 Ford F-150, with annual mileages of 7,000 and 14,000 for each vehicle. Three car insurance coverage levels were used, as were credit tiers of good and poor. Clean driving records, as well as records with one accident, one speeding violation, or one DUI were also used in the calculations of certain driver archetypes.   
  
The three coverage levels we used are referred to as "low," "medium," and "high." Low coverage refers to the minimum coverage required in each state the insurer covers, along with any other mandatory coverages in the state. The medium coverage tier is $50,000/$100,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible, $50,000 property damage coverage, $50,000/$100,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, and any other mandatory coverages a state may require. The high coverage tier is $100,000/$300,000 bodily injury coverage, comprehensive and collision coverage with a $500 deductible, $100,000 property damage coverage, $100,000/$300,000 uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage per accident, as well as any other mandatory coverages a state may require.   
  
To get the average annual rate used in our analysis, we computed the mean rate for male and female drivers aged 25, 40, and 60 who drive 14,000 miles per year, have medium coverage, good credit, and a clean driving record. The rates are for comparative purposes only and should not be considered “average” rates available by individual insurers. Because car insurance rates are based on individual factors, your car insurance rates will differ.
