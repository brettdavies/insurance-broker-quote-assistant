Starting March 1 they are stopping most MAPD plan commissions. What's odd is they are paying on "new to FL blue at the renwal rate" but paying $0 on new to Medicare. Not even sure how that works or maybe I'm reading it wrong.

I was laughed at 6 months ago when i mentioned commissions being slashed . It's in motion now . Pay close attention to all carrier stocks collapsing the last few weeks. Profit pressures are immense . The big fat agent commissions have a big target on there back

FL Blue didn't pay commission before 3-4 years ago. A lot of counties are stopping in 2025, maybe 2026. But, I'll bet they'll be back in soon.   
I made it a decade not selling them and didn't lose sales. Won't happen now either.   
  
I think a lot of companies underestimated the drug cap including Fl blue. $15 tier 3 is way too low. I have a guy hitting the cap with them next year after spending $80 or so.

Chazm the list of carriers pulling comp is growing . Anthem pulled almost every plan in 4 states oct 30 . Cigna same . Aetna and many regionals . Is this the beginning? Next aep will answer many of these questions . As I said I go till the wheels fall off but many bad signs are forming
