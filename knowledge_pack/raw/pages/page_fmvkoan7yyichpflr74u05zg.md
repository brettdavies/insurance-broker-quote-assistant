Geico's cheap rates are a mystery to many, but it all starts with their business model. Geico uses a direct-to-consumer approach, cutting out middlemen like agents and brokers to save on costs.
By selling policies directly to customers, Geico eliminates the need for commissions, which are a **significant expense for traditional insurance companies**. This approach allows Geico to pass the savings on to customers.
Geico also uses a unique underwriting process that takes into account various factors, including driving history and credit score. This process helps Geico to **accurately assess risk and offer lower rates** to customers who are less likely to file a claim.

## Why Geico is Cheap
GEICO's business model is a key factor in its affordability. They sell insurance directly to consumers, cutting out the middlemen and local offices that other companies have.
This approach allows GEICO to save on overhead costs. Having a **smaller agent network is a big part** of that.
Credit: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9-N5YYdS0E), Geico Discounts
GEICO's rates are significantly lower than those of its top competitors, like State Farm and Progressive. This is _largely due to their direct-to-consumer sales model_.
In one scenario, GEICO came in at #5 out of 48 companies with a rate of $725 for basic liability-only insurance. That's a pretty impressive ranking.
The overall average based on the 48 companies was $1,078, about $350 more than GEICO's proposal. This shows just how competitive GEICO's rates are.
GEICO's rates are also lower in other regions, like Florida. In the Sunshine State, GEICO came in at #3 out of 20 companies with a rate of $952 for minimum coverage.
In Florida, the overall average prices for minimum coverage were $1,970 and for full coverage were $5,073. GEICO's estimates were a fraction of that.
The J.D. Powers Insurance Shopping Study for 2018 shows that customers feel GEICO's service is average for the industry. However, they did rate GEICO "Better Than Most" in the **policy offering and pricing category**.

## Geico's Business Model
Credit: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1RebzeEzP0), Why is Geico cheap
Geico's low prices are a result of its efficient business model, which allows the company to keep costs low and pass the savings on to customers.
The company has a low overhead cost structure, with a small number of agents and a focus on online sales.
Geico's use of a **15-minute phone call to gather policy information** and issue quotes is a **key factor in its low costs**.

### Direct Sales
Geico's direct sales approach has been a key factor in its success. The company sells directly to customers, cutting out middlemen and reducing operating costs.
This strategy allowed Geico to pass the savings on to its customers, making high-quality insurance more affordable. By doing so, Geico became the **second-largest insurer of private passenger vehicles** in the United States.
The founder, Leo Goodwin, was a pioneer in this approach, making a bold decision that went against the trend at the time.
### Usage-Based Auto Insurance
Usage-Based Auto Insurance is a unique offering from Geico, allowing customers to **earn discounts based on their driving habits**. This program is called DriveEasy.

Geico's DriveEasy uses an app and sensors in your phone to track your driving habits, monitoring behaviors such as hard braking, distracted driving, cornering, and time of day. The app provides a driving score, helping you identify areas for improvement.
Liberty Mutual also offers a usage-based auto insurance program called RightTrack, which has two options: a **mobile app or a plug-in device** for certain states. The RightTrack mobile app tracks driving behaviors and shows your score, while the plug-in device is specifically for New York residents.
