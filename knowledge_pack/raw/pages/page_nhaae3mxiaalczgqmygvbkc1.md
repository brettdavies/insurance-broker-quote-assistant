## Umbrella Insurance Explained
Have you ever been in a legal battle because of property damage, a car accident involving your child, or your dog biting a neighbor’s son? If so, you’ve probably heard of an umbrella insurance plan.
Umbrella insurance coverage gives you extra liability coverage beyond what your regular insurance covers. Many providers, like MetLife, offer this coverage. (Learn more: [Does MetLife offer umbrella insurance coverage?](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/does-metlife-offer-umbrella-insurance-coverage/))
Think of your liability insurance like a raincoat—it protects you, but not completely. Your legs might still get wet because your coat doesn’t cover them.
Now, imagine carrying an umbrella. It has a wider span than your raincoat, giving you more protection. That’s how an umbrella insurance policy works—it gives you extra coverage when your basic insurance isn’t enough.
To get the most out of your umbrella insurance policy, follow umbrella insurance tips, such as making sure your primary insurance has coverage limits that are high enough before adding an umbrella insurance plan. This will ensure that your umbrella coverage only kicks in when your regular insurance reaches its limit.
Umbrella coverage is often called second-tier or second-layer insurance because it only kicks in after you use up the personal liability coverage in your primary policy. An umbrella policy gives you extra coverage when your regular insurance isn’t enough.
This type of coverage helps you save money while giving you more protection at a lower premium since your first-tier insurance covers most situations. Choosing the best umbrella insurance makes sure you have the right coverage for unexpected events.
With umbrella insurance protection, you get an extra layer of security that helps protect you from big financial losses in case of lawsuits or large claims.
_**TIP:** Increasing your liability limits will increase your premium payments. Decide whether you need an increased limit before you purchase umbrella coverage._

You can purchase a personal umbrella rider, but this is typically offered as a stand-alone policy. Most insurers make you raise your liability limits on your existing policies before they sell you umbrella coverage.
For example, MetLife umbrella insurance may require you to raise the liability limits on your home or auto insurance before adding an umbrella policy. This makes sure your primary insurance covers most claims before your umbrella insurance coverage takes over.
Read more: [MetLife Auto Insurance Review](https://www.freeadvice.com/insurance/metlife-auto-insurance-review/)
When you purchase umbrella coverage for your home, your insurance company may require you to boost the liability limits on your homeowner’s policy from $300,000 to at least $500,000 to maintain your umbrella policy. You will need to have a greater amount of protection in place before your umbrella liability insurance policy will activate.
The reason for this requirement is that umbrella insurance is designed to step in only after your primary insurance has covered its part. By increasing your first-tier coverage, you reduce the chances of using your umbrella policy too soon.
![Who is generally covered under an umbrella insurance policy? Infographic: Umbrella Insurance](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
This also helps the insurance company by making sure you use up your first-tier coverage before it pays anything under your umbrella liability insurance policy. In the long run, having the right coverage limits protects you from large financial losses and ensures you meet the insurance company’s requirements.
**TIP:** _The average homeowner’s liability coverage limits are normally $300,000 to $500,000. It is not uncommon today for a claim to exceed your liability limits. Umbrella coverage would step in once you have exhausted your underlying limits_.

## How Umbrella Insurance Protects You
Umbrella insurance coverage gives you extra protection beyond the liability limits of your homeowner’s insurance. You can buy an umbrella policy in amounts like $1 million, $2 million, or up to $10 million.
It is not uncommon to have lawsuits resulting in millions of dollars, making umbrella insurance a valuable coverage to have if you are sued. 
Daniel Walker **Licensed Insurance Agent**
If your dog bites a neighbor’s child, your umbrella liability insurance helps cover medical bills and legal costs. Without this coverage, a single lawsuit could wipe out everything you’ve worked for.
Here’s what an umbrella policy covers:
  * **Injury or Property Damage Liability** : This covers injuries or property damage caused by you, your family, or hazards on your property, like swimming pools and trampolines.
  * **Off-Premises Liability** : Covers incidents away from home, like a dog bite injury (Learn about [dog bite injuries: do’s & don’ts](https://www.freeadvice.com/legal/dog-bite-injuries-dos-donts/))
  * **Rental Property Liability:** Protects landlords from lawsuits if an accident happens at a rental property.
  * **Legal Defense Coverage:** Pays for lawyer fees if you need to defend yourself in court.


Getting the cheapest umbrella insurance might not always give you the best protection. Comparing options like a MetLife umbrella insurance policy can help you find the right coverage.
## What Umbrella Insurance Won’t Cover
An umbrella policy has its limitations, so it’s best to read and know what is not covered. Some of the disadvantages of umbrella insurance are:
  * **Intentional Damages:** If you intentionally cause damage, your umbrella policy will not cover it.
  * **Exotic Vehicle Liability:** Aircraft, jet skis, and other exotic vehicles are not covered. (Snowmobiles and golf carts are usually covered.)
  * **Damage to Your Own Property:** If your own property is damaged, this policy won’t cover it. Your homeowner’s insurance might, depending on the cause.
  * **Business-Related Liability:** Business claims aren’t covered under an umbrella policy. You’ll need business insurance for that.
  * **Employment-Related Liability:** Doctors, lawyers, and other professionals won’t get coverage for work-related issues under this policy.


An umbrella policy only covers damages caused by others, not damage you do to your own property. It also won’t cover criminal acts, intentional harm, business liabilities, or flood damage, which require separate policies.

## Deciding if Umbrella Insurance Coverage is Right for You
Umbrella insurance is useful if you have high liability risks. To see if it’s a good choice, ask yourself:
  * **Are you a landlord?** Renting out property can lead to lawsuits for wrongful eviction, tenant injuries, or poor maintenance.
  * **Do you have a high net worth or a high-earning job?** Wealth can make you a target for lawsuits if someone gets hurt and knows you can pay.
  * **Do you have an aggressive dog?** Even a small dog bite could lead to an expensive lawsuit.
  * **Do you own a swimming pool or trampoline?** These increase the risk of serious injuries or accidents. (Learn more: [Homeowner Swimming Pool Liability](https://www.freeadvice.com/legal/homeowner-swimming-pool-liability/))


If any of these apply to you, umbrella insurance can give you extra protection and peace of mind.
**IMPORTANT!** _Make sure your umbrella coverage is over and above your underlying limits. For example, if you purchase a $1 million dollar umbrella policy, this coverage should be $1 million above your $300,000 homeowners liability, giving you a total combined coverage of $1,300,000 in liability coverage (as opposed to your underlying limits being included in the $1,000,000 which would give you only a total of $700,000)_.

## Cost of Umbrella Insurance Coverage
The umbrella insurance coverage cost varies based on the insurance company, your coverage limits, and personal factors like your credit score and claims history. On average, a $1 million umbrella policy costs around $12 to $25 per month, while higher coverage amounts will cost more.

## 3 Case Studies: Umbrella Insurance Coverage
Umbrella insurance coverage provides additional protection when your standard insurance is not sufficient. These true stories demonstrate how it can assist when something unexpected occurs.
John, being a businessman, was sued by a former worker for $2 million due to workplace discrimination. His standard insurance paid out $1 million, and his umbrella liability insurance settled the remaining amount. This shielded John’s personal assets.
Sara had a party in her backyard, and a guest fell and was severely injured. The medical expenses and lawsuit exceeded her $500,000 homeowner’s liability coverage. Fortunately, her umbrella liability policy provided $1 million in additional coverage, paying the balance and saving her financially.
Tom, who was a landlord, was sued for $3 million when a tenant slipped due to a faulty staircase. His umbrella insurance coverage paid the entire claim, safeguarding both his personal and business assets.
