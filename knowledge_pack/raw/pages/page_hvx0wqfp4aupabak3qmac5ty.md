Our hearts and thoughts go out to the people and communities affected by these fires. **We are focused on our customers and helping them recover from the largest fire event we have ever experienced in the state.**
**Keeping our promise to customers:**
  * **Our claims force is the largest in the industry** and we are bringing the full scale and force of our catastrophe response teams to help customers recover. 
  * As of Nov. 6, we have received over 13,500 claims related to the fires and have paid almost $5 billion to our California customers.


Six months after the wildfires
State Farm® claims employees, associates, and agents remain on the ground helping customers recover and we empathize with those who are rebuilding their lives six months after the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. As of July 15, we have received over 13,000 claims related to the fires and have paid over $4.3 billion to our California customers.   
  
Given the magnitude of this event and the impact on so many individuals and families, we are still actively working with customers through the claims process. In the weeks after the fires, more than 1,000 claims employees came from across the country to help customers in Los Angeles. Many more assisted virtually. Today, hundreds of State Farm claims representatives remain in California to assist customers. We evaluate each claim, including smoke claims, on a case-by-case basis. We’re committed to providing every customer all the benefits they have available through their policy.   
  
With more than 2.8 million residential and commercial policies, State Farm General is California’s largest private insurer. Having sufficient resources helps ensure we can cover any future claims from our State Farm General customers. In June 2024, well before the tragic wildfires this year, State Farm General submitted a rate increase request as a critical step to restoring the financial health of State Farm General.   
  
In February 2025, State Farm General requested a smaller emergency interim rate increase, which was approved by the Commissioner in May. It’s important to note that this interim rate increase must still be permanently approved through a formal rate hearing later this year and is only a portion of the original rate increase requested in June 2024, long before the wildfires.   
  
In addition, State Farm General obtained from its parent company, State Farm Mutual, an advance of $400 million under a surplus note issued by State Farm General. The California Department of Insurance granted approval of that surplus note on June 23, 2025. State Farm General is obligated to repay the surplus note balance plus interest over time.   
  
We will continue to work alongside regulators, policymakers and industry leaders to create a sustainable insurance environment in California.
Immediate support for customers affected by wildfires
Your safety and recovery are our top priorities. If you’ve been impacted by the wildfires, here’s how we can help:
  * Filing Claims: If you’ve experienced damage, you can file a claim through:
    * Your local State Farm agent.
    * Calling 1-800-SF-CLAIM.
    * Using the State Farm mobile app or visiting [_statefarm.com_](https://www.statefarm.com/).
  * Premium Payment Assistance: Our agents are ready to provide premium payment extensions for those facing financial strain**.**


State Farm Catastrophe Team® deployed
The State Farm Catastrophe Response Team has deployed to California to help residents recover from this catastrophe. Our catastrophe response includes a dedicated, mobile workforce, specially trained to handle catastrophe claims and prepared to go anywhere in the country. Our on-the-ground team is fully equipped to respond to our customers’ needs in the face of these devastating wildfires.
Our response also includes local California State Farm agents who live and work in these same neighborhoods as our customers, and they are joined by thousands of employees in centralized care centers across the country virtually helping answer customers’ questions and file their claims. Our remote claim teams can conduct virtual meetings and inspections with our customers.
Tips to help protect customers from fraud and scams
There unfortunately may be some dishonest contractors attempting to take advantage and defraud or scam residents as they seek to rebuild or repair their homes. **The following tips will help protect from fraud or scams:**
  * If you have property damage to your home, contact State Farm as soon as possible to report your claim.
  * Make temporary repairs as timely as possible to prevent further damage, but do not make repairs that go beyond temporary mitigation until the damages can be assessed by State Farm. Preserve any items or materials moved or taken from your home until you speak with your claim handler.
  * Be careful **not to sign any documents** with a contractor or builder before fully reading and understanding them.
  * Deal with reputable local contractors whenever possible. **Take time to verify references and licenses and get multiple quotes.**
  * Insist on a written estimate and work contract with a breakdown of costs, payment due dates, and contact information. Do not agree to pay for repairs in full before the work has been completed to your satisfaction.
  * Be on the lookout for red flags such as **asking for full payment before starting the work, lack of communication with you, or frequent unexpected expenses**.
  * When considering short- or long-term living accommodations or lodging while making repairs or rebuilding, verify the identity of the landlord (for example, meet the landlord in person), read reviews by other people, and don’t pay a deposit until you have seen the property in person.

Personal Property Coverage
Our focus continues to be on supporting our customers in their recovery from the devastating 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles. Effective April 14, State Farm General Insurance Company increased advance contents payments to customers with total losses from 50% of their contents limit to 65%  _without requiring an inventory_. We’ll continue to work with state and federal officials in support of our customers and appreciate their engagement.
Contents coverage is one type of benefit within the policy. Another type is dwelling coverage, which helps cover damage to the home and attached structures such as garages and structures permanently attached to the home or property. Contents coverage helps cover personal possessions not permanently attached to the home or property, such as furniture and electronics.
Approximately 2,500 of our customers have experienced total losses stemming from the January 2025 wildfires.
We understand this is a difficult time for our impacted customers, and we’re here to help. Our claim handlers are assisting customers with their claims, including the contents inventory.
Previously, we offered advances up to 50% of the policy’s contents limit to customers who suffered a total loss from the January wildfires without requiring a detailed personal property inventory. This already went substantially beyond what California law requires. State Farm General typically advances more dollars in contents coverage than other companies because of the policy benefits offered.
After receiving the advance, customers can complete a contents inventory, with assistance from their agent and assigned claim representative, to receive additional payment up to the full policy limit.
We’re reaching out to customers who already received an advance to offer the additional 15%. Customers will need to sign a form to receive this additional amount.

[State Farm Newsroom](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/)
## Understanding California
State Farm serves more customers in California than any other insurer, and we’ve been doing this for nearly 100 years. In LA County, we insure 250,000 homes and 880,000 automobiles. We continue to insure over 1 million homes and more than 4 million autos representing billions in risk across the state.
**Non-Renewal Update, 1/16/25**
Following the recent wildfires, homeowners non-renewals in Los Angeles County were paused. Any of these homeowners' policies which had pended non-renewals in LA County that were on the books on January 7th will have an option to renew with State Farm General.
This decision reflects our commitment to supporting our customers and goes beyond the Department of Insurance's request. Our focus is on continuing to meet our customers’ needs and working closely with the State of California to create a sustainable insurance market. This is an evolving situation, and our focus remains on our customers.
LA County customers will have an option to renew with State Farm for another policy term. Policyholders in the fire zones with total losses would have the option to renew with State Farm for two policy term renewals, as required by law.
