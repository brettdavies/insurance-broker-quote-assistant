### State Farm vs. Safeco: rates for high-risk drivers
If you are saddled with an at-fault collision or [ticket](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/tickets-violations/), State Farm could be the better choice than Safeco. However, a reckless driving or DUI charge costs less at Safeco. Every car insurance company has different post-violation pricing structures, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurance company suits you.
##### RATES BY VIOLATION: SAFECO VS. STATE FARM
**Citation** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,849 | $2,546

DUI/DWI | $3,854 | $2,796  
Reckless driving | $2,895 | $2,853  
Speeding ticket | $1,983 | $2,512  
#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### State Farm vs. Safeco: rates by age bracket
Auto insurance companies rely on a driver's age to outline risk potential, assigning rates accordingly. A car insurance policy is typically expensive for drivers younger than 25 — due to their inexperience — and more affordable for older drivers. Because every auto insurance company rates age brackets uniquely, it's worth shopping around and finding the best rate for you.
As a general rule, [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) should choose State Farn over Safeco: the former's average annual rates are $1,945 less.
##### COMPARING AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY AGE: SAFECO VS. STATE FARM
**Age** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Safeco avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $5,820 | $7,765  
**20s** | $2,379 | $2,566  
**30s** | $1,585 | $2,566  
**40s** | $1,587 | $2,128  
**50s** | $1,558 | $1,745  
**60s** | $1,485 | $1,687  
Affordability aside, State Farm and Safeco each have pros and cons, including their discounts, perks, customer satisfaction ratings, and financial stability. Be sure to shop around before settling on an option.

Rating from The Zebra [ Question mark icon ](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/state-farm-vs-safeco/)
State Farm has a number of great options for [add-on coverage](https://www.thezebra.com/homeowners-insurance/coverage/homeowners-insurance-policy-endorsements/), making them a great option for customers looking for flexible or with unique coverage needs.
