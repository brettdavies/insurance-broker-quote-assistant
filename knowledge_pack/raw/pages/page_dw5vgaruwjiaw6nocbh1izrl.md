## Average Car Insurance Expenditure in California by Age Bracket
It’s a fact of life: [as you age](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/), your auto insurance premiums change. Typically, auto insurance is pricier for [young drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-young-adults/) and [teens](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/), as auto insurance companies see newer drivers as less responsible. Rates are cheapest for California drivers in their 60s. Have a look at average rates by age below.
###### CALIFORNIA CAR INSURANCE RATES BY AGE
Age | Average Yearly Premium  
---|---  
16 | $7,175.12  
17 | $6,853.99  
18 | $6,021.14  
19 | $4,428.57  
20s | $2,416.70

#### Rates by age in California
In California, auto coverage costs $7,175 annually for a [16-year-old driver](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/car-insurance-16-year-olds/), compared to $1,450 per year for a driver between [50 and 59 years](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/discounts/senior-citizen-discount/) of age. It's worth noting, however, that a 16-year-old added to a parent's insurance plan will not be as expensive as a teenager getting their own policy. 
If you're facing the pricey prospect of insuring a teen driver, it's worth noting California is the 34th cheapest state in which to purchase car insurance for a 16-year-old.

One benefit of getting hitched — aside from the honeymoon — is the better deal you may receive on your car insurance policy.

###### CALIFORNIA CAR INSURANCE RATES BY MARITAL STATUS

* * *
## Average Auto Insurance Costs in California by Credit Score
[Car insurance companies](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-companies/) use credit score to get an idea of a potential customer's reliability. Data trends show drivers with good credit histories are often more dependable car insurance customers: they are less likely to file claims covered by auto insurance. However, **California outlaws the use of credit score as an insurance rating factor** , meaning you'll pay the same car insurance rate no matter your credit history.
###### CALIFORNIA AUTO INSURANCE RATES BY CREDIT SCORE
Credit Tier | Average Annual Rate  
---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $1,649.21  
Fair (580-669) | $1,649.21  
Good (670-739) | $1,649.21  
Very Good (740-799) | $1,649.21  
Exceptional (800-850) | $1,649.21
