This is why I never, EVER, go through the other person's insurance to fix my car. I file a claim with my insurance company. My insurance company then tells me where to take the car to get fixed. Then my insurer goes after whoever they want to get the money. My insurer pays for the rental too. I pay my deductible which is refunded. This takes me out of the middleman business where I have to track down people, file small claims, or any other nonsense.

The state minimum for liability is $5k in California. So if they were carrying the state minimum, then that's all there is. You can't compel insurance to pay above the policy limit. So unless you are alleging that they are lying to you about their coverage limits, your best option is to file with your insurance if your damages exceed $5k.

Yes, I believe for renewals happening 1/1/25 or later. I’m not sure why ERAC wouldn’t have more coverage here unless the accident happened last year.

> > I also find it hard to believe that a large company like Enterprise has a 5k limit on property damage. 
Their rental contracts transfer liability to the driver who is renting the car, which is why they require that you either purchase the extra insurance that they offer, or provide proof of your own. 
So yes, Enterprise as a corporation definitely has much higher coverage limits to that but to get them to pay would likely require taking them to court and challenging the wording in their rental agreements. I'm no lawyer, but I'm sure there's precedent for people trying that in the past, there's probably documented cases in various states that could be found to see how such a lawsuit typically turns out. 
Turn it in to your own insurance.

Enterprise as a corporation has no liability here for the negligence of their renter, which is federally protected by law. Rental cars are only required to have state minimum coverage in CA for the renter and that's what has been provided by Enterprise. OP should be involving their own insurance or sue the driver, but apparently they were a foreign traveler, so that's probably a dead end.

Nope. California allows people to carry 5K PD limits and as you can imagine, lots of people do. 
I would call your insurance company this morning and get the process started.

That is an absurdly small minimum. I'm gonna guess that it's old and not inflation-adjusted, and that no legislator wants to be known as the guy who made everybody get more expensive insurance.

They just changed the PD to 15k this year. So any new and renewing policies will have 15k as of 1/1/2025. Meaning if he was in the middle of his term he is not required to have the higher 15k until renewal. 15k is still crazy but hey people still carried 5k for whatever reason

You could pursue the driver in small claims court, but the chances of collecting are slim. While there could be idiots with money driving around with state minimums, usually the only people who do are the people with no money sue for.

They likely did not have enterprise insurance and relied on their own policy, which they can do 
California has a $5k minimum liability. Thats fully on state lawmakers, and is an indirect tax on everyone in the state driving a car worth more than $5k, which is almost every car these days. 
You're going to need to file a claim on your own collision insurance. They will attempt to subrogate and collect your deductable to refund you. Don't hold your breath on that one.

In my state, I could go through “uninsured/underinsured motorist” coverage. This is the same coverage I would use for a hit and run. It’s no fault to (meaning no raise in premium) but I have to pay a $250 deductible. 
In a case like yours, depending on how much my insurance company would have to pay, they would sue the driver civilly for the difference. This includes seeing in the have private car insurance and submitting a claim against it. Either way, I wouldn’t really be involved with that portion as fault is already determined. And if they win, I’d get my deductible back.

Ask Enterprise why they’re only affording $5,000 in coverage when the minimum PD limit was raised to $15,000 as of 1/1/25.

What Enterprise carries in their vehicles and if the driver pays with a credit card and has coverage provided through that, or if they have coverage extended through their personal policy for covering occasionally renting a vehicle are all different issues. 
You can spend the time chasing down everyone you need to file a claim with to get your vehicle repaired, or you can file a claim on your insurance and let them do the work. It won't count against your claim history if they are able to recover all the damages from each of the different policies in play during the accident.

5k is minimum PD limit for 2024 policies that haven't renewed in 2025 yet. 
Also if they are under the CLCA (CA Low Auto) program then its 3k. 
A basic policy under the California’s Low Cost Auto (CLCA) Insurance program coverage provides: 
  * Up to $10,000 per person in case of bodily injury or death 
  * Up to $20,000 per accident in case of bodily injury or death 
  * Up to $3,000 for property damage
