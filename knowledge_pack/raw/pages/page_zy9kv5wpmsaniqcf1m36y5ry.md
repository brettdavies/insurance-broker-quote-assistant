## Is Loggerhead a good insurance company?
**Loggerhead Insurance may be a good company if you're trying to find coverage after Progressive canceled your policy or if you're trying to switch from Citizens Insurance.** However, because it's a new company, it doesn’t have a long track record of positive customer reviews.
Also, if you're just looking for the best rate, you might want to look at other Florida homeowners insurance companies.
**Progressive has partnered with Loggerhead to offer home insurance to Floridians who had policies canceled by Progressive.**
However, you don't have to get insurance from Loggerhead if you're a former Progressive customer. If Progressive sent you a nonrenewal notice, you should shop for quotes from multiple companies. That's usually the best way to make sure you're getting reliable customer service and the coverage you need at an affordable price.

## What is Loggerhead Insurance?
**Loggerhead Insurance may be worth checking out if you're a Florida homeowner having a hard time finding coverage elsewhere.** It's also a good option for Progressive customers losing their coverage.
  
As a newer insurance company, Loggerhead doesn't have an established reputation for great customer service. Choosing a larger company with a strong history of happy customers may be a better choice.
Loggerhead is a home insurance company founded in 2022, based in Tampa, Florida.
Loggerhead sells policies through independent insurance agents throughout Florida. That means you'll need to contact a local agent to get a quote from Loggerhead. Independent agents sell insurance from multiple companies. So you'll be able to compare quotes from other companies at the same time.
**Although it's a newer company, Loggerhead is on good financial footing.** It earned an A or "Excellent" score from Demotech. That means it should be able to pay out claims, even if Florida experiences a big disaster.
Loggerhead is what's called a reciprocal insurance exchange, which means its customers own it. Unlike other insurance exchanges, Loggerhead says its customers won't have to pay higher rates if the company isn't performing well. However, you could get a payout if the company is doing well financially.

## Loggerhead home insurance coverage
Loggerhead offers three levels of home insurance coverage: essential, enhanced and elite.
Talk with your insurance agent to see which option will best fit your needs based on your budget, location and unique risk factors or concerns.
* * *

### Essential coverage
**[Essential coverage #essential ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loggerhead-insurance-review#essential "#essential")** includes the [standard home insurance coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage "What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?") you would find at a major insurance company. Essential coverage from Loggerhead comes with:
  * **[Dwelling coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-coverage "What Is Dwelling Insurance? How Does It Protect Your Home?")** , which pays for damage to the structure of your home.
  * **[Personal property coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-property-insurance "What Is Personal Property Insurance?")** , which pays to replace your belongings if a covered event, like a fire, damages them.
This coverage is based on the current condition of your things, including wear and tear. This is also called [actual cash value](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance"). That means you won't get enough money to replace your stuff with new things.
  * **[Personal liability coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance/personal-liability-insurance "Personal Liability Insurance: How Much Does It Cost?")** , which protects you if you hurt someone or damage their property by accident.
  * **[Other structures coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/does-homeowners-cover-other-structures "What Is Other Structures Coverage for Home Insurance?")** , which pays for damage to structures on your property, like a detached garage, shed or fence.
  * **[Loss of use coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loss-of-use-homeowners-insurance "What Is Loss of Use Coverage for Homeowners and Renters?")** , which pays for many of the costs of living away from home if your house is damaged and unsafe. This can include a hotel or rental home, moving expenses and the cost of meals if your rental doesn't have a kitchen. 


* * *

### Enhanced coverage
Enhanced coverage includes all of the protection you get with the essential coverage package, along with a few coverage upgrades like the ones listed below.
  * [Replacement cost coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance") pays to replace damaged things with new items. 
  * Water backup coverage pays for water damage caused by a backed-up pipe or sewer or a broken sump pump. 
  * Animal liability coverage pays for damage or injuries caused by your pet. 
  * Refrigerated property coverage pays to replace spoiled food in your fridge or freezer after a power outage. 
  * Ordinance and law coverage pays to update your home based on current building codes after damage. 


Enhanced coverage also comes with higher limits for personal property, personal liability and loss of use.
* * *
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/auto-step3)
### Elite coverage
Loggerhead's Elite package comes with the coverage included in the essential and enhanced packages. It offers higher coverage limits than the other packages, along with a few extra types of coverage. Most importantly, it's the only package that includes full replacement cost for your roof. Homeowners with elite coverage should have to pay the least if they need a new roof after a windstorm.
  * **[Full roof replacement cost](https://www.valuepenguin.com/actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost "Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost in Home Insurance")** will pay the total cost to replace your roof  (minus your deductible) after an event your insurance covers, like a fire.
Many other home insurance companies factor wear and tear into your roof payout. If you have an older roof, you could pay a lot of money for a new one if you don't have replacement cost coverage.
  * **[Pool](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-pool-affects-your-homeowners-insurance "How a Pool Affects Your Homeowners Insurance") and [trampoline](https://www.valuepenguin.com/homeowners-insurance-coverage-trampolines-treehouses "Does Home Insurance Cover Trampolines and Treehouses?") liability coverage** helps cover medical expenses or the cost of a lawsuit if a guest is hurt while using your pool or trampoline.
  * **[Identity theft coverage](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-cyber-home-insurance "What Is Personal Cyber Insurance? And How Can Homeowners Buy a Policy?")** pays to help restore your identity if it's stolen. This can include reimbursing you for credit card fraud, expert help and more. 


Homeowners with elite coverage also benefit from a lower deductible if they have a major loss. However, Loggerhead doesn't give examples of what a large loss is or how much your deductible will be.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70/icons/shield)
**Loggerhead customers can also add firearm use protection to their home insurance policy.**
This coverage is called Loggerhead Shield. It pays for injuries, property damage and legal fees if your gun is discharged by accident, used in self-defense or used while lost or stolen.
However, personal liability coverage typically includes gun liability. Gun owners should check with their insurance company to see whether they're already protected.
## Loggerhead home insurance discounts
Loggerhead offers Florida homeowners several ways to save on their home insurance rates, like discounts for seniors and newly built homes.
  * **Newer construction and renovations:** Save money if your home is less than 10 years old or you replaced your roof within the last 10 years. 
  * **Protected community:** Get a discount if gates or a security system protect your neighborhood. 
  * **Seniors and retirees discount:** Florida homeowners over the age of 55 save 10% on Loggerhead home insurance. 
  * **Smart home discount:** Earn a discount if you install a fire or burglar alarm, leak detection, an automatic water shutoff valve or another protective device. 
  * **Accredited builder discount:** Get a discount if Loggerhead approves your home builder and it offers a home warranty. 


**Loggerhead also gives Florida homeowners a wind protection discount if their home has certain features that protect it from wind damage.**
How to get the Loggerhead wind protection discount
The wind protection discount is based on:
  * The type of protection you have for windows, doors, sliding glass doors, skylights and garage doors. This may include things like hurricane shutters or window film. 
  * The age of your roof, its building material and its shape. For example, a newer roof should earn a bigger discount since the weather's less likely to damage it. 
  * How your roof is attached to your home's frame, also known as the roof-deck attachment. 
  * The type of fasteners used to connect the roof to your home's walls. 
  * Whether you have a water-resistant liner under your shingles. 
  * Whether your home meets the 2001 Florida Building Code (FBC). If your home was built after March 1, 2002, it meets this standard. Older homes can also get this discount with certain windstorm mitigation upgrades. 


## Loggerhead Insurance reviews and ratings
Loggerhead Insurance only started selling home insurance in 2022, so it doesn't have a lot of customer reviews to help you decide if it's a good insurance company. However, it gets 63% fewer complaints than average, according to the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This means homeowners should find it easy to file and settle their claims.
Loggerhead earned an A financial strength score from Demotech. That means it should be able to pay out claims, even if Florida has a major emergency.
While an A rating is considered "Excellent," it is the third-highest rating from Demotech. Loggerhead doesn't have a rating from AM Best, the industry leader in financial strength ratings. This is likely because Loggerhead is a newer company. If you're concerned about the financial strength of your home insurance company, you may want to shop around.
**Floridians should also compare quotes from companies with a longer history of reliable customer service and financial stability.**
You should look for companies with an A+ financial strength rating from AM Best and positive customer service reviews, like [American Modern](https://www.valuepenguin.com/american-modern-insurance-review "American Modern Insurance Review for Nonstandard Homes") and [Nationwide](https://www.valuepenguin.com/nationwide-insurance-review "Nationwide Insurance Review").
## Frequently asked questions
### Is Loggerhead Insurance legitimate?

Loggerhead was founded in 2022, so it doesn't have a long history of dependable customer service like you'd expect from a major insurance company. That said, the company has been responsive to complaints and concerns filed through the Better Business Bureau (BBB), even though it's not a BBB-accredited business.
[Loggerhead should be able to pay out claims #reviews ](https://www.valuepenguin.com/loggerhead-insurance-review#reviews "#reviews") even if Florida has a major weather event, according to Demotech, which rates insurance companies based on their financial stability.

You should still [compare quotes from other Florida insurance companies](https://www.valuepenguin.com/best-cheap-homeowners-insurance-florida "The Best and Cheapest Homeowners Insurance Companies in Florida") before making a decision.
### Is Loggerhead Insurance a good option if I'm switching from Citizens?
