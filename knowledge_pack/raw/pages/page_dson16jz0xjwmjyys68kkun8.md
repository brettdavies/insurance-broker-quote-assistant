# Texas Minimum Insurance Requirements: Are They Enough?
Texas requires every driver to carry a minimum level of auto insurance to legally operate a vehicle. But legal compliance isn’t the same as financial protection. Many drivers only find this out after a serious accident – when they discover that their policy doesn’t cover all the damages.
[Leer esta página en español](https://es.ellisandthomas.com/texas-minimum-insurance-requirements-are-they-enough/)
Minimum coverage may satisfy the law, but it rarely covers the full cost of a crash. Between rising medical expenses, vehicle repair costs, and the potential for lawsuits, Texas’s liability minimums often fall short. Knowing what’s required – and what’s recommended – can help you avoid major financial risk.
### What Are the Current Minimum Insurance Requirements in Texas?
The mandatory minimum coverage in Texas is known as 30/60/25 liability insurance. It includes:
  * $30,000 for bodily [injury per person](https://www.ellisandthomas.com/how-do-pre-existing-medical-conditions-affect-a-personal-injury-claim/)
  * $60,000 total for bodily injury per accident
  * $25,000 for property damage per accident


These limits apply only if you’re at fault in a crash and only cover the other party’s injuries or property damage. They do not [pay for your own medical bills](https://www.ellisandthomas.com/car-accident-who-pays-medical-bills-texas/) or vehicle repairs.
Coverage Type | Limit | What It Typically Covers  
---|---|---  
Bodily Injury (Per Person) | $30,000 | One person’s emergency care, minor injuries  
Bodily Injury (Per Accident) | $60,000 | Shared among all injured parties  
Property Damage | $25,000 | Repairs or replacement for another vehicle or property  
For many accidents, especially those involving multiple injuries or high-value vehicles, these limits are quickly exhausted.
### Why Minimum Coverage May Not Be Enough
Medical care and vehicle damage are more expensive than ever. A visit to the ER alone can cost over $3,000. If two or more people are injured, the $60,000 bodily injury cap may be used up within days. And $25,000 won’t fully cover repairs for many newer vehicles.
Here’s a realistic scenario. You [cause an accident](https://www.ellisandthomas.com/are-parents-liable-for-an-accident-caused-by-their-teen/) with three people in the other car. Two passengers require surgery and rehab, and the third loses wages from missing work. Their car is a newer SUV valued at $38,000. Your insurance only pays up to the limits. The rest comes from your own pocket – or a potential lawsuit.
### What Happens If You Cause an Accident and Your Coverage Isn’t Enough?
When your insurance maxes out, you’re still responsible for anything left unpaid. The injured party can pursue you personally to recover those costs. That can lead to:
  * Civil lawsuits
  * Court judgments against you
  * Garnished wages or bank account liens
  * Long-term financial strain


Even if the other driver has coverage of their own, they may still hold you liable for the uncovered balance, especially if their injuries are serious or permanent.
### Recommended Coverage Levels for Better Protection
Increasing your liability limits is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself financially. Many drivers upgrade to:
  * 100/300/100: $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident, $100,000 property damage
  * 250/500/100: For even greater security, especially for drivers with assets to protect


Higher limits reduce your risk of being sued for unpaid damages. You should also consider full coverage, which includes:
  * Collision: Pays to repair your own [vehicle after an at-fault accident](https://www.ellisandthomas.com/single-vehicle-accident-claims/)
  * Comprehensive: Covers theft, hail, flooding, and non-collision incidents
  * UM/UIM: Protects you if the other driver has no insurance or too little
  * Medical Payments or PIP: Helps cover your medical bills regardless of fault

Coverage Tier | Liability Limits | Ideal For  
---|---|---  
Minimum | 30/60/25 | Legal compliance only  
Moderate | 100/300/100 | Typical families, most working professionals  
High | 250/500/100 | Drivers with assets or high-risk occupations  
### Alternatives That Supplement Minimum Coverage
You don’t have to rely on liability coverage alone. [Optional policy features can help manage costs when an accident](https://www.ellisandthomas.com/uninsured-driver-accident-texas/) exceeds coverage or involves special risks.
Popular supplemental coverages include:
  * Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM): Protects you when the at-fault driver can’t pay
  * Personal Injury Protection (PIP): Covers medical bills and lost wages, no matter who caused the crash
  * Medical Payments (MedPay): Helps pay your medical expenses with fewer restrictions than health insurance
  * Umbrella Policies: Provide extra liability coverage after your auto policy limits are exhausted


These options can add meaningful protection for only a small increase in premium.
### FAQs About Texas Minimum Auto Insurance
**Is the minimum coverage enough if I rarely drive?**  
Even occasional drivers face serious financial risk. One collision can still lead to tens of thousands in damages.
**Can someone sue me if I only have minimum coverage?**  
Yes. If your insurance doesn’t cover all the losses, the injured party can sue you for the rest.
**Do I need full coverage on a leased or financed car?**  
Yes. Most lenders and leasing companies require collision and comprehensive insurance to protect their interest in the vehicle.
**How much more does it cost to upgrade my coverage?**  
Raising your limits from 30/60/25 to 100/300/100 may only add $15 to $40 per month, depending on your driving record and location.
**Does minimum coverage pay for my injuries or car repairs?**  
No. It only covers the other driver’s losses. You’ll need additional coverage to protect yourself.
### Get the Protection You Actually Need
Having only the Texas minimum coverage might keep you legal, but it likely won’t keep you protected. One accident can put your savings, income, and assets at risk. Upgrading your policy now could save you tens of thousands later – and it’s more affordable than many drivers realize.
### Make Sure You’re Covered When It Matters Most
Meeting the legal minimum isn’t the same as having real protection. If you’re in an accident and your insurance isn’t enough to cover the damages, you could face lawsuits, out-of-pocket payments, and long-term financial loss.
