## How long does it take to get car insurance? 
You can get an online quote for car insurance in as little as four minutes from Progressive. If you're happy with the price, you can often purchase the policy and get immediate coverage. Whether you buy auto insurance online, over the phone, or through an agent, you typically need a few details to start a policy:
  * **Vehicle identification number (VIN)** : Located on the vehicle's dashboard or the driver's door, the VIN is necessary for all cars on your policy
  * **Driver's license number** : You need a valid driver's license, and your insurer requires the driver's license number for all drivers listed on the policy
  * **First payment** : You can pay monthly or in full, but be prepared to make an initial payment to start your policy. There's no such thing as ["no money down" auto insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/no-down-payment-car-insurance/).


## How does immediate car insurance work? 
With many insurers, including Progressive, your [auto insurance coverage](https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/) is typically effective once the payment is processed — if you choose to start the policy right away. Within minutes of purchasing a Progressive policy, Progressive will send an email to you with a link to your digital [proof of insurance](https://www.progressive.com/answers/proof-of-insurance/), so you can show coverage immediately.
However, some insurers may not offer same-day coverage in every situation. Always ask your insurer or agent exactly what day and time the policy takes effect.
If you need immediate coverage but your insurer has a waiting period, [consider shopping around](https://www.progressive.com/answers/how-to-shop-car-insurance/). Some companies will activate a policy more quickly.
### Am I covered for an incident that happens on the day that the policy goes into effect? 
You won't have coverage for an accident that occurs prior to the purchase of your insurance policy. Your insurance will cover an accident only if it happens after your coverage becomes effective. 
Most [states require some level of car insurance coverage](https://www.progressive.com/answers/state-car-insurance-information/), so make sure you're covered before you hit the road.
### Is same-day insurance coverage more expensive? 
Obtaining same-day coverage may result in paying a higher premium. Progressive may offer discounts for quoting a certain number of days in advance.

## How to get same-day car insurance
Try following these steps to find the right same-day auto policy for you:
  1. **Know what coverage you need** : A basic liability policy is the fastest and cheapest option, but if you lease or finance your car, you'll likely need comprehensive and collision coverage as well.
  2. **Choose your limits and deductible** : Higher limits offer more protection while a higher deductible can lower your premium. Make sure it's an amount you can afford in an emergency.
  3. **Get quotes from multiple insurers** : Have your coverage choices ready so you can compare policies apples to apples. Many companies let you buy online and start coverage the same day.


Same-day car insurance is possible with major insurers, including Progressive, if you have your information ready and choose a policy that starts immediately.
## Can I get car insurance online without talking to someone? 
Yes, Progressive makes it simple to quote and buy a policy entirely online. If you have questions or prefer to speak with someone, you can call [1-800-776-4737](tel:1-800-776-4737) to speak to a licensed representative for your state.
