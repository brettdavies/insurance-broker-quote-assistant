## State Farm vs. Farmers: rates for high-risk drivers
If you're saddled with an at-fault crash, speeding violation, reckless driving citation, or DUI offense on your driving résumé, Farmers could be a better choice than State Farm. Every auto insurance company prices its policies differently, so it's worth comparing quotes to find out which insurer is best for you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: FARMERS VS. STATE FARM
**Citation** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $2,849 | $2,334  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $1,524 | $1,699  
DUI/DWI | $3,854 | $3,239  
Reckless driving | $2,895 | $4,636  
Speeding ticket | $1,983 | $2,045  
## State Farm vs. Farmers: rates by age
Insurance companies rely on age to estimate risk, pricing policies accordingly. A car insurance policy is usually expensive for teen drivers — because of their inexperience — and relatively affordable for middle-aged drivers. Since every insurance company evaluates age tiers differently, it's smart to shop around and find a great rate.
As a general rule, teen drivers should choose State Farm over Farmers: State Farm offers average yearly savings of $698, compared to Farmers.
##### RATES BY AGE: FARMERS VS. STATE FARM
**Age tier** | **State Farm avg. annual premium** | **Farmers avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $5,820 | $6,518  
**20s** | $2,379 | $2,020  
**30s** | $1,585 | $2,020  
**40s** | $1,587 | $1,511  
**50s** | $1,558 | $1,507  
**60s** | $1,485 | $1,402  
Finances aside, State Farm and Farmers each come with pros and cons, including their customer satisfaction ratings, discount programs, add-ons, and financial stability. Be sure to weigh these elements before deciding.
