# Snapshot® by Progressive in Baldwin County, Alabama
At Heritage Insurance in Silverhill, we’re proud to represent [**Progressive Insurance**](https://www.heritageins.net/Progressive-Insurance), one of the most innovative carriers in the industry. One of Progressive’s most popular features is [**Snapshot**](https://www.progressive.com/auto/discounts/snapshot/)**®** , a usage-based insurance program that rewards safe driving with real discounts.
## What Is Snapshot®?
Snapshot® is Progressive’s **telematics program** , designed to personalize your insurance rates based on how you actually drive—not just general statistics like age or ZIP code. By tracking driving behavior through either the **mobile app** or a **plug-in device** , Snapshot can help lower your [auto insurance](https://www.heritageins.net/Auto-Insurance) premiums if you practice safe driving habits.
Drivers typically receive:
  * An **initial participation discount** just for enrolling.
  * The opportunity to earn **larger savings at renewal** based on performance.


## How It Works
When you enroll through Heritage Insurance, you’ll choose either the **Snapshot mobile app** or a **small plug-in device** mailed to you. Snapshot monitors:
  * **Time of day** you drive (late-night driving may increase risk)
  * **Hard braking and rapid acceleration**
  * **Speed and mileage**
  * **Phone usage while driving** (mobile app only)


You’ll be able to see a driving score and trip details inside the app, helping you improve your driving habits while working toward discounts.
## Do Other Carriers Offer Similar Programs?
Yes—many insurers now offer **usage-based insurance programs** like this, but Progressive’s Snapshot® is among the most established and widely used. Other companies may use similar systems (like [National General’s DynamicDrive](https://www.heritageins.net/DynamicDrive)), but Progressive’s program is unique in offering both a plug-in device and an app option.
## Things to Keep in Mind
While many drivers save with Snapshot®, not everyone will. If the program shows risky driving habits—like frequent hard braking, speeding, or late-night trips—it may impact your rate at renewal. Still, most safe drivers find that Snapshot® offers meaningful discounts and valuable feedback.
## Is Snapshot® Right for You?
If you’re a safe, consistent driver, Snapshot® is a great way to turn your good habits into savings. At **Heritage Insurance** , we’ll explain how it works, help you get set up, and make sure your policy is customized for the best value.
