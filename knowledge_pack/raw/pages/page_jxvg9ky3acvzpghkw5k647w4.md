Updates:
Oct. 6, 2025 – Recouping FAIR Plan Assessment Costs in California
The California FAIR Plan, with the approval of Insurance Commissioner Lara, can assess insurers licensed to sell property insurance in California if the FAIR Plan needs additional funds to help pay for property losses. Following the January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles County, California’s insurance commissioner approved a $1 billion FAIR Plan assessment levied to insurers operating in the state. Each insurer’s assessment was based on their market share. As the largest insurer in California, State Farm General’s assessment to be paid to the FAIR Plan was over $165 million.
Insurers may recoup up to 50% of their assessment from policyholders. All insurer requests to recoup assessment costs must be filed and approved by the California Department of Insurance. To recoup a portion of the assessment, State Farm General will implement a temporary supplemental fee on personal and commercial lines policies (e.g., homeowners, renters, businessowners) in California. Recouping the costs associated with the FAIR Plan assessment helps State Farm General continue to serve California customers.
This temporary supplemental fee is a percentage of an individual policy’s annual premium. For Homeowners and Rental Dwelling policies, the fee is 1.13% each renewal for two renewal periods. For other personal lines policies, the fee is 2.25% for one renewal period. For commercial policies, the fee is 0.26% for one renewal period. Customers will begin to see the temporary supplemental fee on policy renewals effective Dec. 1, 2025, for personal lines and Jan. 1, 2026, for commercial lines.
Aug. 4, 2025 – S&P Global Lowers State Farm General Financial Strength Rating to A- with Stable Outlook
**State Farm General S &P Global Rating Update (**[**_Financial Strength Rating lowered; Stable Outlook_**](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/101638780)**)**
S&P Global Ratings (S&P) concluded a [ _previously announced_](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3368291) review of State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm General) to evaluate its standalone rating, separate from the State Farm Group rating. With this review, S&P lowered its financial strength rating (FSR) of State Farm General from **‘A+’** to **‘A-’** with a **‘stable’** outlook and removed the **"CreditWatch - Negative"** from the rating.
The outcome was anticipated, and our approach is unchanged. We remain deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General, as it is difficult to match price to risk in California. To ensure the long-term sustainability of State Farm General, we are being diligent in our efforts to turn around the financial stability of the company.
State Farm General has taken numerous actions, including the June 2024 rate increase request, to ensure our financial strength allows us to continue to protect our California customers.
The recent emergency interim rate approval by the Commissioner and receipt of a $400 million investment from State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company®, through the issuance of a surplus note in June 2025, are critical steps in the process to continue serving our California customers.
The **‘A-’** rating meets Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac single family mortgage origination and servicing guidelines.
July 8, 2025 – State Farm General’s Ongoing Commitment and Response to California Wildfires
**State Farm General - Summary Update**
For six months, thousands of State Farm employees, associates, and agents have been helping customers recover from the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. Many left their own families to be there for customers who were impacted. As the state’s largest private insurer, helping people is what we do. To date, we’ve handled more than 13,000 claims following the fires and paid customers more than $4.2 billion. As we continue to work with our customers through the claims process, we anticipate paying at least $2 billion more.
Our goal has always been to be part of a sustainable insurance market in California. For years, State Farm General has worked to help customers and support the insurance market in the state of California, continuing to provide coverage for more than 2.8 million policies, including more than one million homeowners. Over the last nine years, we have recorded more than $5 billion in underwriting losses in pursuing that effort. Here are the facts:  

**Our priority after the wildfires was to help our customers recover. That remains our priority.**  

  * As of July 6, State Farm has received almost 13,000 claims related to the fires and paid over $4.2 billion to our California customers, more than any other insurer.   

  * Given the magnitude of this event and its impact on so many families, we are still actively working with customers through the claims process. Anyone with a question or a concern should reach out to us.  

  * We evaluate each claim, including smoke claims, on a case-by-case basis. We’re committed to providing every customer all the benefits they have available through their policy.  

  * We are proud to have helped thousands of State Farm customers to date and committed to helping all of those customers impacted recover.   



**State Farm has been committed to the state of California for almost a century.**  

  * State Farm has had a presence in California since 1928 and currently serves almost 7.8 million policies in California. This includes 2.8 million residential and commercial fire policies served through our affiliate, State Farm General in California.  

  * State Farm General began providing property and commercial coverage in California in 1998 to manage the unique property risk exposure and regulatory environment in the state. State Farm has multiple affiliates so that we may serve as many customers as possible.  



**State Farm wants to continue serving California customers over the long term by stabilizing its financial condition.**  

  * State Farm General submitted a rate increase to the California Department of Insurance in June 2024. That increase is a critical step to restoring the financial strength of State Farm General.  

  * Following the wildfires and the continued deterioration of capital from State Farm General, the Commissioner approved an emergency interim rate increase in May 2025.  

  * That increase must still be permanently approved through a formal rate hearing later this year and is only a portion of the original rate increase requested in June 2024.  



**Insurance will cost more for customers in California going forward because the risk is greater in California.**  

  * In spite of the elevated risk and a unique regulatory environment, home insurance premiums in California have not matched price to risk and are [ _below the national average_](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.iii.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/triple-i_trends_and_insights_california_homeowners_issues_brief_09212023.pdf__;!!KZXpRQ!TjCwCAykk5DCwRSHV8_f8AgGFSpPEEGslmIRNntHzLCNbxkan0EuANDD2ROncrcb6oXJyMeOxsO7De-pBJe7UeZxkPNvNweI$). In fact, over the last nine years, State Farm General paid $1.26 for every premium dollar collected, resulting in over $5 billion in cumulative losses.  

  * State Farm and each of its affiliates, including State Farm General in California, operate on an individual entity-by-entity basis without regard to the financial condition of any other affiliated entity. It is the expectation of State Farm that each affiliate will, on an individual basis over the long-term, generate and maintain capital sufficient to support itself. Such capital is not freely transferrable among affiliated entities. A key to making insurance work is that each customer pays premium in line with the risk they present. Customers outside California are not paying for risks in California and they should not be expected to. 


June 30, 2025 – State Farm General Cooperates with CDI
**State Farm Continues to Help Thousands of Californians**
State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm) is cooperating with the California Department of Insurance (CDI) and will comply with the market conduct exam process. A fair review will find that thousands of State Farm customers are being helped by our teams on the ground in Los Angeles County and are very satisfied. Our efforts will remain on serving all our customers and meeting our obligations under the contract while providing the necessary information to the CDI. The California Department of Insurance as well as other state regulators routinely examine all insurance companies. These exams help ensure processes and procedures are in full compliance with state regulations.
We’re here to help our customers recover and we empathize with those who are rebuilding their lives. Our focus continues to be on supporting our customers in their recovery from the largest fire event we have ever experienced. As of June 30, we have received approximately 13,000 total claims related to the fires and have paid over $4.2 billion to our California customers.
Our claims force is the largest in the industry and we have brought the full scale and force of our catastrophe response teams to help our Southern California customers recover. Our claim handlers remain on the ground assisting customers. Customers should continue to directly reach out to us with claim questions or concerns. We actively work with each of our customers to understand the facts of their loss, identify the damages and applicable coverage, and ultimately resolve their claim.
In California, we remain committed to helping build an affordable, available, and sustainable insurance market for all Californians.

May 13, 2025, 3 p.m. CDT – S&P Maintains State Farm General on CreditWatch-Negative Amid Financial Concerns
**State Farm General S &P Global Rating action (**[**_Financial Strength Rating remains on CreditWatch – Negative_**](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3368291)**)**
We remain deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General, as it is difficult to match price to risk in California. As we continue to emphasize in our ongoing interim rate filing, we need immediate rate increases to help stabilize State Farm General’s financial condition to be able to serve our California customers for the long-term. S&P’s decision today regarding changing its assessment of the status of State Farm General within the State Farm group from “Core” to**"Strategically Important** ", resulted in SF General no longer receiving the ‘AA’ financial strength rating (FSR) assigned to State Farm Mutual and its core subsidiaries by S&P. Also, S&P lowering of its FSR on State Farm General to **"A+"** rating and continuing the **"CreditWatch - Negative"** reinforces the need for urgency.
The ‘A+’ rating does not affect customers who use their State Farm General policy as collateral backing for their mortgage.
March 14, 2025 – State Farm Responds to Insurance Commissioner’s Provisional Rate Approval
**Response to Commissioner Lara's provisional rate approval**
It’s time for certainty in the California insurance market for our customers. The provisional nature of[ _today’s decision_](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/release026-2025.cfm)
State Farm General has worked openly and honestly with all parties in this process. In addition, State Farm General will continue to monitor capacity to support its risks and build sufficient capital for the future.
Feb. 26, 2025 – State Farm Urges Urgent Approval of Interim Rate Request to Support California Customers
Today we took the opportunity to reiterate with Commissioner Lara the urgency needed to approve State Farm General’s interim rate request so that State Farm General can continue helping California customers.
The actions State Farm General has taken in the state, including the request for interim rate increases, are designed to support State Farm General’s need to collect sufficient premiums to protect policyholders against the risk of loss to their homes and other property.
Feb. 25, 2025, 3 p.m. CST – State Farm General Placed on S&P CreditWatch-Negative
**State Farm General S &P Global Rating action (**[**_Financial Strength Rating placed on CreditWatch - Negative_**](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3328722)**)**
Feb. 25, 2025, 2 p.m. CST – State Farm Details Wildfire Loss Estimates and Urges Interim Rate Approval
**State Farm General Insurance Company responds to Commissioner Lara Ahead of Feb. 26 meeting; Shares cost estimates of wildfires**
Representatives from State Farm General Insurance Company (SFG) will attend a meeting tomorrow with Commissioner Lara about SFG’s emergency interim rate request. SFG submitted a [ _letter_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/download/3867bd51-fce0-4abd-9a96-cf2da05152d5/sfgtolara2.25.25.pdf) to the Commissioner today.
SFG’s current estimate of direct losses from the Los Angeles fires stands at approximately $7.6 billion, taking into account both reported and not reported claims. Estimates for SFG’s retained losses after reinsurance, and for SFG’s share of total FAIR Plan losses, are approximately $212 million and $400 million, respectively. Based on these estimates, and after accounting for reinsurance recoveries, tax impacts and partial recoupment of SFG’s allocation of the FAIR Plan’s recent $1 billion assessment, the January fires will reduce SFG’s surplus, which stood at $1.04 billion at the end of 2024 after a decline of over $300 million from year-end 2023, by approximately $400 million. These initial estimates will continue to be reviewed and updated, if needed, as we continue through the claim adjudication process and more information becomes available.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (SFM) serves as the primary reinsurer for SFG and will assume the majority of losses related to these fires ceded by SFG under its reinsurance contracts.
The interim rate request is not to pay for the costs of the wildfires. SFG will rely on existing surplus and a robust reinsurance program to pay claims from the wildfires.
Immediate interim approval is an indispensable and critical first step to eventually restoring the company’s financial strength. Financial strength is necessary so an insurance company can pay for any future claims for the risks it insures.
In the letter submitted today, SFG said it agrees with the California Department of Insurance that the Commissioner should approve the interim rate request as it is “in the public interest, in order to maintain maximum availability of homeowners insurance options in California.”
As SFG said in its [ _February 3 letter_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/download/90ab44d3-54d6-42b7-8d69-0d883fa5de78/february32025lettersenttocadepartmentofinsurance.pdf) to the Commissioner, approval is needed to help avert a dire situation for the more than 2.8 million policies issued by SFG, including 1 million State Farm General homeowners customers, and the insurance market in the state of California.
Last year, one rating agency downgraded SFG’s financial strength rating due to its capital position. With further capital deterioration as a result of the wildfires, additional downgrades could follow. If that were to happen, customers with a mortgage might not be able to use SFG insurance on the collateral backing for their mortgage. 
SFG insures high concentrations of risk in California that could generate financial losses multiple times larger than the company’s current surplus. A smaller capital base will further constrain SFG’s ability to provide ongoing coverage.
Insurance will cost more for customers in California going forward because the risk is greater in California. Over the last nine years, the lack of alignment between price and risk means that for every $1.00 collected in premium, SFG paid $1.26, resulting in over $5 billion in cumulative underwriting losses.
We look forward to working alongside regulators, policymakers and industry leaders on creating a sustainable insurance environment in California – one that balances risk and increased rates, ensures long-term market stability and allows insurers like SFG to remain a vital part of California’s future.
Feb. 14, 2025 – State Farm Responds to Denial of Emergency Interim Rate Request
**Response to California Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s denial of emergency interim rate request**
We are very disappointed the Commissioner ignored his department’s recommendation to take the critical and necessary step to approve State Farm General’s request for interim rate increases associated with our June 2024 filings. 
This lack of approval sends a strong message to State Farm General about the support it will receive to collect sufficient premiums in the future to protect Californians against the risk of loss to their homes, property, and other claims.
We have gone to great lengths to clearly answer the questions outlined by the Commissioner. While we’re positioned to handle all of the claims associated with the most recent wildfires, State Farm General must seriously consider its options within the California insurance market going forward. 
[**_Commissioner’s Response_**](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2025/upload/nr018CommissionerLetterEmergencyInterimRateApproval.pdf)
Additional Details
**State Farm General asks the California Department of Insurance to immediately approve interim rate increases**
  * **State Farm has served the customers of California for nearly 100 years and our intention is to continue serving them for many more.** State Farm has more customers in California than any other insurer. State Farm General Insurance Company is the state’s largest provider of Fire insurance, with more than 2.8 million policies in California. State Farm General protects more than 1 million homeowners customers.  

  * **State Farm helps people recover from the unexpected. That is what we are doing in the wake of the wildfires.** Thousands of State Farm agents, agent team members and employees are on the ground in California and are assisting customers virtually in the wake of this tragedy. As of February 1st, State Farm General (Fire only) has received more than 8,700 claims and has already paid more than $1 billion to customers. State Farm General will ultimately pay out significantly more, as collectively these fires will be the costliest disasters in the history of State Farm General. Reinsurance will assist us in paying what we owe to customers.  

  * **The costs of the January 2025 wildfires will further deplete capital from State Farm General.** Capital is necessary so an insurance company can pay for any future claims for the risks it insures.
    * Last year, one rating agency downgraded State Farm General’s financial strength rating due to its capital position. With further capital deterioration as a result of the wildfires, additional downgrades could follow. If that were to happen, customers with a mortgage might not be able to use State Farm General insurance on the collateral backing for their mortgage. 
    * **State Farm General asked the California Department of Insurance today to immediately approve interim rate increases** to help avert a dire situation for the more than 2.8 million policies issued by State Farm General, including 1 million State Farm General homeowners customers, and the insurance market in the state of California.  

  * **Insurance will cost more for customers in California going forward because the risk is greater in California.** Immediate emergency interim approval of additional rate is essential to more closely align cost and risk and enable State Farm General to rebuild capital.
    * We must appropriately match price to risk. That is foundational to how insurance works. Higher risks should pay more for insurance than lower risks.
    * Over the last 9 years, the lack of alignment between price and risk means that for every $1.00 collected in premium, State Farm General paid $1.26, resulting in over $5 billion in cumulative underwriting losses.
    * State Farm General’s attempts over that same period to both raise rates and restrict growth, in order to keep our risk profile in line with available surplus, were constrained by regulatory considerations and met with limited success. This was due in no small part to intervenors in the rate review process, whose efforts to delay and decrease needed rate adjustments prevented State Farm General from maintaining a capital position supportive of its risk profile and impaired its ability to support continued underwriting of California properties.
    * Even before the January wildfires, at year-end 2024, State Farm General’s Policyholder Protection Fund – or capital available to pay future claims – was approximately a quarter of what it was in 2016.
    * State Farm General has had an outstanding filed rate increase pending since June 2024.
    * The magnitude of expected claims payments for the recent wildfires, along with its share of FAIR Plan losses, puts even more pressure on State Farm General’s capital position.  

  * **State Farm General has made difficult decisions to attempt to responsibly limit overexposure in high-risk areas, while allowing for targeted growth in lower risk areas of the state.**
    * In [ _May 2023, State Farm General made the difficult decision_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/state-farm-general-insurance-company-california-new-business-update/) to stop writing any new policies.
    * In a detailed letter to the CDI in March 2024, State Farm General said, “The swift capital depletion of State Farm General is an alarm signaling the grave need for rapid and transformational action, including the critical need for rapid review and approval of currently pending and future rate filings.”
    * In [ _March 2024, another difficult decision_](https://newsroom.statefarm.com/update-on-california/) was made to non-renew 30,000 homeowners policies, representing the company’s greatest catastrophe risk. That non-renewal process is ongoing. Following the recent wildfires, homeowners non-renewals in Los Angeles County were paused. Any of these homeowner policies which had pending non-renewals in Los Angeles County that were on the books on January 7th will have an option to renew with State Farm General.
    * State Farm General still insures high concentrations of risk in California that could generate financial losses multiple times larger than the company’s surplus. A smaller capital base will further constrain State Farm General’s ability to provide ongoing coverage.  

  * **We look forward to working alongside regulators, policymakers and industry leaders on creating a sustainable insurance environment in California –** one that balances risk and increased rates, ensures long-term market stability and availability and allows insurers like State Farm General to remain a vital part of California’s future.
