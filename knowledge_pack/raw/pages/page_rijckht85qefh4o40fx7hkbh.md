# Car Insurance Requirements in Texas
While no one expects to be involved in a car accident, accidents happen. When they do, it is vital to know that your automobile insurance meets (or even exceeds) Texas’s minimum car insurance requirements.
Car insurance is protection for yourself and your family in the event of a motor vehicle accident. Basic car insurance, as mandated by Texas law, is liability coverage. Liability insurance pays for damages to the other driver’s car and medical bills incurred by the other driver and their passengers. 
Vehicle owners who owe money on their cars are required to carry collision and comprehensive coverage by their lenders.
## Liability Coverage is Required by Texas Law
According to the [Texas Department of Insurance](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html#:~:text=Texas%20law%20requires%20you%20to,about%20buying%20more%20liability%20coverage.) (TDI), vehicle owners must have at least $30,000 of coverage for injuries per person, up to a total of $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 of coverage for property damage. This is known as 30/60/25 coverage. Keep in mind, that these are minimum coverages, and these may not fully meet the medical and damage expenses in a serious accident. Vehicle owners without enough car insurance may be liable for losses not met by insurance coverage.
## Other Types of Coverage
In addition to liability coverage, Texas vehicle owners have access to the following:
  * Collision coverage. Collision coverage pays for the repair or replacement of your own car after an accident;
  * Comprehensive coverage. This is coverage for a vehicle that is stolen or damaged by something other than collision like fire, flood, or vandalism;
  * Medical payments coverage. Medical payments coverage pays for your passengers’ medical bills. It also pays for your accident-related injuries while riding in someone else’s car, walking, or biking;
  * Personal injury protection or PIP coverage. PIP coverage pays not only your medical bills and those of your passengers but also lost wages and non-medical costs. All auto policies in Texas include PIP coverage unless a policyholder opts out;
  * Uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. These coverages pay for motorists without insurance or without sufficient insurance to pay for your injuries and vehicle damage;
  * Towing and labor coverage; and
  * Rental reimbursement coverage. 


Insurance coverage generally includes the vehicle owner, their family, and those driving the car with the owner’s permission. However, this should be clarified by the insurance agent and thorough reading of the policy.
## Filing an Accident Claim
If you are injured in a Texas car accident through no fault of your own, get immediate police and medical help. This will protect your physical health and can preserve any future legal claim. State only facts about the accident. Never accept blame or admit guilt.
Record any driver, witness, and insurance policy information on your phone. Take pictures of the accident scene, injuries, and vehicle damage if you are able.
Notify your insurance company about the accident but do not make a recorded statement. Ask to make a statement at a later time. 
Speak with an experienced [San Antonio car accident attorney](https://www.aguirrelawpllc.com/san-antonio-car-accident-lawyer/). An attorney can help you prepare a written statement for any insurance company.
Continue any follow-up care with physicians and closely monitor your health for changes. Some serious accident-related injuries appear days or weeks after the accident itself. 
Your car accident attorney will file your claim and make an appropriate compensation demand based on the severity of your accident, your injuries, your prognosis for recovery, and much more.
