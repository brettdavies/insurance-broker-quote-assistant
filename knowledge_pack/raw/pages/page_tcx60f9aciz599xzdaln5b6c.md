## California car insurance requirements
The minimum limits in California increased on Jan. 1, 2025.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/minimum-requirements/#cite-1) The state’s new current minimum coverage levels are 30/60/15.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/minimum-requirements/#cite-2)
The table below reflects this change and the types and amount of coverage all drivers need to carry:
**Coverage** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **2024 Coverage Limits** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **2025 Coverage Limits** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---|---  
Bodily injury liability | $15,000 per person / $30,000 per accident | $30,000 per person / $60,000 per accident  
Property damage liability | $5,000 per accident | $15,000 per accident  
You can forgo the state’s auto insurance requirement if you make a cash deposit of $75,000 with the DMV, receive a DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance, or provide a surety bond for $75,000 from a company licensed to do business in California. But most drivers choose to purchase an auto insurance policy because it’s much cheaper than a cash deposit.
It’s easier to decide what car insurance you need when you know what the required car insurance coverage pays for.
### Bodily injury liability
[**Bodily injury liability coverage**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/bodily-injury-liability/) helps pay for injuries you cause to others behind the wheel. In California, vehicle owners must carry at least $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident in bodily injury liability coverage.
For example, if you cause an accident and the other driver accumulates $5,000 in related medical bills, your insurance policy would cover these costs. But your insurer will only pay up to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident. You can opt to carry higher limits of coverage to better protect your finances.
### Property damage liability
California law also requires drivers to carry $15,000 in property damage liability coverage. This type of insurance helps pay to repair or replace another person’s vehicle or other property if you damage it during an accident.
For instance, if you cause a fender bender that damages the other driver’s vehicle, your insurance company will help you pay to repair their vehicle. But this coverage won’t help you pay to repair or replace your vehicle.[[3]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/minimum-requirements/#cite-3)
If you want help repairing your vehicle after an at-fault accident or non-collision incident, consider a full-coverage policy. [**Full-coverage car insurance**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/full-coverage/) includes collision coverage and comprehensive coverage, which pay for damage to your vehicle after a covered incident.
## California Low Cost Auto Insurance program
California offers a more affordable option to some drivers: California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance program. To qualify, you must meet the following requirements:
  * Have a valid California driver’s license
  * Meet income eligibility guidelines
  * Own a vehicle valued at $25,000 or less
  * Meet age requirement of 18 years old (16 years old if legally emancipated)
  * Have a good driving record or be a new driver


The income eligibility requirements vary based on the size of your household. For example, drivers with two people in their household have an annual income cap of $49,300. If you qualify, the annual premium ranges from $232 to $932 per year, which includes the state’s minimum liability requirements.[[4]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/minimum-requirements/#cite-4)
You can apply for this program online at [**MyLowCostAuto.com**](http://mylowcostauto.com).
## Do you need more than state-minimum coverage in California?
Liability insurance can cover the bodily injury and property damage costs of the other driver in the event of an accident, but it doesn’t cover any of your medical expenses or vehicle repair costs. Purchasing liability-only coverage is the cheapest insurance option, but it can leave you with costly out-of-pocket expenses following an accident.
If you cause an accident and the other drivers have $20,000 in vehicle damage, your minimum liability insurance can only pay $15,000 toward their property damage. You’ll have to pay the remaining $5,000 out of pocket — on top of any of your medical bills and repair costs.
Many insurance experts recommend paying for higher liability limits and opting for full coverage. Full-coverage policies include both comprehensive and collision coverage, which protects you much more than liability-only coverage. A more robust insurance policy comes at a higher cost.
If you have ample emergency savings to cover major repairs after an accident, you might choose to skip full coverage. But if you don’t want to pay for repair costs after an accident, you should consider a full-coverage policy. If you have a loan on your car, your lender will likely require you to carry full coverage to protect its investment. It’s always a good idea to consider your coverage options beyond the state’s minimum auto insurance coverage for additional financial protection.
## Penalties for driving without proof of insurance in California
Without the minimum coverage amount of auto liability insurance, California drivers face significant penalties. Here’s a closer look at the penalties you might face for driving without proof of insurance in the Golden State:
  * **Fines:** You might face hundreds of dollars in fines if law enforcement catches you driving without automobile insurance.
  * **Impoundment:** Law enforcement might impound your vehicle until you can resolve your insurance issue.
  * **Suspended vehicle registration:** Until you provide proof of insurance, you may continue to face vehicle registration suspension, depending on the situation.[[5]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/california/minimum-requirements/#cite-5)

## California car insurance requirements FAQs
It’s important to understand [**how much car insurance you need**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/knowledge/how-much-car-insurance-do-i-need/) in California. The following information can help answer your remaining questions about minimum insurance requirements in the state.
  * ### Does California require car insurance?
Yes, in most cases. California motorists must carry a minimum amount of liability car insurance at the state’s mandated 30/60/15 limits.
Drivers can only opt out of liability insurance if they make a cash deposit of $75,000 with the DMV, get a DMV-issued certificate of self-insurance, or provide a surety bond for $75,000 from a company licensed to do business in California.
  * ### What is the new law for car insurance in California?
As of Jan. 1, 2025, California increased its minimum liability insurance requirements to $30,000 per person and $60,000 per accident in bodily liability injury coverage and $15,000 per accident in property damage liability coverage.
  * ### Do you need car insurance to register a car in California?
No, but you do need to submit insurance information within 30 days of registering the car. If you don’t do this, your registration may be suspended. Make sure you have enough liability insurance to meet state-mandated requirements and avoid suspension of your vehicle registration. California state law prohibits people from driving on public roads without liability insurance coverage.
  * ### What is the recommended auto insurance coverage in California?
Though California drivers currently only need to buy coverage with auto insurance liability limits of 30/60/15, most experts recommend that drivers increase their liability limits and buy more insurance protection. Buying a full-coverage policy can protect your car in the event of vehicle damage. These policies include liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage.

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to: 
  * Comprehensive coverage with a $1,000 deductible
  * Collision coverage with a $1,000 deductible
