## Wisconsin renters insurance coverages
Check out the four standard coverages on nearly all Wisconsin renters insurance policies:
  * **Personal property** protects your personal belongings, including furniture, clothing, and electronics whether they're inside your apartment or elsewhere
  * **Loss of use** helps cover costs associated with an increase in living expenses, up to your policy's limit, if you're unable to stay in your home while it's being repaired or rebuilt due to a covered loss
  * **Personal liability** protects you financially if you're legally responsible for another person's injuries or damage to their property
  * **Medical payments to others** pays for medical expenses due to a covered occurrence


### Additional coverages
The best renters insurance in Wisconsin is always a policy with customized coverage. Here are some extra options for when you need more protection:
  * **Add a rider:** Certain valuable items, [like jewelry](https://www.progressive.com/answers/jewelry-and-engagement-ring-insurance/), may have specific limits on your renters policy. If your item exceeds the limit, you may be able to purchase an endorsement called **[a rider](https://www.progressive.com/answers/insurance-rider/)**
  * **Personal injury coverage** : May pay for legal fees and damages if you're liable for slander or defamation.
  * **Water back-up coverage** : Water that backs up through sewers or drains or discharges from a sump pump may not be covered by a standard renters policy. Water back-up coverage may pay for the damage to your belongings and water removal costs.
