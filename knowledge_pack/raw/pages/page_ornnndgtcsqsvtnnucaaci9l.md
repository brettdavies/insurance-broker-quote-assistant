## What is a paperless and auto-billing auto insurance discount?
Most companies combine paperless and auto-billing discounts into one rate reduction for customers, making this one of the best auto insurance discounts to ask for to help lower your premiums.
> Some companies might offer these as two separate saving opportunities, but it’s rare.
Considered a policy discount, to qualify, you typically need to enroll in the paperless billing and the auto-pay programs through your insurer.
But how do you enroll in paperless and auto-billing? Most company websites feature opt-in checkpoints for both under the billing section of the customer portal. So look at your online account.
**But the process differs by provider, so ask a company representative for more details if needed.**
Besides earning a discount, why opt for paperless and auto-billing in the first place? Convenience.
All of your policy information, identification cards, and billing statements will live in a single, secure online space.
Plus, there’s no need to go through the hassle of printing out your insurance cards. Instead, you’ll have access any time through a mobile app.
**The Geico paperless billing and paperless policy, for example, is offered as a benefit to drivers with no associated rate reductions.**
Besides the paperless and auto-pay deals, another auto insurance payment discount for simpler billing is the paid-in-full discount. You earn this by paying for your entire policy upfront in one lump sum.
With billing discounts like these, some companies apply the savings automatically, but others wait until your policy is up for renewal.
_**However, you must ask for some discounts directly to earn the rate reduction.**_
So never hesitate to ask a company representative to verify what discounts you’re getting, and inform them if there are others you believe you qualify for.
## Why do companies combine paperless discounts with auto-pay discounts?
Most providers combine paperless and auto-pay discounts into one deal because nowadays, people comfortably use smartphones and prefer online communications.
Also, auto-billing systems are usually paperless, and limiting paper use is better for the environment.
Technically, a **paperless billing discount** rewards you with a rate reduction for opting to receive all communication and billing through your insurer online through a mobile app, email, or text messaging.
On the other hand, an **auto-billing discount** is earned by setting up an automatic payment at a specific time between your insurer and your bank account.
> If you pay auto insurance with a checking account each month, and the funds move from your bank to your insurer without you doing anything, you likely have auto-pay set up.
Therefore, the company saves administrative and overhead costs by not printing out and mailing you paperwork or cashing your checks.
Plus, auto-billing is essentially a promise that you’ll responsibly pay your premiums on time. So, as a result, you earn a minor rate reduction.
Still, other companies reduce your rates without advertising any auto-billing or paperless savings opportunities at all.
