**The average cost of flood insurance in Texas is $783 a year, or $65 a month.** Most people buy flood insurance from the federal government, but several private companies also offer it. 
Lenders require flood insurance for mortgages in high-risk flood zones. Since homeowners insurance does not cover floods, flood insurance is often worth getting even when it’s not required. 
##  How much is flood insurance in Texas? 
[Flood insurance costs](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/flood-insurance-cost/) an average of $783 a year for policies obtained through the government-backed National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
If you live in an area with a high risk of flooding, you usually pay more for flood insurance than those in lower-risk areas. 
The NFIP is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which also maps flood risks across the country. 
The actual price you pay for NFIP flood insurance depends on factors such as: 
  * Your home’s elevation and distance from water sources 
  * The amount of coverage you need 
  * Any steps you’ve taken to protect your home from flood damage 


Although private companies analyze similar factors to determine your rate, they can sometimes offer you a cheaper rate than FEMA. This is why it’s important to compare NFIP rates to quotes from private flood insurance companies. 
###  Texas flood insurance rates by zone 
Homeowners in Texas’ high-risk flood zones pay 52% more for NFIP flood insurance than those in moderate- and low-risk areas. 
Flood zone | Annual rate | Monthly average  
---|---|---  
High risk | $1,021 | $85  
Low and moderate risk | $671 | $56  
State average | $783 | $65  
On FEMA’s flood maps, any flood zone code that begins with the letter A or V is high risk. These include zones AE, AH and VE. 
The letters B, C and X stand for low- and moderate-risk flood zones. 
If you’re not sure of your home’s flood risk, or the flood risk of a home you want to buy, you can look it up online. Just visit the [Flood Map Service Center](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home) on FEMA’s website. 
##  Texas flood insurance rates by county 
In Texas’ largest counties, flood insurance rates range from an average of $531 a year in Hidalgo County to $992 a year in Galveston County. 
NFIP flood insurance in Harris County costs an average of $786 a year, which is nearly identical to the state average. 
County | Annual cost | Monthly average  
---|---|---  
Bell County | $758 | $63  
Bexar County | $794 | $66  
Brazoria County | $794 | $66  
Brazos County | $591 | $49  
Cameron County | $583 | $49  
Collin County | $712 | $59  
Dallas County | $720 | $60  
Denton County | $805 | $67  
El Paso County | $580 | $48  
Ellis County | $871 | $73

##  Texas flood insurance requirements 
Under federal law, lenders must make you get flood insurance for a mortgage in any high-risk area, or any zone beginning with A or V. 
The law applies to all federally regulated lending institutions, including banks, nonbanks and credit unions. 
The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) has additional flood insurance requirements for homes in high-risk flood zones. 
If the home was built or altered after Sept. 1, 2009, you need flood insurance to get TWIA windstorm insurance, regardless of your mortgage status. 
###  Why should I get flood insurance if it’s not required? 
The unpredictability of flooding and its costs make flood insurance worth considering when it’s not required for a mortgage or TWIA policy. 
FEMA estimates that 40% of NFIP flood insurance claims come from areas of low and moderate risk. The average payout for NFIP flood insurance claims between 2016 and 2022 was $66,000. 
###  Texas home insurance and flood damage coverage 
No part of Texas is safe from flooding. Here’s what you need to know to protect yourself and your home from flooding in Texas. 
  * **A standard home insurance policy usually won’t cover flood damage.** You need to buy a separate [flood insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/best-flood-insurance/) policy for that. 
  * If you have flood insurance, **contact your insurance company or agent as soon as you can** after flooding damages your home. 
  * Be patient after you file your flood claim. **It can take four to eight weeks for your insurer to finalize and pay your claim.**
  * If you don’t have flood insurance, **consider buying it even if you don’t live in a high-risk flood zone**. Most of Texas’ major cities have a high flood risk. 


##  What does NFIP flood insurance cover in Texas? 
NFIP flood insurance provides up to $250,000 in building coverage and up to $100,000 in contents coverage. 
  * Building coverage pays to repair structural damage to your home. It’s available for single-family homes, townhomes, and condo units. 
  * Contents coverage insures your belongings. If you rent, you can buy contents-only flood insurance. 
  * The deductibles for both coverages range from $1,000 to $10,000. 


If you get flood insurance to satisfy a mortgage requirement, an NFIP policy can take effect on your close date. Otherwise you have to wait 30 days for your coverage to start. 
##  How does private flood insurance work in Texas? 
Several private companies offer flood insurance in Texas as an alternative to NFIP policies. Some also sell excess flood insurance, which adds protection to an existing NFIP policy. 
NFIP policies are usually cheaper than [private flood insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/private-flood-insurance/). However, private policies usually offer more protection. 
For example, private flood insurers usually offer higher coverage limits than NFIP policies. 
Private flood insurers often cover loss of use, or temporary living expenses during flood repairs. NFIP policies do not cover loss of use. 
Private flood insurance policies usually also have shorter waiting periods than the NFIP for non-loan closings. 
###  Private flood insurance vs. NFIP coverage comparison 
Policy features | NFIP (FEMA) | ResiFlood (Wright Flood) | Beyond Floods (Allstate)  
---|---|---|---  
Building limit | $250,000 | $1 million | $1.5 million  
Contents limit | $100,000 | $250,000 | $750,000  
Loss of use | Not available | Available | Available  
Non-loan waiting period | 30 days | None | Seven days  
##  How to get flood insurance quotes in Texas 
Getting flood insurance quotes in Texas is almost as easy as shopping for [normal home insurance](https://www.lendingtree.com/home-insurance/). 
Any local insurance agency with FEMA-certified agents can send you an NFIP flood insurance quote. This includes nationally known companies such as State Farm and Progressive, as well as independent agencies serving your area. 
The better-known Texas companies to contact for private flood insurance quotes include: 
  * Allstate 
  * Geico 
  * Neptune Flood 
  * Travelers 
  * Wright Flood 


Most companies that offer private flood insurance quotes can also provide an NFIP quote. 
Your NFIP quote should be the same from any provider, regardless of whether you get it from Geico, Wright Flood or any other authorized agent. 
##  Methodology 
NFIP flood insurance rates are based on an analysis of FEMA records on flood insurance policies in force as of Jan. 31, 2024. Your rates may vary.
