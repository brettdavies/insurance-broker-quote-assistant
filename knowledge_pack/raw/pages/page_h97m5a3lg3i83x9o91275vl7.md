You have many ways to [save money on car insurance](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/car-insurance-hacks), but taking advantage of discounts is the easiest. Drivers in most U.S. states can save up to 15% after completing a state-approved defensive driving course, but qualifications and course length requirements vary by state and insurance company.
[Progressive](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/reviews/progressive) offers a defensive driver discount to eligible drivers in 34 states and Washington, D.C. We’ll explain how to get Progressive’s defensive driving insurance discount, plus other ways to save money on your car insurance.
## **What Is the Progressive Defensive Driving Discount?**
Most [car insurance companies](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies) offer a defensive driving course discount. But many — including Progressive — offer it only in states that legally require it. Some states make the [defensive driving course discount](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/defensive-driver-discount) available to drivers of all ages, while others allow it only for specific age groups.
The following drivers typically qualify:
  * [New drivers](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/cheapest-car-insurance-for-new-drivers) age 21 and younger
  * Drivers age 50 and older
  * Drivers in states mandating the discount


Most [states](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/insurance-rates-by-state) also require you to complete the course voluntarily, not because of a court order or governmental requirement.

## **How Much Can You Save With the Progressive Defensive Driving Discount?**
![Person in a plaid suit fastening a seatbelt inside a car, with a focus on the hand and seatbelt mechanism.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/74b581610d/buckling-seatbelt.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
Progressive doesn’t advertise the defensive driver discount on its website, and the discount amount varies by state and[ ](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage)coverage. But you can typically get up to 15% in 34 states and Washington, D.C., after completing a defensive driving course.
For example, [Delaware](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/delaware) and [New York](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/new-york) drivers of all ages can save 10% on:[[1]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-defensive-driver-discount#cite-1)
  * [Liability coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/liability-insurance)
  * [Personal injury protection (PIP)](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/personal-injury-protection)
  * [Medical payments coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/medical-payments-coverage)
  * [Collision coverage](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/coverage/collision-insurance)


In Delaware, the discount lasts for three years, and you can recertify within 180 days of the end of the three years to receive a 15% discount.[[2]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-defensive-driver-discount#cite-2)
Savings vary, and the discounts you already have factor into how much you can save, as several Reddit users found out.[[3]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-defensive-driver-discount#cite-3) A few pointed out that many insurers cap how much you can save with discounts. So you may not save much with the defensive driving discount if you already have multiple discounts on your car insurance policy.
### **How does Progressive’s defensive driving discount compare to competitors?**
Many other insurers offer a defensive driving course discount, including State Farm, GEICO, Allstate, and Liberty Mutual.

## **How to Get the Progressive Defensive Driving Discount**
![Smiling woman in glasses typing on a laptop at a wooden table, with a coffee mug and green plants in the background.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/295508/1200x675/5cc52e578a/woman-laptop-mug.jpg/m/1200x675/smart/filters:quality\(90\))
You must complete a qualifying defensive driving course to get a discount from Progressive. Your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) may have a list of approved courses and can provide information about whether you have to complete the course in person or if you can do it online. In-person classes can cost around $100, while online courses usually cost between $5 and $50, according to our research.
You’ll also need to check if you meet the age and other requirements. For example, [Florida](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/florida) offers this discount only for seniors 55 and older.[[4]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-defensive-driver-discount#cite-4) You also must have a clean [driving record](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/resources/rate-factors/driving-record) with no traffic violations or accidents within the last three years.
[Georgia](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/georgia) has the same driving-record requirements,[[5]](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/cheap-car-insurance/discounts/progressive-defensive-driver-discount#cite-5) and it also requires drivers 25 and older to complete a course that’s at least six hours long. Drivers younger than 25 must complete a 30-hour course and six hours of driver training.
Since you need to pay for the course and set aside the time to complete it, it’s worth checking with Progressive to see how much you can save and compare the course cost for each eligible driver.
## **Other Progressive Discounts to Consider**
