According to the Texas Department of Insurance, Texas law requires you to have a minimum of $30,000 of liability coverage per person for injuries as well as $25,000 in property damage coverage.
There are other types of insurance add-ons you can get to help supplement the cost of an accident, including:
  * Additional liability coverage
  * Collision coverage
  * Comprehensive coverage
  * Medical payments coverage (MedPay)
  * [Personal injury](https://personalpersonalinjury.com/personal-injury/) protection (PIP)
  * Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM)
  * Towing and labor coverage
  * Rental reimbursement

If you are still paying off your car, you will be required to have collision and comprehensive coverage in addition to liability coverage. Collision coverage kicks in to cover the cost of repair or replacement of your car after an accident, and comprehensive coverage pays in other instances, like if your car is stolen or damaged by something other than a collision.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I’m Joel Hudson, the founder of Carrollton Injury Law, located at 4221 Medical Pkwy, Suite 300, Carrollton, TX 75010. 
With over 25 years of experience practicing personal injury law, I’ve built my firm on a simple belief: there’s a better way to handle injury claims. It starts with treating you like a person—not a number—and continues with consistent communication throughout your entire case. You can reach us directly at (972) 360-9898 to discuss your situation—we are hear to listen.
I’ve seen how a single injury can ripple through every part of your life, affecting not just you but your family too. That’s why my approach is different. At Carrollton Injury Law, we don’t just chase settlements; we focus on you. I’ve found that giving clients the extra attention many Dallas law firms overlook leads to happier clients, smoother dealings with adjusters who appreciate the updates, and, ultimately, higher injury settlements in less time. My clients often call me the “personal” attorney because we care about maximizing your recovery while also helping you navigate the disruptions a car accident or injury brings—whether it’s medical bills, lost work, or simply getting back to normal.
I earned my Juris Doctor from Texas A&M University School of Law in 1998, after completing my Bachelor of Arts in Communications and Business at Texas Christian University in 1992. Since being admitted to practice in Texas in 1998, I’ve dedicated my career to fighting for injury victims across the state. 
At Carrollton Injury Law, we live by our motto: “We put Personal back into Personal Injury Law.” It’s not just a tagline—it’s how we work, every day, for every client.
If you’re ready to talk about your injury claim or just need some guidance, don’t hesitate to get in touch. I’m here to help you take the first step toward justice and recovery.
