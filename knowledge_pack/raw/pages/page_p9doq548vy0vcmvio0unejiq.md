For example, anyone who works for a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway qualifies for a Geico discount, as well as members of the California Association for the Education of Young Children, and members, faculty, and staff at Howard University. You can use the [Geico website](https://www.geico.com/save/discounts/organization-member/) to find out if you qualify for a discount based on your employer or other affiliation.

_“My wife was in a serious rollover crash; thankfully, she's OK. I filed the accident claim on my Geico app while in the emergency room that night, and within 30 minutes, Geico called me to follow up on it. The representative's first words were about my wife, asking how she was doing. The rest of the claim process was smooth – I had a few calls with the company that evening to iron out some details about the crash, and there was another follow-up the next day with a claims representative and then one with the adjuster. The car was declared a total loss, and the adjuster secured a rental car for us to use while we looked for a replacement one. Two and a half weeks after the accident, the claims payment check arrived at our house.”_

## Geico Car Insurance Coverage
Geico provides the major coverage types you’d expect, such as:
Liability
When you’re at fault in an accident, this covers injuries you cause to others (bodily injury liability) or damage you cause to someone else's property (property damage liability). It also covers legal fees if you’re taken to court.  

Uninsured/underinsured motorist

This covers damage caused by something other than a collision, such as theft, vandalism, fire, severe weather, falling objects, and cracked windshields.
Medical payments (MedPay)
This pays medical bills for you and your passengers regardless of fault in an accident.
