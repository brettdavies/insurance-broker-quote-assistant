## State Farm Homeowners Insurance Review
Despite low scores in our consumer survey, State Farm ranks at No. 3 overall in our [best home insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance) rating, based on its low cost, coverage options, discounts, and more.
On our [cheapest home insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheapest) list, this provider has a sample rate of $129 per month, which is second only to Amica’s $97 average premium.

## **What Does State Farm Homeowners Insurance Cover?**
State Farm offers a relatively basic home insurance policy with protections for your home and personal property, plus a type of coverage rarely included in standard homeowners insurance.
#### Dwelling Coverage
After a covered claim, this pays to repair or rebuild your home and its attached structures, such as a garage. [Dwelling insurance](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/dwelling-insurance) will cover some things inside your home, like flooring, walls, roof, and cabinetry.
#### Other Structures
This coverage protects structures on your property that are not directly attached to your house, such as a shed or detached garage.
#### Personal Property
This pays for your personal property to be repaired or replaced if damaged or stolen. [Personal property](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/what-is-personal-property-insurance) coverage includes things not attached to your property, such as furniture or clothing.
#### Personal Liability
This protects against legal liability for bodily injury or property damage if an incident occurs on your property.
#### Guest Medical Payments
Also referred to as medical payments for others, this coverage helps pay the medical bills of someone injured on your property.
#### Additional Living Expenses
Loss of use coverage helps pay additional living expenses if you can’t live in your home after a covered peril.
#### Inflation Coverage
Inflation coverage automatically adjusts your coverage annually to account for inflation. While this coverage typically costs extra with other insurers, it is standard at State Farm.
#### Other Included Coverages
Depending on your policy, your coverage may also include credit card or bank card forgery, debris removal, trees and landscaping, volcanic action, refrigerated products, locks and remote devices, power interruption, and more.
## Additional Options Offered by State Farm Homeowners Insurance
Along with the standard coverages listed above, State Farm offers some optional endorsements or separate policies to enhance your coverage.
### **Water Backup**
The Back-up of Sewer or Drain Endorsement provides some coverage against water damage when water backs up from the sewers or drains.
### **Home Systems Protection**
Appliances that have broken down or become worn out over time are usually not covered by insurance, but you may be able to get some additional protection with State Farm’s Home Systems Protection.
### **Identity Theft**
State Farm’s identity restoration coverage can be added to your homeowners policy for an annual fee of $25 to help pay for expenses related to identity fraud.
### **Personal Articles**
If you want more personal property coverage than your home insurance policy provides, consider purchasing a separate personal articles policy. It offers replacement cost coverage to protect belongings like jewelry, sports equipment, and medical devices.
### **Earthquake Coverage**
State Farm does not generally cover earthquake damage, but depending on where you live, you may have the option to add an endorsement to your policy or purchase a separate policy.
### **Flood Insurance**
Standard home insurance typically excludes coverage for flood damage, but you could be at risk of flooding even if you don’t live in a high-risk flood zone. State Farm does not offer flood insurance, but you can protect your home with a separate flood insurance policy through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance).
### **Umbrella Insurance**
For extra liability coverage beyond the limits of your homeowners policy, you can buy a separate umbrella insurance policy. It can protect you from personal claims, such as libel, that may not be covered under your home insurance.
## What Does State Farm Homeowners Insurance Not Cover?
As with most providers, State Farm’s standard home insurance does not cover losses from earthquakes or flooding. You can get a separate flood policy through the government-run NFIP and ask your agent about your coverage options for earthquakes. Water backup damage is not covered unless you specifically add an endorsement.
Exclusions may vary by policy, but you typically cannot get coverage for damage from gradual deterioration over time, infestations of pests like rodents, neglect, malicious intentions, contamination, and nuclear hazards. Business-related pursuits and vehicle liability are also generally excluded from your standard homeowners policy.
## How Much Does State Farm Homeowners Insurance Cost?
State Farm has the No. 2 most affordable home insurance premium in our study of the [cheapest homeowners insurance companies](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheapest). The sample monthly premium for its homeowners policy is $129. This rate is for a policy with a dwelling coverage limit of $300,000 and a liability coverage limit of $100,000.

## How To Buy Homeowners Insurance From State Farm
On [State Farm’s website](https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/homeowners), you can apply for a quote or search for a local agent. Getting an online quote may be faster, but we recommend speaking to an agent if you’re insuring a new property and need help determining your coverage limits.
To get a quote, you’ll provide your house address, your date of birth, and the coverage start date. State Farm will access public records to fill in information about your home, and once you confirm it, you’ll be asked for more specific information.
Be prepared to provide details such as the year your house was built, its square footage, the number of stories, other structures on the property, safety features, and the number of people living there full time. You should also be able to describe your insurance history, which includes the name of your last provider, the dates of prior coverage, and any home insurance claims you’ve made in the last five years.
Once you receive a quote, you can finalize it and buy your policy either online or through your agent. If you go through this process online, you have up to 30 days after receiving your quote to buy the policy. Inform your mortgage lender once you buy a new policy, and don’t cancel your existing one until your new insurance takes effect.
## How Do I File a Homeowners Insurance Claim With State Farm?
You can file a claim with State Farm [online](https://reportloss.claims.statefarm.com/start-claim), via the mobile app, or by calling 800-732-5246.
Before you start your claim, try to mitigate any further damage to your property, and take any notes, photos, and videos that may help State Farm process your claim. Keep any relevant documents, such as receipts for emergency repairs. Additionally, if you regularly maintain a [home inventory](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/home-inventory-how-to-create-one) that lists all your belongings, you can expedite the claims process when you experience a covered loss.
Once you file, State Farm will confirm receipt of your claim and assign you to a claim handler or team. They will reach out with questions to assess the damage and determine whether your policy will cover it.
If the claims representative concludes that you are owed a settlement, you may be able to choose from either direct deposit or a check. You can then use your settlement money to pay contractors or reimburse yourself if you’ve already done so.
## FAQ
Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover mold?
Mold is typically excluded from homeowners insurance coverage. That’s because [mold](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/when-does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold) is commonly caused by a lack of maintenance, which isn’t a covered peril. Generally, you’ll need to show that the mold is caused by a sudden incident covered in your policy, such as a burst pipe or storm damage to a roof. You can speak to a State Farm agent for more details about events where mold might be covered under your policy.
Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover water damage or roof leaks?
State Farm homeowners policies cover [water damage](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-water-damage) from perils included under your policy, such as a faulty appliance, water from fighting a fire, etc. Not all water damage is eligible to be covered, but you can purchase extra protection with an endorsement for water backup from sewers or drains and a separate flood insurance policy through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program.
Typically, homeowners policies cover [roof leaks](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-damage) caused by sudden, accidental events such as storm damage or a tree falling onto the roof. However, leaks caused by lack of maintenance or typical wear and tear aren’t covered.
Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover theft?
Your State Farm homeowners policy includes coverage for theft of your personal property. There are limits to the amount of coverage you’ll receive in a standard policy, so if you have more expensive items such as jewelry or a collection of antiques, you can also purchase a personal articles policy.
Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover tree damage?
If a tree falls due to a covered event like a storm and damages your property, your insurance usually covers it. Also, if the tree lands on a covered structure such as your house or a detached garage, tree removal is also covered. Most policies do not pay for damage to the tree itself.
Does State Farm homeowners insurance cover fire?
Homeowners policies generally cover [damage from a fire](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-fire-damage) and smoke damage, though each policy and claim will be handled differently. Depending on the extent of the damage, both dwelling protection and personal property coverage may apply.
The key exceptions are preventable fires, such as arson or failure to maintain a chimney. In these cases, your policy is unlikely to cover the damages.
How do I cancel State Farm home insurance?
You can cancel your State Farm home insurance policy by phone, mail, or in person. Cancellations by phone are effective immediately, or you can schedule it for a specific date. If you write a letter, mail it out at least 2 weeks before your intended cancellation date.
Speak to an agent for more guidance on the cancellation process.
Is State Farm a good insurance company?
Yes, State Farm is a good insurance company, ranking third in our best homeowners insurance companies rating and second in our cheapest homeowners insurance companies study. However, get a quote, review coverage options, and pricing to determine if it's a good company for your needs.
