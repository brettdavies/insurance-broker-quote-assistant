## **Progressive's accident forgiveness programs**
Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness: Small Accident Forgiveness, Large Accident Forgiveness, and Accident Forgiveness that can be purchased.
**Small Accident Forgiveness**
As a new Progressive customer in most states, you'll receive Small Accident Forgiveness automatically and for free as soon as your policy begins. This is available as part of Progressive's Loyalty Rewards program. With this benefit, your insurance rate stays the same for your first claim that's less than or equal to $500.
**Large Accident Forgiveness**
Large Accident Forgiveness is available to customers in most states as part of the Loyalty Rewards program. This benefit rewards those who have stayed with Progressive for at least five years and have remained accident and violation-free for up to five consecutive years. With Large Accident Forgiveness, your rates won't increase if you have a claim, even if the total claim exceeds $500.
**Accident Forgiveness that can be purchased**
In most states, Progressive allows customers to purchase accident forgiveness coverage when they buy or renew a policy. Accident forgiveness applies to one accident per policy, not one accident per driver. If you have an accident, any small or large accident forgiveness you’ve earned from being a loyal Progressive customer will apply first, and then you can apply the accident forgiveness benefit you purchased to a second eligible claim.

## **At-fault accidents**
In most states, when an accident occurs, one party is usually considered "at-fault" and must cover the injuries of the other driver and their passengers, typically through their liability insurance coverage. The at-fault driver's insurance company will pay for any property damage, medical bills, and, in some cases, compensation for other damages, such as pain and suffering. However, determining fault in an accident can be challenging, and claims adjusters may get involved to investigate the cause. It is important to note that even if you are found to be partially at fault, your insurance company may still be responsible for covering the damages.
Progressive offers accident forgiveness benefits, which can prevent your insurance rates from increasing after an eligible incident, regardless of fault. Progressive provides three types of accident forgiveness: Small Accident Forgiveness, Large Accident Forgiveness, and Accident Forgiveness for certain accidents. As a new Progressive customer in most states, you will automatically receive Small Accident Forgiveness as soon as your policy begins. With Small Accident Forgiveness, your insurance rate stays the same for your first claim that is less than or equal to $500. Large Accident Forgiveness is available to customers who have been with Progressive for an extended period, typically at least five years, and have remained accident-free during that time. Progressive also offers Accident Forgiveness for certain accidents, which may be included automatically or purchased as an endorsement.
It is important to note that accident forgiveness may not be available in all states, and eligibility can vary by insurer. Additionally, even with accident forgiveness, your insurance rate may still increase due to other factors such as traffic violations, address changes, or adding a new vehicle to your policy. Progressive also offers a Loyalty Rewards program, which provides additional benefits to customers who have been with the company for a longer period. The longer you are with Progressive, the better the Accident Forgiveness benefit. By reviewing your policy and comparing rates, you can work towards finding the most competitive premium possible after an at-fault accident.

## **Not-at-fault accidents**
Even if you are not at fault in an accident, your insurance rate may still increase, depending on your state and insurer. Not-at-fault accidents can indicate a higher likelihood of future accidents, and they remain on your driving record for a certain number of years, which varies by state.
If you are a Progressive customer and have been in an accident that was not your fault, Progressive will work with you to ensure that the at-fault driver or their insurance company pays for your damages. Progressive offers Accident Forgiveness benefits through its Loyalty Rewards program, which may prevent your insurance rate from increasing after an accident. The longer you are with Progressive, the better the Accident Forgiveness benefit. For example, your rate won't go up for your first small claim of $500 or less. In most states, Progressive customers automatically get Small Accident Forgiveness for free as soon as they start their policy. After being a Progressive customer for at least five years and remaining accident and violation-free for up to five consecutive years, your rate won't increase if you have a claim.
However, Progressive and other insurance companies may use tactics to reduce or deny your claim. For example, they may ask for a recorded statement, which is not actually required, and use leading questions to try to trick you into saying something that will hurt your claim. They may also ask questions designed to make you accidentally admit fault for the accident.

## **Loyalty Rewards program**
Progressive Insurance offers a Loyalty Rewards program that provides benefits such as money-saving discounts and accident forgiveness. The longer you stay with Progressive, the more benefits you can earn. Even the time you spent insured with a previous company is counted toward your Progressive loyalty level.
The Loyalty Rewards program includes Small Accident Forgiveness, which means your insurance rate stays the same for your first claim that's less than or equal to $500. This benefit is available to new Progressive customers in most states as soon as their policy begins.
The program also offers Large Accident Forgiveness. This benefit is available to customers who have been with Progressive for at least five years and have remained accident and violation-free during that time. With Large Accident Forgiveness, your rates won't increase if you have a claim, even if the total claim exceeds $500.
In addition to accident forgiveness, the Loyalty Rewards program offers other perks such as priority call routing and discounts on multiple policies. For example, if you have both auto and home insurance with Progressive, you could save an average of 7% on your auto policy. You can also combine auto insurance with other policies, such as boat, motorcycle, or RV insurance, to receive additional discounts.
After 20 years with Progressive, you'll earn a lifetime renewal guarantee, which means your policy will be renewed regardless of changes to your driving record. This extended loyalty to the company is rewarded, and your loyalty level is not reset if you move states.

## **How long accidents stay on your record**
Accidents, especially at-fault accidents, will almost always raise your insurance rates. The length of time that an accident will remain on your record varies depending on the state and the insurer. In certain states, your insurance company may not increase your premium if the damage is below a certain monetary value. Generally, accidents remain on your record for 3 to 5 years, after which your insurance company will stop charging you for the accident. However, the accident may still be visible on your record and could affect your eligibility for certain discounts.
In most states, Progressive offers accident forgiveness for your first claim that totals less than $500 as soon as you become a customer. Progressive customers automatically get Small Accident Forgiveness in most states for free as soon as they start their Progressive policy. You can also purchase Progressive Accident Forgiveness when you first buy your Progressive policy or during policy renewal. With this benefit, you may be eligible to have one accident forgiven per policy period. The longer you're with Progressive, the better the Accident Forgiveness benefit.
Additionally, Progressive offers Large Accident Forgiveness to customers who have been with the company for at least five years and have remained accident and violation-free for up to five consecutive years. With this benefit, your rates won't increase even if the total claim exceeds $500.
It's important to note that no-fault accidents can also influence your premium, although not as severely as at-fault accidents. When shopping for insurance quotes, companies will typically ask if you've had any accidents in the last five years.
