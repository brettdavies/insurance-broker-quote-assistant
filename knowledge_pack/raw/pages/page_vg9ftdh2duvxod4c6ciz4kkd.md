**Why Geico made our list:** Geico is a trusted household name and offers lower-than-average premiums in Ohio. On top of low average rates, Geico may offer one of the longest lists of potential car insurance discounts of all the major carriers in Ohio. Geico offers discounts for qualifying government employees, members of affiliated professional groups, eligible military members, good students, seniors who complete a defensive driving course and more. In the [J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Insurance Digital Experience Study](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-insurance-digital-experience-study), Geico placed above average in the shopping category, suggesting that the company offers a streamlined and efficient process for those looking to purchase their policy online.

**Who Geico may be good for:** Geico may be a good choice if budget is your primary concern and you have a few dings on your driving record. Drivers who prefer a hands-on approach to their car insurance may also enjoy Geico's robust digital tools.

**Why State Farm made our list:** State Farm is a household name, which is not surprising since it is the largest personal auto insurance company in the country. It also has local agents throughout Ohio, which may make it an excellent choice for drivers who prefer to do business in person. State Farm has above-average 2024 J.D. Power Study ratings for [claims satisfaction](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-claims-satisfaction-study), digital service and customer service in the North Central region. It generally has lower-than-average rates for those with one at-fault accident or speeding ticket, too. State Farm offers two safe-driving programs: [Steer Clear](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-steer-clear/) for teens and [Drive Safe & Save](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/state-farm-drive-safe-and-save/) for adult drivers. Both programs could help you save on your insurance while helping you or your teen driver learn safer driving habits. Its commitment to helping safe drivers get affordable rates is why State Farm won the 2025 Bankrate Award for Best auto insurance company for safe drivers.
**Who State Farm may be good for:** Because of the company's vast network of brick-and-mortar agencies, State Farm could provide some of the best auto insurance in Ohio for drivers who prefer the personal touch of a local agent. State Farm's telematics programs and typically low rates may also appeal to young drivers or those with an accident or speeding ticket on their records.

**Why Auto-Owners made our list:** Although Auto-Owners may only be available in 26 states, Ohio is one of them. We chose Auto-Owners as the best car insurance in Ohio for bundling for a few reasons. First, the company offers more than one bundling discount — one for carrying a qualifying Auto-Owners policy (such as a [homeowners policy](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/)) alongside Auto-Owners car insurance, and a bundling discount for also carrying an Auto-Owners life insurance policy. Additionally, Auto-Owners offers lower-than-average homeowners insurance premiums in Ohio, giving auto policyholders another incentive to bundle. Auto-Owners also has a fairly robust list of discounts and endorsements, making for a well-rounded regional carrier option. It won two 2025 Bankrate Awards for being the Best Budget Auto Insurance Company and the Best Auto Insurance Company for Young Drivers.
**Who Auto-Owners may be good for:** Ohio drivers who want to save money and have a young driver on their policy may want to look into getting quotes from Auto-Owners, particularly Ohio homeowners who may have policies to bundle for maximum savings.

**Why USAA made our list:** Although it is not eligible for official ranking with J.D. Power due to its membership requirements, USAA consistently receives high scores for customer satisfaction and claims service. However, the provider only sells insurance to active-duty military members, veterans and their immediate family members. This limitation is one reason it tied with Amica for Best Auto Insurance Company Overall instead of winning the category outright. USAA is known to offer lower-than-average premiums and a host of potential discounts to help you save even more, including savings for loyalty and deployment.
**Who USAA may be good for:** Eligible drivers who value customer service over optional car insurance endorsements and need cheap Ohio auto insurance may want to request a quote from USAA.

How Bankrate chose the best car insurance companies in Ohio
To find the [best auto insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) in Ohio, we reviewed various metrics to help us rank each company. First, we used proprietary rate data provided by Quadrant Information Services to find the providers that offer the lowest average rates. We understand that the company that provides the cheapest rates may not be the best company for all drivers, so we then reviewed other factors such as third-party scores, coverage offerings, mobile accessibility, financial strength and discount opportunities.
Using this information, we could paint a complete picture of dozens of Ohio auto insurance companies, issuing each a Bankrate Score ranging from 0.0 to 5.0, with 5.0 being the best score possible. Our goal is to give drivers an in-house scoring model that they may use to feel empowered during their shopping journey.
  * ####  Bankrate Score methodology
Caret Down Icon
Our 2024 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impacts policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. Each factor was added to a category, and these categories were weighted in a tiered approach to analyze how companies perform in key customer-impacting categories. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
    * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings): **To determine how well auto and home insurance companies satisfy these priorities, average quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [NAIC](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/), were analyzed.
    * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated each company’s discount options listed on its website.
    * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto and home insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.

## How to find the best car insurance in Ohio
When choosing car insurance companies, Ohio drivers may consider a variety of factors to determine which provider offers them the most fitting coverage for their situation. Factors may include anything from low cost to outstanding customer service, but taking steps to consider the following points may help narrow down your options.
  * Number 1 Icon
###  Consider minimum insurance requirements in Ohio
Caret Down Icon
Like most states, [Ohio mandates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/ohio-car-insurance-laws/) specific limits that each driver must carry as a minimum requirement to drive legally. Because Ohio is an at-fault state, minimum coverage requirements include bodily injury liability and property damage liability, with exact amounts noted on the state’s [motor vehicle website](https://www.bmv.ohio.gov/dl-mandatory-insurance.aspx). Although there are other ways to satisfy Ohio’s financial responsibility law, like posting a bond or qualifying as a self-insurer, most insurance professionals recommend purchasing enough coverage to avoid financial devastation in case of an accident.
Although buying minimum coverage might mean you pay a lower premium, the limits may not be enough to protect your finances if you cause an accident. If the injuries and damage that you cause exceed your insurance limits, you will have to pay extra costs out of pocket.
  * Number 2 Icon
###  Consider lender requirements
Caret Down Icon
More than [80 percent of new vehicle purchases](https://www.statista.com/statistics/453000/share-of-new-vehicles-with-financing-usa/) in the U.S. were financed in 2024. Because a financial institution has a stake in the vehicle, drivers are typically required to purchase full coverage insurance in these situations. As minimum coverage limits do not provide any physical damage coverage for your vehicle, collision and comprehensive coverage come in handy when facing repair or replacement costs. Drivers of newer model cars in Ohio may also want to consider purchasing [gap insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/gap-insurance/), which helps pay the difference between your insurance claim check and the outstanding loan amount should your vehicle be totaled or stolen and unrecoverable.
Drivers [leasing their vehicles](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/lease-car-insurance/) usually have additional insurance requirements regarding [liability coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/liability-car-insurance/). In most cases, leasing companies require you to carry at least $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident in bodily injury, and $50,000 per accident in property damage coverage. You may see this denoted as 100/300/50 on your policy documentation.
  * Number 3 Icon
###  Consider your individual needs
Caret Down Icon
Many personal factors, like driver risk, may influence the cost of insurance. Insurance companies typically use driving records to gauge how likely a policyholder is to file future claims, so they often charge higher rates for drivers with prior traffic violations. Having a [speeding ticket](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/speeding-tickets/) on your motor vehicle record, for example, could demonstrate [high-risk driving behavior](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/), potentially increasing average annual premiums by hundreds of dollars.

## How much is car insurance in Ohio?
In the Buckeye State, Bankrate found that drivers pay an [average annual cost](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-ohio/) of $498 for minimum coverage and $1,842 for full coverage car insurance, based on 2024 quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services. Ohio’s average rates are significantly less than the average cost of car insurance in the U.S., which is $806 per year for minimum coverage and $2,671 per year for full coverage.
Ohio’s rates aren’t only cheaper than the national average — they’re cheaper compared to neighboring states, too. For instance, the average annual premium for a full coverage policy in [Michigan](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-michigan/) is $3,207, with minimum coverage averaging $897. Average premiums are also higher in [Pennsylvania](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-pennsylvania/), where an annual policy may set you back $2,397 for full coverage or $521 for minimum.
The cost of car insurance in Ohio may be cheaper than other states for several reasons. Auto insurance rates are calculated based on various factors, including the incidence and average cost of accidents in a given area. Because much of Ohio is rural or suburban, roads may not be as busy, leading to fewer accidents than in metropolitan areas, which tend to have higher premiums. Additionally, Michigan and Pennsylvania have different minimum insurance requirements than Ohio (and both are [no-fault states](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/no-fault-coverage/)) which could also account for higher premiums.
However, each driver’s premiums are unique and may also factor in details specific to them such as their vehicle type, vehicle age and annual mileage. Carriers also consider whether drivers have been involved in at-fault accidents or have received moving violation convictions when determining rates.

Caret Down Icon
No single company always has the cheapest insurance all the time. Having said that, there are a handful of companies with a reputation for [writing cheap policies](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/cheapest-car-insurance-in-ohio/) in the Buckeye State. Finding the one that's best for your needs can be simple if you first consider what matters most to you. For example, if you have a teen driver in your family, you may want to look at companies that offer affordable rates and [multiple discounts for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-discounts/). Or perhaps you have a military connection, and are better served by a company that offers the best insurance for veterans and military men and women. If you have a few marks on your license, a company that specializes in high-risk insurance may offer you the best rate. Thinking about your priorities and then asking for quotes from several likely companies can lead you to the most affordable coverage for your situation.
  * ###  Do I have to have car insurance in Ohio?
Caret Down Icon
Yes, like most states, Ohio has certain minimum requirements for car insurance, and you must meet these in order to drive legally in the state. Although some drivers may take the option of posting a bond or qualifying as a self-insurer, most will fulfill the requirement by purchasing an insurance policy. If you are found to be [driving without insurance in Ohio](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/driving-without-insurance/), you could face multiple penalties. These may include loss of your license and registration as well as fines and the requirement to file [an SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22/) in order to get back on the road.
  * ###  Why is car insurance cheap in Ohio?
Caret Down Icon
There are a few factors that could contribute to Ohio's below-average car insurance rates. For one, a lot of the Buckeye State is suburban or rural. Roads outside of urban areas tend to be less busy, meaning that there are usually fewer accidents, which may translate to lower premiums. While Ohio does experience some severe winter weather, it doesn't have the same tornado risk as some other Midwestern states, and it doesn't experience hurricanes like states on the East Coast. Lastly, Ohio's [minimum car insurance requirements](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/minimum-coverage-requirements/) are fairly basic, so minimum coverage is typically not as high as in other states where liability requirements are high or personal injury protection coverage is required.
  * ######  How do I compare car insurance quotes in Ohio?
Caret Down Icon
Most insurance companies offer online [car insurance quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/), but for carriers that do not (or if you prefer a more personalized approach), you can also get quotes over the phone with a company agent or in person if the carrier has local offices in your area. If you want to quickly compare rates across multiple companies, you may find online quote comparison tools useful, or you could choose to work with an [independent insurance broker](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/independent-insurance-agents/). Brokers collect quotes from multiple companies on your behalf for you to compare coverage options, pricing and discounts.

Quoted rates for our base profile are based on the following characteristics and full coverage limits with bundling and paperless billing discounts applied:

To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.
If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts.
