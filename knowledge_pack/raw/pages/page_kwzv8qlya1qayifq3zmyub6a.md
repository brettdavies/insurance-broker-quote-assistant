At Insurify, our goal is to help customers compare insurance products and find the best policy for them. We strive to provide open, honest, and unbiased information about the insurance products and services we review. Our hard-working team of data analysts, insurance experts, insurance agents, editors and writers, has put in thousands of hours of research to create the content found on our site.
We do receive compensation when a sale or referral occurs from many of the insurance providers and marketing partners on our site. That may impact which products we display and where they appear on our site. But it does not influence our meticulously researched editorial content, what we write about, or any reviews or recommendations we may make. We do not guarantee favorable reviews or any coverage at all in exchange for compensation.
**Why you can trust Insurify:** Comparing accurate insurance quotes should never put you at risk of spam. We earn an agent commission only if you buy a policy based on our quotes. Our [editorial team](https://insurify.com/authors/) follows a [rigorous set of editorial standards](https://insurify.com/company/editorial-guidelines/) and operates independently from our insurance partners.

  * [FAQs](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#faq)


As you begin your search for a new insurer, you’ll come across several companies worth considering, including GEICO and Esurance.
GEICO is one of the largest companies in the industry.[[1]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#cite-1) Esurance, which Allstate bought in 2011, no longer writes insurance policies. Instead, Allstate writes any policies you can purchase under the Esurance brand.
Both companies offer advantages and disadvantages. For example, GEICO tends to offer lower average rates than Esurance. But GEICO earned a customer satisfaction rating below the industry average — and below Allstate’s — in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study.[[2]](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/companies/compare/esurance-vs-geico/#cite-2)
If you’ve narrowed down your choices to these two companies, it’s critical to look at the details carefully. [**Comparing rates**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/), customer service, coverage options, and discounts can help you find the best option for your situation.
Quick Facts
  * On average, GEICO offers lower liability-only quotes.
  * GEICO offers policies in all 50 states. Esurance offers policies in 43 states.
  * GEICO offers more insurance options than Esurance, including boat insurance and pet insurance.

  * **How Insurify rates insurance companies**![expand/collapse](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)
Our editorial team spent more than 350 hours developing the [Insurify Quality (IQ) Score](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/ratings/) and scoring insurance companies. The IQ Score objectively analyzes and calculates a score for insurers using more than 15 crucial criteria. The team weighted criteria by importance to the consumer — factors such as customer reviews and affordability influence the score more than availability and third-party ratings.
We rate each company on a 1 to 10 scale based on five categories: financial ratings, customer satisfaction, affordability, customer support and transparency, and availability. Insurify updates ratings once a year or as more recent information becomes available.
    * **Third-party financial ratings:** Insurify uses data from AM Best, S&P, Moody’s, and more to compare insurance companies’ credit and ability to pay out future claims.
    * **Customer satisfaction:** To calculate this score, Insurify analyzed more than 55,000 customer reviews across 155 car insurance companies. We also consider third-party ratings from J.D. Power, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and Trustpilot.
    * **Affordability:** Our data scientists analyzed more than 90 million real-time auto insurance rates from our partners across the U.S., as well as available discounts, to calculate an affordability score.
    * **Customer support and transparency:** This measures coverage options, ease of claims filing, and the insurer's transparency surrounding discounts, coverages, and claims process.
    * **Availability and reach:** Insurify scores availability and reach by identifying the number of states in which insurers offer coverage and company size by market share.


## Esurance
Esurance, which is owned by Allstate, has a reputation for a seamless online car insurance experience. While Allstate tends to offer higher rates than GEICO, Allstate boasts an above-average claims satisfaction rating.

Reviewed in Alabama on November 2025
I found out from a previous employee about their directive that they are not supposed to cover roof damage. Unfortunately, it was after my roof was damaged. They said it was not wind damage even though two trees were blown down and my son's trampoline was blown over 30 feet.

Why we picked this company
GEICO, a subsidiary of the Berkshire Hathaway Group, is the third-largest U.S. insurer by market share.

The insurer offers numerous car insurance discounts to help drivers save. For example, drivers who are accident-free for five years could earn 22% off premiums, and good students could earn 15% off. GEICO’s National Association of Insurance Commissioners complaint index score is below average, meaning it receives fewer consumer complaints than average.
Pros
  * Good rates for good drivers, seniors, and young drivers
  * Accident forgiveness available
  * A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from AM Best


Cons
  * High rates for drivers with certain violations, like DUIs

Insurify data scientists analyzed more than 90 million quotes served to car insurance applicants in Insurify’s proprietary database to calculate the premium averages displayed on this page. These premiums are real quotes that come directly from Insurify’s 500+ partner insurance companies in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Quote averages represent the median price for a quote across the given coverage level, driver subset, and geographic area. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for drivers between 20 and 70 years old with a clean driving record and average or better credit (a credit score of 600 or higher).
Liability-only premium averages correspond to policies with the following coverage limits:
  * Bodily injury limits between state-minimum rates and $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident
  * Property damage limits between $10,000 and $50,000
  * No additional coverage

Full-coverage premium averages correspond to the same bodily injury and property damage limits in addition to:
