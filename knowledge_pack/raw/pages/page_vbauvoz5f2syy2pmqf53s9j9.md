Compare Rates[Start Now →](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/best-auto-insurance-companies-in-texas/#mdatop)
Accident frequency and claims volume vary widely across Texas cities, playing a major role in how insurance is priced by ZIP code. Urban hotspots drive up insurance costs due to dense traffic, higher claim rates, and increased vehicle damage risk. Insurers rely heavily on localized data when setting rates, so where you live and drive in Texas truly matters.
**Texas Auto Accidents & Insurance Claims per Year by City**
City | Accidents per Year | Claims per Year  
---|---|---  
Arlington | 20,000 | 17,000  
Austin | 35,000 | 30,000  
Corpus Christi | 14,000 | 12,000

#### Texas drivers can get the lowest rates by keeping a clean record, avoiding violations, and comparing quotes from multiple providers every 6 to 12 months.
Brad Larson  **Licensed Insurance Agent**
Average highway speeds are also faster in the Lone Star State, which is why collision insurance rates in Texas are higher than in other states. These patterns show why Texas drivers should consider [comprehensive and collision auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/collision-vs-comprehensive-auto-insurance/) coverage, even if it’s not required.
## Texas Auto Insurance Coverage Requirements
Texas auto insurance coverage requirements mandate that all drivers carry at least 30/60/25 [liability auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/liability-auto-insurance/) coverage. This means $30,000 in bodily injury liability per person, $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 in property damage liability.
![Property Damage vs. Bodily Injury Liability Definition Card: Best Auto Insurance Companies in Texas](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20844'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
These minimums help cover costs if you’re at fault in an accident, but they may not fully protect you in serious collisions or multi-vehicle incidents. Texas drivers should review their policy limits carefully, as rising repair and medical costs can quickly exceed the state’s minimum requirements.
### More Auto Insurance Coverage Options in Texas
While Texas only requires liability insurance, many drivers add extra coverage to protect their finances, vehicles, and health, especially given Texas’s accident rates, severe weather, and heavy traffic. Here are the most common auto insurance coverage options available in Texas:
  * **Collision Coverage:** [Collision auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/collision-auto-insurance/) pays to repair or replace your vehicle if it’s damaged in a crash, regardless of who’s at fault.
  * **Comprehensive Coverage:** [Comprehensive auto insurance](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/comprehensive-auto-insurance/) covers non-collision damage such as theft, hail, flooding, or falling objects, especially useful during Texas storm season.
  * **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage:** Helps cover your costs if you’re hit by a driver in Texas who doesn’t have enough or any insurance.
  * **[Personal Injury Protection](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/personal-injury-protection/ "Personal Injury Protection") (PIP):** Covers medical expenses and lost income for you and your passengers, regardless of fault.
  * **[Medical Payments Coverage](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/medical-payments-coverage-medpay/ "Medical Payments Coverage") (MedPay):** An optional alternative to PIP that helps pay medical costs after an accident in Texas.


These additional coverage options give Texas drivers more complete protection on and off the road. With unpredictable weather, busy highways, and rising repair costs, expanding your coverage beyond the minimum can be a smart investment.
## Top Auto Insurance Discounts in Texas
Texas drivers can save significantly by taking advantage of auto insurance discounts offered by top providers. [Nationwide](https://www.quote.com/companies/nationwide-insurance-review/ "Nationwide") stands out with the highest good driver discount at 40%, making it ideal for Texans with clean records.
