The cost of your [car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/) policy's premium is determined by many factors. When providing the average car insurance cost, it's helpful to point out some of the specific aspects that may impact your premiums. Your location, driving history, credit score, age, gender, and many other factors all go into [calculating car insurance rates](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-calculator/). When asking, "How much does car insurance cost?" you'll need to consider all these different qualifiers. You could own and drive the exact same vehicle in two different states and pay two completely different car insurance premiums. 
Understanding how these factors impact the cost of car insurance can help you better understand your coverage and its rates. So, how much is car insurance per month? Trusted Choice compared quotes from multiple car insurance carriers across the nation, and we found that the overall average cost of car insurance for 2025 is $2,678 for full coverage or $799 annually for minimum, liability-only coverage. This breaks down to a range of about $67 to $223 per month.
An [independent insurance agent](https://www.trustedchoice.com/find-an-agent/?category=PERSONAL&businessLines=AUTO) can also help you find the most affordable car insurance near you. They'll get you set up with a policy that does everything you need it to do. But first, here's a breakdown of the average cost you can expect to pay for car insurance in 2025.
## What Factors Impact How Much Car Insurance Costs?
The average car insurance payment you might expect to pay will be based on your age, where you live, your driving history, the kind of car you drive, the number of cars and drivers in your household, and more. Overall, many different things factor into your car insurance premiums. Here, we break down a handful of them so you can better understand the cost of your policy.
### Age
A driver's age has a huge impact on their car insurance rates. When drivers first get their licenses, traditionally, they're in their teens. Young drivers have some of the highest car insurance rates by far due to their increased risk factors, such as lack of driving experience, a higher tendency toward speeding, and an overall higher tendency toward potentially dangerous driving maneuvers and distracted driving, such as while texting.
Car insurance rates tend to [decrease as driver age increases](https://www.trustedchoice.com/insurance-articles/wheels-wings-motors/what-age-does-car-insurance-go-down/), at least for quite a while. However, once a driver reaches a certain level of seniority, often around age 70, rates can start to increase again. This can be due to risk factors such as declining eyesight and decreased reaction time, which can create a greater likelihood of accidents.
### Location
The state in which the vehicle is registered and driven affects the costs of car insurance premiums. Heavily populated and trafficked areas, such as major cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, and others, often have higher-than-average car insurance rates due to increased risk factors like vandalism, car theft, and accidents due to the volume of traffic. 
Car values can be higher in certain areas, too, such as where the overall cost of living is higher, meaning car insurance rates are more expensive as well. You might also have higher car insurance rates in areas where your vehicle is at a greater risk of damage by natural disasters, such as in locations along the coast, particularly if you have comprehensive coverage.
### Vehicle Age
The age of your vehicle also impacts your car insurance rates. Newer vehicles are often more expensive to insure than older ones, partially due to their higher actual cash value, which would mean they cost more to replace after an accident, theft, or other total loss. New cars are also at an increased risk of being stolen compared to older vehicles. 
### Not-At-Fault Accidents
The ways in which a not-at-fault accident on your record can impact your car insurance rates vary by state. Many states don't hike your car insurance premiums if you're involved in an accident for which you weren't at fault. 
However, other states still raise your car insurance premiums, or at least certain carriers do. Single-car accidents, in which no other vehicles or drivers were involved, may also be considered your fault by many insurance companies, so your rates may likely increase after an incident that falls in this category.
### At-Fault Accidents
Most often, you can expect your car insurance rates to increase after even one at-fault accident on your record. However, the good news is that these insurance rate increases usually aren't permanent, and your insurance carrier is likely to stop charging you extra for the incident after a few years have passed. 
It's also necessary to keep in mind that certain car insurance companies offer accident forgiveness up to certain claim amounts. So, for drivers with this type of coverage, their car insurance rates won't increase after an accident claim that falls within the coverage limit.
### Car Insurance Coverage Selection
The type and amount of coverage you buy influence your premium. Buying a liability-only policy costs quite a bit less than a "full coverage" policy or one that has protection for not just liability but also damage from collisions, medical treatment for your personal injuries, etc. 
But while a liability-only car insurance policy that meets your state's minimum coverage requirements is always the least expensive option, you'll still want to review all the different [types of car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-types/) available so you can build a policy that works best for you. Though adding more coverage to your policy may initially seem more expensive, having the additional coverage can really pay off in case you have to file a claim later.
### Vehicle Type
The type of vehicle you drive, including its make and model, affects your car insurance rates as well. The more valuable a vehicle is, the more expensive it may be to insure. 
Safer vehicles are often less expensive to insure since the risk of major damage and injuries from accidents is also lower. Your specific vehicle's theft rate also impacts your car insurance premiums, as vehicles that are proven to be frequent targets for thieves are considered more of a risk to insure.
### Annual Mileage
Many car insurance companies offer lower rates for drivers who use their vehicles less than a specified number of miles per year. How often you use your vehicle impacts your car insurance rates because, generally speaking, the more often you're on the road, the more you're at risk of accidents and other incidents. If you only use your vehicle to go to work or run errands, you might pay less for car insurance than if you frequently take long road trips or use your vehicle for other purposes. 
### How Experience and Driving Record Impact Car Insurance Cost
When estimating your [car insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/) premiums, an insurance provider will look into your history as a motorist. If you have a history of traffic accidents and citations, your rate will likely be higher. Insurance companies view drivers with more traffic violations as statistically more likely to be in an accident.
Maintaining a violation-free driving record can dramatically enhance your driver profile and result in lower auto insurance premiums. The time frame to remain free of violations varies by insurance company but is typically three to five years.

## Minimum Auto Liability Insurance by State
If you've just started investigating car insurance rates, you may be wondering if the minimum liability required in your state is enough coverage for you. The answer is typically no because the state minimum liability is often not enough to fully cover losses and even potential liability claims.
Your next question may be, “What happens if my insurance is not enough to cover a loss?” In such a case, you'd be responsible for covering the remainder of the cost out of your own pocket.
The minimum coverage car insurance requirements by state are provided below. The first number indicates bodily injury liability per person, the second is the bodily injury liability limit per accident, and the third number is the total coverage amount for property damage in thousands.

Let’s look at Indiana as an example. If you're at fault for an accident in Indiana that totals a car and sends three people to the hospital, your available insurance will cover the first two people who file a claim, up to a total of $50,000 in medical payments and liability costs, and up to $25,000 in property damage costs.
Those totals will very likely fall short of the medical payments, legal defense fees, and property damage costs associated with the accident.
## Five Most Expensive States for Car Insurance
In some states, car insurance is more expensive due to higher car theft rates, car values, and a greater risk of natural disasters, among other factors. Trusted Choice compared quotes from multiple insurance carriers in each state to determine the average auto insurance cost per month nationwide. 
So, how much does car insurance cost per month in the most expensive states in the U.S.? Here are the five most expensive states for car insurance and their average rates for 2025.
  1. **Florida:** $4,210 per year 
  2. **New York:** $4,093 per year
  3. **Louisiana:** $3,998 per year
  4. **Nevada:** $3,660 per year 
  5. **Colorado:** $3,212


## Five Cheapest States for Car Insurance

  1. **Idaho:** $1,473 per year 
  2. **Vermont:** $1,506 per year

## How Uninsured and Underinsured Drivers Impact Car Insurance Prices
Motorists with little or no auto insurance are a leading cause of increased premiums. Although minimum liability insurance is required in each state, some drivers buy the insurance only to meet the requirement and then cancel or default on the policy. Areas that have a higher rate of uninsured and underinsured drivers typically have higher rates for car insurance.
In a car accident, the driver responsible must pay for the damage. For example, if a driver rear-ends you at an intersection, that driver must cover the costs of damage and any injuries. If the driver has liability insurance, the driver’s insurance company pays for the damage.
If the driver responsible for causing the accident does not have car insurance, or the accident was a hit and run, your insurance company would pay for your medical treatment and the repairs to your vehicle based on how much [uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-types/uninsured-motorist-coverage/) you carry and your policy's limits. Since your insurance company is more likely to pay unnecessary costs in areas where motorists tend to go uninsured, the monthly auto insurance premium in these areas is typically higher.

## Why Are Car Insurance Rates Higher for Younger Drivers?
Age equals experience in the eyes of insurers. Younger motorists are considered a high-risk demographic. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), drivers between the ages of 16 and 19 are almost three times more likely to crash than those aged 20 and older. Sadly, fatal accidents account for nearly one-half of all teenage deaths.
While these statistics can dramatically affect how insurance companies determine rates by the age of the driver, there are a number of measures [teen drivers](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-types/teen-young-driver/) can take to reduce their cost of car insurance.
### Car Insurance Cost Reduction Tips for Teens
There are a few ways teen drivers can reduce the cost of their car insurance premiums, including:
  * Getting their license as early as possible, even if they won’t be driving yet
  * Maintaining an excellent driving record
  * Maintaining [good grades in school](https://www.trustedchoice.com/car-insurance/auto-coverage-discounts/good-student-discounts/)


For teens, the more time that passes from the day your license was issued, the better for your monthly auto insurance costs. Even if you don't plan to drive alone until you're out of the high-risk category, it's a good idea to get your license as soon as you can to get distance from that “just licensed” period.

"Full coverage," on the other hand, refers to an auto insurance policy that includes all of your state's minimum mandated coverages and extras, typically including collision coverage, comprehensive coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, personal injury protection, and more.
