**Our Take**
State Farm stands out for financial strength and customer satisfaction, with top ratings from both AM Best and J.D. Power. In our review of 45 top insurers, State Farm wins a spot on our list of the best term life insurance companies for financial stability. The company offers convertible term coverage and a return-of-premium option. However, State Farm sells fewer policy types and riders than some competitors, requires you to shop through one of its agents, and only offers low face amounts without a medical exam.

##  Pros Explained 
  * **Highest financial strength rating:** State Farm received the highest possible financial strength grade from [AM Best](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-m-best.asp), which indicates a superior ability to pay claims. 
  * **Highest J.D. Power score:** State Farm was the highest-scoring company in the [J.D. Power](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-j-d-power-5025160) 2023 U.S. Life Insurance Study.2
  * **Renewable and convertible term coverage:** State Farm offers term life insurance policies that are renewable up to age 95 and convertible to a permanent policy without a medical exam.
  * **Return-of-premium term policy option:** State Farm offers a return-of-premium term policy, an rarity among life insurers. The policy costs more, but the company will refund your paid premiums if you outlive the term. 
  * **Bundling discount for auto policyholders:** If you bundle your [car insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/beginner-guide-auto-insurance.asp) and life insurance with State Farm, you’ll get a discount. 


##  Cons Explained 
  * **Low limit for no-medical-exam coverage:** State Farm only offers up to $50,000 in no-exam term coverage and up to $15,000 in final expense coverage. Other insurers offer much higher face amounts with no medical exam through [accelerated underwriting](https://www.investopedia.com/insurance/accelerated-underwriting-easy-life-insurance/). 
  * **Applications for most policies require agent help:** You can’t apply online for most policy types without speaking with a State Farm agent. 
  * **No living benefits riders for most policies:** Though State Farm offers a universal life insurance policy rider that provides limited access to the death benefit in the event of chronic illness, most policies aren’t eligible for [accelerated benefits](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/013114/closer-look-accelerated-benefit-riders.asp). Some other life insurers include such riders with most policies for no charge. 
  * **Higher-than-average pricing for term coverage:** State Farm’s pricing for term policies is less expensive than some competitors, but the company charges higher premiums than the industry average, according to our analysis. 
  * **No online claims:** Your beneficiaries will need to contact your State Farm agent to start a life insurance claim. 


##  Financial Stability 
State Farm has an A++ financial strength grade from AM Best, an independent credit rating agency that evaluates insurance companies. This is the highest possible AM Best rating, indicating that State Farm has a superior ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders.3 Choosing a financially strong company when buying life insurance is important to ensure the company can pay your beneficiaries years or even decades down the line. Several other life insurance companies hold the same financial strength rating, including Thrivent and MassMutual. 
##  Customer Complaints and Satisfaction 
State Farm is highly rated for customer satisfaction. The company earned first place in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Life Insurance Study, which measures customer satisfaction in five areas: Communication, interaction, price, product offerings, and statements.2
State Farm also has a low complaint index from the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp). The NAIC calculates a complaint index for every life insurance company by dividing the insurer’s share of total consumer complaints to state insurance departments by its market share of premiums. The national index of 1.00 is a benchmark, with a lower index indicating relatively few customer complaints.4 State Farm has a three-year average complaint index of 0.356, which is much better than expected for a company of its size. 
##  Types of Life Insurance Offered by State Farm 
###  Term Life Insurance 
[Term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) is temporary coverage that pays a [death benefit](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082114/6-ways-capture-cash-value-life-insurance.asp) to your beneficiaries if you die during the specified term, which is usually between one and 30 years. It’s more affordable than [permanent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanentlife.asp) life insurance. State Farm offers three term policy options. 
  * **Select Term Life Insurance:** Available in terms of 10, 20, and 30 years with a maximum issue age of 75 for 10-year terms, this policy is renewable at increasing rates until age 95 and convertible to a permanent policy with options varying by state. The policy comes with a few [rider](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/life_insurance_rider.asp) options. Face amounts start at $100,000 with no disclosed maximum. 
  * **Return-of-Premium Term Life Insurance:** Available in 20- or 30-year terms with face amounts starting at $100,000, this policy is more expensive but allows you to receive a refund on premiums paid if you outlive the term. The policy also builds cash value, which you can access through policy loans during the term. The maximum issue age is 60, but your health and age determine the maximum term. It’s renewable to age 95 and convertible to age 75.
  * **Instant Answer Term:** This no-medical-exam term policy offers instant approval when you apply with an agent. Applicants can buy up to $50,000 in coverage that lasts up to age 50 or a maximum of 10 years, whichever is longer. 


###  Whole Life Insurance 
[Whole life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp) is permanent coverage, offering a guaranteed death benefit no matter when the insured passes away. Whole life insurance features level premiums and a [cash value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-value-life-insurance.asp) component that accumulates in a savings account, which the insured can access through [policy loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/policyloan.asp). State Farm offers the following whole life insurance policies, which may pay annual [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011816/guide-dividendpaying-whole-life-insurance.asp). 
  * **Whole Life:** This basic policy comes in face amounts of $100,000 or more and features level premiums for life. 
  * **Limited Pay Whole Life:** With this policy, you can pay premiums for 10, 15, or 20 years for $100,000 or more in coverage that lasts a lifetime. You can buy the policy for a child, and it comes with a few optional riders, including a guaranteed insurability option.
  * **Single Premium Whole Life:** Available for issue ages 0 to 80 in amounts starting at $15,000, this policy is fully paid with a single premium. 
  * **Guaranteed Issue Final Expense:** This policy is designed to cover final expenses for older people. Instant approval is guaranteed without health questions or a medical exam. The policy is available in face amounts between $10,000 and $15,000 with a graded (reduced) death benefit for the first two policy years. 
  * **$10,000 Whole Life in NY:** This policy is only available to New Yorkers aged 50 to 75 and requires premium payments until age 100. It offers $10,000 in final expense coverage. 


###  Universal Life Insurance 
[Universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/universallife.asp) offers flexible permanent coverage, allowing you to adjust your premiums and death benefit as your situation changes. The cash value component typically earns a money market interest rate. You must ensure you meet the minimum funding requirements, or the policy could lapse if you deplete the cash value. State Farm offers a few universal life insurance policies, each with a few optional riders. 
  * **Universal Life Insurance:** This policy is available to issue ages 0 to 85 in face amounts starting at $25,000 or $50,000, depending on the applicant’s age. You can opt for a [level death benefit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/level-death-benefit.asp) or one that varies according to your policy account value. 
  * **Survivorship Universal Life Insurance:** This [second-to-die](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondtodieinsurance.asp) policy is available to applicants ages 18 to 90 (18 to 78 in California) in face amounts starting at $250,000. It insures two people and only pays a death benefit after both have died, making it more affordable than two individual policies. 
  * **Joint Universal Life:** This first-to-die policy comes in face amounts starting at $100,000 and is available to applicants aged 18 to 85. It covers two people, typically couples or business partners, and pays a death benefit after the first insured dies. The surviving person can purchase a new permanent policy without evidence of insurability if they’re under 75. 


##  Does State Farm Require a Life Insurance Medical Exam? 
Most State Farm life insurance policies require a medical exam, but the following policies don’t require a physical exam or lab tests. 
  * **Instant Answer Term:** This policy requires applicants to complete a health questionnaire, so it’s possible to be denied, but there’s no medical exam requirement. It offers up to $50,000 in term coverage for applicants up to age 50. 
  * **Guaranteed Issue Final Expense:** This policy doesn’t require a medical exam or health questions, and you can’t be denied coverage. However, it’s only available in amounts up to $15,000 and it won’t pay out the full death benefit if you die of natural causes during the first two policy years. 


Other insurers offer [no-medical-exam coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance-8773567) with higher coverage amounts. 
##  Available Riders from State Farm 
Life insurance riders are optional add-ons to a policy that allow you to customize your benefits for an additional premium. State Farm offers several attractive riders, but options are limited compared to other life insurance companies. Not all riders are available with every policy or in every state. Options include: 
  * **Children’s term rider:** This offers up to $20,000 in temporary coverage for your existing and future eligible children. The policy can be converted to a permanent policy at up to five times the face amount when the child turns 25. It’s available with Select Term, Return of Premium Term, Whole Life, and Universal Life policies. 
  * **Select term rider:** This provides 10 to 30 years of term coverage for an additional adult that is convertible to permanent coverage. It’s available with Select Term and Whole Life policies. 
  * **Waiver of premium for disability:** This rider allows you to stop paying premiums if you become totally disabled while keeping the policy in force. It’s available with most fully underwritten policies, but the details vary depending on the type of policy you buy. 
  * **Guaranteed insurability option:** This rider lets you purchase more life insurance coverage at standard rates without a medical exam. You can exercise the option at specific ages or milestones, depending on the policy type. It’s available with most fully underwritten whole and universal life insurance policies that include a waiver of premium rider. 
  * **Flexible care benefits:** Available only with State Farm’s basic universal life insurance policy, this rider gives the insured access to monthly payments equal to 2% of the death benefit up to age 75 should they become chronically ill and require qualified long-term care services. 
  * **Estate preservation rider:** Available with a survivorship universal life insurance policy, this rider offers an extra payout during the first four policy years to help with tax planning. 


##  How Much Does State Farm Life Insurance Cost? 
Based on our analysis of term life insurance quotes across two cities, State Farm’s premiums are slightly more expensive than the industry average for 30- and 40-year-olds. State Farm doesn’t offer 30-year term policies for people over the age of 45, so the quotes for 55-year-olds below reflect a 20-year term policy. 
Note that your individual rate may differ depending on the policy and term you choose, along with your age, health, smoking status, occupation, lifestyle, and other factors. It’s a good idea to compare quotes from a few life insurance companies, but remember that the cheapest policy isn’t always the best.

##  The Bottom Line 
State Farm’s superb customer service and financial strength ratings make the company a good option if you want life insurance, particularly for people looking for a return-of-premium term policy or couples and business partners looking for affordable coverage for two. But people looking for accelerated death benefits or other customization options and those hoping to forgo a medical exam may be better served by another company. While State Farm offers a great mobile app, you can’t apply for most policies online, and beneficiaries can’t file online claims, though you can meet with an agent virtually. 
##  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
###  Can I Cash Out My State Farm Life Insurance Policy? 
Once you’ve accumulated enough cash value with a State Farm whole or universal life insurance policy, you can [borrow against it or withdraw](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082114/6-ways-capture-cash-value-life-insurance.asp) from it up to four times per year. You can also surrender the policy, but you may incur a surrender charge. While term life insurance doesn’t typically have a cash surrender value, State Farm offers a Return-of-Premium Term Life policy that pays cash if you outlive the term. 
###  Is State Farm Life Insurance Expensive? 
State Farm term life insurance policies cost more than average, but many life insurance companies charge even higher premiums. Most life insurance companies don’t offer online quotes for fully underwritten permanent policies, so you’ll need to get a quote from an agent to compare State Farm’s whole and universal life insurance prices with other life insurers. 
###  Is State Farm Reliable? 
Yes. State Farm has been a reputable insurance provider for more than 100 years and is top-rated for financial strength and customer satisfaction. 
##  How We Review Life Insurance Companies 
To compile our list of the best life insurance companies, Investopedia first conducted preliminary research on dozens of life insurance companies and determined that 45 met our minimum standard for financial strength, customer satisfaction, and online transparency.
