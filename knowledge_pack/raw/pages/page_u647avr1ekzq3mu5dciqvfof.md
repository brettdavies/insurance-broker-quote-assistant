#  State farm. Youthful Driver Rating 
I recently got my bill increased by about $90 and they stated the change was made because "Youthful Driver Rating Change Policy reinstated" Im 22 23 in less than a month. Im on my own policy 2 vehicles and they randomly just increased my insurance? Like why? They knew my age and everything from the beginning. Ive been licensed since 16. I don't understand where I went wrong.

Are we talking $90 per month? 
$90 every 6 months, because that's less than a Netflix subscription 
Or $90 per year where that's $7.50 a month? 
Take your info to a individual insurance agent (that's it's own category of insurance agents). They will shop you out to 8-12 companies all at the same time. 
Some things I would counsel you on as a young adult about insurance. Things I learned though experience (sometimes the hard way). You may already know some of this and you can ignore it if you do, but I like to leave pearls of wisdom so you can learn about insurance. 
  1. Get more than the state minimum limits. It's there to protect you. It won't pay to repair a bumper tap in most cases. 
  2. You have to get collision if get a loan. Liability only won't fix your car, even if you are fault. Collision won't fix your car if let's say, an act of God like hail gets it. You need comprehensive. 
  3. Roadside assistance uses create comprehensive claims. Comprehensive claims are used to rate your risk in premiums. One is not bad, but if you're like me and you work near a landfill, sometimes you get a sting of bad luck. Use extended warranties or Triple AAA when you can instead. 
  4. You get what you pay for when it comes to insurance. It's expensive. You hope you never need to use it. But when you pay for the cheapest possible company and the bare bones policy, don't be surprised when you get some headaches when you need to use it. If the premium is crazy cheap compared to some other companies (fred loya, amshield, ect) your paying for a piece of paper to make you legal to drive. There's about a snowballs chance of the company paying the claim, which leaves you at risk for a suit.

State Farm's interpretation of "youthful driver" generally continues until age 25. The rate drops a bit every two years until then. Women automatically leave youthful driver status when they turn 25, or earlier when they get married or have a child. Men leave it if 25 and married....otherwise, single men are still youthful drivers until age 30. Before you decide it's not fair.....that's what the claim data says.

Did you have a lapse, because it says your policy was reinstated.... That could be the reason for your increase

Increase of $90 per year doesn't seem too bad.

Depends on the company... Many companies offer 12 month policies for auto. 
Almost all home policies are for 12 months. I've never seen one not for 12.
