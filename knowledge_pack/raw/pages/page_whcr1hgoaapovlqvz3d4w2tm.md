  * **Skip Filing Small Claims:** Unless it’s worth it, think twice before you [file an auto insurance claim](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/file-claims-that-win/) for minor damage, as frequent claims can lead to rate hikes.
  * **Try Geico’s DriveEasy Program:** Let the app track your safe driving habits — good scores can lead to lower rates.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Is Geico insurance good?
Yes. Geico has an A++ rating from A.M. Best, so it’s got the financial strength to pay out even during big disasters. Safe drivers can snag monthly rates starting around $43, and you can pile on savings with multi-policy, good driver, and vehicle safety discounts.
### Is Geico good at claims?
Yes. Geico’s claims handling earns above-average satisfaction scores from J.D. Power and a 0.55 NAIC complaint ratio — about half the industry average. Filing through the Geico mobile app often speeds up processing, with some repairs approved the same day.
### Who is better, Geico or Progressive?
If your record’s squeaky clean, Geico usually gives you lower monthly rates and plenty of discounts, like breaks for federal employees or defensive driving courses. But if you’re shopping for [auto insurance for high-risk drivers](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/cheap-auto-insurance-for-high-risk-drivers/), Progressive could be the better pick with its Snapshot program that rewards safer habits behind the wheel.

It can be, especially if your current insurer charges more than Geico’s typical $43 monthly safe-driver rate. Check if you qualify for bundling, military, or multiple-vehicle discounts to reduce your costs further. Always compare side-by-side quotes before committing.
### Is Geico overcharging customers?
Not usually. Rate hikes often happen after a claim, a ticket, or when you add extra coverage. If your bill suddenly jumps, ask for a policy review, consider raising your deductible, or shop around to make sure you’re getting the best deal for your situation.
### Who is better, Geico or State Farm?
Geico usually wins on lower monthly premiums for tech-savvy drivers who like managing everything online or through its app. But if you’re more into face-to-face help and perks like teen driver programs or safe driving rewards, checking out a [State Farm insurance review](https://www.quote.com/companies/state-farm-insurance-review/) might show it’s the better fit for you.
### Is Geico hard to deal with?
You’ll find Geico easy to manage if you prefer digital tools, as their mobile app allows you to handle ID cards, payments, and claims quickly. However, if you prefer in-person service, fewer local offices may feel limiting.
### Why is Geico so much cheaper?
Geico keeps costs down by running mostly online and over the phone, which helps cut overhead. If you’ve got a clean driving record, you could pay as little as $40 a month, and you can save even more with perks like multi-policy or vehicle safety discounts.
### Is Allstate or Geico better?
If you prefer in-person help from local agents, Allstate might suit you better, as highlighted in our [Allstate insurance review](https://www.quote.com/companies/allstate-auto-insurance-review/). But if you value low monthly premiums, Geico’s $43 clean-record rate and wide discount options usually make it the more affordable choice.
### What is Geico’s customer satisfaction rating?
Geico holds an A+ BBB rating and a 74/100 rating from Consumer Reports, indicating that customers are generally satisfied. J.D. Power also scores Geico above average at 692/1,000 for claims handling.
### How to get Geico to lower rates?
You can lower your Geico rates by raising deductibles, bundling policies, or enrolling in DriveEasy, which tracks safe driving habits. Skipping small claims can also help you avoid future rate hikes, and following an [auto insurance guide](https://www.quote.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance/) makes it easier to spot other ways to cut costs without losing important coverage.
