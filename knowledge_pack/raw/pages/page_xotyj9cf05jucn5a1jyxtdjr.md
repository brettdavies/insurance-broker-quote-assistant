## How customers feel about GEICO home insurance
Customers have mixed opinions on GEICO home insurance and its third-party underwriters. For example, GEICO’s underwriting partner, Homesite, ranked below average for customer satisfaction in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Home Insurance Study.[[2]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-2)
GEICO also has a low rating with Trustpilot users, with an average rating of 1.3 out of 5 across 880 reviews. Several reviewers express dissatisfaction with GEICO’s customer service team, indicating they’re difficult to contact.
That said, the company has a very low number of customer complaints with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
### GEICO industry ratings
Industry ratings measure an insurance company’s financial stability, customer satisfaction, and the total number of customer complaints relative to the average.
Here’s how GEICO ranks with independent rating agencies:
**Rating** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **Score** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg) |  **What This Means** ![sort asc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)![sort desc](https://insurifycdn.com/ui/icons/ExpandArrowOutline.svg)  
---|---|---  
AM Best | A++ (Superior) | Highest possible score for financial stability  
J.D. Power | 563 (out of 1,000) | Below-average customer satisfaction rating  
NAIC Complaint Index | Low | Very small number of customer complaints  
## GEICO home insurance discounts
[**Home insurance discounts**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/home-insurance-discounts/)

  * **Home security discount:** Homeowners can earn a discount for installing things like [**alarm systems**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/security-system-discount/) and home security cameras. These items can help reduce the risk of theft and break-ins.
  * **Safety equipment discount:** Homeowners can save by installing smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in their homes**.**


### GEICO insurance bundling options
GEICO, like many other insurance companies, offers [**bundling discounts**](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/coverage/home-and-auto/). You can earn a bundling discount through GEICO if you get a home and auto policy. While bundling your home and auto insurance can help reduce your rate, GEICO doesn’t specify how much of a discount you’ll receive.
## How to file a home insurance claim with GEICO
Since other insurance companies underwrite GEICO’s home insurance policies, the claims process looks slightly different.
Here’s a quick overview of what the claims filing process includes:
  1. **Visit the GEICO claims center.** You can begin the[**home insurance claim**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/knowledge/how-to-file-a-home-insurance-claim/)[[3]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-3)
  2. **Choose your company.** Select the insurance company that underwrote your home insurance policy.
  3. **Follow its claims process.** Visit the partner company’s website or call to file a claim. The actual claims process and policy management tools will vary by partner insurance company.
  4. **Wait for a response.** Once you file your claim, you’ll need to await a response from the insurance company and proceed as instructed.

## GEICO vs. other insurance companies
If you’re still considering multiple insurance options, take a look at how GEICO compares to a couple of other [**top insurance companies**](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/best-home-insurance-companies/).
### GEICO vs. State Farm
Like GEICO, State Farm is a large, established insurance company that has sold insurance since 1922. State Farm offers homeowners insurance and underwrites its own policies.
The company operates in all 50 U.S. states, but it doesn’t currently offer new policies in Massachusetts or Rhode Island. The average cost of a State Farm insurance policy with $300,000 in dwelling coverage with a $10,000 deductible is $1,988 per year.
### GEICO vs. Progressive
Progressive is another major U.S. insurance company that can sell coverage in all 50 states. Similar to GEICO, Progressive has its homeowners insurance policies underwritten by third-party partners. The company earned a below-average rating in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Home Insurance Study, but it ranked higher than GEICO.
## GEICO home insurance FAQs
The following information can help you decide whether GEICO is the right option for your home insurance needs.
  * ### Is GEICO legitimate?
Yes. GEICO is a legitimate insurance company that has sold insurance since 1936. The company has an A++ (Superior) financial strength rating from independent insurance-rating company AM Best.
  * ### Is GEICO good at paying claims?
GEICO’s AM Best financial strength rating of A++ (Superior) indicates an ability to pay claims. But the company’s underwriting partner, Homesite, ranked last in the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study.[[4]](https://insurify.com/homeowners-insurance/companies/geico/#cite-4) This indicates that some policyholders may be slightly dissatisfied with the claims process but not necessarily that the company is unable to pay out claims.
  * ### Does GEICO underwrite homeowners insurance?
No. GEICO doesn’t underwrite its homeowners insurance policies. The company’s nonaffiliated partners underwrite its policies.
  * ### Are GEICO and Homesite the same company?
No. GEICO and Homesite aren’t the same company. They’re separate insurance companies, though Homesite underwrites some policies for GEICO.


## Methodology
Insurify data scientists analyzed rates from more than 180 home insurance companies sourced directly from Insurify’s partner companies and Quadrant Information Services. Rates span all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and quote averages represent the mean price for a given coverage level and geographic area. To ensure data reliability, only insurers meeting minimum quote thresholds were included in the analysis. 
Unless otherwise specified, quoted rates reflect the average cost for homeowners with no prior claims and good credit with a home construction year of 1980. The default coverage assumptions include: 
Default Coverage Assumptions
  * **Dwelling coverage:** $300,000
  * **Deductible:** $1,000
  * **Personal property limit:** $25,000
  * **Liability limit:** $300,000


Additional data points beyond these default values are sourced from Insurify’s proprietary database. Rates are updated monthly.
