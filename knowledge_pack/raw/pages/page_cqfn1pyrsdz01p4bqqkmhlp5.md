### Progressive Snapshot vs. USAA SafePilot
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70//icons/award)

That's because [USAA's SafePilot](https://www.valuepenguin.com/usaa-safepilot-insurance-review "USAA SafePilot Review: Is It Worth It?") typically offers a larger discount, and it won't raise your rates if you get a bad score. On the other hand, 20% of drivers who sign up for [Progressive Snapshot](https://www.valuepenguin.com/progressive-snapshot-insurance-review "Progressive Snapshot Review") see their rates go up.
| Progressive Snapshot | USAA SafePilot  
---|---|---

## USAA vs. Progressive customer service
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/w_70//icons/award)
USAA has better customer service ratings than Progressive.
**Drivers can expect an excellent customer service experience from USAA.** It earned one of the top scores on J.D. Power's claims satisfaction study. USAA also gets an average number of complaints compared to insurance companies of its size, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
**In comparison, Progressive earned one of the lowest scores on J.D. Power's claims satisfaction survey.** That means it could take Progressive a long time to fix your car, and you may have to pay more for repairs. However, Progressive gets about one-quarter fewer complaints than an average company its size, according to the NAIC.
| Progressive | USAA  
---|---|---  
Editor's rating |  |   
J.D. Power | 3rd out of 25 | 19th out of 25  
NAIC complaint index | 28% fewer than average | 1% fewer than average  
AM Best financial strength rating | A+ | A++  
**In addition, USAA stands out with an excellent rating from ValuePengin's editors due to its excellent customer service ratings and the overall value it provides customers.** It also earned the highest financial strength rating available from AM Best. That means that the company has the ability to pay out claims, even in tough economic situations.
**Progressive did not score as well with our editors largely due to its home and renters insurance offerings.** Drivers who buy home insurance through Progressive have to file claims with a different company because Progressive does not underwrite its homeowners insurance policies. This may lead to inconsistent service.
