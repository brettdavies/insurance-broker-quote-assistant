The roof is only 4 years old. We appealed and sent in these photos, but they said it has granular loss and needs a FULL REPLACEMENT. The roof looks great to me, am I crazy??

I don’t see granule loss, but I do know that 3 tab is essentially being phased out and becoming harder and harder to insure. It’s just much more susceptible to pretty much all kinds of damage, and in a climate where door to door storm chasers are squeezing every dime out of communities and are often pressing for truly laughable claims (looked at one yesterday), the homeowners are really the ones who are going to continue to get shafted.

This plus with the shingle being discontinued the potential for the insurance company to have to pay for the roof in the event of a minor claim goes up substantially.

Insurance is for having, not for using. If you are going to use it they don't want your business. Otherwise, keep sending them the stuffed envelopes of cash for your policy.

Not exactly; they’re finding ways to avoid shelling out more and more money to a fairly ravenous industry. I don’t like or agree with insurance, but I see this kind of determination as reactionary.

So with this and shingles being discontinued, what is the best thing to use for a roof? Are there companies that make the really old fashioned houses that last for generations the way they used to be made before the modern era? I know people will give weird reactions to this comment but they have lasted literally for more than 8 decades without any maintenance and no damage since ancient times.

Cost is such a massive consideration these days, so that’s really the first question anyone needs to ask before thinking about replacing a roof, whether it’s for you or for someone else. If I were spending your money, I’d tell you to get a [standing seam metal roof](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=standing+seam+metal+roof&cId=7cfe31e6-7702-449f-9374-e1fea37cdde9&iId=5bb80995-a054-4c49-bc0f-202a039b4830), the thicker gauge metal the better (which means the smaller number the better… 29G is the minimum). Ice and water all valleys, edges, and transitions, synthetic underlayment broadly on slope. I’d tell you the simpler roof the better, so that means the fewest penetrations, fewest changes of slope, and fewest complications in general. If you run a good standing seam on a mono-slope roof with no penetrations through it, you’ll never see water get through it in your life time, and I don’t much care how old you are now or how old you get to. 
People make the mistake these days ALL THE TIME of paying near standing seam prices for metal panel roofing that’s just face screwed down and people end up getting the same life out of that roof as they do a traditional shingle roof because of the thousand and a half maintenance points on the roof. 
People can feel free to message me if they have more questions, want me to elaborate further, or whatever.

I have used CertainTeed triple laminate shingles and have them on my house. After 22 years they still look new. But they are thick and they are heavy and they are expensive. And the solar installers who tried to pry up some for putting in their hold-downs said they had the toughest adhesive to get loose of any shingle they ever had worked on. We live in a windy location, but never have exceeded 80 mph, so I can't vouch for their top wind resistance. But they haven't curled or chipped or even have thinning edges.

Get used to it. The latest scheme in my policy renewal is that the insurance will deduct 10% per year for [asphalt shingles](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=asphalt+shingles+insurance+deduction&cId=7a7f7f47-5421-4b72-88ea-74379fb038a9&iId=697f2aa4-008e-4a7b-8735-d2d80935b69a), and they'll bottom out liability at 25% of the replacement cost. So, if I have a total shingle loss after 7.5 years of putting on a new roof, they're paying 25% and im paying 75%.

Is anyone else seeing a lack of ventilation and warped decking? I see a couple turbines and maybe a box vent? The last picture looks wavy along the shingles. Could be due to moisture trapping in the attic. I feel like this roof could use a little more air flow.

I don’t see the granule loss, I think that’s just the form letter they send out, we hear that same phrase in every post like this. The roof looks wavy and I question whether it needs new decking or if they torn off the previous roof or did a second layer and these are much bigger problems than granule loss and a better reason not to insure the roof. But it’s probably actuaries deciding there are too many homes insured in your area and they want to lower liabilities there.

Homesite is super strict to the extent I call bullshit. I was recently cancelled by them due to "granular loss". The only way to stay active was a full roof replacement. I had three reputable roofers come by and they all said my roof looks great and has another 15 years easy. I switched to another insurer.

It's your roof type. It's more susceptible to wind events, and is being phased out due to It's low life expectancy. It also has an increased risk of interior leaks averted minor failures compared to more modern designs. 
I'm not agreeing with what they did just stating how they justify it

The roof looks fine to me but I would need to see more up-close pictures. There has been a significant change in the insurance market regarding roofs. 2022 was a bad year for claims. I believe for 2022 77% of all worldwide claim dollars went into the US. The reinsurance market in 2023 cancelled or modified treaties/contracts with insurance companies. Reinsurance is where insurance companies are basically insured to keep them afloat during hard periods. Lloyds of London is a reinsurer. Warren Buffet is big player in this market with Berkshire Hathaway Re. A number of companies saw their premiums go up 50%. Either they pass this on, go with higher deductibles, or tighter restrictions. In this case all three. Areas like Florida have been hit hard compared to other states. Homeowners are facing tighter restrictions like you are seeing. Depreciation on claims now starts normally at 10 to 15 years of roof age. Some companies start this if the roof is over 2 years of age. If I need to replace again I will be looking into a metal roof. Shingle roofs are just not lasting like they should.

Roof looks perfect. They are likely canceling because of the trees overhanging your roof. Find another carrier. Not Allstate/ State Farm

I switched to lemonade after my previous policy doubled. I haven't had a claim (knock on wood) so I can't really vouch for them beyond it was easy to get insured.

I am switching FROM Lemonade because they doubled our policy at renewal and made our mortgage go up $450/month. Switched to Progressive and then they dropped us after one month.

I was just dropped by Homesite. I contacted an insurance broker. He brought me a Homesite quote. I explained that I had just been dropped by them. They have a new underwriter and are going to insure my home again.

Not a roofer - but looks in good shape. Despite it being a three tab shingle which seem to be a lower quality I’ve heard.
