# What Is The Minimum Amount of Car Insurance Required in Illinois? 
The Illinois Hammer Injury Law Firm
At a minimum, Illinois drivers must carry automobile insurance on registered vehicles that includes liability coverage of $25,000 for the injury or death of one person, $50,000 for multiple injuries or deaths, and $20,000 for property damage. You could face serious consequences if you don’t carry insurance or have insurance that doesn’t meet these requirements. You can also purchase car insurance with higher limits or insurance that protects you from additional risks. 
No matter what type of car insurance you choose, you have a legal right to seek [compensation for your losses after an auto accident](https://illinoishammer.com/illinois/car-accident-lawyer/). The Illinois Hammer Injury Attorneys can help you protect your rights and get the money you deserve. 
## Illinois Car Insurance Basics 
All vehicles registered in the state of Illinois must carry [liability insurance](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/auto-insurance-shopping-guide.html). This type of insurance protects you from financial losses related to property damage and injuries you cause others in the event of a crash. 
Without liability insurance, you are directly responsible for the other drivers’ bills if the crash is deemed to be your fault. That could cost thousands of dollars out of pocket. Insurance helps you by covering at least part of those losses in the event of an accident. 
You may also hear the phrase “full coverage,” which generally refers to a car insurance policy with collision and comprehensive coverage in addition to liability. Collision coverage pays for damage caused by an accident with a car or stationary object. Comprehensive coverage pays for most other sources of auto damage, including weather and theft. 
## What Is the Minimum Auto Insurance Coverage in Illinois? 
All vehicles registered in Illinois must have liability insurance that meets or exceeds the following amounts: 
  * $25,000 for the injury or death of one person 


  * $50,000 for the injury or death of two or more people 


  * $20,000 for the damage to another person’s property 


If your car is financed, your lending institution may require you to purchase insurance with higher limits or additional coverage. 
### What Are the Risks of Protecting Myself with Minimum Car Insurance in Illinois? 
While minimum auto insurance can be enough for minor fender benders, it may not cover the full cost of major accidents or provide protection for other damage to your car. Illinois drivers often choose minimum insurance policies to save on monthly premiums, but many would be better off with greater coverage. 
If you are in a serious accident and the other driver’s car is totaled, the driver may sue you for costs exceeding the $20,000 damage cap. If you hit a deer and damage your vehicle without having comprehensive insurance coverage, you’ll be liable for the full financial cost. 
Having only the minimum car insurance opens you up to lawsuits and financial liability that could wipe out your entire savings. Instead of considering the legal minimum for insurance, think of the minimum amount you’d be comfortable with. 
## What Are the Benefits of Additional Coverage? 
Additional insurance coverage above and beyond the legal requirements can provide added protection and peace of mind. Types of additional insurance coverage you can purchase include the following:
  * **Collision coverage:** Pays for costs associated with hitting another vehicle or a stationary object, such as a pole or tree


  * **Comprehensive coverage:** Pays for damage to your vehicle from a variety of sources, including weather, fire, theft, hitting an animal, and more


  * **Towing:** Pays for the cost of towing your disabled vehicle


  * **Uninsured motorist property damage:** Pays for damage caused to your vehicle by an uninsured driver


  * **Rental reimbursement:** Pays a daily amount for renting a vehicle while the insured vehicle undergoes repairs


  * **Gap coverage:** Pays off your loan or lease if the vehicle is totaled and you still owe money


  * **Custom coverage:** Pays for any customized features added to a vehicle


Another type of coverage you may want to get is medical coverage. Sometimes referred to as personal injury protection or PIP, medical coverage pays a certain amount towards medical costs if you or your passengers receive injuries in an accident, [even if you are at fault.](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/auto-insurance-shopping-guide.html)
## What Is the Penalty for Driving Without Insurance in Illinois? 
Illinois officials [check twice yearly](https://www.ilsos.gov/departments/vehicles/mandatory_insurance.html) to see if a vehicle has a minimum insurance policy. If your vehicle is flagged, the state will check again in 30 days to see if you are still without minimum insurance coverage. If the second check finds no insurance, the Secretary of State’s office will send you a vehicle suspension letter.
If you still cannot prove insurance coverage, your registration will be suspended, and you must pay an additional $100 fee to recover it.
If you drive without adequate car insurance and are stopped for a traffic violation or get into an auto accident, [you may receive a traffic citation](https://www.ilsos.gov/departments/vehicles/mandatory_insurance.html). If convicted of driving without insurance, your license plates will be suspended, and you may face a fine of at least $500. Drivers who have plates already suspended for driving with no insurance face a minimum $1,000 fine.
## What Can I Do if I'm Hit by a Driver With Minimum or No Insurance Coverage? 
If your vehicle is involved in an accident with a driver who has little or no insurance, you may be confused about how to pursue compensation for medical bills and auto damage. The skilled attorneys at [The Illinois Hammer Injury Attorneys](https://illinoishammer.com/illinois/) can answer your questions about your legal rights and help you recover what you’re owed.
### Helpful Steps to Take 
Take the following steps after an accident to protect your health and preserve your legal rights: 
  * **Call 911 for any severe injuries.** Visit a doctor as soon as possible, as some injuries may not immediately show symptoms. 


  * **Don’t admit fault for the accident.** Whether you’re speaking with the other drivers, law enforcement, or your insurance company, keep your statements factual and neutral. 


  * **Get whatever documentation you can at the scene.** This may include pictures of injuries, damage to the car, and the condition of the roads. 


  * **Get contact and insurance information from the other drivers.**


  * **Contact the police and file a report as soon as you can.** Do this while the details of the crash are still fresh in your mind. 


  * **Contact your insurance company promptly to file a claim.** It is recommended to consult with a [Chicago car accident attorney](https://illinoishammer.com/chicago/car-accident-lawyer/) first. 


  * **Consider your legal options.** Consulting an [Illinois lawyer](https://illinoishammer.com/illinois/) can help you understand your rights and available options at every stage.

Testimonials
I suffered an injury and was having a hard time finding answers to my questions as no lawyer saw my case as being financially worthy. But I called in and spoke to Domenic, and he said I did have a case and he wanted to get it started immediately. It took almost 3 years, but Domenic got all my bills paid and a very good settlement for my injuries. I think the time he took with me and my questions was far more than any other attorney would spend with me and I really appreciated it.
