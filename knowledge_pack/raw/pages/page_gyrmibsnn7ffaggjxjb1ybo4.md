[State Farm](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/state-farm/) is the largest car insurance underwriter, holding over [18 percent of the total private passenger market share](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/research-actuarial-property-casualty-market-share.pdf). The company was founded in 1922 and is headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois. State Farm has a vast network of nearly 19,000 agents spread across the country. Known for its slogan of being “like a good neighbor,” State Farm offers policyholders a selection of banking products in addition to other insurance lines.
[Progressive](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/progressive/) is the second-largest car insurance underwriter and occupies over 16 percent of the market share. Progressive was founded in 1937 and is based in Mayfield, Ohio. The company has more than 38,000 independent agents and sells car insurance in all 50 states. Progressive made its mark in the insurance world back in the [mid-1950s](https://www.progressive.com/about/history/) by being the first company to write policies for riskier drivers, like those with a DUI or other moving violations, who may have a harder time finding car insurance.
Lightbulb Icon
Our verdict
Progressive shines among those who appreciate digital convenience and have complex driving histories, offering tools like the Name Your Price tool and Snapshot telematics program for personalized rates. Conversely, State Farm could be ideal for those seeking a more traditional insurance experience with a personal touch, offering superior claims satisfaction and agent accessibility. Both insurers provide compelling reasons to be considered, depending on individual preferences and requirements.
## Progressive vs. State Farm comparison
Progressive and State Farm are two of the biggest car insurance providers on the market. However, the Progressive and State Farm differences are numerous; these two companies stand apart for their varying coverage options, discount opportunities and average premiums.

Bankrate's take
For drivers with DUIs, finding insurance coverage can be particularly challenging. Not all insurance companies are willing to provide coverage to drivers with DUIs due to the increased risk they represent. Progressive is one of the insurers that typically offers policies to such drivers, although it's important to note that this may result in significantly higher [rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/). On the other hand, State Farm generally does not write policies for drivers with DUIs. For those affected by State Farm's policy, it becomes essential to explore other insurers like Progressive or seek specialized [high-risk insurance providers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/high-risk-drivers/). Prospective policyholders should prepare for a thorough rate assessment, where disclosing all relevant details of their driving history is important for receiving an accurate quote. This helps ensure they find a coverage option that aligns with their needs and budget.

### Customer complaints
The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC) Complaint Index measures the number of complaints an insurance company receives relative to its size, expressed as its market share. This index is a useful tool to gauge how well an insurer meets customer expectations in handling claims and service. A lower index score (under 1.00) typically suggests better performance, indicating fewer complaints than expected for a company of its size, while a higher score (above 1.00) indicates more complaints. Understanding this index can help consumers compare the reliability and service quality of different insurers.
#### Progressive auto insurance customer complaints
Progressive's auto insurance [customer complaints from the NAIC](https://content.naic.org/cis_refined_results.htm?TABLEAU=CIS_COMPLAINTS&COCODE=24260&:refresh) show a trend of improvement over recent years. A decreasing score from 2021 to 2023 suggests that Progressive has been addressing customer issues more effectively or seeing fewer complaints in proportion to its size. This information can be a valuable factor for potential customers to consider when evaluating the quality of customer service and reliability of Progressive's insurance offerings.

Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.

Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:

### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings

20% Support

  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

We are compensated in exchange for placement of sponsored products and services, or by you clicking on certain links posted on our site. Therefore, this compensation may impact how, where and in what order products appear within listing categories, except where prohibited by law for our mortgage, home equity and other home lending products. Other factors, such as our own proprietary website rules and whether a product is offered in your area or at your self-selected credit score range, can also impact how and where products appear on this site. While we strive to provide a wide range of offers, Bankrate does not include information about every financial or credit product or service.
