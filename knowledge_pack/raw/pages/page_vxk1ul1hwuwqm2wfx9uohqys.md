#  Progressive "Renter Protection Policy" doesn't cover liability? 
I have a tenant who left a faucet running. The water spilled out and damaged hardwood floors. My tenant has a Progressive "Renter Protection Policy", which includes liability. But.. excludes liability for a .. get this.. rented property. Excluded in a renters policy is: ""Property damage" to property rented to, occupied by, used by or in the care of an "insured". This exclusion does not apply to "property damage" resulting from fire, smoke or explosion. " 
Progressive is denying the claim. 
Wow.... thoughts??

It’s in the contract and is laid out pretty clearly. When I sell a renters policy to customers I explain that exclusion to them before they sign. I know not every agent does, but many people see “liability coverage” and thing that means ANY liability. 
This is why you should have insurance on the dwelling. Generally, the tenant should insure what’s inside the structure, and the landlord should insure the structure itself

It’s an incredibly common exclusion for property in a policyholder’s care, custody or control.

I'm not an insurance pro, but I did read my liability policy and the gist of it seems to be that if I mistakenly cause my rented apartment to be lit on fire, the damage that'll do to all the _other_ apartments in the flat is covered, but not my own. 
Not sure if I interpreted that correctly, but fortunately I don't have any plans of lighting stuff on fire. (And even if I had, liability from intentional damage is also excluded.)

This is probably **the** reason why renters insurance are typically cheap, often with a simple and fast underwriting process. Damages to the rental property itself is probably the number one type of loss/claim, if not excluded

Landlord has a policy, tenants have a policy. Landlord’s covers the building. Tenants covers their stuff. They do not cover liability towards each other.

Renters insurance is not going to cover damage to the property being rented. The liability coverage on a renters insurance policy is so you, as the property owner, don't get sued due to negligence from the tenant. 
You carry your own insurance on the property to cover damage to it from things like this.

Not so much. I've been a landlord of more than 1 property for about 10 years. My property management company has, in their lease, a clause requiring the tenant to carry liability insurance against damage to the house. This is the first time I've had significant damage at the fault of the tenant.

And did you do due diligence to read that policy and ensure it covered the liability you need? Or do you delegate every task you have? What productive work do you actually do to deserve this income from your tenants? Why should we as a society not just give your house to them, seeing as you provide nothing of value for the premium you are charging?

Renters insurance should not exclude damage to rented property. 
Not sure how many units you have, but look into tenant damage waiver. Sometimes offered via property management software but be careful buying insurance from a non-expert. 
Your property policy could cover this as others have mentioned, but this really is on the tenant and their policy should pay. 
Not sure why insurance people feel the need to be snotty know it alls.
