**Why Allstate made our list:** Allstate offers a variety of savings programs for eligible drivers to pursue on top of a robust list of discounts. Although the company provides many upsides, it does have some of the highest average rates on our list and scored slightly below the industry average for customer satisfaction in California in the 2025 J.D. Power study.
**Why Allstate may be the best for local agents:** Allstate maintains an extensive network of agents, aiding customers who prefer live-person interactions. For others, however, the insurer offers a robust array of digital tools and conveniences. Since California is prone to extreme weather claims, having a boots-on-the-ground agent could benefit San Diego drivers.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Mercury offers San Diego drivers some of the lowest average minimum and full coverage rates. Although it continued to rank below average in J.D. Power’s latest auto insurance and auto claims studies, it did earn an A (Excellent) rating for financial strength from AM Best. Mercury doesn’t offer as many endorsements as other carriers on this list, but low-mileage drivers may be interested in Mercury’s RealDrive program. Additional discounts include a telematics program and potential savings for anti-theft devices.
**Why Mercury may be the best for rideshare coverage:** Mercury has ride-hailing coverage for San Diego drivers participating in Uber or Lyft. While many ridesharing companies offer coverage while you have a client in the vehicle, finding a company that offers coverage for when the car is being used for personal use and in the ride-hailing or period one stage of the rideshare app can be challenging. Mercury’s ride-hailing insurance provides both personal and period one coverage.

## How much is car insurance in San Diego, California?
The [average cost of car insurance in California](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/#:~:text=Full%20coverage%20car%20insurance%20costs,coverage%20is%20%24645%20per%20year.) is $3,102 per year for full coverage which is 14 percent more than the same level of coverage in San Diego, which is $2,727 per year. On average, California drivers pay $915 per year for minimum coverage, which is 14 percent more than what San Diego drivers pay. Premiums and coverage for car insurance can both be highly individualized, and your actual rates could vary noticeably from the San Diego average. Factors like coverage level, driving experience and driving history make premiums between drivers and carriers vary significantly.
### San Diego rates for teens
[Teenage drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-driver-facts-and-statistics/?_bypasscdn=b3a86258-8987-44a9-9d4a-f843f19c9210#:~:text=Male%20drivers%20make%20up%20about,19%20years%20old%20in%202020.) are usually considered high-risk drivers in most states and tend to pay the most for car insurance compared to other age groups. Driving skills such as avoiding road hazards and adjusting your driving to accommodate weather conditions take time to learn. Teens are often charged significantly less while they stay on their parents' policies (which is required until they are 18 anyway).

### San Diego rates for young drivers
As drivers age and develop road experience, their rates tend to decrease. Drivers in their mid-twenties are still considered young drivers, but are no longer treated as risky as teen drivers (if they've kept their driving records clean). As adult children move out and get their own policies, they may still be able to keep certain discounts geared towards newer drivers, such as the driving training discount and the good student discount. Affordable [car insurance rates for young drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) are possible, and below, you can find some of the cheapest carriers for young adults in San Diego.

### San Diego rates for adults
Once drivers hit their mid-twenties, they should start to see young driver surcharges start to drop off. Based on data from the [Insurance Institute of Highway Safety](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot), the rate of fatal crashes for adults remains fairly level for adults throughout their 30s through 50s. This means that [other rating factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/) may become even more important, including your location, marital status and even where you park your car.

### Car insurance after a DUI in San Diego
In California, it is common for drivers who receive DUIs to need an [SR-22](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/sr22-california/) for three to five years after the offense.

Minimum coverage requirements in San Diego
Drivers in San Diego have many coverage levels and endorsement options available to build a policy that meets their financial needs. While most car insurance professionals recommend carrying higher levels of liability coverage for more financial protection, [California car insurance law](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/california-car-insurance-laws/) only requires drivers to carry the following [minimum liability insurance](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/):
  * $30,000 in bodily injury per person
  * $60,000 in bodily injury per accident
  * $15,000 for property damage


Drivers in San Diego should consider the extreme weather conditions and population density of their city when looking for the best car insurance coverage. Common losses such as wildfire, flooding, wind, hail, theft and vandalism are all covered by [comprehensive coverage](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/comprehensive-insurance/) which can be much more affordable than people expect.
## Frequently asked questions
  * ###  What is the best car insurance company?
Caret Down Icon
Typically, some of the best car insurance companies offer a combination of low rates, varied discounts, strong customer service, diverse coverage options and reputable financial strength ratings. However, the [best car insurance company](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-car-insurance-companies/) for you will likely depend on personal factors like where you live, the kind of car you drive and your claims history.
  * ###  What is the average cost of car insurance in San Diego?
Caret Down Icon
Using data from Quadrant Information Services, Bankrate has found the average yearly cost of San Diego car insurance to be $2,727 for full coverage and $801 for minimum. For comparison, the [national averages](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) are $2,671 and $806, respectively. Your personal rates may vary from these averages based on your driving record, age, ZIP code, vehicle, coverage options and more.
  * ###  How can I get more affordable car insurance in San Diego?
Caret Down Icon
There are several strategies you can try to find the best cheap car insurance in San Diego. First, [ask for quotes](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-quotes/) from several insurers rather than just one. You are likely to find that each offers you a different rate. Just be sure to ask for the same types and levels of coverage from each. Next, consider [discounts](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/best-auto-insurance-discounts/). Almost all insurers have at least a few and they may be easy to earn. You could save, for example, just by agreeing to receive policy documents digitally rather than by postal mail. One of the most important ways you can save money on your policy is by maintaining a clean driving record, since drivers without tickets or accidents generally see lower rates.
  * ######  Is car insurance getting more expensive in San Diego?
Caret Down Icon
Car insurance rates have risen in recent years, and continue to trend upward, although not at as fast of a pace as they were post-pandemic. High vehicle repair costs, [increased extreme weather](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/rising-cost-extreme-weather/) and an uptick in distracted driving are some primary factors contributing to high premiums. While you might not be able to do anything about these macroeconomic factors, you can take a look at your personal rating factors to potentially lower your premium. Maintaining a clean driving record is a great place to start, and you can always shop around to see if a different company offers you a lower rate for your selected coverage types.

If otherwise specified, the base profile has been modified with the following driver characteristics:
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:

Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
