## What are the penalties for driving without a license?
Each state has laws against driving without a license. In general, the penalties for driving without a license or driving with a suspended license are more severe than if you misplaced or forgot your license. In many states, a first offense for driving without a valid driver's license can be classified as a misdemeanor on your criminal record.
### Is driving without a license a felony?

Fines for driving without a license vary based on your state and individual circumstances. **First tickets for driving without a license may be in the range of a few hundred dollars and will vary by state**.
