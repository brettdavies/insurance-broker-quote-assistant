# Property Damage Claims In Florida
March 4, 2025
D2 Law
If your property has been damaged in Tampa, FL, you may be wondering what steps to take to recover your losses. Property damage claims can involve anything from car accidents to home damage caused by storms, fires, or even construction defects. Knowing your rights and understanding the claims process can make a significant difference in how much compensation you receive.
## **What is a Property Damage Claim?**
A property damage claim is a request for compensation from an insurance company or at-fault party to cover the cost of repairing or replacing damaged property. This can include damage to your home, vehicle, or personal belongings.
## **Types of Property Damage Claims**
  1. **Vehicle Damage** – If your car is damaged in an accident, you may be able to file a claim with your own insurance company or the at-fault driver’s insurer.
  2. **Home Damage** – This includes damage from hurricanes, fires, flooding, and vandalism. Homeowners’ insurance usually covers these incidents, but specific policies may vary.
  3. **Business Property Damage** – If a business suffers property damage, the owner may file a claim through commercial property insurance.
  4. **Construction Defects** – Poor construction or design flaws can lead to property damage. Claims may be filed against the builder, contractor, or architect.
  5. **Theft or Vandalism** – If your property is stolen or intentionally damaged, you may file a claim with your insurance company or pursue legal action against the responsible party.


## **How to File a Property Damage Claim**
  1. **Document the Damage** – Take clear photos and videos of the damage from multiple angles. If possible, gather receipts or estimates for repairs.
  2. **Report the Incident** – Notify the police if the damage involves theft, vandalism, or a car accident. Get a copy of the police report for your records.
  3. **Contact Your Insurance Company** – Provide all necessary documentation, including photos, receipts, and any reports from law enforcement or experts.
  4. **Obtain Repair Estimates** – Get written repair estimates from professionals to understand the cost of fixing the damage.
  5. **Negotiate the Settlement** – Insurance companies may offer a lower amount than what you need. Be prepared to negotiate or consult an attorney if necessary.


## **Florida’s Statute of Limitations for Property Damage Claims**
In Florida, you generally have **four years** from the date of the damage to file a lawsuit for property damage. However, if the damage resulted from negligence, such as a car accident, you may only have **two years** to file a claim. Filing after the deadline could mean losing your right to compensation.
## **Dealing with Insurance Companies**
Insurance companies may try to minimize their payouts by disputing the cause of damage, undervaluing repairs, or delaying payments. If you experience these tactics:
  * Keep detailed records of all communication.
  * Get independent repair estimates.
  * Consider hiring a property damage lawyer to protect your rights.


## **When to Hire a Property Damage Lawyer**
Hiring a lawyer may be necessary if:
  * Your claim is denied without a valid reason.
  * The insurance company offers a settlement far below repair costs.
  * The process is taking too long, and you need compensation urgently.
  * The at-fault party refuses to take responsibility.


An attorney can help you gather evidence, negotiate with insurers, and, if needed, take legal action to ensure you get the compensation you deserve.
## **Need Help With A Property Damage Claim?**
Dealing with property damage can be stressful, but knowing your rights and the claims process can help you recover faster. If you’re facing difficulties with an insurance company or need help with your claim, call **D2 Law at 800-790-5641** for a free consultation.
