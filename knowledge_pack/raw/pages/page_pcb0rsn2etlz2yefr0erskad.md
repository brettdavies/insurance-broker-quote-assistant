View typical insurance rates by credit level for Allstate and AAA below.
##### RATES BY CREDIT LEVEL: ALLSTATE VS. AAA
**Credit level** | **AAA avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
Very Poor (300-579) | $6,569 | $3,117  
Fair (580-669) | $4,023 | $2,162  
Good (670-739) | $3,723 | $2,021

#### The Zebra’s auto insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

### AAA vs. Allstate: rates for high-risk drivers
If you've got an at-fault crash, speeding ticket, reckless driving violation, or DWI in your rearview mirror, **Allstate could be a better choice than AAA**. Each auto insurance company prices policies differently after a violation, so don't be afraid to shop around to figure out which insurer suits you.
##### RATES BY CITATION: ALLSTATE VS. AAA
**Citation** | **AAA avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
At-fault accident (damage < $1,000) | $4,078 | $3,006  
At-fault accident (damage > $1,000) | $4,002 | $2,290  
DUI/DWI | $5,530 | $3,637  
Reckless driving | $5,530 | $3,388  
Speeding ticket | $4,078 | $2,256  
### AAA vs. Allstate: rates by age
Auto insurance companies rely on a driver's age to indicate risk, pricing premiums accordingly. An auto insurance policy is commonly more expensive for [teen drivers](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/driver/age/cheap-car-insurance-teens/) — thanks to their inexperience — and most affordable for middle-aged drivers. Because every car insurance company rates ages differently, it's wise to compare rates and find great coverage.
As a general rule, teen drivers should choose Allstate before AAA: Allstate offers average yearly savings of $3,814 versus AAA.
##### RATES BY AGE: ALLSTATE VS. AAA
**Age tier** | **AAA avg. annual premium** | **Allstate avg. annual premium**  
---|---|---  
**Teens** | $10,256 | $6,442  
**20s** | $4,644 | $2,636  
**30s** | $4,644 | $2,636  
**40s** | $3,195 | $1,912  
**50s** | $3,083 | $1,893  
**60s** | $2,887 | $1,768  
Aside from finances, AAA and Allstate each carry pros and cons, including their customer satisfaction ratings, discount programs, add-ons, and financial stability. Be sure to [get quotes](https://www.thezebra.com/car-insurance-quotes/) and compare rates before purchasing a policy.

In addition to the discounts listed above, Allstate offers additional discounts for utility vehicles, farm vehicles, and the newly retired. Due to AAA's partnerships with other car insurance companies to provide policies, some of these discount options may not be available in some locations. Always ask about what discounts you are eligible for when shopping for your policy.
* * *
## Telematics options: AAA vs. Allstate
Both AAA and Allstate offer telematics programs. Allstate offers more options than AAA, meaning that customers may find a better choice for their personal driving needs. Find out more about each company's [mobile app selection](https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-companies/best-car-insurance-apps-websites/) below. 
AAA OnBoard
Depending on the state in which they reside, some customers may be able to sign up for OnBoard, AAA's telematics option. The company boasts savings of 15% at sign-up, with total savings of up to 30% possible for eligible drivers. However, there is no separate app at the time of writing, meaning that all participants must download the AAA mobile app.
Allstate Drivewise
This telematics program uses a mobile app to track your driving behavior, possibly leading to discounts for safe motorists. Drivers receive 3% cashback for signing up for Drivewise. The app-based program can be used by both policyholders and "non-customers" alike to view driving data and receive feedback.
Allstate Milewise
Milewise is a newer program that offers [pay-per-mile car insurance](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/policies/pay-mile-auto-insurance/). This type of coverage could benefit low-mileage drivers in particular as your rates are based on the number of miles that you drive. These miles are tracked by a plug-in device. While not available in every state, Allstate has plans to continue expansion in an effort to gain more users. 
### Zebra Tip: Explore Allstate for telematics offerings
* * *

### AAA vs. Allstate: home insurance rate comparison
The average annual home insurance rates for AAA are **$1,212**. Allstate comes in somewhat higher at **$1,594**. Allstate and AAA both differ in their underwriting methods, so it's important to remember that your quotes may not match these exactly when you are searching for home coverage. 
Similar to car insurance, homeowners insurance prices can vary based on certain personal and location factors. Companies use not only your insurance history when putting together your quotes, but also historical data for the neighborhood, including crime rates, location to fire fighting services, and the likelihood of natural disasters.
Cheapest average rates
The insurer with the cheapest home insurance rates is **AAA at around $101 per month** , somewhat cheaper than **Allstate's average of $132 per month**.
#### The Zebra’s homeowners insurance data methodology
The Zebra’s Dynamic Insurance Rating Tool for home and auto insurance rates utilizes the latest ZIP code-level rate filings from across the U.S., sourced from Quadrant Information Services and S&P Global. These filings, typically updated annually or biennially by insurers, are verified through Quadrant’s QA process and then integrated into The Zebra’s estimator.  
  
The displayed rates are based on a dynamic home and auto profile designed to reflect the content of the page. This profile is tailored to match specific factors such as age, location, and coverage level, which are adjusted based on the page content to show how these variables can impact premiums.  
  
For a comprehensive understanding, see our [detailed methodology](https://www.thezebra.com/about/methodology/).

####  [ Can an insurance company force me to be added to a policy? ](https://www.thezebra.com/ask/can-parents-insurance-company-force-add-policy-live-house-not-drive/ "Can an insurance company force me to be added to a policy?")
It is normal for insurance companies, including Allstate, to require anyone in the household (of driving age) to be listed on a policy, "just in case." Even if you don't ever plan on driving their cars, insurers know that things come up and there is always a small chance. For example, if you're rid…

Yes, you can. AAA roadside assistance is a standalone membership, so you don’t need to have your car insurance through AAA to use it. But if you're budget-conscious, it’s a good idea to compare what AAA offers with other programs—some may offer similar coverage at a lower price.What does AAA roadsi…
