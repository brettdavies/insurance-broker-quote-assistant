# What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Texas?

![What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Texas?](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/what-is-the-minimum-car-insurance-required-in-texas.jpg)
When driving in Texas, knowing the minimum car insurance requirements isn’t just a good idea; it’s the law. As an “at-fault” state, Texas requires drivers to carry liability coverage to pay for damages and injuries resulting from accidents they cause. Specifically, the state mandates minimum coverage of $30,000 for injuries per person, $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage, commonly called 30/60/25 coverage. But **what is the minimum car insurance required in Texas**? To legally drive, you’ll need to meet these coverage requirements. For Austin drivers with questions about coverage, accidents, or their rights, [**TK Injury Lawyers: Austin Personal Injury Lawyer**](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/) is here to help.

## **What Is the Minimum Car Insurance Required in Texas? Understanding 30/60/25 Coverage**
**In Texas, drivers are required to carry a minimum of $30,000 in liability coverage for each injured person, up to a total of $60,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage per accident. This basic coverage is commonly referred to as 30/60/25**. This liability insurance is designed to cover the costs of repairs, medical bills, and other expenses for the other party if you are at fault in an accident, but only up to these specific limits. 
As noted by the [Texas Department of Insurance](https://tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb020.html), liability insurance does not cover damages to your vehicle or medical expenses for you or your passengers unless you add optional coverages like collision, comprehensive, or personal injury protection (PIP). 
While 30/60/25 coverage fulfills the state’s minimum legal requirements, it’s essential to consider whether these limits are enough to protect you financially in the event of a serious accident. Medical bills and repair costs can quickly exceed these amounts, potentially leaving you responsible for the difference. Assessing your needs and adding extra coverage can provide greater peace of mind. 
## **Is 30/60/25 Enough Coverage After a Car Accident in Austin?**
Although meeting the 30/60/25 requirement makes you legally compliant, it may not always provide enough protection after a serious accident. 
For example, if you cause an accident involving multiple vehicles needing repairs and significant medical treatment for several people, your coverage limits might fall short. With healthcare costs rising and the average price of cars like a new Ford F-150 exceeding $30,000, your $25,000 property damage limit could quickly be exceeded. Likewise, $30,000 for one person’s medical expenses can run out fast in cases of severe injuries, leaving you personally liable for the remaining costs. 
It’s also important to note that standard liability insurance only covers damages or injuries you cause to others; it does not include coverage for your own medical bills or vehicle repairs. To better protect yourself financially, consider exploring additional coverage options such as uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, which can protect you if the [at-fault driver has insufficient insurance](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/someone-hit-my-car-and-drove-off/) and collision or comprehensive coverage to safeguard your vehicle in case of accidents, theft, or other damages.

## **Penalties for Driving Without Minimum Insurance in Texas**
Driving without the required minimum insurance in Texas can lead to serious consequences. [Under Texas law](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/texas-car-insurance-laws-2024-update/), as outlined in the [Transportation Code](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/TN/htm/TN.601.htm), penalties for failing to maintain proper coverage start with a fine ranging from $175 to $350 for a first offense. However, the repercussions become more severe for repeat violations, with penalties climbing up to $1,000. In addition to hefty fines, repeat offenders may face suspension of their driver’s license and even have their vehicle impounded, which can add further costs and inconvenience.
The penalties don’t stop there. If you’re involved in an accident and [cannot provide proof of insurance](https://www.tkinjurylawyers.com/is-it-illegal-not-to-have-car-insurance-in-texas/), you may be required to provide evidence of financial responsibility before your license can be reinstated. This typically involves obtaining the necessary state-minimum coverage and proving compliance, which can take time and add additional burdens.
These stringent measures emphasize the importance of maintaining at least the state-mandated minimum insurance coverage. Beyond avoiding fines and legal penalties, proper insurance also ensures financial protection for yourself and others in the event of an accident. Whether it’s covering damages, medical bills, or legal costs, meeting insurance requirements is a legal obligation and a crucial step in being a responsible driver on Texas roads.
