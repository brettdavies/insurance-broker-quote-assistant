**Why Progressive made our list:** Affordable rates, a wide range of discounts and excellent policy customization options make Progressive one of our top picks for the best car insurance in Ontario, California. With a 4.4 Bankrate Score for auto insurance, Progressive stands out from the competition with well-rounded options for many Ontario drivers, including those with violations or accidents on their driving record.
**Why Progressive is best for digital policy management:** While Progressive has a handful of [Ontario-area agents](https://www.progressiveagent.com/local-agent/california/ontario/), its highly-rated mobile app and user-friendly website make it a strong option for drivers who prefer to manage their auto insurance from their smartphone.

**Why Mercury made our list:** Low rates and unique coverage make Mercury a standout option for auto insurance in Ontario, CA. In addition to standard coverage like liability and collision insurance, Mercury offers ridesharing insurance to drivers for transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft. However, it’s worth noting that Mercury receives consistently below-average customer satisfaction ratings in J.D. Power studies.
**Why Mercury is best for local agents:** Mercury works with a network of [local independent agents](https://www.mercuryinsurance.com/agentlocator/) in the Ontario area. While the company’s mobile tools are highly rated, drivers who prefer to work with an agent who knows the area may find a good fit in Mercury.

**Why Kemper made our list:** Kemper’s low rates for drivers in Ontario earns it a place in our top picks for local auto insurers. While the company did not rank in the 2024 U.S. Auto Claims Satisfaction Study from [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-auto-insurance-study), its basic coverage offerings and below-average rates for Ontario drivers could make it a worthwhile option for some local residents.
**Why Kemper is best for high-risk auto insurance:** Kemper’s specialty is auto insurance for high-risk drivers, including those with poor driving records and immigrant drivers. Kemper offers SR-22 filing and works with drivers who hold international licenses or Matrícula Consular identification cards from Mexico.

## How much is car insurance in Ontario, California?
The average cost of car insurance in Ontario, California is $3,076 per year for full coverage and $901. For drivers seeking full coverage, that’s 1 percent less than the [state average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance-in-california/) of $915 and 14 percent more than the [national average](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/).
Note that your premium is unlikely to be an exact match for these average rates. Your own payments are personalized based on a range of factors that your insurer considers. Your age and [location](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/states/) as well as your car's age, make and model all play a role in determining what you will pay. Another primary risk factor is your driving record. Drivers with [few or no marks on their license](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-insurance-for-good-drivers/) generally qualify for the best rates, since insurers see them as less likely to cause accidents or file claims in the future.
### Ontario rates for teens
[Teen drivers](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/teen-drivers/) in Ontario regularly pay some of the highest premiums for car insurance, especially if they’re not on a parent’s policy, because of their lack of driving experience and high accident rate. An 18-year-old Ontario driver with a standalone full coverage policy pays an average of $8,051 per year, while their parents would pay an average of $6,230 per year to keep them on their policy.

### Ontario rates for young drivers
[Drivers aged 20 to 25](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/young-drivers/) in Ontario typically pay lower car insurance premiums than teens, but more than older adults with a greater degree of experience behind the wheel. While staying on a family policy at this age can help to keep costs low, many young adults will have their own address and need a standalone policy — which costs from $3,805 on average for 25-year-olds to $5,365 for 20-year-old drivers. Sticking to state minimum coverage could lower rates, but at the expense of financial protection in the event of accidents.

## The cheapest car insurance in Ontario by driving record
Insurance companies base Ontario car insurance rates on [risk factors](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/rate-factors/), including the individual risk factors in a driver’s motor vehicle record. If a prospective insurer sees tickets or accidents on your driving record, it will likely price your coverage higher to account for the added risk of claims.
### Car insurance with a speeding ticket in Ontario

### Car insurance after an accident in Ontario
Like a speeding ticket, an at-fault accident on your driving record signals to insurers that you are more likely to have an at-fault accident in the future — and thus more likely to file a claim. On average, Ontario drivers with a single at-fault accident pay 68 percent more for full coverage than drivers with clean records at an annual average of $5,167.

### Car insurance after a DUI in Ontario
[California law](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/alcohol-and-drugs/) imposes serious penalties on DUI convictions, including immediate revocation of driving privileges, SR-22 filing requirements and potential fines, fees, vehicle impoundment and jail time. In addition, your DUI conviction may make it difficult to find affordable auto coverage. The average annual cost of full coverage after a DUI conviction is $7,820 for drivers in Ontario, and $2,323 just for state minimum coverage. That’s 158 percent more than the state average for minimum coverage and 154 percent more for full coverage.
It’s important to note that securing coverage after a DUI can also be more challenging, as not all standard carriers are willing to write policies following the high-risk incident. Some insurers could cancel your policy mid-term following a DUI conviction while others will wait until the end of the policy term.

## Frequently asked questions
  * ######  What is the best car insurance company in Ontario?
Caret Down Icon
The best Ontario car insurance company varies from person to person. Insurance providers look at a number of personal factors to determine a driver’s insurance rate. It can help to consider your factors and insurance needs when shopping for a provider.

Or, if you work from home and don’t have a commute, you may want a company that offers a telematics program.
  * ###  How can I lower my car insurance rates in Ontario?
Caret Down Icon
Shopping for car insurance frequently is one of the best ways to [lower your car insurance premium](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/savings/). Rates can fluctuate throughout the year, and your premium may go up at renewal time. Instead of letting your costs creep up, you may want to request quotes from several carriers.

  * ###  Is car insurance expensive in Ontario?

#### Other profiles
  * ###  Credit-based insurance scores:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan. 
  * ###  Incidents:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following incidents applied: clean record (base), at-fault accident, single speeding ticket, single DUI conviction and lapse in coverage.
  * ###  Mileage:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the following differences in mileage: 2K, 5K, 12K (base), 15K and 20K.
  * ###  Model:
Caret Down Icon
Unless otherwise stated, rates are for 2023 vehicle models. For new vs used vehicles, we included the following year in our calculations: 2013.
  * ###  Age:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were calculated by evaluating our base profile with the ages 18-70 (base: 40 years) applied. Depending on age, drivers may be a renter or homeowner. Age is not a contributing rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts due to state regulations. For teen drivers, rates were determined by adding a 16- or 17-year-old teen to their 40-year-old married parents' policy. The rates displayed reflect the total cost of a driver this age added to their parents’ policy. 
  * ###  Gender:
Caret Down Icon
The following states do not use gender as a determining factor in calculating premiums: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
  * ###  Status:
Caret Down Icon
Rates were evaluated based on the following marital/family status: single (base), married, 40-year-old married man and woman. Marital status is not a rating factor in Hawaii and Massachusetts. 


### Bankrate Score
Our 2025 Bankrate Score for auto insurance considers key variables that our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach. 
Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
50% Cost & ratings
50% Cost & ratings
30% Coverage & savings
30% Coverage & savings
20% Support
20% Support
  * **Tier 1 (Cost & ratings):** To determine how well auto insurance companies satisfy these priorities, our team analyzed quoted premiums from Quadrant Information Services (if available), as well as any of the latest third-party agency ratings from [J.D. Power](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/jd-power/), [AM Best](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/am-best/), Demotech and the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/naic/) (NAIC). 
  * **Tier 2 (Coverage & savings): **We assessed companies’ coverage options and availability to help policyholders find a provider that balances cost with coverage. Additionally, we evaluated the discount options listed on each company’s website.
  * **Tier 3 (Support):** To encompass the many ways an auto insurance company can support policyholders, we analyzed avenues of customer accessibility along with community support. This analysis incorporated additional financial strength ratings from [S&P](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/s-and-p/) and Moody’s and factored in a company’s corporate sustainability efforts.


Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
