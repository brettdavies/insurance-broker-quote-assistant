# "Subject to Underwriting" Meaning

Based on the webpage content, here's the explanation:

## Core Definition

When an insurance provider includes "subject to underwriting" on a quotation, it indicates the quote is **provisional and dependent on successful completion of the underwriting process**.

## Two-Step Process

**Quoting (Initial Step):**
The provider offers a preliminary quote based on information supplied, typically using "worst case scenario" assumptions to ensure the estimate covers potential risks.

**Underwriting (Final Step):**
This involves "a careful review of any medical reports" and detailed examination of your medical history to reach a final determination.

## Key Outcome

After underwriting completion, you may receive a **revised quote** that's usually more favorable than the initial projection. As stated: *"the process delivers a fully underwritten policy that provides peace of mind that all assessments decisions have been completed."*

## Purpose

The "subject to underwriting" language protects both parties—it acknowledges the quote isn't binding until medical assessment is complete, giving the insurer time to verify risk factors while allowing applicants to understand final terms before commitment.
