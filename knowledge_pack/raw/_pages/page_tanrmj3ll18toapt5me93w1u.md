# Underwriting Definition and Application

Based on the provided content, here's what the article explains about underwriting:

## Core Definition
The article defines underwriting as: **"the process insurers use to determine the risks of insuring your small business."**

## Key Functions

**Risk Assessment**: Underwriters evaluate whether a business represents an acceptable risk and calculate appropriate premium costs.

**Applicability**: The process applies to all insurance forms, including commercial policies, homeowners, life, and health insurance.

## Underwriting Process Factors

Underwriters assess multiple risk indicators:
- Business type and age
- Financial metrics (size, sales, assets)
- Credit history and bankruptcy records
- Property condition
- Prior insurance claims
- Loss-prevention measures

## Professional Role

An underwriter is described as **"an insurance professional who specializes in risk assessment"** representing the insurer's interests, not the customer's.

## Relationship to Other Roles

Unlike insurance agents or brokers, underwriters:
- Create the underwriting system determining coverage eligibility
- Work behind the scenes on risk evaluation
- Don't directly interact with customers on applications

## Unfavorable Outcomes

If underwriting reveals problematic risk factors, insurers may offer modified coverage through endorsements rather than declining coverage entirely.

The article emphasizes that underwriting is essential because **"insurance involves individuals or businesses transferring their risks to an insurer."**
