# California Auto Insurance Policy Limits Disclosure Requirements

## Key Requirements

California law mandates that drivers carry minimum auto insurance coverage:
- **Bodily injury liability**: $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident
- **Property damage liability**: $5,000 minimum
- **Uninsured motorist coverage**: $15,000 per person/$30,000 per accident

## Disclosure Rules

**Pre-Litigation Disclosure**: Insurance carriers must make a "prompt written inquiry" to their insured policyholder asking permission before disclosing policy limits information to third-party claimants before litigation begins.

**Post-Litigation Disclosure**: Once formal litigation commences, insurers must reveal policy limit amounts through discovery procedures (California Judicial Council Form Interrogatories, No. 4.1(e)).

## Strategic Considerations

Insurance companies often withhold this information pre-litigation to gain negotiating advantage. The document notes that "nondisclosure favors the insurer's economic interests," while disclosure may benefit the policyholder by encouraging settlement discussions and potentially preventing costly litigation.

## Bad Faith Implications

If an insurer refuses a reasonable settlement within policy limits and a judgment exceeds those limits, the company faces potential "bad faith liability" exposure to its own insured, creating incentive to disclose and settle appropriately.
